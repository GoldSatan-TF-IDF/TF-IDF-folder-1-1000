william dietrich ice reich part one chapter one the flying was bad the corpse made it worse the whore named ramona was wrapped in a red hudsons bay company blanket and slung beneath owen harts bush plane like one of those newfangled aerial torpedoes hart could hear her down there as the plane bucked in the rough air the frayed ends of the hemp rope that snugged her in place beating an incessant tattoo against the bottom of his cabin door hed reluctantly agreed to transport the macabre cargo but when it had become apparent at fairbanks field that the body wouldnt fit inside the alreadystuffed cargo area her cousin elmer had persuaded him to tie ramona to the undercarriage struts that way you wont have to smell her the eskimo pointed out hart understood what the old man was trying to do in sending ramona back to her birthplace at anaktuvuk pass but all in all it seemed a bad business in the pilots experience women were generally bad luck and he assumed dead women were doubly so it wasnt just the extra drag that made things difficult but the weight the singleengine stinson was so badly overloaded hed had to delay takeoff until late afternoon for the august air to cool sufficiently to give him the necessary lift it was an old bush trick waiting for thicker air but now the light was slowly fading barrow had radioed of deteriorating weather in the north and the plane rattled tiredly as its propeller clutched at the broad alaskan sky he flew over an earth seemingly untouched by human hand or imagination the boreal forest of pine and birch and boggy muskeg rolled north from fairbanks for two hundred miles before ending at a tall wall of mountains the trees stopped and beyond the brooks range was the vast arctic plain the north slope its tundra a great shaggy carpet already turning orange and scarlet at summers end and beyond that was the frozen northern ocean the ice at this time of year holding offshore and the waves lapping lonely beaches of gray sand there wasnt a damn thing in that awful emptiness that any man could really want except perhaps freedom or the room to hide from past disappointments disappointments he figured the woman strapped beneath his fuselage had had a few weary usedup ramona the whores were called slot machines in the bush had worked the miners trappers and fishermen in nome and fairbanks and ketchikan and juneau old elmer had said her spirit could be free of bad memories if she could come home that seemed reason enough for hart who had no home christ she was ugly hed said to elmer as the eskimo heaved her up against the bottom of the fuselage while hart tied his slipknots how in hell did she ever make a living you shouldnt speak so of the dead grunted elmer who only did this kind of lifting in moose season you should have seen her smile in the old days before her husband took her to the camps and died drunk at cards hard to imagine her young hart said flatly he pulled on the rope there shes tight youre a good man owen for taking her well shes got about as much money as any other passenger ive met in this godforsaken icebox at least ill have company while i fly myself broke elmer misunderstood yes youll have ivan that was the name of his halfblind halfcrippled earchewed husky the dog was as pugugly as ramona and smelled about as bad yet hart was taking the mutt to anaktuvuk anyway probably to die as well the animal was no good on a team anymore shortwave says the weathers getting bad up north hart noted youll have an angel on your shoulder the eskimo assured hart knew that elmer believed in angels as solemnly as he did the return of the salmon or the cycle of winter now in midflight hart found himself wanting to believe in elmers angel as the stinson began to buck and the weather worsened he was usually a safe flier which meant a cautious one and of course that was what cost him his shot at the big time in and sent him like a whipped dog to the north i didnt hire you owen to advise me what i shouldnt do i hired you to find a way i could the millionaire elliott farnsworth had told him as hart had slewed their plane around to race away from the storms of antarctica in retreating the pilot had ruined the explorers first great chance to fly across the southern continent farnsworth had lived to come back three years later and try it again finally making what should have been a fourteenhour crossing in twentytwo days after putting down for periodic storms and hart had been dismissed long before that as the pilot without grit the man who hesitated the exacting overcautious coldweather flier whose heart had chilled at the critical moment farnsworth having spent so much had not hesitated to complain bitterly in the press now here was bad weather again clouds rolling down the barren slopes of the brooks range like a mirror reflection of surf hissing up a steep beach and once again hart had a woman to think about hang on lady he whispered to ramona the stinson hit a pocket and bounced and there was a bark and a yelp at the back shut up ivan he called youre the only damn thing in gods creation uglier than that whore the earlier woman had been named audrey hed found her in california when preparing with farnsworth actually shed found him approaching him on a long beach float both the tethered seaplane and her halo of hair afire from a golden dusk she was a kind of woman hed never known exhibiting the poise that comes with effortless beauty and drawn to the dock not so much by the money as by the sense of limitless adventure that millionaires like farnsworth exuded she glowed from the electric atmosphere of preexpedition camaraderie and fed on its energy funny and fascinated and in the ensuing weeks hed lost his heart and maybe something else because when the critical moment came at the bottom of the world hed finally been afraid not at the risk of losing himself so much as of losing her of never coming back to all she represented the perfume of her the soft caress of her hair her implicit promise that life was not just grim struggle but sweetness as well and in not risking hed lost her ever more completely of course lost her in a rush of shame and hurt pride and devastating regret since then hed come to regard all women with a tight wariness the alaskan light was wan the sun down somewhere behind the mountains and only lingering chinks of silver glimmered through unconsciously adopting a half grin his trademark reaction to worry hart leaned forward and calculated his chances he had the lean build of the rangy montanan he was not so much muscled as wiry a cowboy body shed called it he was handsome in a rugged way dark hair falling toward smokegray eyes and a nose bent just slightly from being cracked on the cockpit rim of a flipped over barnstormer his cheekbones and chin were as hard as the country he was flying through but his grin conveyed reassurance if he wished it a woman would return his look before glancing uncertainly away he didnt want to turn back not with a corpse on board that needed to freeze into the permafrost if he found the mouth of the pass in time he might be able to fly under the weather to ramonas home hed hit the range a bit east of the opening and now skirted the foothills to search storm clouds stacking above him like dark towers the plane lurched in the rising wind and elmers husky let out a low howl it had been this way in when farnsworth tried to become the first man to fly miles across antarctica the expedition was dogged by ill fortune first the northrop monoplane polar star had wrecked its undercarriage when the ice shelf being used as a makeshift runway prematurely broke up only the wings caught by ice floes as the aircraft dropped toward the water prevented the plane from disappearing into the sea completely the millionaire steamed back to the united states to make repairs hart seeing audrey again sinking helplessly into the pool of her green eyes and then returned dangerously late in the season toward the end of the antarctic summer this time weather was the enemy week after week of storm and overcast the millionaires mood turned as foul as the climate and he finally ordered his men to pack for home of course it was then that a bowl of blue sky opened up like the doorway to heaven were going farnsworth roared excitedly the crew heaved supplies on board the plane as hart and his employer crouched over the maps a final time in little more than an hour theyd lifted off sprinting south then three hours into the flight a wall of cloud loomed over the polar plateau and hart swung away dammit man what are you doing farnsworth cried looking up from his chart thats suicide weather elliott the featureless white of the antarctic plateau had dissolved into the rushing fog of an approaching storm you didnt pay me to let you go down in that were going back farnsworth protested that the front looked weak or that they might fly through it or over it or around it that they were turning their back on history hed sputtered and raged and finally just seethed on the long painful retreat home as the weather first chased them and then hung back over the white horizon a taunting ghost back on snow hill island the financier muttered damned yellow within hearing of the crew owen had stalked away in his own bottled anger neither man really knowing if a path could have been found or if a break in the clouds would have proved a sucker hole leading them to whiteout and death and in making his call hart had committed a kind of suicide giving up a sliver of lindberghlike fame for doubt for whispers for airfield secondguessing no one would talk about it directly of course especially not the woman audrey was incapable of knowing what to say because hart didnt know himself and ultimately as if each was marooned on a fissuring shelf of ice they drifted apart so hart finally came to alaska where he didnt have to face anyone not talking about it where the country was as fierce and empty as his heart where the almosts and whatifs and doovers wouldnt haunt him quite as badly maybe where he could wonder all by himself if the arrogant millionaire was secretly right that hed looked out over a frozen wasteland and allowed it to swallow his senses squeeze his heart and then turned away snow he grimaced watching the flakes whip past his windshield alaska was wrapped in gauze the view losing definition and hart knew his chance of finding anaktuvuk pass was blurring with it still as he drifted down closer to the forest the wilderness offered a shred of familiarity the dark blackgreen of the trees the dull pewter of taiga lakes a familiar scale of height and distance in antarctica by contrast there had been a glorious clarity of atmosphere that destroyed depth perception a seemingly airless infinity above sterile whiteness without a hint of life the continent bigger than the united states boasted an emptiness as intimidating as a cell its clouds boiling down from the high polar plateau alien primeval creation before the fire as the stinson skipped from pocket to pocket of air wings flapping as they picked up a rime of ice the engine roared and then groaned only the toes of the brooks range were visible now and theyd turned white he skittered west looking for the john river which rose near anaktuvuk and hoping he wouldnt overshoot and pick up the alana a river that deadended in the mountains he cursed himself for being so anxious to lift away from fairbanks and cursed elmer for saddling him with a decomposing corpse the cockpit windows were frosting so he cursed the stinsons balky heater as well it was hard to believe the warmth of fairbanks had given way to this but that was alaska where was elmers angel ramona youre a hardluck case even when youre dead there a ribbon colored white and leadgray leading into a knot of storm hart banked and began following the river it led to a gap in the foothills and he pressed on five hundred feet above the john the water was unfrozen and low at this time of year its exposed bars had turned white with snow flurries the air had stabilized since hed crossed the edge of the storm but light and visibility continued to fade leaving him in a box of cotton he dipped lower toward the broad gravel channel snaking the plane and sensing more than seeing the squeeze of enclosing hills still no anaktuvuk ivan was whimpering his toenails skittering as he scraped for purchase in the bucking plane dog said hart i think wed better put down hed been foolish not to do so earlier he realized the fog of snow had cost him the ability to judge exactly how close he was to the ground increasing the possibility hed slam into it when he tried to land he needed a dark log to serve as reference point but had left all trees behind he was in a developing whiteout the same effective blindness hed feared in antarctica a sane man would have fled to brazil he chided himself not for the first time if he could drop a reference marker from the plane he could judge his approach to the ground something big something colorful something red ramonas blanket was red he debated it for only a moment crashing would do her no better good shed be chewed up if the undercarriage broke and the plane skidded down on top of her and the snow might cushion her fall she was beyond caring wasnt she the only danger seemed to be the possibility of angry relatives if she was busted up too much right now they seemed less threatening than the unyielding flank of a mountain banking as steeply as he could he turned downriver anxiously watching a snow slope solidify off his wing tip then he continued turning until he was pointing north again satisfied he could maintain that orbit there was a gravel bar below far superior to boggy tundra for a landing he unlatched the plane door and pushed it open against a shriek of wind and cold holding it with his leg leaning out one hand on the stick as he circled he began tugging at the slipknots that held ramona in place ivan kept up a low rumbling moan hart clung to a fistful of blanket at the point where the johns channels joined he let go ramona slumped the wind caught her and she was gone the stinson bounced upward and circled there the red blanket was bright as a cherry against the snow closer than hed imagined nervously he pulled up a few feet then he aimed for her cigarshaped form wanting his undercarriage to touch just past her flaps down power reduced he glided down fighting small gusts the heavily laden plane was sluggish he aimed as if to ram her and then hopped over ramona at the last minute striking the bar beyond the plane bounced once twice set down stumbled over a rock began to slow hed made it then it all went wrong the right wheel banged into a snowhidden hole and shattered a wing tip caught and the plane jerked sideways pivoting out of control the propeller chewed into gravel and disintegrated one piece cracking the windshield the engine screamed coughed died and then it should have been quiet except that ivan was barking excitedly hart blinked hed been thrown onto the control panel cargo had lurched forward to occupy the space where his head had been and he reached up to shove it back the plane was awkwardly tilted he popped open the door on the elevated side pushed clear and dropped to the wet snowdusted ground sweating he sat a minute on the hard gravel and then stood unsteadily and backed off to survey the damage his propeller had become two wooden stumps one wing was crumpled the wheels and struts were gone and if ramona had still been strapped on shed have been crushed his plane was finished and so was he he had no money to repair the damage and after this precious little reputation to get a loan damn damn damn the world was a white blur of gusting snow he assumed he was near anaktuvuk but had no idea how far there was no real danger he thought the storm would soon blow over this time of year hed just have to wait he dug out his parka and some jerky throwing a bit to the dog then he sat in the cockpit jesus well he could still probably find a flying job in the lower running a mail route and going crazy from boredom or he could chuck the whole business and stay up here and fish to hell with it to hell with everything chapter two a low growl from ivan prodded hart from sleep the dog had its nose up it sensed something or maybe smelled it the light was dim and the pilot peered into the thinning snow trying to spot what the husky was so uneasy about then the curtain of flakes shifted and a huge shape ambled along the edge of the bar grizzly the bears cinnamon coat was flecked with snow the muscles of its neck and back rippling along its hump hart groped behind his seat for his sheathed winchester and levered a shell into the rifles chamber the bear took no notice of the click then ivan began barking excitedly and the grizzlys muzzle came up not so much fearful as puzzled slowly it put its nose down and began ambling casually downriver as if to retreat without admitting it hart glanced around the cockpit the airplanes metal skin suddenly seemed not only cold but thin he was relieved the bear had moved on then he remembered ramona of all the luck it would be less than easy to explain to the village of anaktuvuk pass that not only had he used one of its natives as an aerial bomb hed allowed her to be devoured by a wild animal as well death had not robbed her claim for final decency hed have to go get her he climbed out of the plane with the winchester at the ready and began walking back toward ramonas body his skin prickling with unease the grizzlys tracks were huge like dinner plates with claws soon the stinson was invisible in the fog behind him and he began to turn around periodically looking for stalking bear the rush of the river hid all other noise and he couldnt smell or see a thing perhaps his own scent would scare the animal off letting him retrieve the body in peace bear he shouted to encourage the animal to continue on its way the noise seemed inconsequential he saw the grizzly before he saw ramona it was a twitching boulder at the limit of his vision bent over the red blanket and working at the body with a massive paw he waited to see if the animal might lose interest but the grizzly showed no sign of doing so slowly he raised the rifle up its stock cold against his cheek and fired deliberately a few feet to the right of the bears muzzle watching splinters of gravel fly its head jerked up in surprise grunting go away bear hart shouted without much hope he fired again past the animals head the bullet kicking up a splash in the river rather than flee the grizzly snarled and reared up on its hind legs trying to make out this intruder with its dim eyesight the pilot waited to see if the animal would charge or run meanwhile sliding replacement shells into the chamber then the bear attacked hart was nearly certain he saw a ripple in the grizzlys shoulder where the first shot struck home but the animal didnt slow at all roaring it devoured the intervening space between them in a few heartbeats the beast a wall of furred fury that swelled to consume all of the pilots vision he levered and fired levered and fired levered and fired nightmarishly without seeming effect praying that the bucking winchester wouldnt jam there was a click a signal the last shell was gone the bear was close enough to smell and then it abruptly collapsed as if someone had jerked a string and its bones had melted to hot wax the grizzly crashed and slid groaning its angry muzzle exhaling one last cloud of steaming air then it was still hart went to ramona it was difficult to tell which damage had been done by the fall and which by the bear the blanket was filthy and half unwrapped a dangling arm scuffed or bitten kneeling he folded the arm back inside and recovered the body retying the ropes holding the shroud in place then hoisting the deadweight over his shoulder he staggered slowly back to the plane the husky was scratching to get out hart let him to stand guard and then pushed ramona into the cockpit and clambered in beside her hed refused to do this in fairbanks but now the body didnt bother him still comforting lonely men cradling the rifle in his arms and carefully leaning against the opposite door of the plane he dozed this time he didnt dream he woke to a brilliant morning the overcast was breaking up and the sun blazed with enough heat to make the snow sweat he climbed out stiffly drank from the river and chewed on a piece of jerky no bears were to be seen or anything else for that matter the treeless whiteness of the scene made him think of the moon and he tried to guess how far it was to anaktuvuk the natives knew he was due the day before and radios would be crackling back and forth prudence suggested waiting so long as snowmelt didnt push up the john river he watched the old dog trot down the sandbar sniff at the bear and then come quickly back to settle down under the broken wing of the plane in clearing weather hart felt even stupider for having crashed his stinson he should have turned back to fairbanks or bettles ramona or no he joined the dog and dozed again then woke shortly after noon to the sound of an engine a plane it came up valley out of the south the glint of metal growing karl poppers orange and silver bush plane by the look of it it roared low over the sandbar and circled once a passenger peering out the side window and then went on toward anaktuvuk popper would put down at the village and walk in with the eskimos to fetch hart and the cargo the pilot waited clouds drifted in again first white and then gray the sun was shut away the air cooled and rain began to spatter down uneasily he noticed that the river had come up almost a foot with the warming weather the bar had shrunk and the willows on the far shores were starting to be tugged by the rising current if he waited too long it would be too high to ford he wished the eskimos would show up it started raining harder washing away the thin snow hart crouched under the wing considering finally he decided to cross over and start walking up the valley he was getting awfully hungry anyway the rifle went over his shoulder again and the remaining jerky in a pocket then he picked up ramona the feeling of unwanted responsibility was beginning to be replaced by the companionship of shared experience she was now too stiff to drape over his other shoulder and so he had to carry her rigid form in his arms like a log youre gaining weight he said with a grunt after crossing the river hed gone only a few hundred yards when ivan let out a low growl another grizzly hart set ramona down carefully and unshouldered his rifle the brush ahead of him moved he levered a fresh shell into the chamber and aimed are you already so hungry that i look like food to you a voice called out shrouded in furs a figure emerged from the brush and slogged toward him two others followed farther behind hart lowered his rifle i thought you might be a bear ah a white man the eskimo said when they come to hunt nothing is safe i hide in anaktuvuk he put his arms up over his face in mock fear im hauling cargo not hunting hart said sheepishly he told the eskimo his name isaac alatak the eskimo replied and im told by mr popper youve stopped hauling and started hunting judging by what he saw from his airplane is not one bear enough for you hart accepted the inevitable ribbing more than enough the second man caught up to them ive heard of dedicated sportsmen but cracking your plane up to get at a grizzly is a bit much hart it was popper i think you need another hobby or another career thanks for coming to fetch me karl well i was paid for a change he jerked his head toward the third figure that other man hung back a few steps and said nothing preferring to observe the soaked pilot im bringing a body to anaktuvuk hart said ramona umiat she died of tb he pointed to the form lying in the mud at his feet startled he saw part of the blanket had unwrapped again and her arm had once more come free shes had a rough time im afraid the eskimo squatted down and touched the still form then he crossed himself what have you done with my sister white man hart winced at the relationship im sorry i got caught in the storm couldnt make the village the eskimo looked mournfully at the battered body foolish day to fly in white man foolish time for such a sacred responsibility you need to learn caution always the white man is in such a hurry hart opened his mouth then said nothing i dont think mr hart crashed on purpose the third man said hart was surprised from the tone of his voice it was obvious he was not eskimo or american either he had a german accent perhaps he was prudent enough not to fly your sister into a mountainside sprechen sie deutsch hart some from my youth the pilot replied in german i grew up in a german settlement in montana yes ive checked your ancestry the stranger said continuing in german the reply gave hart pause and you are german you come here to climb sometimes krauts came to alaska for the mountains they were nuts for mountains an opportunity the stranger replied id planned to contact you in fairbanks but youd just left despite the weather a decision that seems counter to your reputation reputation antarctica there was silence a moment the weather was fine when i left hart said when you fly you have to make decisions i respect that the stranger said alatak produced a small hatchet and began slashing at the willows ill make a sling for my sister while you practice your german popper bent to help but hart mystified by the stranger made no move he was too numb when it became apparent he wasnt going to speak the german did this time in english my name is otto kohl im a germanamerican trade representative ive come halfway around the world to speak with you when anaktuvuk radioed that your plane was missing i feared id wasted my time on a dead man mr popper though convinced me to hire his plane and have a look for you lucky for you that i did i wouldve been all right perhaps kohl looked away down valley could you show me your plane id like to make a complete report hart was taken aback a report you from the government not exactly is your plane near here hart looked at alatak go on the eskimo grumbled knowing it wasnt far well finish here wordlessly hart led the way back through the brush to the bank the river was rising swiftly and the bar was almost gone a channel had opened under the fuselage and the crippled stinson was rocking in the flow as they watched it slid a few feet downstream im going to lose my whole damn cargo yes kohl observed fortune is curious isnt it the pilot turned to study his companion more closely he looked near fifty with a trim mustache pale soft skin and an irritating selfassurance for such wild surroundings well it wasnt his plane that had been lost they stood there a moment in silence rain drumming on their heads who the hell are you kohl smiled im based in washington but represent the german government he pointed to the plane beginning to tilt i could report to the reich that you incautiously flew into bad weather and landed poorly exhibiting neither courage nor wisdom he waited for hart to react but the pilot said nothing or i could report you have a knack for survival in polar weather conditions even saving a passenger from a grizzly bear albeit a dead passenger why should i care what you report let me be blunt the german replied your misfortune may prove to be our opportunity because it may predispose you to accept what im about to offer youre well aware that my government is controversial you may be aware it has limited experience in antarctic exploration germany has yet to make any lengthy presence there unlike the british or norwegians or you americans with admiral byrd youre certainly aware that under national socialism my country is moving quickly to claim her rightful place as an equal in the rank of nations you on the other hand are in financial difficulty i suspect youve just lost your primary possession you lost some of your reputation as a flier in and this incident will hardly restore it yet im here to offer you another chance to be part of history hart stood watching his plane as if drawn by a giant unseen hand it sank toward the center of the channel why me simple youre an expert at antarctic flying youre what we need i was fired in the antarctic my boss said i chickened and did you there was a silence ive done some checking said kohl you were fired for caution we germans can be determined even headstrong but we know prudence is a virtue as well in any event you know about antarctic oils fuels clothing and navigation wait a minute hart said still absorbing what the german was saying i fly my plane into the ground and you still want to hire me kohl shrugged you strike me as a man who accepts the options he has and chooses well and frankly for us your situation is ideal we want to make clear to the world that our mission is one of peaceful exploration as an american a foreigner your presence will reinforce that the german eyed him intently in your present situation may i assume politics are a nonissue i dont follow politics hart tried to think he hadnt made up his mind about the nazis hitler was a dictator certainly but hed put germany to work lindbergh had visited and come away impressed but hart knew why kohl had come all the way to alaska not everyone wanted to work for the reich not everyone had forgotten the great war ill think about it certainly think all you want as we hike back to anaktuvuk think tonight as you eat and then sleep think and ask me any question you care to and then you must decide because mr popper and i are returning to fairbanks in the morning we have room for an employee kohl smiled but there was little warmth in it they went back to where the eskimo had slung ramona between willow branches the german and hart took one end popper and the eskimo the other the dog led off as always the tundra was miserable walking spongy and ankletwisting but the trudge was warming this expedition will it be reported hart asked kohl in german reported in the newspapers if it succeeds will the world know about it the men who make it will be as famous as they wish the german replied as successful as they dare they reached anaktuvuk after midnight the tethered huskies of the village barking excitedly at ivans approach despite the late hour half the village came out to meet them taking ramonas battered body away for cleaning and wrapping and final rest her condition caused some looks at the pilot but no one spoke word of the bear had spread hart took popper aside this guy is offering me a job in germany he said what do you think of him popper shrugged and spat he paid me in cash later at the mission house the two bush pilots ate some soup and bread and warmed themselves in front of the stove hart thought about what kohl had said the germans arrival seemed so well timed he wondered if elmers angel was real after all sorry about your plane hart popper said its simpler in antarctica hart said drowsily he was trying to resummon that world what do you mean no one lives there no one stays there it has no memory no memory bah every place has history no hart said here theres history because people are here to remember but not there it has no past only a great yawning now sounds too simple to me owen smiled maybe youre right he sighed but when everything is now you can always start over chapter three berlin was a brown city set ablaze with the red of nazi banners their fabric caressing hard stone to hart arriving in the fall of it seemed a richly conservative metropolis crackling with the excitement of the dangerously new a resurgently smug place with a sense of watchful unease a place on stage a grand opera that was dramatically unfolding boots and high heels black uniforms and silver furs welcome to the future otto kohl greeted him the two had parted company at fairbanks kohl had gone ahead to washington and germany while hart remained in alaska to check out of his rooming house store his meager belongings and wrap up his simple affairs being single and bankrupt gave life a certain simplicity he reflected and now he felt infused with new purpose antarctica hed thought he would never go near the place again yet suddenly it promised both adventure and redemption and with a bunch of krauts no less hed felt a curious german mix of arrogance and apprehension even on arrival in hamburg thered been a sense of entering something captive being hurtled toward a great unknown the energy of germany was palpable there was the drumbeat of reawakening industry made visible by the shroud of steam and greasy smoke above the port citys factories there was the officious pompous bustle of uniformed bureaucrats stamping this peering at that smelling of sausage and beer there was the shriek of ferry and steamer whistles the clang of trolleys and the excitement of crowds admiring an example of the beetleshaped peoples car that hitler had invented yet the germans were quieter than hed imagined not diffident even a bit boastful about their astonishing transformation since the nazis came to power but cautiously restrained all the same as if there was an unspoken lid on laughter and enthusiasms there simply were a lot of uniforms adding to the surreal quality were the many berlin shop fronts still boarded up from the antijewish terror of crystal night less than two weeks before hart had heard reports that some jews were fleeing the country and rumors that others were simply disappearing into a vast new nazi prison system the pilot knew no jews at least he didnt know of knowing any but the stories were unsettling as hopeless as his situation had seemed in alaska he couldnt help wondering if accepting employment from these people was wise he decided that he admired their resurgence but questioned their judgment his task was to separate the application of polar expertise from politics to remain focused on exploration and science the germans lived up to their reputation for efficiency kohl was brisk at the berlin train station snapping orders to a porter to collect the pilots bag leading him at a neartrot to the taxi stand issuing crisp instructions about the hotel and giving him a clip of new reichsmarks for meals and expenses a courier would arrive at the hotel the next morning at nine oclock with suitable clothes kohl explained hart would then be free until four when the german would pick him up to meet reich minister hermann goring they would journey to gorings estate of karinhall at the outskirts of berlin and dine that evening with the officers of the antarctic expedition preparatory to sailing late in the year for the southern continent the expedition was timed to take advantage of antarcticas brief summer of good weather the opposite of seasons in the northern hemisphere it was very much gorings expedition kohl explained and the powerful minister was giving it his personal attention he had a curiosity about the world hart was welcome to tour berlin but was not to take notes or pictures speak to anyone more than necessary or discuss the expedition circumspection is a key to our success kohl had said pushing hart into a taxi the pilot found himself at the swank adlon hotel on unter den linden not far from the foreign and propaganda ministries an interior ministry courier arrived promptly the next morning as promised greeting hart at his hotel room door with a stiffarmed salute and a heil hitler hart looked at him with bemusement for gods sake put your arm down the messenger looked miffed as if a compliment had been batted away unacknowledged he delivered a written invitation to the reich ministers karinhall and a box with a suit shirt and tie a handwritten note from kohl told hart to be wearing them at four to kill time the pilot wandered outside the traffic and bustle of a huge city intimidated him so he crossed to the tiergarten park barren and empty in november he walked briskly enjoying the empty cold then he returned to his room gave himself a full hour to struggle into the new suit descended to the lobby fifteen minutes early and waited uncomfortably he felt the concierge sneaking glances at him as if driven by a clock a black mercedes limousine arrived outside the hotel doors promptly at four and the chauffeur opened the rear door with a click of booted heels the rearmost seat was filled but the facing one was empty so hart climbed in to find himself sitting backward knee to knee with kohl and a beautiful young blonde in an evening dress and fur wrap the door clicked shut and the car purred forward this is leni stauffenberg the film actress said kohl who looked as assured in his business suit as hart felt uncomfortable the woman flashed a stunning but distant smile sufficient to serve notice that there was an insurmountable wall between them she had no interest in mere pilots the reich minister enjoys the company of lovely women from the film industry kohl explained after being widowed he married the actress emmy sonnemann you may know it was the most stunning ceremony of the new regime i preferred the opera ball leni said i was told he spent a million marks on that one miss stauffenberg later caught his eye in perhaps her finest work conquest of the crest remarkable climbing picture have you heard of it we dont get german movies in alaska of course kohl smiled thinly i almost froze making that picture leni said that bastard reinhardt insisted on shooting everything outdoors i got caught in an avalanche i nearly died hart studied her he couldnt imagine this woman on a mountain let alone in an avalanche he wondered what her intention was in attending this dinner she gave no sign of being attached to kohl and goring while famous was not only married he was fat maybe the reich minister had something to do with the german movie business noting his curious scrutiny of the actress kohl felt compelled to issue a caution i should mention its best not to be too inquisitive about the reich ministers social life when were at karinhall the presence of his female guests is decorative you understand suppose nothing else leni poked her companion im not a decoration the actress objected hermann is simply a wonderful man she said smugly to hart funny enthusiastic a child really you must let him show you his trains the pilot looked quizzical at this model railroad kohl said the biggest ive ever seen but hes no child he was an ace in the great war well hermann makes me laugh leni he shot down more than twenty men she laughed herself as i said boyish charm have you looked at the pictures at karinhall he was really quite handsome back then still is in a way well the reich minister is a great man kohl grumped somehow annoyed by this lighthearted affection he clearly deemed inappropriate second only to hitler he runs not only the luftwaffe but the prussian interior ministry the forestry commission and the hunt hes president of the reichstag and founded the gestapo a truly superhuman energy they say he draws six salaries leni winked kohl chose to ignore this gossip its too bad about the wound he suffered at the munich putsch the reliance on pain relievers hart dont let the burdens that the reich minister shoulders deflect your honor to him your presence on this voyage as a foreigner is important to its image but sensitive ive been working hard to assure the authorities youll not be a problem goring is key you must be certain to satisfy him keep your curiosity within limits be ready to do as instructed restrain your american casualness oh otto leni scolded with a grin i think mr hart will muster the proper respect hart had only seen goring in newsreels and thought the man looked clownish but he kept that opinion to himself ill do my best he told kohl determined to be polite but not a toady he was irritated that the german was treating him like a rube in front of the woman hell have to take me as i am leni nodded good for you thats the kind of attitude hermann enjoys the car raced through the suburbs the trim german homes getting larger and farther apart as they journeyed into the forest surrounding the city it seemed to hart that all of germany was like a model railroad too tidy to be a place people really lived in litter was absent cars were washed and the forest itself seemed groomed its floor picked clean of branches and leaf litter he had a sense of having entered onto a stage set and the company of a movie star reinforced the notion she drew kohl into gossiping about nazis whom hart had never heard of he half listened watching the scenery it took nearly an hour to reach the gates of gorings estate an unmarked road departed from the main highway and the car turned down the oakshaded lane then it slowed to weave around concrete pylons and approach a guard station a whitepainted pole blocked the road and grayuniformed soldiers with strapped submachine guns dangling from their necks sauntered out as the limousine came to a halt they barely glanced at the driver clearly recognizing him but they peered inside intently first to kohl then hart and then with appreciation to miss stauffenberg papers please a handsome lieutenant barked keeping his eyes on the actress she ignored him the guards studied their passes as if this was the first time theyd seen writing then with elaborate slowness they handed them back american the lieutenant remarked the wings on his uniform showed him to be a member of the luftwaffe the german air arm that goring had reportedly made into the most powerful in the world new york perhaps alaska hart replied ah yes clearly the place didnt register soon well have planes that reach new york perhaps ill see it one day from the air his smile was cold mr hart is an employee of the german government kohl snapped with unmistakable authority the lieutenant stiffened of course you are free to proceed heil hitler he snapped his salute heil hitler kohl grunted dismissing the sentry the pole was raised and the limousine jumped forward gorings estate was a vast park of forest lake and meadow the car following a winding drive to a final vast lawn its crown was karinhall a feudal halftimbered chateau modeled on a rural retreat of gorings former inlaws in sweden an edifice of leaded glass and soaring towers and steep slategray roofs it reminded hart of a gingerbread fantasy wheres hansel and gretel he murmured both impressed and uneasy at this proximity to power kohl gave him a warning glance leni smiled slightly the light was quickly fading from the brief november day and the mansions windows glowed a welcoming yellow two more guards these in black uniforms flanked a massive oaken door a german shepherd stood alertly as the limo pulled up but did not growl or bark an orderly trotted officiously down the stone stairs to meet them moving to lenis door first she took his arm stood expertly in her heels in the pea gravel and then ascended the steps as if floating the silk of her dress lightly kissing stone how does she do that hart wondered following the massive entryway seemed to open of its own accord and then they were in a large flagstone foyer hung with medieval tapestries two suits of black armor stood guard there were no swastikas or nazi regalia in sight welcome to karinhall the orderly said mr kohl he gave a nod of acknowledgment so good to have you with us again miss stauffenberg a smile this time then more appraising and yes mr hart the reich minister is of course especially fond of pilots youre actually the second american pilot to visit you know of mr lindbergh i know of him hart replied dryly was there anyone in the flying profession who didnt a great man the orderly enthused a great man servants materialized to take their coats and then they moved to the great hall a soaring timbered cathedral of a room its walls were studded with game heads a fire roared in a vast fireplace and a table as long as a bowling alley occupied its center the feeling of a stage set was sustained as if karinhall was designed not just as a home but as a kind of artificial realm trying to couple germanic charm with overbearing power for hart the power was there but the charm was not clearly herr gorings politics have paid off he noted mildly his head rotating back to eye the timbered ceiling the reich minister stood by the fuhrer in the dark days after the putsch kohl said he went broke trying to represent the party while hitler was in prison hes exhibited the economic vision to remake germany vision enough to reach all the way to the bottom of the world a great man hart said trying to estimate the length of the table fifty feet it was bizarre to find himself here after anaktuvuk pass suddenly unannounced a figure strode through the doorway not just a man but a presence goring was big for one thing almost decadently fat and his girth was clothed in a snowwhite uniform with gold epaulets at the shoulders and buttons and braid accenting them below the belt was black and its buckle silver a nazi eagle at rigid attention in gold relief the clothes were ornate but to hart he looked faintly ridiculous like a new york doorman it was certainly disconcerting that instead of jackboots the reich minister wore slippers lined with fur his complexion was healthy but too pink at the cheeks as if he used rouge and the fat of his jowls softened the military bearing yet gorings air of authority remained unmistakable there was a sense of arrogant proprietorship the habit of command gentlemen leni goring reached out with fingers that were short and fat and studded with rings kohl shook and then hart followed surprised by a pumping grip both energetic and soft there was a slight sense of decay in the touch and yet gorings eyes were ironhard black and judging quite disconcerting really the entire effect was strange and despite his determination not to seem obsequious hart felt off balance so this is our american expert on antarctica a fellow flier i must tell you hart the only pure place is in the air yes reich minister hart managed i share your enthusiasm the air and perhaps antarctica ah really goring looked genuinely interested and what is so pure about the southern continent well hart thought for a moment the ice of course is as white as your uniform no not just white but prismatic the colors are unworldly and the air is clearer there you can see to infinity ah infinity goring laughed appreciatively i think i saw that a few times from my biplane in the war looking over my shoulder into the barrel of an enemy machine gun im not sure id like to see so much infinity again hart found himself joining the others in complimentary laughter a solar system in orbit around its fat white sun but then the kind of purity you talk of hart the sublime cleanliness of a place never before trod by man that that must be remarkable it can be inspiring or frightening hart said without thinking instantly feeling hed betrayed himself so i understand suddenly gorings softness seemed to stiffen and his eyes bored into the pilots as if taking harts measure owen forced himself to stare calmly back my pilots the men i recruit are not easily frightened no theyre not herr goring you germans were dogged enough to search me out in alaska and paid to bring me here he thought if you dont want me now then to hell with you the german held his gaze for a moment more and then abruptly smiled the appraisal was done good you know hart thats the name of the stag a name that originally comes from the german word for hornand so i approve of your ancestry as well just like lindbergh we germans are all pioneers of the air now come come into my library you must meet your fellow adventurers chapter four the library was the size of a small hangar its goldlettered books ranked as neatly as soldiers most looked new and completely unread this was a room to impress not to work in a fire burned here as well clustered around a side table were four men and a woman sipping wine their evident leader the captain hart guessed wore his prussian aura of command on weathered features his steelgray hair closecropped and his goatee trimmed with precision next to him was a tall blond nordic man of about harts age who looked like hed stepped from a nazi recruiting poster and a shorter more officiouslooking fellow with a mustache and gold wirerimmed glasses the oldest at least in appearance was a balding somewhat cadaverous male with thin lips yellowed teeth and long tobaccostained fingers he was smoking a cigarette the woman hart studied for a moment longer she was about leni stauffenbergs age but did not pretend to the actresss ostentatious beauty her dark red hair was cut just below her shoulders flipped slightly inward in a simple style and she wore a modestly cut print dress and low heels she appeared to wear no makeup and seemed to have no need of it her skin was clear and her blue eyes bright and intelligent captain heiden goring greeted the prussian let me present to you one of our countrys representatives in america otto kohl our american consultant owen hart and of course our own beautiful leni stauffenberg even more stunning and here the reich minister grinned like a playboy in the flesh than on the screen who would have thought it possible heiden bowed with prussian formality and took the actresss gloved hand kissing it lightly then he turned and gave a shorter bow to hart so good of you to agree to accompany us mr hart he said im konrad heiden captain of the schwabenland the seaplane tender that will take us to antarctica your experience in polar flying should prove invaluable let me introduce our political liaison jurgen drexlerthe handsome blond gave a nod our chief geographer alfred federhere the shorter man bobbed his head a bit shyly ships doctor maximilian schmidtthe smoker smiled remotely behind a cloud of exhaled smoke and greta heinz our polar biologist the woman smiled and looked at hart with interest keeping one hand on the stem of her wineglass and the other at her wrist as if the goblet needed special support she glanced quickly at leni and then away shy of the movie stars polish and seemed to avoid even incidental eye contact with kohl almost imperceptibly drexler sidled an inch closer as if to suggest a relationship she gave no sign she noticed she was attractive hart decided not so much glamorous as interesting glad to meet you hart said it should be an intriguing adventure captain heiden has had experience in the arctic but this will be germanys first great thrust toward the south pole goring said weve had explorers there before erich von drygalski even rose in a balloon just after the turn of the century becoming the first antarctic aeronaut but the effort wasnt sustained this time were being systematic about it were staking our claim and planning to do antarctic research the expedition will have geopolitical implications as well goring turned toward the others and mr hart has been assuring me about the beauty of the place how i wish i could accompany you to escape the cares of my office but hermann germany would miss you so much leni exclaimed as if she thought goring was really going to slip away to sea she leaned toward him and grasped his arm and i would miss germany the reich minister said beaming the others smiled at this banter so hart i assume you didnt fly in the war drexler said clearly sizing him up the german was slim athletic and even in repose seemed to have the grace of a cat i dont look that old i hope hart replied ah goring cried the unintended insults of arrogant youth the group laughed i did some flying on the barnstormer circuit hart said then flew in competition and in the rockies learning cold weather skills hired on with elliott farnsworth and was fired when i wouldnt fly him into bad weather sometimes heroism must be put in abeyance drexler observed unsure of what to make of that remark the pilot turned to the geographer alfred do you know exactly where on the continent were going i do the man said with a certain selfsatisfaction and the rest of you shall know when we get there there was an awkward pause and then goring laughed explosively drawing the others in ha he crowed the white part hart youre going to the cold part he laughed some more patting feder on the back i do like a man who can keep a secret hart smiled mystified by any secrecy schmidt spoke up the truth is owen like all explorers we dont know exactly where were going weve selected an area of interest with an eye to competing national claims and are looking for a possible permanent site for research but this is of course an investigation of a new world he took a puff you and your fellow pilots will be our eyes from the air hart nodded well ive got good eyesight dr schmidt he remembered youve been to sea before no ive volunteered for this opportunity because it will allow me to explore my medical interest the body in environmental extremes you mean cold cold and simplicity no group of people has ever really inhabited antarctica and few plants and animals exist there what remains i hope is medical truth shorn of the complexities and prejudices of our warmer world to understand polar perils is to take a step toward conquering them yes or avoiding them as we prudent pilots might advise the others laughed and the pilot encouraged by this good humor turned to the woman and greta youre a biologist looking at polar bears perhaps she looked amused if youve truly been to antarctica you know as well as i do that there are no bears there penguins of course and seals but im primarily interested in krill the pilot nodded politely those little shrimp things we saw clouds of them in the ocean back in whale food hart whale food goring boomed the key to scientific management of antarctic whaling one of many keys to germanys bright future then this mission may indeed have significance for our whaling industry reich minister kohl inquired with the tone of one who already knew the answer what whaling industry otto goring growled the damned norwegians have a nearmonopoly down there theyve laid a territorial claim and tried to chase others out well two can play that game this expedition will lay its own claim and with it the justification for expansion of the german whaling effort whale fat and oils are vital to sustaining our expanding economy and the greatest whales in the world are to be found in that region so hart said turning back to greta youll be taking a census of this whale food he was intrigued by her hed never heard of a woman going to antarctica that and more she replied im interested in the relationship between the world of the great the whale for example and the small the latter is my field of expertise plankton protozoa bacteria viruses germs hart said with a grin yes germs you might not think so but they reside in antarctica too theyre capable of adapting to every condition including cold it is this adaptability of life that interests me drexler piped up greta is a woman who can look in a microscope and see a universe were lucky to have her greta smiled to acknowledge the compliment a bit obvious hart thought he wondered what their relationship was hermann leni said mr hart expressed interest in your trains really goring said his mood clearly jovial are you a railroad enthusiast as well as an aeronaut uhm well i like trains he glanced at kohl who nodded approvingly drexler looked at hart with amusement ha i tell my staff its an organizational exercise goring said smiling designing the tracks scheduling the trains not so different from running a nation but secretly hart im convinced we men remain boys relishing our toys we leave it to women to be the grownups in the house while we play in the outside world its one of the reasons im so happy that im a man if you can forgive that miss heinz again the group joined in his laughter and why im happy to be a woman goring bowed puffing a bit the reich minister led his entourage up a winding balustrade toward the attic as they began to ascend hart found himself just behind and to the right of greta still curious about her he tried to think of something to say but drexler smoothly moved in front of him and slipped beside her forcing the pilot to pause a moment on the stairs to avoid a collision the tips of the germans fingers brushed her elbow as if to guide her and he whispered a comment she raised her wineglass to her lips as they climbed moving her arm slightly out of reach but she also granted him a look and smile hart fell back the party went through an arched wooden door and filed into a dim cavernous room when all were present goring flicked on the lights under the eves sprawled an enormous track set with model trains lined up on sidings the set was the biggest hart had ever seen scalemodel miles of track and a score of locomotives curiously scenery was absent as if irrelevant to gorings vision the layout did indeed resemble some kind of enormous organizational chart in its abstract complexity hart was struck by its sterility there were no miniature people in it oh hermann let me operate one of the trains leni begged goring chuckled at her interest and mr hart you must direct another the reich minister said he showed them the controls with a few jerks as he adjusted the speed hart managed to begin moving his train out of its station the actress succeeded too the trains traveled around a vast oval occasionally passing each other on different tracks it took some concentration to hold their speed at curves and pause at crossings to avoid a possible collision the others watched politely chatting among themselves your skill as a pilot serves you well as an engineer said a soft voice at harts elbow he glanced sideways it was greta he nodded smiling tightly i was warned i might be tested but no one talked about model trains he nodded toward the actress at the other end of the control box herr goring does have an enthusiasm for toys it seems greta shrugged shes just for show did you know that the reich minister took a bullet at the putsch causes him a great deal of pain apparently in many ways it was in the groin direct your jokes and sympathies accordingly she smiled mischievously suddenly gorings voice boomed now hart you must observe airpower in action your direction is impressive but what if youre caught in an extremity how does one keep the system functioning he paused dramatically then pushed a button there was a rattle and something swooped down from the shadowy eves above hart thought for a moment it was a swallow then he saw it was a model of a german stuka divebomber gliding down across the train as it dangled from a sloping wire goring stabbed another button and a pellet fell from its belly arcing in with expert aim to bounce off one of harts boxcars a direct hit goring exclaimed in combat your train would be cut in two he laughed the next war will be decided in the air there was another rattle and a second model airplane flew jerkily down and released again this time striking lenis train oh pooh hermann she exclaimed youre such a bully gorings eyes were already on harts train again as it rounded a curve a third airplane rode its wire down from the gloom aimed for harts engine the pilot considered a moment then tightened his hold on the electric throttle when the pellet fell he slammed his train to a halt the bomb bounced harmlessly across the track ahead flying by wire is too predictable hart said goring smiled but a bit less broadly very true a quick reaction mr hart unpredictability is the first lesson of war he emphasized this last as if hed sought to make that point to the others but i would still have cut the track no matter the pilot threw his train into reverse as a man of prudence id be backing out of that war zone as fast as possible the group laughed greta clapping her hands once in applause and yet there might be an even better strategy it was jurgen drexler catching the womans eye if you would allow me to take a turn at the controls owen certainly the american surrendered the throttle and backed away the trains began moving around the oval again greta was watching the german with interest and hart searched for something to continue their conversation i understand the reich minister is the most popular of germanys leaders he finally tried she kept her gaze on the railroad speaking quietly so as not to be overheard hes a brave man i think but hes had much trauma in his life years of exile and poverty a virtual political outlaw the loss of his first wife the wound it explains perhaps the morphine the weight the clothes he certainly likes to dress up greta lowered her voice even further we germans joke about it the story goes that gorings forestry ministry was going to harvest the tiergarten to build him an adequatesized wardrobe but the chief forester had to report back that the trees were gone already theyd all been sawed into his coat hangers we dont laugh at him we laugh with him because we can identify with his appetites or at least we try not to judge yet he judges us hart saw gorings hand stray toward the button that would release his model warplanes we serve at his pleasure its different here in germany owen were a society with a purpose but to have such purpose you cant rely on the mob it must be directed by a few great men i dont think the american voter thinks of himself as a mob she shrugged still someone must be in charge just then there was a familiar rattle and a stuka swooped down its rigid wheels like the talons of a raptor hearing the noise drexler calmly reached across the control panel and threw a switch ive watched you at the controls reich minister he explained his train shunted onto a new line just as goring released his bomb the pellet landed squarely on the newly emptied track and drexlers train rumbled calmly past the impact point ach touche jurgen goring exclaimed im outwitted the political liaisons train accelerated and on you go to your destination he laughed with the reich ministers good humor the others laughed too drexler nodded in acknowledgment and stole a glance at greta she replied with an encouraging smile owen found himself irked by the demonstration do you consider yourself a man of strong opinions owen she whispered still watching drexler he looked at her curiously wondering if hed become a toy in some game he didnt understand i am adaptable i guess she nodded knowingly thats obvious meaning meaning youre here in germany with us no said hart shaking his head you dont understand im not with you not against you im simply on my way to antarctica where politics dont apply ah wait until you get on the schwabenland a confined society a long voyage humans wear politics as tightly as their skin she was teasing him is that why jurgen is necessary she shrugged watching the blond german as he stole a glance at them again jurgen reminds us why were here he sees things clearly drexler brought his train into the station i was admittedly fortunate that your attack coincided with the availability of a siding he told the reich minister but there is a lesson here no a lesson for us in antarctica perhaps if one way doesnt serve another may suffice indeed your twist has demonstrated the endless complications of war goring agreed which is why battle is not as simple as it appears in the history books well my luftwaffe is out of bombs perhaps we should adjourn for dinner there was no disagreement greta moved off to congratulate drexler over her head he nodded at hart the group filed down the stairs to a baronial dining room with timbered ceiling and glittering candles more suits of armor posted in the shadows like hovering waiters two more lovely women one a model another an aspiring starlet hart gathered joined the group goring took his place at the head of the table with the two actresses at either side and the model at the foot facing him there otherwise didnt seem to be assigned seating greta moved toward a chair and drexler quickly moved forward to touch the back of an adjacent one as if asserting the spoils of victory but at the last moment she unbalanced things by slipping sideways around feder alfred id like to map out a sampling calendar based on your expected arrival and departure dates she murmured and swiftly plopped down between the geographer and hart giving the american pilot a quick smile owen sensed someone else looking at him it was kohl across the table frowning and giving a barely perceptible shake of his head and owen greta said turning away from feder id like to learn more from you about america well hart said surprised by her continuing attention america is a bit what i suspect you to be energetic and adventuresome ah and unsettled youre describing yourself perhaps hmm well the frontier has closed but the nation is uncompleted america is an experiment still playing itself out then perhaps that is me she said smiling course followed course goring commenting on the food like a gourmand as he explained its origins or spicing or preparation given his girth and enthusiasms it seemed almost appropriate when he finally turned the conversation back to whales the most astonishing creatures the reich minister said i believe the creator placed them here as much for the nourishment of the soul as for the nourishment of industry of course it is the latter that preoccupies me at the moment to a strong nation the whale is as important as steel important for what hart dared genuinely curious while he knew whaling continued in the world hed always thought it belonged more to a bygone era of sailing ships and moby dick fat of course the reich minister said winking and patting his own stomach in selfdeprecation the others laughed again for margarine and oil not for lighting anymore no were no longer harpooning to read by for munitions hart whale fat is a valuable ingredient of glycerin and sperm oil is preferred for precision machinery such as fighter plane engines the whale is vital for waging modern war so this expedition isnt just for scientific purposes hart asked science and national destiny are inextricably linked in the modern world answered heiden making a rare contribution to the conversation well said captain exclaimed goring knowledge is power knowledge is also progress added greta after all what ultimately sets us apart from the whales is what we know but this is a peaceful expedition persisted hart despite a frown of disapproval from kohl goring grew serious life is competition hart he said i dont draw the distinction between peace and war that the naive do i think owens real question is whether the schwabenland is a warship said kohl trying to steer the conversation to safer ground no of course not do you think wed enlist an american in our navy your mere presence underlines germanys peaceful intentions no no no we sail for knowledge but knowledge with purpose to explore antarctica and to establish our rights we stake our claim in peace heiden said exactly the reich minister said and if the norwegians get in our way our spirits are prepared for war chapter five the schwabenland looked like an unpacked steamer trunk its holds popped open and antarctic supplies strewn on the hamburg docks crates canvas bags tanks tubes and coils of rope and wire were heaped as if in anticipation of christmas wooden skis were bundled like firewood tents came wrapped in their own ropes and pegs and cargo sleds machined in bavaria were precisely lined on the creosote dock timbers as if on military parade pallets of canned food shone dully under the gray german sky freshly filled and without rust there were ice axes crampons fur parkas boots nets carboys buoys snow shovels backpacks camp stoves a case of scotch whiskey and a box of spanish oranges be prepared hart quoted to himself perched on the vessels stern were two twinengined dornier wal seaplanes mounted to catapults that stretched for one hundred and forty feet along its deck so these are the birds the pilot whispered to himself the flying boats were big sixty feet long with a ninetyfoot wingspan struts held the wing and engine housing above a narrow boatlike fuselage that nested on enormous floats on the tail was a swastika the wals looked a bit ungainly but hart knew they were famous for dependability and endurance the schwabenland itself was a seaplane tender of workmanlike appearance the point of its bow descending vertically into the water and its rounded stern overhanging a huge rudder two cargo masts were busily employed swinging cargo aboard there was a low bridge superstructure a middeck with a single towering smokestack and lifeboats and then a long stern deck dominated by the catapults the ship looked twice the length of the tender farnsworth had taken to the antarctic the germans seemed to be sparing no expense hart was met on the pier by a short and wiry masters mate with curly hair and wry manner you the yankee he asked not waiting for an answer yes of course i could see it a quarter mile away the walk the manner americans god knows what possessed you to show up here i was hired hart said the universal excuse well my name is fritz eckermanns the surname but its just fritz to you right because youre going to be owen to me im afraid no herr this and herr that ach dont bother shaking hands with yours so full you can kiss me later here ill take that seabag god in heaven are you hoarding lead no im just kidding ive got it but christ youve packed enough for the afterlife ah its books i suspect youre a secret intellectual some are dirty i hope no well its a long voyage pilot you can borrow mine this way will you look at this mess damnation who ordered all this stuff not the people who have to put it away you can bet on that albert move that massive ass of yours were coming aboard and hart was led up the gangway and through a hatchway to the initially bewildering warren of companion and passageways typical of any ship the manifest assigned him a tiny stateroom to himself im impressed said fritz giving an exaggerated groan as he dumped harts seabag on the floor your own bunk and porthole one more poohbah right well no bowing and scraping from fritz eckermann im afraid when the revolution comes well all be equal he winked come on then you can sort your socks later captain heiden wants to meet with you he turned and led the way toward the bridge the expedition leader sat in a high leather swivel chair from which he could survey the citys harbor meeting a steady stream of officers and sailors who had questions about the voyage heiden usually answered with a curt sentence or two but with owen he took a bit longer welcome aboard the schwabenland hart not quite as luxurious as karinhall but i think youll find her a good ship a range of twentyfour thousand miles and a host of recent improvements fritz here will show you about but i must warn you dont take his prattling too seriously hart smiled its bigger than i expected its no battleship but weve made some modifications theres a meterwide belt of reinforcing steel around the hull to fend off ice the bronze prop has been replaced by a stronger steel one weve added nine cabins you have one of the new ones and to make sure we dont suffer the fate of the titanic weve added thousands of welded steel casks in the lowest hold for emergency flotation in case were breached were trying to think of everything but im sure your experience will be most useful so dont hesitate to suggest improvements if there is a question or decision im the ultimate authority understand hart nodded then jurgens role is advisory he asked taking the opportunity to satisfy his curiosity about the political liaison the captain frowned drexler represents the reich minister he said obliquely the state he is in the allgemeine division but this ship is mine now you must meet our pilots fritz will introduce you please inspect the airplanes and equipment and youll dine in the officers mess as will the people you met at karinhall there will be a rotating watch once were at sea if there is a problem see me this is satisfactory yes and with that fritz ushered him away this is satisfactory the seaman mimicked as they descended from the bridge as if we have an alternative you have no ticket back to america yet yes and no pay yet am i right thats what i thought ha welcome to germany mr pilot you may have signed on for more than you wished of course i never said that heil hitler blah blah blah wheres your germanic respect for authority fritz hart asked i lost it when i watched workingmen tremble before bosses who couldnt find the crack of their ass with both hands he said nazi big shots ive seen more pompous fools and selfimportant blunderers the last few years than a toilet swabber in a berlin ministry though to tell you the truth pilot this heiden seems all right just dont you strike any airs with me in actuality things were satisfactory hart found himself useful soon after his arrival in hamburg the voyage gave him purpose hed gone from selfimposed exile to foreign expert he specified the airplane fueloil ratio lufthansa was supplying for antarctic cold and began prowling the cargo and comparing it to his experience on snow hill island he suggested substitution of wooden for metal runners on the sleds to make them less brittle and seemingly primitive leather lashings in exchange for machined screws for the same purpose dehydration is a surprisingly severe problem in dry polar air and so he made sure there were sufficient canteens he proposed canvas hoods that could be slung over the airplane engine casings until their oil pans could be warmed by portable kerosene heaters and he inspected with misgiving the troublesome bubble sextants used to help estimate position in a highlatitude region where compasses became unreliable these will be hampered by the cold he warned the german pilots reinhard kauffman and seigfried lambert the bubbles will distort youll have to use them in conjunction with compass and dead reckoning and above all keep an eye on the weather so you can use landmarks its easy to get lost down there the men nodded their initial wariness at meeting the american had given way to the international fraternity of fliers tell heiden as well kauffman requested your own caution will make him understand ours quickly bonding into a team were fritz the irreverent german and hart the amused outsider from america the pilot was a safe and reliable audience for fritzs observations on germany and fritz exhibited a wry candor the other germans didnt share hitler is a wanttobe the little sailor psychoanalyzed blandly while sucking on a cigarette under soggy hamburg skies the little austrian who wants to outgerman germany hes seized on our worst traits owen everywhere there are rules now do this do that papers please stamp stamp stamp his father was a customs official you know and now the whole nation is a fucking post office oh hitler is smart all right hes a shrewd one i grant him that look how far hes come and he has the fault of all clever men he believes his own speeches like our earnest jurgen drexler jurgen hasnt given any speeches to me give him time hart smiled and do you understand his role aboard to outhitler hitler i suspect the captain said hes in the allgemeine division whats that what all the nazi poohbahs must belong to the civilian branch of the ss the fuhrers elite drexlers a major so be careful with him owen the political liaison never wore a uniform or referred to his rank yet when it came time to seek additional supplies his role became more obvious his whisper of gorings name sufficed hart judged him reflexively competitive but also competent and seemingly straightforward on the docks the young nazi was all business listening judiciously to the pilots suggestions asking intelligent questions and acting quickly once a decision was made he seemed a man of serious intent who assumed others shared that intent until they revealed otherwise he also appeared to respect harts experience twice drexler went out of his way to find the pilot and introduce him to visiting functionaries from berlin including a reporter from goebbelss propaganda ministry this is owen hart our american consultant he would say mr hart is intimately involved in planning the success of our expedition drexlers candor was limited however the pilot was puzzled that some of the crates were labeled only by number and stamped with a german eagle his inquiries as to what they contained brought bored shrugs from the sailors cargo net after cargo net was slung into the hold fritz whats all this gear hart finally asked the schwabenland is going to sink if we put much more aboard the mate considered a moment then elaborately looked first one way then another the german glance he explained with a wink his voice fell to a conspiratorial whisper well if you ask heiden hell tell you it helps ballast the boat to keep the propeller below the ice if you ask drexler hell tell you its peanuts for the elephant seals but since you asked me ive peeked at a bit of it and it seems to be field equipment construction supplies even guns yes bangbang dont be surprised im not sure all these things are going to come back off the ice these nazis dont like to be tourists you know they look for places to stay room to grow so it looks to me weve enough to start a research camp or a whaling station or a fucking hamburg shopping arcade but thats just me im not a big shot they tell me less than they do you hart decided to pursue the question with drexler he found the blond german sitting alone one evening in a corner of the galley looking weary but satisfied jurgen lifted his glass of cognac as the pilot came in so hart he greeted do you think were ready for the southern continent as ready as anyone can be the pilot said taking a chair i cant fault your preparations the rest is up to antarctica well put and do you feel at home with us hart considered im comfortable its a much larger ship than the one i was on before it must be strange sailing on a foreign vessel do you get homesick no my home is wherever i am my parents were lost in the big spanish flu epidemic of i have no other relatives no house no job no plane id have a hard time filling out an employment form im afraid its a miracle you hired me the german laughed unattached is one of the best credentials for an explorer i suppose so and no sweetheart back in america either the question was meant to be light but it had a slight edge to it no not much luck in that department im afraid or skill he grinned ruefully but what about you i sensed a relationship with greta heinz the german sipped his cognac greta shes a good friend maybe more someday who knows shes also a professional like us tied up in her work shes coming aboard because shes very very good in her field how did you meet through her well otto introduced us otto seems to introduce everyone drexler laughed again and whats your background jurgen he grew serious i grew up in the german nightmare you have no idea how disastrous for us the weimar republic was how huge a failure democracy was money worth nothing morality worth nothing honor worth nothing i was alone too my father dead in the war my mother ill in an institution and then came the party my new family my new father my new hope i know it looks strange to you outsiders the torches the marches but the fuhrer has touched the very soul of the german people the soul hart nodded considering he searched for the right question jurgen im puzzled by so much cargo boxes and boxes of it i dont know what it is where it goes the sailors keep mum well were going to a place far away thousands of miles from resupply its better to be over than underprepared and if we find a site for a future base we may cache supplies so this is more than just an aerial survey in essence this is an opportunity the dimensions of which none of us can guess as yet i just feel i could be more help if i understood more drexler took another sip i understand your american curiosity owen but its best not to ask too many questions youll be told everything you need to know to perform your job and believe me it will be easier not having to worry about what you dont need to know i mean no disrespect by this its simply the way we germans prefer to do things i trust you understand hart didnt but decided not to press the point he had to live with these people for the next three months later he asked fritz to come to his cabin presenting some bottled beers hed liberated from the officers mess for our philosophic musings he explained fritz pulled out some schnapps from his coat for our philharmonic bitching you can tell me about alaska and ill tell you about this ship unfortunately for you i have opinions on everyone and everything loud and obnoxious ones if we toast enough times owen summarized his conversation with drexler including the germans admonition you should be flattered if you were a german hed simply tell you to shut up they spoil you owen are you tired of it yet hart took a swig its a cozy ship he assessed and i like germans theyre enthusiastic energetic like americans ha as if that were a compliment fritz tilted the schnapps bottle well heiden is okay he knows his seamanship im told had some problems on an earlier voyage up to the arctic lost a ship but the story is that it was ice and bad luck we learn from our mistakes drexler im more suspicious of ambitious the kind of ambition that gets other people hurt the type of arrogant young prick they seem to stamp out of some reich factory by the thousands these days i tell you hart the party has put people to work i grant them that but they also attract the biggest collection of selfimportant pigheads ive ever seen and i never said that by the way he shouted at a vent opening jurgen simply strikes me as serious committed or pretentious fritz stood stiffly trying to comb his curly hair to one side with his fingers to approximate drexlers straight blond cut we sail for the glory of greater germany crap i sail for three months good wages and to get out of this lunatic asylum and you sail to erase your past drexler to curry favor heiden to make up for the ship he lost in the arctic in this woman heinz i bet to find a husband or escape one ach we all have one reason and pretend another we lie so desperately we believe ourselves we look for chance and call it purpose what a lot of pompous asses all people are hartall of us he belched probably me no better than him at lunch the next day hart asked drexler about his enthusiasm for a leader many americans regarded with apprehension adolf hitler has succeeded for one simple reason the political liaison replied pointing with his fork hes extraordinary a man of vision who is above common appetites but who recognizes those appetites in others there is an ofttold story hitler goes to a small village inn and the mayor and notables assemble at a table with him when the waiter comes hitler orders mineral water all the others hastily do too except one absentminded fellow at the end of the table who orders beer the other men look aghast but hitler smiles it seems you and i are the only two honest men in this village feder barked a laugh so why is the world so uneasy with him hart asked because he represents change or rather correction hitler seeks only to correct the errors in the treachery at versailles that followed the great war the allied politicians seeking their revenge put germans in france germans in austria germans in czechoslovakia a bastard creation of a country that didnt even existand germans in poland christ poland another geographic monstrosity another historical aberration and thats supposed to solve something give germany germany thats all hitler is asking cant you agree hart was cautious european history is confusing to americans im afraid justice is not i hope and flags are irrelevant in an antarctic storm the german smiled thinly then why does every nation take them there the docks were beginning to empty and the ship to settle lower in the water departure was drawing near one night a gray military truck pulled onto the dock and a dozen muscular young men leaped off shouldered seabags and bounded up the gangplank to disappear without a word into the forecastle they wouldnt appear on deck again until the ship had entered the north sea went the rumor around ship drexler was closeted with them naval marines ill bet fritz offered or something worse marines had never been discussed in conversations about the provisioning of the expedition so hart mentioned their sudden appearance to the political liaison drexler looked faintly disapproving those men are not your concern but why marines in the antarctic i didnt say they were marines then what are they drexler sighed those men are simply security hart specialists from the schutzstaffel the ss elite troops then they are your men they are my responsibility but im a civilian in the ss not a soldier an advisor not a general they take guidance from me why soldiers in antarctica theyre mountaineers trained for extreme conditions a precaution against rash action by norwegian whalers or anyone else we might encounter you know better than i how far well be from civilization it would be imprudent not to include such protection to ensure the safety of our mission we wont encounter anyone theres no one down there thats not true half the world is ahead of us down there really hart this is exactly the kind of situation we discussed in the galley our polar flight is your business the makeup of our complement is not and with that he walked away greta arrived a day later only one day prior to sailing hart encountered her in a passageway trailing another seaman who was carrying a seabag to her cabin ah so i see they let the other oddball on board she said brightly first an american horns in now i arrive what do you think is there room enough on this ship for a woman oh im sure youll have no problem said hart theyll soon be admiring your gumption gumption she was puzzled guts courage it takes a lot of both to be going where youre going oh i have my chaperon jurgen is determined to look after me she laughed but hart wasnt sure she found that idea unappealing or ridiculous and a pilot guide from america she added you wont let me get lost will you he smiled uncertainly you seem to know your way hardly she laughed again and was off down a passageway calling over her shoulder i can barely find my way around this ship women are bad luck he reminded himself as he stared after her remembering her smile chapter six the schwabenland left hamburg at six in the morning on december casting off in a chill drizzle europe was electric with tension as czechoslovakia was absorbed into the reich and civil war neared its climax in spain a war the fascists appeared destined to win hart was largely oblivious to such events engrossed in the details of expedition preparation with teutonic efficiency the aircraft mechanics had stocked two of everything hart suggested they get three the pilots had requested two weeks emergency rations on each plane hart had them double it to four he also convinced heiden to bring on board sixty parachutes attached to enough emergency food water and fuel to last a downed aircraft a month soon they were plowing through snow squalls in the north sea hart had a fliers stomach and little problem with the motion but feder and greta were sick and stayed away from the officers mess for the first few days the seaplane tender soon turned down the channel and passed other freighters their running lights glowing in the gloom none seemed to take special note of the german passing despite the dornier seaplanes lashed to the catapults off calais however a british destroyer emerged from a bank of fog and rounded on the schwabenlands flag following for a few miles like a dog sniffing scent drexler ran out on the bridge wing and studied the warship through binoculars as no doubt its officers were studying the german vessel then the british ship pulled away hart liked the sea it offered the same combination of freedom and simple emptiness as the air and the ship was a cocoon a refuge of warmth from the elements outside the americans quarters were with the expedition leaders and pilots high in the midcastle housing ordinary seamen were on decks below the mysteriously ensconced ss mountaineers were housed in the uncomfortable forecastle where the ships motion and noise from pounding waves was at an extreme true to prediction the soldiers did emerge after the ship left hamburg but they kept to themselves clinging to the bow area of the schwabenland as if an invisible leash kept them from roaming twice a day they assembled on the forward deck in shorts and tshirts and did calisthenics they looked like white blond machines hart prowled the vessels passageways until he had a mental map of its layout then scouted cozy places on deck shielded from wind from there catching the warmth of the occasional winter sun like a cat he could watch the cresting swells for hours under dark skies the waves were like hills of obsidian glassy but opaque when the sun shone they turned molten emerald the air outside was cold and refreshing a contrast to the interiors smell of oil and cigarette smoke and overcooked german food eventually greta emerged on deck and remained there as long as possible using the wind to blow away her nausea at first she seemed to prefer to be alone with her thoughts sometimes drexler would approach her hart would surreptitiously observe and she would give a quiet shake of her head but later she would chat with him for a bit and the other officers would occasionally join her too sometimes making a joke to cover their awkwardness her gender made her exotic and her quiet beauty it was more evident here at sea away from the calculated flash of gorings actresses a magnet without effort she became along with heiden as captain and drexler as german philosopher a focal point in the officers mess she would arrive for dinner dressed in practical working clothes wool pants boots and a sweater her red hair pulled back into a ponytail and gamely enter the male conversation sometimes she smelled of perfume and sometimes of formaldehyde but she had a light gentle laugh that sounded in the dark and overheated mess like a bell in a cave her effect was amusing the men would unconsciously straighten a bit voices would quiet and soften eyes would quickly dart her way and then turn to a studious examination of a salt shaker or coffee mug she was aware of this and careful to let her own gaze flit from face to face democratically pleasant the woman was an antidote to coarseness and hart guessed most of the men in the officers mess were secretly grateful for her presence yet he knew her position was not easy she was trying to assert a place as an equal and yet adhere to the feminine reticence expected in germany her relationship with jurgen drexler seemed as unsettled as shed described herself to be clearly she enjoyed his company he was handsome selfassured and flattering in his attentions the german was a man on the make a comer who might go far in the new regime if this expedition was a success an alliance with a bright pathbreaking woman like greta would likely make them a celebrity couple back home and he was a dogged campaigner for her affection whenever possible hart noticed drexler would take the seat next to her in the mess the others often left it empty as if waiting for his arrival yet the pilot wasnt sure what the woman made of this presumption on a few occasions she made a point of sitting between two other men reminding him of her move at karinhall the change it seemed to hart gave her a bit of relief jurgen drexler could be relentlessly persistent yet when drexler talked late in the evening about their expedition to the crystal towers of antarcticahed lose himself in romanticism and the biologists eyes would take on a certain shine still hart didnt see in gretas manner an emotional commitment to the german there was none of the easy partnership of a romance or affair or betrothal her fingers were empty of rings and she retained the cautious aloofness attractive women sometimes adopt as a necessary shield drexler was clearly seeking an intimacy beyond simple friendship but she had a way of both admitting him and yet putting him off all this was the subject of idle gossip of course it was assumed the presence of both on board was far from coincidental yet no one claimed firm knowledge the couple deflected curiosity drexlers behavior persuaded hart that he should keep a careful distance from greta if he was going to rehabilitate his reputation the last thing he needed was a rivalry with the expeditions political liaison or to get his mind wrapped around another woman yet curiosity nagged at him one evening he took drexlers intended seat next to hers in order to see what would happen she looked at him curiously but not without welcome hello hart smiled it looks like youve gotten your sea legs he nodded toward her full plate and you appear to be finding your way as well she studied him his throat suddenly felt dry but he managed well it isnt that big a ship yes and yet i havent seen that much of you everyone is busy and im trying not to interfere you seem occupied she looked up at the dark circle of a porthole the lift of her chin showing the white curve of her neck not all the time she said trying to keep her tone light they let that hang for a moment so have you gotten things the expedition i mean in proper order she finally asked actually my contribution has been pretty minimal ive done my best but the cliches about german thoroughness appear to be true really she smiled at that how does it feel to be surrounded by meticulous germans depends on the german of course she sipped some water studying him over the rim of the glass well i suspect we benefit from the perspective of an outsider theres talk about you on the ship you know your past why youre here i have my own theory which is i think youre a deliberate adventurer undaunted by the prospect of death but afraid of life fond of going to remote lonely places she waited for his reaction hmmm that might describe anyone on this ship including you she laughed thats the problem with professor freuds psychoanalysis its like a boomerang coming back at the analyst yes but still its fun to form conjectures i must admit ive been mostly stymied in your case she smiled how so well hart paused afraid he was venturing onto unsafe ground your presence on this ship is puzzling a lone woman among so many men willing to risk everything for some scientific data one wonders what i only meant that youre female thats good admirable but i cant help wondering how you came to be here i was invited like you i know that yes of course for my expertise owen like you she sounded annoyed i didnt mean drexler came in then his cheeks flushed from some mission outside in the cold he moved to the table where greta was and then stopped clearly a bit nonplussed at harts presence greta looked up at him with exasperation as if hed undercut her point by appearing then she studied her salad poking it with her fork i am unclear what you did mean she said quietly to hart quickly masking his own discomfort drexler moved to a smaller table and took a seat next to schmidt pretending a hearty companionship greta glanced over at the blond german who was studiously ignoring her damn youd better eat that salad hart told her his voice a bit rougher than he intended well be out of greens in another week yes of course she trimmed a small leaf with her knife and lifted it to her lips slipping it in then she suddenly turned to him you must forgive me im still finding my way aboard and am a bit awkward at it im afraid she abruptly stood up gathering her dishes this motion destroys my appetite hart started to stand too anxious that hed spoiled her supper but as soon as he did so he knocked over his water glass sending a small flood toward the pilot kauffman he lunged im sorry reinhard he groped for his napkin glancing around in time to see greta leave the galley drexler looked after her as she disappeared but didnt move well thought hart next time ill sit elsewhere after dinner drexler paused at harts table no luck or no skill each of the expedition leaders was developing roles in the ships new social order heiden was friendly but professionally distant appropriately so hart judged the success of the expedition was ultimately the captains responsibility and so he was trying to cultivate an air of shared competence not camaraderie he had a prussian briskness drexlers manner was one of energetic dedication an officious drive he probably thought reasonably masked his interest in greta hart had heard little of this schutzstaffel or ss but it clearly was an elite that drew deference from germans jurgen enjoyed gorings influence and heidens ear hart was impressed by his mind drexler seemed to retain any statistic about the dorniers that was thrown at him and his ability to put their voyage in grand historical context this is a first step toward making germany a true global power he would exclaim with almost boyish enthusiasm he conferred for long hours with heiden the two men bent over old antarctic charts alfred feder the geographer was conversational exhibiting a genuine curiosity about antarctica what had been the weather pattern how cold in summer and winter which food if any could be hunted or fished for what did the climate do to storage of supplies was fire a serious danger because of dry air yes and of course the lack of unfrozen water how did the british or americans melt enough to sustain a base hart answered as straightforwardly as he could not pretending knowledge when he didnt have it schmidt the ships doctor was more of a mystery he had a sour closeness about him seeming to tolerate people more than enjoy them he smoked like a chimney and only dabbed at his food his sallow skin reminded hart of oiled paper the physician held a clinic for the sailors two hours each day receiving the usual litany of complaints ranging from seasickness to the inevitable venereal disease resulting from hamburg shore leave he quickly earned a reputation for being gruff and ungentle hes got the bedside manner of a veterinarian the sailors reported hart continued to run into greta but she passed by with a distracted air which satisfied him in truth he was a bit intimidated by her once he caught her looking at him her expression opaque and could think of nothing intelligent to say then she approached again the pilot was sitting on a hatch cover enjoying a watery sun in a hazy sky to occupy himself hed found some line and was splicing two rope ends together you do that as if from long experience came a female voice he looked up startled she was carrying binoculars and a book about seabirds the wind pressing one side of her coat against her figure and snapping the other end free like a flag she pointed to his splices were you a seaman as well as a pilot shed caught him by surprise and he hesitated a moment before replying no fritz taught me her skin was rosy from the unaccustomed midwinter sun and wind he noticed im a landlubber a what its an american word for someone whos never been to sea i grew up in montana a mountain state id never been on the ocean until my first trip south i like the mountains too have you been to the alps afraid not not even in lenis movies she smiled at the reference and without asking sat down opening the book on her lap the pages fluttered in the wind hart was a bit surprised at this overture he thought hed muddled things sufficiently at supper now here she was pretending as if nothing had happened is it a good place montana a wonderful place to grow up for a boy riding fishing climbing caving caving spelunking there were caverns not far from our place beautiful limestone ones we were warned not to go in them but wed sneak off anyway with candles and lanterns crawling around and getting stuck lucky we didnt get lost wed come home pretending wed gone someplace else but our mothers had to know we stank of them you had a lot of freedom then they let us run wild and you she laughed convent school my father far away nuns sin guilt my god oh not so bad but this is my chance to run to freedom its the only thing worth running to he said for a moment she didnt say anything then how did you become a pilot took a dollar ride at a county fair and was hooked i saved up during a summer of riding and roping and bought myself flying lessons i became a barnstormer a wild one actually at eighteen you think youre immortal i had more guts than sense until i cracked up a couple times then i ran cargo chartered and did a lot of cold weather flying i met elliott farnsworth at an air show and the rest as they say is history and no woman in this history thats a forward kind of inquiry its the only inquiry any woman cares to know surely youve learned that by now he grinned youre not very coy are you i am when i want to be well the girls i knew would tell you ive learned nothing about your gender yes there were women even a woman but it didnt last a pilot is about as stable as a hummingbird and antarctica is not a place conducive to romance she laughed at that and hart sensed she was laughing at herself too bad too cold and if were being so inquisitive let me ask you about men in your history ah well thats a complicated story she looked across the waves im not married if thats what you mean i i hope to do a lot of thinking down here about jurgen she looked away no about me her tone made him cautious all right fair enough they were quiet for a bit he sensed her approval at the quiet it felt companionable to watch the swells hiss by finally she turned to him again would you like to see my laboratory it was on the main deck just above the waterline a single porthole offered natural illumination a microscope was bolted to a wooden table shelves held scientific books and journals in german and cabinets stored beakers and tubes small translucent shrimplike creatures floated in jars of formaldehyde all less than an inch long krill she explained holding them to the light regarding the specimens with a professionally flat rationality there are billions trillions of them in the southern ocean combined they outweigh any animal on earth humans elephants whales a hundred million tons some have guessed theyre the key to the biological wealth of antarctica they look like ghosts hart said so pale as clear as the cold waters we have some nets aboard to try to produce an estimate of their abundance that we scarcely recognized their importance until a few years ago is humbling no how little we still know of our own world yes he took the jar and examined the creatures closely they seemed gossamer in their translucence naked somehow yet we dont seem to be humbled were anxious enough to run the world anyway you mean by whaling in antarctica by going there by staying there by establishing new orders look at hitler he wants to change everything hes exciting greta said he started from nothing and now hes the most important man in the world he has what most people lack vision and will you sound like drexler jurgens not incorrect he recognizes the path to the future even if he can be a bit singleminded about it at times its exciting to feel a part of that for an american perhaps its different ah you mean im not a patriot hart said wryly a hired gun just that you go for your own reasons i and jurgen and captain heiden and everyone else aboard go for germany at least in part hart thought back to fritzs more cynical interpretation and i go for myself my guess is youre looking for yourself there oh freud again she shrugged guiltily smiling but theres more than that he said i go for antarctica yes she put the jar back on the shelf and thats interesting it must be quite a place to draw you back chapter seven the weather warmed as the tender sailed south mindful of the need to take advantage of the short antarctic summer heiden bypassed the chance to get fresh produce in the canaries the spanish oranges were already gone and steamed on for the equator hart busied himself getting to know the two flying boats and their pilots kauffman and lambert the aviators seemed simple and straightforward men in love with flying and excited at the prospect of being the first humans to see unexplored territory in the calmer seas off africa it was decided to give the airplanes a test flight and the schwabenland turned to point the heinkel k catapults directly into the hot breeze the sea here was rolling but placid like a cerulean desert would you like to go flying hart kauffman asked him of course ive never been on a catapult plane then youre in for a ride well achieve a speed of one hundred and fifty kilometers per hour in a second and a half takes your breath away kauffman took the pilots seat hart the copilots in the compartment behind lambert served as navigator and heinrich stern the expeditions communications officer was radioman sailors scrambled to ready the catapult and the dornier engine roared to life the plane trembling like an excited puppy kauffman checked the gauges hart following his gaze all were familiar planes are planes he thought then the german pilot brought the engine to full power and gave a thumbsup there was a bang and a hiss and the propeller craft hurled forward shoving hart back into his seat as they left the catapults end there was a brief alarming drop toward the sea a moments hesitation as if the engine was gathering effort and then they were away and soaring upward banking to rotate over the ship hart whooped and kauffman grinned toy figures on the deck below waved a cheer and the schwabenland suddenly seemed very tiny in the immensity of the ocean the men took a bearing toward africa and flew off in that direction the blue bowl they navigated through featureless and hazy hart felt the sheer exhilaration of being in the air cut free from the earth and sea do you want to fly her kauffman inquired hart nodded happily and took the controls the seaplane was not nimble but steady a highpowered workhorse that should perform well in the cold antarctic air he began flying in a broad loop back toward the ship the vessel was lost for a while in the dazzle of the sun and then became visible again drawing a dark line on a platter of silver it looked so slow and stately from this height then toward the horizon there was a puff of mist kauffman pointed excitedly whales hart brought the plane down to three hundred feet and roared over the leviathans awed by the spectacle the beasts were huge barnacled and battered like jetty rocks they broke the surface exhaled with a powerful sigh and then slid underwater to become racing blue shadows when he flew over again at only fifty feet the whales sounded tails flashing in the sunlight as they headed for the abyss hart realized hed been holding his breath magnificent the german pilot held his thumb up in approval im not sure im happy to be helping hunt them the american added kauffman shrugged god put them there for us how can you be sure because he gave us the skill to kill them harden yourself hart those are dumb animals its no different than a slaughterhouse it feels different seeing them in the wild like that bah theyre beasts glorious creatures but beasts nonetheless no theyre more than that greta heinz should be here shed tell you kauffman grinned then let her have heinrich radio the ship well pick her up and chase them by the time we turn the plane around they should be back to the surface we can spot their blow for miles hart surrendered control of the plane again to kauffman for the landing the german pilot betrayed no anxiety only intense concentration he let the pontoons clip the top of one swell then another and finally settled on the third like a great seabird the plane sledded down its gentle slope and came to a halt in the wave hollow then they were bobbing on the ocean the schwabenland came up to create a lee pocket and the cargo crane rotated out kauffman scrambled out on top of the wing to catch the hook and attach it to the engine housing the dornier was lifted twisting a bit like a dripping ornament and then rose swiftly up over the crewmen grabbing the wet slippery pontoons and they were back aboard greta came running up as soon as they dropped from the planes hatch yes the whales i must see them she grabbed kauffmans arm reinhard please take me up drexler had trailed her whats all the excitement about he asked warily kauffman was already issuing orders to the crewmen to ready the plane again we spotted a pod of whales hart explained i thought greta might like to see them its really an extraordinary sight jurgen you must come too she said to observe them from the air is an amazing opportunity the german looked doubtfully at the stilldripping aircraft i think ill see them well enough from the ship the schwabenland will never catch them kauffman warned theyre too far drexler looked distinctly uncomfortable i think it would be too crowded we have room please come jurgen it will be so much fun he smiled weakly at her pleading come this may be a onceinalifetime chance hart suddenly realized the man didnt relish being launched into the air he was afraid of flying yes come on up jurgen the american joined unable to resist we could dive right on them and get a real closeup view drexlers mouth set in a thin line harts voice had decided him all right roughly grabbing a life jacket he pushed past the american to jerk open the hatch you can take lamberts spot kauffman called after him the navigators seat greta can be copilot next to me nodding wordlessly drexler crawled inside ill replace heinrich on the radio hart said they followed drexler greta peppering kauffman with questions about the instruments as he buckled her in hart sat on the rearfacing radiomans seat opposite jurgen the german was staring straight backward refusing to glance out the porthole at the sailors making final preparations then the engine coughed to life spun and roared the plane rattled again eager to go drexlers hands gripped the underside of his seat and hart watched the knuckles whiten ready kauffmans voice came over the earphones another bang and with a lurch and a rush they were off its so quick greta exclaimed with delight the plane banked bouncing a bit in the warm air drexler shut his eyes kauffmans voice crackled in harts ears over his headphones ill get a bit of altitude and start looking where we saw them before he announced hart began peering out his own porthole searching for telltale spouts it was greta who first saw them again look amazing kauffman exclaimed how far theyve moved hart unbuckled his seat belt and poked his head up into the cockpit he could see dissipating mist ahead and a flash of foam as if the sea was breaking over rocks jurgen greta called you must come and see there was a long pause jurgen finally there was a click of an unfastened belt and hart was roughly pushed to one side the political liaison put his head between greta and kauffman and squinted at the ocean he was pale his skin glistening i see them he managed and yes theyre impressive kauffman passed over at three hundred feet again so as not to spook the animals as the whales rose and fell breathing rhythmically their backs darkened and lightened with the depth of the water making it look like they glowed with variable light so beautiful greta enthused look at the slow slow beat of their swim hart added its like music but to a different longer deeper time i wonder how long they live kauffman asked swinging the plane around the whales came in view again how long does it take to grow to such immense size nearly forever they roared over again the whale spouts shimmering with solar rainbows just remember that what were seeing is germanys next resource greta looked at drexler with exasperation jurgen look their peeling skin was like a worn hill testimony to epic survival theyre just oil to you drexler took a deep breath my personal reaction is irrelevant he said exhaling to battle his physical unease its not that theyre without beauty its that such beauty has no practical use thats an awfully prosaic view of nature hart objected its a realistic view of nature drexler regained some selfassurance as he talked it took his mind off where he was suspended in air above the ocean you pilots never ask where the machine that carries you comes from it comes ultimately from nature from resources like those whales to think otherwise is pleasurable but naive hart frowned he liked the man better when he was quiet from fright next would come a lecture on nazi destiny reinhard let me fly again owen suggested i need the practice the german pilot hesitated hed been enjoying showing off for the woman but it would look piggish to refuse all right there was a laborious shifting of bodies both pilots brushing against greta as drexler leaned back unhappily then hart was at the controls he banked again steeper this time and headed back toward the whales i think we should get closer he said over his shoulder to drexler if we can find some mark that identifies individuals like the colors of ponies maybe youll think of them as more than bags of oil he put the ponderous seaplane in a dive oh my greta slapped out her hands to brace herself the dornier rapidly closed with the water until it looked as if the mammal spouts would spatter their canopy she managed a laugh anxious and delighted then hart pulled up my stomach she exclaimed the seaplane zoomed upward as if climbing a hill slowed hesitated and rolled to the left banking steeply then it dove again hart stop it kauffman snapped this isnt a barnstormer of course he pulled back and leveled then banked a bit to peer down the whales had sounded again damn theyre gone greta laid a hand on the muscles of his forearm you frightened me just trying to get a good look he glanced over his shoulder drexler was gone kauffman ducked down to look back along the interior of the fuselage jurgen was on his knees his head inside the planes cramped lavatory our political liaison is sick how was your maiden dornier voyage hart heiden inquired over tea in the galley the captain was in a pleasant mood it was the day after the whale sighting the weather was still fine progress good and the airplanes appeared in excellent working order theyd crossed the equator that morning and were entering the southern latitudes thered been a ceremony on board with heiden as king neptune christening those who hadnt yet made the crossing drexler had recovered his equilibrium and was determined to take his dousing with good humor he even seized the bucket to spray greta who laughed and hurled water back neptune backing off hurriedly the seamen craned to look at the clothes plastered on her body before she ran below to change i felt free as a bird the american now replied i think youve got an agile airplane there reinhard let me put her through some paces yes i heard your flying was quite exuberant my stomach is still up there im afraid drexler said trying to make light of his experience hart is quite the stunt pilot he poured himself some tea in good weather no one missed the allusion ive had a lot of experience hart said evenly in all kinds of weather the dorniers a good plane drexler went on mildly range of a thousand kilometers ceiling of four he didnt forget what the pilots had told him its part of germanys leadership in the air he took a sip of earl grey from england and looked at greta i expect someday all of us will travel by air everywhere aircraft will be as commonplace as the auto as if everyone would want one hart thought sick as a dog and now an aeronautical visionary the man didnt back down an inch well feder put in it will be interesting to see how the planes perform in antarctica i suppose youd stick to dogs alfred it worked for amundsen feder replied referring to the first man to reach the south pole ach the norwegians again a nation living in the past i think you need to take the best of the past and the future hart said in antarctica wood sometimes works better than metal fur better than linen and a gun better than an arrow said drexler thats why the airplane will let us explore more territory in a day than the norwegians or british saw in a year i dont disagree with that said hart im a flier but airplanes have their limitations too you can only see so much detail airplanes break down some days they arent usable i respect bad weather yes a prudent flier drexler said so weve heard a live flier hart countered jurgen for goodness sake greta said owen is helping us and you pretend there is some contest of views im just making a point after he made his he agrees with you and you insult him you need to get to an iceberg to cool your head drexler looked truculent at this scolding but said nothing chapter eight the first icebergs were huge flat chunks from the ice shelf of the weddell sea looking to hart like mesas rising from a watery desert they gleamed as if lit from within shining with pearly translucence under a pale gray sky in the emptiness of the southern ocean their exact size was impossible to gauge but as the schwabenland steamed closer their immensity became apparent the white cliffs of their sides were taller than a fortress wall and their bulk was enough to produce a harbor of calm water on their lee side to windward ocean swells ate caves into their bulk the white was veined with blue like marble and just below the slategray water the bergs shelved into brilliant turquoise their top was snowy and unmarked the perfect face of snowfalls stretching back ten thousand years the days were growing steadily longer as they steamed south hart spent the twilight after dinner watching the bergs slide by wrapped in his flying jacket and wool hat they look like cake yes hart turned it was cold at the railing and greta was bundled in her antarctic parka the fur ruff of its hood framing her face her eyes were the same blue as the fissures in the icebergs but he didnt say that youll make me hungry he joked lamely he was pleased shed joined him but he didnt say that either they seemed to have repaired the awkward dinner and hed been secretly pleased at her defense of him at tea still he was cautious theyre like wedding cakes the biologist said beautiful but sad you know that something sublime is about to be consumed or in this case melted it heightens the beauty i think like leaves in autumn things are more beautiful when theyre lost yes because the loss makes the feeling more intense sometimes life seems to me to be an endless slipping away well things seem more beautiful when you cant have them said hart sometimes life seems to me to be an endless anticipation of arrival like this voyage greta smiled wistfully ach what a pair we are arriving leaving never in the moment perhaps we should take a lesson from the whales who are always in the moment it would be interesting to be them for a while dont you think to have every fiber of your being focused on the now to drink in all the endless sensations the colors the feelings the scents and tastes it must be a comfort not even realizing the inevitability of your own death you seem less a biologist than a philosopher hart said meaning to joke but feeling uncomfortable hed never met a woman who talked like this he was intrigued by her mind but not quite sure how to respond you seem less a pilot than an artist she countered i catch you watching things but not in the way the other men do as an obstacle or a prize you have an eye for beauty yes i do hart risked looking at her tendrils of her red hair fluttered against her ruff in the breeze and her skin was pale and taut in the cold she blushed then looked up at him her eyes searching his greta i abruptly she turned away and was gone the schwabenland met its first norwegian whaler the next day it was a large pursuit vessel part of a flotilla of harpoon ships that would kill and tow whales to a factory vessel or shore station somewhere beyond the horizon its harpoon was mounted like a cannon on its bow id like to see the dart thats loaded into that thing said the pilot kauffman watching with hart from the wing of the bridge deck i saw them hunt last time the american said the harpoons are as long as a man and weigh as much as fritz the tip alone is as long as your forearm they explode inside the whale with a charge of powder its spectacular and violent i would have thought it overkill but then we saw the size of those whales the foreign ship swung about from its routine prowl and steamed over heiden watched the whalers approach through binoculars and then spoke to a mate break out the flag he said the german ensign began fluttering from a mast the norwegian skipper called by radio speaking a heavily accented german this is sigvald jansen from the aurora australis he greeted we dont get many aircraft carriers at sixty degrees south are you lost my friends drexler smiled thinly we should tell him to get lost after we stake our claim he is going to find himself in reich territory heiden ignored this this is captain konrad heiden of the german seaplane tender schwabenland he radioed back were on a scientific mission to explore the continent by air do you have any word on the extent of the pack ice there was a moments hesitation as the norwegians digested this information no we havent gone that far south jansens voice crackled maybe thats where our whales are hiding weve had poor hunting so far well were going to the ice so well keep an eye out for whales heiden radioed of course if we see any well think of them as our whales the norwegian actually laughed at that ha i can tell i am speaking to germans well its almost christmas my friends and ocean and ice enough to share id like to satisfy my curiosity about that ship of yours i think i can find a holiday present if youll allow us to row over heiden looked questioningly at drexler the political liaison considered a moment then nodded we may learn something the captain spoke into the radio be our guest they watched the norwegians work efficiently to launch a boat and pull strongly across jansen proved a big thickly muscled man with a blond beard and icegray eyes he came stomping into the schwabenlands mess in an oilskin jacket and enormous black seaboots ho ho ho he chortled trying to imitate the angloamerican version of saint nick merry christmas heiden shook the callused hand politely and began making introductions he smells like a ripe whale feder whispered to hart drexler hung back sizing the man up jansen noticed and returned the scrutiny a political liaison the whaler repeated after heidens introduction far from a ministry arent you not far from political issues as you know jansen raised his eyebrows at that really id hoped we were his bag tied with red yarn whomped down onto a table with a clink merry christmas bowing heiden unlaced it inside were several bottles of aquavit a fiery norwegian drink to keep you warm on your trip back the german grinned and some dutch courage to you my friend heiden said handing over a case of schnapps in return jansen beamed i love religious holidays he plopped into a chair and looked about curiously nice ship all this for science were intending to explore new regions of the continent by air and establish formal claim drexler spoke up our intention is to see more of antarctica in a season than most explorers see in a lifetime by airplane the norwegian looked at the german with amusement fair enough but flying doesnt count does it i mean you have to step ashore to lay claim politically speaking we will drexler said our dorniers have skis our launch has an engine our rowboats oars we intend to be everywhere staking our claim jansen laughed yes i can tell i am talking with germans although the american there hart is it he has a bit of a different look he sticks out like a crooked harpoon exactly who are you young fellow im a pilot ive flown in antarctica before flown here before and come back with nazis no less then youve got about as much sense as i do locked in this stinking miserable buttfreezing frustrating bankrupt glorious trade of whaling he turned to heiden its not like the old days you know the whales are all gone weve hunted them out and yet youre still here observed drexler as ive already told you ive no more sense than the yankee there of course drexler said dryly of course the norwegian smiled broadly scanning the room to see if anyone believed him it would be interesting to tour your ship ive never seen a tender like this before unfortunately thats not possible heiden said most of the ship is off limits because of the sensitivity of our scientific cargo im sure youve seen her type before not down here yes we germans like to be first really thats too bad because we norwegians have been here decades before you jansens expression grew harder be careful at the continent my friends its cold down there lots of ice weve learned to stay away from those latitudes he looked grave and why is that asked heiden a whaler ventured down that way last season the bergen wondered if the whales had been pushed that far south and radioed it had found a possible site for a rendering station then poof was never heard from again what happened the german captain asked who knows ice storm im not about to go down there to find out id advise you to exercise caution as well but germans first in austria then czechoslovakia now antarctica such ambition i expect well meet again only if you stay in these waters drexler said oh well stay these waters are home to us now jansen let his gaze flicker from german to german again looking each of them squarely in the eye but then you already know that he winked stood and clomped back to his waiting launch merry christmas he shouted again from the boat waving as it rose and fell in the swells the german officers gathered on the bridge wing and watched the norwegian whaler swing away like an animal peeing to mark his territory drexler assessed hes probably saying the same thing about us feder remarked god willing well be the first not the last of third reich explorers he meets down here heiden said hell find more germans than he likes and will have to adjust to it become an ally or an enemy better the former heiden turned the comment came from fritz pulling watch duty on the bridge you speak from experience mr eckermann yes sir fished with them in theres a bit of the viking left best not to cross them especially when it comes to boats and fish and best for them not to cross us drexler said yes the norwegians are about to experience true competition the captain agreed and i wonder what happened to the bergen i suspect antarctica swallowed it the clouds darkened as they continued steaming south the wind picked up snow began scudding across the deck and the temperature dropped signaling their approach to the southern continent the ship began to roll heavily and hart stood lookout for icebergs observing them pass like dark fortresses in the gloom the weather continued foul for the brief night the following day and into a second night while the ice grew steadily thicker christmas morning dawned with the ship pushing through thin pack ice broken into floes the size of houses it was loose enough that they could shoulder the ice aside occasionally driving headlong into a floe and splintering it cracks racing away from the bow of the ship the ice rasped and banged against the hull drexler and feder joined hart on deck watching the spectacle on some of the floes giantsized seals snoozed content on their mattress of snow they obviously belonged here crabeater seals most of them greta told the men at the rail they get their name from eating krill they look awkward not in the water greta said smiling drexler gathered some snow from the deck and threw a snowball at one it raised its head and opened its mouth giving a grawkkk as it yawned a sleepy protest then it wiggled forward into the water and slipped away like a dying note of music jurgen she scolded you shouldnt harass them theyre just seals greta slugs of the ice jump in the water and swim next to them and well see who looks like the slug she jested theyve adapted to this place in ways we can only envy drexler harrumphed yes they can swim but they simply exist they are passive meek dim you wouldnt say that if you encountered a leopard seal oh theyre spotted ten feet long weigh as much as four men and have huge jaws full of sharp teeth they can move faster than any of us and snatch us in a minute they prey on penguins and seals drexler laughed well im not a penguin and im not going to lose any sleep over a seal i do admire the way you love these animals greta but im more concerned about the future of our species she looked miffed someday youll meet a leopard seal jurgen and then youll see someday he shrugged the ship broke into clear water again dark and cold now the passing bergs were tall and sharp like small jagged mountains they passed a cluster of penguins standing on one some sliding comically down the ice like children on a slide christmas dinner was festive lit by the warm glow of candlelight heiden was in a good mood about their progress feder became first amusingly and then annoyingly drunk schmidt sat in a corner chainsmoking his cigarettes and content to just watch the others it appeared there were no presents but hart passed out intricately knotted key or watch chains hed tied from thick cord gretas was inked red and green when he presented it her cheeks were flush from the libations and her eyes shining with the excitement of being in such an exotic spot for the holiday she lit up as if hed given her a necklace and leaning forward quickly pecked him on the cheek im embarrassed i have nothing for you she whispered in his ear then she slipped away drexler watched fingering his own key chain very thoughtful hart its good youre finding time for clever crafts i dont have anything for you either but i doand here he raised his voice have something as well for our female pioneer she turned smiling in surprise alone of her gender but not alone in our hearts said drexler with a bow to greta for her tolerance of this rude companythey laughed i present this gift he pulled a wrapped package from behind a chair and handed it to the biologist she blushed jurgen you know you shouldnt single me out this way she carefully unfastened the bright wrapping and peeked when it was half off its a book more paper came off the germans clustered around a book about whales not poetry perhaps but better than the one about paramecia drexler joked but from you jurgen he picked it out in hamburg heiden said too timid to buy a romance so he headed for the biology section the germans laughed i figured i couldnt go wrong getting you something connected with your specialty jurgen said sheepishly when i saw the title lords of the ocean it seemed like the right choice greta nodded her eyes moist you devil you are more intrigued by them than you dare admit she grasped the back of his neck and kissed him quickly on the lips the assembly roared with appreciation thank you she looked at him shyly grasping the book to her breast jurgen smiled hart watched from the shadows the next morning there was a watery dawn of gray light as the sun climbed higher the wind dropped and the overcast began to break the schwabenland was in a lead of cold black water between two masses of pack ice picking its way slowly southward more silvercolored seals lounged on the ice floes indeed looking from a distance like giant slugs maybe drexler had a point then the clouds on the horizon slowly spun away to reveal a harder shape a chain of white mountains rose from the sea the snow on them so thick and immaculate it looked like a wall of sugar antarctica hart announced to the germans chapter nine antarctica was like a dream that stung part of it seemed soft and hallucinatory the gauzy shimmer of downy white peaks reflected in a cobalt sea vast icebergs drifting out of a cold fog the ethereal gloom of crevasses sunk like blue wounds into crumpled glaciers yet the continent was hard as well the blaze of reflected light that dazzled the eyes the bitter cold that seared the nose and throat or the rime of ice on railings and deck nose hair froze lips cracked and even the blinked moisture of an eye could become sticky from the chill during a gale the wind could become so bitter that it would seem to suck all oxygen away with it yet on a still day the sunny radiance could leave ones body glowing while standing on a slab of ice most of all there was the clarity of the air the ordinary slight humid haze of temperate lands was wholly absent and distant mountains stood revealed in incredible detail instead of sharpening perception this clarity seemed to confuse it the mind lost its common reference points and the landscape seemed less real not more antarctica was as vivid as fantasy as substantial as reverie hart had fallen in love with it the first time he found he still feared it as well where are we he asked heiden for all his recognition of the white wall of mountains that stretched as far as the eye could see in any direction he could have been on the moon new schwabenland the captain replied the newest part of greater germany the immediate need was to go ashore drexler announced the schwabenland was the first vessel of the third reich to visit the southern continent and a formal claim was paramount theyd anchored in a bay bounded by twohundredfoothigh glacial walls that the geographer feder promptly named after their home port of hamburg occasionally a chunk of ice would break away from the glacier face with a crack like a cannon shot crashing into the dark clear water and bobbing away through the echoes of its own turbulence a rocky point of land jutted from the southwest corner and it was there that they rowed in a lifeboat the eversilent mountaineers pulling at the oars the boat crunched onto a beach of rocky cobbles and the passengers splashed through the shallows to mushy snow and granite outcrops a gulllike skua flew overhead shrieking a protest of prior occupation feder had brought a movie camera which he proceeded to erect on a tripod greta had her silver leica drexler carried a small nazi flag tied to a boathook pole since there was no breeze to flaunt the swastika he had one of the soldiers hold the flag outward while greta snapped a picture then he ushered heiden in front of the movie camera pulling down the captains parka hood so that his steelgray prussian features were clearly visible we claim this land for the german reich in the name of adolf hitler the captain proclaimed his voice thin in the immense landscape may its challenge and resources inspire the german people for generations to come schmidt stumbled off to peer at small stains of lichen on the rocks life at its most elemental he muttered scraping some off there was also a colony of adelie penguins nearby and a trio of avian ambassadors waddled across the snow to inspect these curious goingson look theyre already dressed for the new year greta exclaimed in delight indeed the penguins looked like a delegation in tuxedos theyre welcoming our protection and administration drexler said winking he strode toward the birds which scuttled away warily thank you for your hospitality we bring you civilization in return he said bowing then he stood erect and gave a stiffarmed salute heil hitler greta laughed and snapped his picture hart sighed and walked over to inspect the penguin colony there were hundreds of birds jockeying for nesting position on the bare dirt that had emerged from surrounding snow the rookery smelled rank from bird excrement which stained the area reddish brown periodically a group of the birds would walk or bellyslide to the waters edge hesitate and then follow a leader their awkwardness instantly changing to grace as they glided away like sibilant torpedoes greta came too clicking away with the leica hart felt slightly irritated with her for photographing the nazi posturing and then reminded himself it was her country she was oblivious to his mood delighted at being ashore again he slowed to wait for her to catch up they look like little people he said to her this is their nesting time no one knows yet where they go in winter but in summer they swim to places like this to breed its funny to see them pause at the waters edge like we might as if it was too cold theyre not pausing for the cold theyre checking for leopard seals the leopards lurk just below the surface looking upward for the silhouette of a penguin before they strike stay away from the edge yourself if you venture onto the pack ice yes maam hart said mock saluting so why are the penguins clustered here they use pebbles to build their nests and return year after year to rookeries that have a supply of them you can see them quarreling over the stones now hart watched some penguins were simply searching the ground for rocks but others eyed the cache of their neighbors sometimes theyd stage a raid and snatch a pebble to much tumult and squawking often their own supply would be raided by still other penguins at the same time it was a pointless competition that seemed well very human theyre not very bright the pilot said no theyre little more than hormone boxes driven by instinct skuas and the gulls are the brighter birds theyll work as a team at breeding time one bird distracting a parent penguin from its egg while the other snatches it but there are so many penguins that i guess enough survive if only theyd cooperate with each other sometimes they do see there that penguin is giving his pebble to another hes probably a male demonstrating his attention to a female romantic yes hart grinned the rocks we humans give are usually prettier but yes they seem to imitate us thats why biology is so fascinating i see us in them even krill she laughed its hard to love krill which drift in the ocean like aimless clouds but whales we know so little about them except their magnificence did you know some can dive more than an hour more than two kilometers deep hart wondered whether shed learned that from the book jurgen had given her with a slight air of irritation he gestured toward the political liaison and his men inspecting a nearby glacial fissure what do you think of them claiming the whales home she shrugged such a claim lets people like me do science and jurgen says that if germany doesnt act some other nation will in fact other nations have the british the norwegians you americans the argentines the chileans everyone planting flags hart nodded reluctantly i suppose youre right still drexler seems so arrogant about it all germany this germany that so damned serious he just made a joke with the penguins hes not as severe as you think and youre pretty intense yourself no talk of home or family or sports do you know what i think you two dont like each other because youre too much alike both loners both rigid in your opinions both interested in well very alike she flushed a bit hart was miffed by the comparison i just find him selfimportant claim this icebox for what no one can really live here the weather is fine today but wait for the first storm the darkness of winter its insane then why are you here to explore to fly not to give a hitler salute to penguins maybe jurgen can see humor where you cant she retorted hes not so bad if youd get to know him and he befriended me i had a a mentor a professor who was killed in a car crash and i had no support in my career as a woman no means to establish myself at a university and then i met jurgen and suddenly i was offered this job in antarctica god the opportunity i could have kissed him and hes sincere in his dreams you never listen to him with an open mind did you did i what kiss him no no and what if i did its none of your business after that party you have to wonder what his motive is in having you aboard good biology her voice was flat i know youre a good biologist but just see him for what he is how dare you her temper was rising who did you kiss to get your berth on the schwabenland you haul this checkered past on board with you and then act superior and condescending about a scientific mission a political mission both hart sighed she was angry and defensive and he knew he was making a mess of the situation that he was alienating a woman who fascinated him pursuing a woman who could only bring trouble look im sorry i i just dont want to see you hurt my friendships are none of your business lets drop it i couldnt care less what you think he looked at her hopelessly greta please im not criticizing you but she was stalking away on the beach he could see jurgen waiting a narrow look of curiosity on his face hart thought greta would cool down by the time they returned to the launch but she sat in the bow away from him close to drexler leaning close to whisper to the german feder grinned at the pilot great owen thought his ineptness would be the talk of the ship he was told by the coxswain to take an oar because some of the german ss troops were staying on the beach to exercise their snow skills he complied pulling as hard as he could with his back to the german couple they began to fly the initial reconnaissance was simple the dornier wal the pilots had dubbed boreas to the west passat to the east each rocketing off the catapult to soar like giant petrels hart recognized none of the geography they were in an unexplored area east of the weddell sea below the atlantic ocean and africa but he found himself playing a useful role in his advice on icing weather patterns the dangerous downdrafts off the mountains and the importance of careful navigation the immensity of antarctica unexpectedly intimidated the german pilots within minutes of their launching the planes seemed swallowed in the wildest most epic landscape theyd ever seen not only was there no town or road or light or landmark there never had been in all of human existence they were the first of their species to see this hostile shore the flights were mostly in clear calm weather not unusual during antarcticas high summer of december and january hart and feder would often have a chance to accompany them the pilot working on his own launchings and landings they began sketching out maps feder sometimes giving names that seemed sure to curry favor the hitler range mount goring goebbels glacier bismarck bay the german pilots seemed particularly interested in anchorages and adjoining bits of snowfree land sometimes after they discovered one the schwabenland worked around the coast to it threading its way past towering bergs and through patchy pack ice hart realized they were looking for a harbor to return to drexler used a word he had apparently picked up from hitlers speeches or writings lebensraum living room heidens greatest fear was the unpredictable ice sometimes pack ice skidded before a breeze one way while the larger deeper icebergs perversely went the opposite because their underwater bulk was being pushed by ocean currents the schwabenland was not a true icebreaker and could make progress only by searching out openings or leads the pilots scouted for them look for a rain squall hart told the aviators at one point its too cold to rain in antarctica kauffman objected its the reflection of open water on an overcast sky the ice shines light back up onto the clouds and makes them whiter than they are but the dark open water throws a patch of shadow it looks like an approaching storm but go that way and youll find a lead or polynya thereafter the germans began making their way through the ice with more confidence the most bizarre part of each flight came when the airplanes reached the farthest point of their range it was then that the mystery of at least some of the crates was solved each morning the sailors would load one into a dornier inside were fourfootlong metal stakes with a small flattened oval and engraved swastika at one end this will substantiate our claim that we saw these lands before any other nation drexler solemnly told the pilots drop them at the far limit of your penetration theyre designed to fall point down and stick into the ice hart could barely restrain himself from laughing out loud at the conceit but he found that as aerial observer it was often his job to drop the damned things the pilots would signal at the appropriate moment and hed have to crank open a side hatch to a blast of shrieking air watching through his goggles as the stakes tumbled until they were lost in ice glare afterward he could see no evidence of their existence he suspected theyd simply been engulfed by the snow but the pilots didnt care so long as the stakes were gone meanwhile greta ignored owen fine he thought im exhausted from the constant flying anyway let drexler entertain her sometimes when returning to the ship in a dornier hed spot her in the launch dragging a net or hauling up water shed come in late wet and cold and go wordlessly to her laboratory with her samples she was quieter and more distracted at mealtimes only summoning the energy to smile wanly at drexler during his monologues about greater germany and a thousand year reich fritz had been right hart was weary of the speeches if jurgen tried any harder the pilot thought hell break a sweat chapter ten a storm moved in a pale sky taut as a balloon was invaded by a great scudding fleet of storm clouds and landmarks were devoured the schwabenland prudently dropped anchor and waited out the wind midsummer snow giving a wintry cast to the decks ice rasped and clanked by as heiden brooded on the bridge the weather provided a welcome respite from flying and hart seized the opportunity to nap the hiatus also gave him time to think however and it bothered him that he thought so much about greta he scarcely knew her he wanted to avoid being distracted by her yet he couldnt get her out of his mind he didnt understand it she had none of the california glamour of audrey half the time the woman simply upset him yet he missed her company the ease of talking with her the surprise of what she would say and cursed himself for both missing it and being an ass every time he was around her then new years came they stayed up late in the officers mess drinking toasts to by candlelight and playing scratchy records some of them american on the ships sole phonograph to amerika a boozy feder offered to the crucible of history and our fuhrer an equally tipsy drexler added to peace on earth greta said there was a grunted assent from the males to antarctica the last untouched place said hart he surreptitiously studied gretas face in the candlelight trying to keep from making his fascination too obvious sometimes shed glance at him and seeing him watching her look uncertainly away drexler noticed once and evenly stared at hart a moment before turning back to fill her glass the man hung on her like a cloak and yet she didnt melt into him hart noticed but he could tell the caution frustrated the political officer she sipped champagne but lacked the gaiety shed demonstrated at christmas shed seemed subdued since their quarrel on the beach the champagne aboard had been cooled for the day in the galley refrigerator when a bottle emptied hart decided it was his turn to fetch another he worked his way in the dark past the steel sideboard and hanging pots and opened the door leaning into its pool of light to seize a bottle as he swung around closing the door with his elbow the eclipsing illumination showed greta frozen behind him the door clicked shut i guess we had the same idea she whispered in the dark he hesitated a moment gauging what to say greta he finally decided im just trying to be a friend he heard her sigh owen its not you he waited saying nothing its just me the expedition things are not going exactly as i expected jurgen and i are trying to we knew each other before its complicated im sorry im sorry too she didnt move a shadow in the dark a tremulous breathing what the hell hart thought he reached up the tips of his fingers cold from grasping the champagne he touched her hair then let his fingers brush against her cheek for a moment he thought he heard her heart and then realized it was his own still she didnt move damn he reached around to cup the back of her neck and leaned forward the scent of her filling his senses he hunted for her lips and then he was kissing her a bit awkwardly as she stiffened her own head tilted and she was hesitantly kissing him back her arms still at her side and then she jerked and took a step back you shouldnt have done that and with that she was gone he waited a minute giving her some grace to collect herself and himself time to calm down that was stupid he told himself youre no good at this wheres the champagne a drunken feder was calling hart came slowly back into the mess bearing the bottle and smiling wanly greta was gone so was drexler the men were slumped looking desultory the only woman and she left kauffman said groaning all she does is remind you of what youre missing wheres jurgen hart asked like a hound on a hunt what do you think feder laughed gesturing at the door or like a dog after an auto wondering what to do when he catches it he laughed again they had hangovers the next morning the storm had passed leaving a gray overcast the ship slowly picked its way along the coast aerial exploration suspended only a few even came to lunch hart looked out over the ice before antarctica hed never dreamed that water could freeze in so many different ways there was a litany of navigator names for it anchor ice bare ice brash ice close ice compacted ice deformed ice dried ice fast ice floe ice frazil ice grease ice growler ice hummocked ice ice rind multiyear ice nilas ice rafted ice ridged ice rotten ice shuga ice slush ice strip ice tongue ice this was pancake ice freshly frozen in platters several feet across that looked like giant pancakes the wind had jostled them together so that the edges overlapped like scalloped potatoes some pieces looked dirty and reddish on the bottom the sailors speculated it was dust blown from africa but greta told them it was really algae that grew there something biologists had scarcely thought possible hart sighed listening to her he assumed she was angry and he supposed she had a right to be hed made a presumption without clarifying her feelings he felt like an oaf still he reminded himself shed hesitated before fleeing he missed her the thought of being on board the rest of the voyage and having her avoid him was intolerable if she was committed to drexler that was fine hed hardly expected anything else he enjoyed talking to her however couldnt they at least do that he brooded about it all day turning events over in his mind that evening he went to gretas laboratory intending to apologize for his forwardness taking a deep breath he rapped on the door there was a bang inside as something fell over and then a shuffle of feet just a minute she called somewhat breathlessly hart waited several seconds when she pulled open the door her sweater was rumpled and her hair awry she looked startled to see him owen what is it she half stepped through the door to partly close it behind her the movement wasnt quick enough to shield his view of drexler standing in the shadows of what was a dimly lit room there was an awkward pause hart cursed himself for coming but it was too late to simply leave look he began swallowing i just wanted to say im sorry okay i i was wrong to do that without asking i mean and i dont intend to criticize its germanys expedition your expedition im just along for the ride she blinked oh yes she seemed momentarily confused as to what he was talking about and then when she remembered struggling between having several things to say her mouth opened but nothing came out it was obviously the wrong time sorry to bother you hart felt foolish she was silent giving no encouragement but looking troubled he turned and walked down the passageway what a mess he told himself stick to flying owen he heard her whisper but he kept going the expeditions turn toward disaster began with their return to the air at first the flying was a relief hart welcomed the launching jolt and freezing air as a tonic to shock away his depression the terrain was as schmidt had remarked on the first beach elemental simple without complication or attachment this is what hed come for hart thought the opportunity to come to terms with a place that promised nothing he had to concentrate on that the radio in boreas had gone down and they were using that plane close to the ship but the passat was still flying wide surveys they probed toward a barrier of mountains to the southwest hart dutifully leaning out to drop stakes like motes into a vast white unblinking eye then they headed north to the coast and out over the ice pack kauffman had decided to follow its edge back to the schwabenland as they swung east toward their ship hart looked out at the bergs dotting the cold ocean there was a darker shape among them and he hefted a pair of binoculars curiously it was a ship he focused and his initial impression was confirmed it looked like a whaler hart jostled kauffman on the shoulder and directed him to look the pilot nodded and angled closer peering damn the german muttered it looked like the aurora australis what are they doing this far south so close to the ice hart swung the glasses around searching then he pointed again hunting so wispy as to almost be missed a tendril of spray puffed above the ocean and the waters roiled whales midway between the norwegians and germans kauffman aimed for the foreign ship accelerating slightly he roared over it barely above mast height a couple of seamen instinctively ducking theyre not supposed to be down this far hart the german growled theyre trying to make a point the bastards dont radio we need to discuss this in private the german set course for the schwabenland once on board they sprinted for the bridge the norwegians are just fifty kilometers to the west kauffman reported right down near the ice theres a pod of whales between us and them icebergs all around its far below their normal hunting range instead of commenting heiden turned to drexler and waited the political liaison frowned pondering i dont care what that bearded viking said he told the captain he wouldnt risk the ice just to chase whales in this region hes shadowing us making a point perhaps or looking for the bergen maybe hes just hunting hart offered hunting and posturing drexler turned to feder was our rendezvous before christmas planned do you think is he trying to track us no it was fortuitous coincidental the ocean is vast our timing uncertain but hes smart and curious do we know something he doesnt are whales down here he trails us he looks for whales why not if hunting elsewhere is as poor as he claims how many whales asked greta who had also come to the bridge she looked at hart what kind does it matter drexler asked they must have swum this far south to feed she said excited it would be interesting to see what theyre preying on to sample for krill drexler considered this then he looked at heiden we cant permit him to come after us dropping flags confusing dates of first claim muddling our authority you know that the captain nodded unhappily we cant but we must were not at war jurgen the sea is unclaimed he can prowl where he wishes nonsense take a german trawler to norwegian fishing grounds and youll not hear them braying such nonsense they simply act to protect what is theirs we must do the same if were to fulfill our duty to the reich heiden looked wary what do you want to do drexler nodded toward greta sample krill he said decisively at the pod krill yes krill i want to cut him off he looked at greta calculating he cant hunt if were at the pod first doing scientific research we can save these whales for future breeding help greta do her research and send a message that this is no longer a profitable whaling ground all at the same time this is ultimately why we came here konrad to make our interests plain jesus said hart cut him off did you get a look at that guy i dont think hes the type to take interference lightly do you think i am drexler said he glanced again at greta im not afraid of a bunch of damned fish eaters im not afraid of accomplishing my mission greta was watching them uncertainly whats your plan simple enough our ship between theirs and the whales you in a boat sampling krill observing behavior whatever you wish were here for science yes it sounds risky hart objected historys lesson is that its inaction that is risky the pilot looked at greta waiting for her to say no i do want to see the whales she said instead hesitantly looking at her fellow germans hart shook his head but what if the norwegians i want our time down here to mean something she said jurgen is right hart bit his lip irritated at her choice but reminded by her manner that he was the foreigner all right its your expedition drexler nodded exactly he turned to heiden assuming an air of command set course now the captain gave a short hesitant nod as you wish he barked some orders the ship began to turn and pick up speed hart was surprised at the deference to the political liaison its best to hurry feder said the barometric pressure is dropping a threat of bad weather jurgen will we get there in time greta asked its late in the day ill do my best he laid a rule against the chart then glanced up at the pilots good eyes reinhard and you too hart but now i suggest you adjourn to the galley were going to be busy up here making clear the new order of things the pair retreated down the companionway a bit presumptive isnt he asked hart i thought he was an advisor suddenly hes acting like an admiral this is an issue of territory owen the german pilot replied when reich politics are at stake we turn to our major in the ss chapter eleven the norwegian whaler was leaking blood it was late in the day the sun sinking into a chill haze and the wind slowly rising the schwabenland rolled uneasily in the growing swell hart feeling slightly ill as he stood at the rail and studied the carcass being towed behind the aurora australis the whales body had been pumped full of compressed air to keep it afloat and its tail rose and fell in the swells with a doleful wave leaving a trail of scarlet jansen had struck at the pod now a boat was fastening a flag to the beast and the norwegian was cutting the whale loose to drift for later recovery his ship began to leave a broader wake as it accelerated aiming for the survivors aiming toward greta heinz hart had gone out on deck after another frustrating encounter on the bridge the norwegians and germans had arrived at the whales at almost the same time jansen swinging away to hunt down a stray at the edge of the pod as the germans slowed to a drift while considering what to do the norwegians harpoon had made a crack clearly audible across the icy sea drexler watched unhappily mentally calculating how far he dared push the situation are we too late asked feder in answer the feeding whales swam past the german ship as if instinctively seeking shelter water roiling when they surfaced suddenly the schwabenland was interposed between hunter and hunted it appears not decided drexler he picked up the radio this is the schwabenland calling aurora australis were conducting a scientific survey of this pod of whales and your hunting is disrupting our investigation we request that you depart immediately im sorry my friends sigvald jansens voice crackled back we got here first drexler considered a moment these are now german territorial waters by right of exploration and formal claim he tried the hell they are we follow the rules of the whaling convention and no other havent you heard of freedom of the seas jansen clicked off ignoring further calls the germans looked at each other greta do you know what kind of biological study you want to conduct here heiden asked to sample for krill and observe the whales behavior from the motor launch can some sailors get me close i think so hart had come back up from the galley uneasy at the idea of putting greta out on the sea lets think about this he cautioned again youre going to put her out there in an open boat with this sigvald jansen firing his harpoon gun only to establish that were doing legitimate scientific research drexler said a note of scorn in his voice theres no danger hart if thats what has aroused your famed prudence were simply establishing our legitimate claim to this pod im worried about her not us shes the one at risk its all right owen greta assured the whales are shy that whaler isnt what if we have a confrontation then well win and the fish eaters will go home drexler said he turned to greta dont listen to hart these whalers wont come near you or your whales i suspect that with us on the scene theyll content themselves with their one kill and go back to their factory ship if not well warn them off with the schwabenland our ship is twice their size i still think this is a needless confrontation the pilot insisted and i think you were hired to provide technical advice not opinions drexler retorted he turned again to the biologist greta this is your decision she watched the whales her face becoming determined i want to go this is the kind of observation i came to antarctica to make i just dont want a fight the whole point of this is to avoid future fights by making clear our position greta theres no need for this hart tried weve been pinned to the coast conducting your aerial exploration owen she replied youve had your chance and this is mine she turned to drexler ill go fetch my nets hart unhappily watched her go your bravado could put that woman in danger only if your timidity prevents my protecting her from that danger why dont you stay off the bridge if our course disturbs you now she and the launch were a speck following the ephemeral blowhole mist and sigvald jansen far from being satisfied with one whale was pointing on the same course the schwabenland began to pick up speed too circling some icebergs as it tried to maintain a barrier hart found himself alone on deck the mountaineering troops were staying out of sight and the crew was busy driving the ship he was uneasy at the nearness of the icebergs carved into baroque castles by sun and wind some were sharpened to points others undercut by caves still more constructed of arches and buttresses in the growing overcast they looked opaque and dull rocking on the sea with nodding menace fritz came to the rail with a thermos and hart scented coffee i see weve made a detour the german said more like a wrong turn hart accepted a cup drexler wants to claim whales as well as a continent so were chasing fish and if norwegians are anything like alaskans all hell is going to break loose when we try to interpose the schwabenland between sigvald jansen and his whales serve him right it was unclear who fritz meant meanwhile the only woman in a thousand miles is out there in an open boat thanks to our crazy political liaison is he so crazy now the woman requires rescue hart looked at the sailor sourly so this idiocy is a mating game simply human nature at its baldest owen jesus the pilot let the coffee steam play across his face drexlers version is that germany is just trying to get its rights back germanys just trying to get its balls back especially one german you know owen you shouldnt have embarrassed him in the plane not in front of greta he had it coming if he wasnt so arrogant like this little stunt here he wouldnt get embarrassed fritz gave hart a long look everyone everywhere trying to get their balls back right there you have all of human history hart laughed even at himself male history fritz shook his head human history at first jansen appeared to be turning away either to leave or chase another whale at the periphery of the pod then as if thinking better of it he swung again and began throwing up an arcing bow wave as his whaler cut through glassy swells a norwegian sailor at the bow bracing himself against the shoulder struts of the harpoon he was heading right for the heart of the pod straight for the motor launch with greta my god said feder on the bridge hes making for the woman he thinks well back down and flee heiden assessed a foolish assumption said drexler ill be damned if im going to let him come close to greta he bent to the intercom that was connected to the engine room full speed ahead full speed were going to push those arrogant sons of bitches all the way back to norway jurgen youre going to risk collision no the voice was cold he risked collision and now hes going to be forced to turn away the final german surge sent an excited shudder through every rivet of the ship hart had gone to the bow to watch and the full powering of the engines made the deck tremble beneath his feet black smoke boiled out of the schwabenlands stack and greta and the sailors in the motor launch were steering hurriedly out of the way yet the charging whalers seemed oblivious to the approaching german seaplane tender hart glanced back upward at the bridge he could see drexler up there against the glass grimly determined his eyes reflecting the mental calculation of his navigation heiden was less visible in the shadows watching from his chair across the water gretas motor launch was abandoning the whales the pilot looked ahead again one ship or the other would give way would have to norwegian sailors began appearing at the rails of their whaler waving the germans off or shaking their fists yet the schwabenland didnt waver thrusting forward like a roman ram closer and closer the whaler loomed the norwegians becoming more and more distinct their features distorted by anger or fear the harpoonist looking anxiously first at a targeted whale and then at the racing research ship more than a hundred feet longer than his own vessel the water separating the two shrank to a lake a pond a moat hart could see the streaks of rust on the aurora australis a deck gutter stained with blood jesussss he seized the decks anchor chain for support jansen finally swerved it was too late to avoid a collision but the blow was more glancing the whaler swelled to fill everything hart could see and then there was a great echoing boom and a howl of metal as the two hulls hit and ground against each other despite his grip the pilot was knocked sprawling back over the anchor chain the growling screech went on and on the bow of the whaler slithering along the side of the bigger research ship the norwegians being bulldozed off course then they were past the aurora australis out of speed and bobbing in their wake the harpoonist apparently knocked from his perch there were howls of triumph on the german bridge the schwabenland began to circle back to pick up greta who was waving frantically the whaler appeared to be backing off hart ran angrily up the outside ladder to the bridge drexler was occupied on the radio but he glanced up at the american with irritation the sound of jansens curses were crackling over the speaker his voice a rage fucking krauts the norwegian roared look what youve done to my ship you nazi bastards the germans instinctively turned to see the whalers bow was slightly crumpled and its side hull was bruised the plates showing a ripple in the dull light discoloration from the scraping ranged from bare metal to red undercoating to the schwabenlands own green hull paint that was insane hart shouted silence barked heiden in no mood for criticism his prussian features could have been carved out of stone his voice forged in the cold of the polar plateau but captain for gods sake enough jansen was still apoplectic on the radio you sausageheaded lunatics he roared youll pay for that pay every damned pfennig and oslo will make sure your bosses have your hide in twenty years at sea that was the most outrageous dangerous arrogant drexler cut him off it was your bow that struck our side captain he snapped a commercial vessel interfering with the mission of a scientific research ship trying to force its way into our sample pod of whales a violation of every rule of safe navigation we will file a diplomatic complaint about your whaling in german territorial waters offshore from a clear german claim youd already been informed of fuck you with a horses dick the radio went dead drexler smiled in triumph well that little whale hunt was cut short he looked out toward the stern gretas launch was being hoisted aboard and perhaps weve indeed learned what brings the creatures to these icy waters he took a breath i trust our damage was not too severe sailors had come to report we lost some paint heiden summarized greta came hurrying breathlessly into the bridge in boots and oilskins she looked alarmed i thought we were simply going to warn him off i tried drexler said he ignored me my god jurgen i thought you were going to sink both our ships there was never any danger and no need to break off your biological investigation everything is fine he swung around to the pilot as for you hart i must remind you again that youre a hired aerial consultant an american national and have no say and no right to comment on the operation of this ship and i told you to stay off the bridge but owen wasnt listening he was staring out the bridges side windows at the norwegian whaler he isnt giving up he said quietly indeed the aurora australis had renewed its course for the receding whales its bow wave steadily climbing again they could recognize jansen on the wing of his bridge making an obscene gesture unbelievable drexler frowned ridiculous obstinacy well then full speed ahead jurgen no greta said weve made our point the political officer ignored her and picked up the engine room intercom speed dammit i asked for speed jurgen youve made your gesture quiet too late he tried to bite it back she looked stricken he took a breath laboring with his emotions please greta its time to establish claim to these waters and fulfill what the reich minister sent us down here for im not afraid of a few damned whalers well have it out now and then it will be over jurgen she pleaded captain a course to intercept he ordered hart get out the pilot went to the bow again his jaw clenched everyone a damn fool as fritz had said he didnt see the little sailor but the german pilots lambert and kauffman joined him as spectators the ships were racing on more parallel courses this time the schwabenland angling toward the norwegian whaler and the spume of the whales a gossamer lure to the surging vessels the sky continued to darken and the horizon was shrinking snow hart predicted to himself the german ship was straining to cut the aurora australis off again the gap of water narrowed between them but more slowly this time the harpoonist was back hart saw and the side of the whaler that had sustained damage was facing away like a recurring nightmare nothing seemed to have changed the collision seemed doomed to happen all over again then jansen appeared on his bridge wing like a huge black crow oilskins flapping in the wind he lifted his hands in warning he had a gun a rifle or shotgun hart looked up at the bridge greta was gone drexler appeared calm looking at the norwegian with amused scorn the two ships came closer the foamy black water between them like a rushing chute they were going to collide again jansen aimed get down hart shouted lunging for kauffman there was a rattle like hail and a boom snatched away by the wind the noise reaching them after the pellets had the norwegian had fired lambert had fallen on top of them howling shit oh damn damn damn damn hed been hit there were bright drops of blood on the deck and the pilots parka was pierced by several dark shotgun holes some welling red hart jerked up the gap between the ships was widening the schwabenland finally swerving away the crazy norwegian fired another blast this time toward the bridge hart couldnt see anyone up there and supposed theyd ducked more pellets rang against the steel jesus it hurts lambert groaned then there was a deeper report and then several more the ss mountaineers had emerged with semiautomatic carbines and were firing back now the norwegians were scattering jansen ducking into his bridge and others sprawling on deck either from being hit or in a scramble for cover christ on a crutch hart breathed drexler and jansen had started a war help me owen it was kauffman the german pilot wanted to carry his injured friend below nodding the american took lamberts legs as kauffman did his shoulders and they carried him to a hatchway they could hear heavier bullets striking the schwabenland more of the norwegians were firing back probably with hunting rifles the two pilots accidentally slammed lamberts shoulder into the hatch coaming as they were dragging him through and he yelped in pain for gods sake let me walk to the infirmary you idiots its not that bad unless you finish me off they set him down sorry siegfried kauffman said gasping for breath we werent prepared for this now i have to face that animal doctor schmidt of all the luck the companionway steps rang from pounding feet above and drexler was on top of them breathless and excited you two he shouted at kauffman and hart get to the planes the one with the working radio we need to use the advantage we have youre going to take some of my troops up with you and end this once and for all what kauffman asked we have some grenades some explosives were going to attack from both air and sea and end this as quickly as we can before more germans are hurt hart groaned jurgen youre going to bomb them for christs sake lets break this off before someone gets silence another word from you and ill have you tossed overboard if you dont want a part of this coward then get below ill be damned if im going to bomb fine youre out of it you he pointed at kauffman get the plane warmed up thats an order kauffman had paled jurgen owen is right now dammit they fired first theyre lunatics crazy men do you want more of your shipmates hit kauffman bit his lip agonizing is this an order on the authority of hermann goring and the ss i want it in writing ill carve it in stone now go he nodded unhappily all right go back on the starboard side in case theres more gunfire youll be shielded yes major he left for the plane drexler bounded back up to the bridge hart helped lambert walk down to the infirmary and then stood inside the ship undecided the schwabenland tilted first one way then another swerving as it danced with the norwegians he was tired of being called a coward he walked aft to where the seaplane catapults were the propellers of passat were beginning to spin and the aurora australis appeared headed for them again hart ran to the airplanes hatch and climbed inside looking down the dim fuselage he saw four of the mountaineers crouched there sorting out hand grenades one had a submachine gun everyone has gone mad he thought kauffman was studying his instruments in the cockpit ill copilot reinhard the american offered grimly its wrong to stick you with this lunacy alone the german glanced back and shook his head no get out of the plane owen i appreciate the gesture but better that only one of us has to live with this with any luck ill end this quickly and chase them away if they shoot and hit you they wont all theyve got is a few rifles get out im not leaving dammit get out now now look theyre approaching i need to get us off please hart looked the whaler was looming closer again gunfire crackled for gods sake what was jansen doing he hesitated just a moment longer all right to hell with it let the germans have their war hart dropped out of the planes belly and a sailor slammed the hatchway shut the engine howled and the airplane shivered ready to go hart backed away toward the boreas kauffman glanced outside grinning fiercely and gave a thumbsup beyond the american could see the looming hull of the aurora australis a crewman reached to fire the catapult before he could launch there was another bang and then an explosion the cockpit of the passat disintegrated pieces of metal skittering across the stern deck of the german ship hart was hit with a spatter of blood then the whaler was swerving steeply away leaning a line drawn from the shattered airplane cockpit to the norwegians bow jesus the flying boat had been hit with the whalers explosivetipped harpoon now the flanges of its head were buried in the remains of the cockpit pulling at the dornier reinhard kauffman was dead his remains hurled at hart and the stunned sailors the mountaineers inside were shouting as the plane began to tip a soldier tumbled from its belly then another the passat tore free of its catapult one wing dipping over the schwabenlands side it caught for a moment leaned precariously and then lurched the harpoon line snapped but the pressure had been enough the airplane toppled into the sea with a crash men overboard the cry went up around the ship sailors ran to fling life rings at the bobbing airplane the schwabenlands engines slowed and the ship began a tight turn the two remaining mountaineers popped up in the ocean next to their airplane and swam onto its wing lifeboat man the lifeboat the craft began to be lowered the shattered seaplane was slowly filling the mountaineers sinking with it the wing shining blue as it was enveloped by cold water the lifeboat hit the water with a splash and reached the mountaineers just as the airplane sunk out from under them still looking as if it was trying to fly as it slid into the deep the soldiers were hauled aboard half dead from the shock of the water ice forming on their clothes then with a whoosh and cloud of white steam a crewman released the air pressure on the port catapult its usefulness was over chapter twelve the aurora australis was fleeing and hart assumed the germans would let it go drexler came running back to the stern after the norwegian harpooning wild with frustration he stopped and stared in disbelief at the chaos what happened they speared us one of the sailors said drexler looked at the redstained stern of the retreating whaler who was hurt two of the soldiers almost drowned reinhard is dead the sailors voice was wooden numbed by shock drexlers eyes flitted around nervously what about the other plane no one answered him who could fly the other plane again no answer his gaze jerked around then settled on hart the pilot stared menacingly back at him it was a look that spoke volumes there would be no more flying today that murdering bastard drexler muttered then he turned and ran back toward the bridge as he watched the german leave hart realized he was trembling from reaction reinhard kauffman had unwittingly saved his life by ordering him out of the plane yet what kind of destiny did hart confront now with drexler having created an international incident that was certain to overshadow whatever the expedition had accomplished from the ships motion in the rising swells the pilot could tell they were picking up speed again the added wind was cold he stood up to see the stern was temporarily deserted but he noticed a commotion toward the bow the ss troops were piling loose crates and gear to form a barricade and laying weapons behind it harts chill increased he stiffly climbed up on the catapult to get a better view ahead they were steaming south at full speed into an archipelago of icebergs still chasing the aurora australis its stern a taunting lure the horizon was shrinking as the wind grew feders storm was coming enough is enough hart began walking back to the bridge twice he saw bullet holes brass shell casings rolled and tinkled on the canting deck like strewn toys madness the bridge was a welcome pocket of heat but drexler swung on him immediately i told you to stay away hart ignored him turning to heiden captain as an expedition member with experience in antarctic waters i must protest our speed and course the ice and weather make it entirely unsafe hart i want you below captain heiden was silent captain you know im right youve been in the arctic or ask feder this is risky the gap between the two ships was slowly narrowing a berg the size of a city block slid by on the port side its underwater bulk like a swollen blue cheese were pursuing a criminal hart drexler said a ship which killed one of our company destroyed one of our planes captain heiden please heiden finally swiveled in his chair to address the pilot we cant end it like this or were finished anyway thats better than sinking no it isnt heiden was resigned things have gone too far hart well close in half an hour but what are we going to do if we catch them i dont know he nodded toward drexler the political liaison turned away fixing his gaze on the stern of the whaling ship an ice floe banged against the hull ringing it like a bell barometer is still dropping feder said worriedly into the hush its growing dark hart glanced around the germans avoided his gaze ahead the aurora australis was disappearing into a cold fog flakes of snow drifted down drexler bent to the intercom i need more speed jurgen were not going to be able to see feder warned the liaison nodded two men out on the wings listening for surf on the ice heiden issued the order hart noticed that the helmsman was sweating this is crazy the pilot insisted no one answered the atmosphere was one of controlled fury instead of losing his grip on the group drexler had strengthened it defeated hart clomped down the stairs toward the galley feeling impotent greta was there a mug of tea in front of her staring at the table hart hesitated a moment then got some coffee and slumped into a chair across from her the biologists hair hung around her face like a curtain and her hands were splayed on the surface as if she were examining them for the first time slowly she looked up her eyes were moist whatever had divided the pair was momentarily forgotten i didnt think our sampling would lead to that she said shaking her head in disbelief i didnt think men would go that far hart let her words hang in the air then he said this voyage was always about politics not science wasnt it she looked at him fiercely it was about both you cant separate so neatly its naive to think you can everything we humans do is confused by human relationships thats what made me so angry on the beach that you recognized that element in regards to my own presence aboard of course jurgen made a difference of course hes a reason im here me instead of any of a hundred other biologists that doesnt mean i know what to feel how to behave what standard i can use to judge myself what role ive really played hart inwardly winced she was blaming herself greta youre not responsible for jurgen drexler or sigvald jansen im responsible for me he reached out and placed his hand on hers it was cold to his touch and his was larger like a blanket she didnt pull away we do our best and go on he said the lucky ones know how to pray i had a friend who believed angels sat on your shoulder she laughed at that sounds like my nuns for a moment her thoughts were far away and then the sadness came back but we dont look for magic any longer it seems we look for resources the last word was bitter owen i dont want to help germany hunt whales any longer he held her hand now his fingers against her palm marveling at her fineness he nodded you wont have to i think were about done down here but his sentence was cut off by an enormous boom so loud it was as if they were suspended inside a drum they were jerked off their chairs and hurled onto the deck amid a cascade of splintering crockery and clattering tableware there was a long grating terrifying squeal of tortured metal then the lights went out she felt for him in the dark what happened ice i think they gambled and lost he could hear confused shouts the pounding of feet the slamming of hatches maybe gushing water too or perhaps he was imagining that he struggled to sit up the deck tilt not too severe yet are you all right dim light he noticed still filtered through the galley portholes i think so it hurt but i think so she sat up too holding on to his sweater im sorry im frightened so am i were a long ways from help he was reluctant to leave her touch but he gently moved her hands to her lap for a moment and stood up his feet slid on loose shards of dishes as he staggered to a porthole a wall of ice filled his view the ship groaned as it rose and fell in clumsy embrace with the berg as the ice leveraged a wider gash in the hull the pilot went back to greta and boosted her up her hand in his was electric sensual like an act of sex he could feel his pulse quickening like a schoolboy he thought lets try to get to the bridge he led up the companionway toward the bridge listening to the creak of torn metal and the rattle of skittering debris as the ship rolled then the lights flickered once twice and came back on a sailor was above them and she dropped his hand as if it were hot he noticed now the reassuring thud of the engine it seemed to be shifting from forward to reverse in an effort to move the ship off the ice the expedition officers were clustered around the wheel sailors continued to shout some of the voices pitched unnaturally high the iceberg had slipped away and the schwabenland was backing with a wallow leaning to starboard where they had struck drexler and heiden wouldnt even look at him what went wrong he whispered to feder we heard the surf but not soon enough to stop we were going too fast the captain said the berg must have had a prong of ice that hit us below the steel reinforcing belt at the waterline its the lowest compartments that are flooded where the flotation drums are we sealed the hatches but the drums are banging around down there its not good hart listened even on the bridge he could hear a dull rhythmic drumming of the flotation devices shifting with each wave schmidt had come up from the infirmary anxious and agitated do we send an sos drexler laughed bitterly to who down here the norwegians i suppose theyd think it a trick besides i wont ask those bastards for help until im neckdeep were not desperate yet were not sinking but if they steam away schmidt let the thought hang there they steam away jurgen glanced at greta and then looked down realizing bravado had gone too far she was struggling not to cry the pilot remained quiet there was no need to say anything well whats your plan then schmidts tone was insistent the doctor was not going to be easily deflected drexler was uncharacteristically silent heiden spoke up if we can make the ship seaworthy we can steam for repairs to cape town or montevideo or even the falklands but its almost impossible to do much at sea with ice all around we need a quick harbor the coast an island somewhere to work on a temporary patch if we dont create one we risk having the hull unzip wonderful schmidt said caustically hamburg bay offered feder the first one where we landed too far heiden said and too far into the ice the mainland if we must but an island farther north would be less risky as the season grows late less ice feder bent over a largely blank chart these waters are mostly unexplored greta had closed her eyes the plane it was drexler yes heiden said the boreas we still have one airplane well use it to find a refuge the captain shook his head weve got one pilot dead another wounded the barometers still dropping its night even if we could get a plane off i dont know if it could fly in this weather or if we could recover it could it land amid this ice in these seas i doubt it there was a silence for a moment the shouts of the sailors echoing up to the bridge it could land in the harbor hart said half wishing hed stayed quiet heiden turned to him what good would that do ill find a harbor let you know where it is land there and wait for you the radio is down ill drop directions coordinates to the ship ive dropped things before drexler studied him suspiciously theres only one flaw in this plan schmidt said what if you dont find a harbor in this storm then you have to try to land out here amid the ice on the ocean maybe youll make it maybe not hart nodded thats the flaw all right greta looked at him worriedly there has to be a better way the pilot looked at drexler unfortunately there isnt heiden considered its the best gamble considering the welfare of the entire crew how do we know youre not going to fly off to the norwegians drexler said hart laughed they already harpooned one plane you think im going to let them within range of the other i was there when reinhard died it wasnt pretty he looked hard at the german besides i have friends on board the schwabenland he nodded toward greta youve emergency food heiden said lines and anchor but you need someone to help you search drop the message secure the plane your little friend fritz perhaps hart nodded if he volunteers no it was drexler taking a breath ill go i took the risk and lost now i need to try to get us out ill fly with hart heiden frowned we know you dont like to fly jurgen i dont and hart doesnt like to fly in this kind of weather hes going because he must and im going because i must well hunt together and survive or die together he looked defiantly at the american well that would be one satisfaction the pilot thought taking him with me together hart agreed aloud the brief summer dusk will start to lighten again in a couple hours well launch as soon as we can see chapter thirteen the schwabenland was sluggish weighted down with hundreds of tons of seawater it had settled several feet some of its portholes awash from passing swells the ships lean tilted the catapult takeoff would be awkward hart told heiden to put the stern in a slow arc once the flying boats engines were at full power giving him a choice of wind direction and ice conditions to launch into hed signal the catapult operator the best moment for release no one had slept tension was too high while the solstice was past the long days of january still prevailed in the southern hemisphere by three am hart judged it light enough to go heiden said he was going to slowly steam due north after launch to get clearer of the ice and the pilot nodded saying he could find them again on that track keep the running lights burning drexler climbed stiffly into the seaplane without saying a word hart glanced over at the empty catapult that had held the passat the deck had been swabbed of blood but thered been no ceremony to mark kauffmans passing now drexler was uncharacteristically quiet he sat firmly cinched in the copilot seat staring out the canopy but no doubt seeing only the events of the last few hours hart didnt want his new flying partner to freeze up listen jurgen i credit your courage for coming along the pilot grudgingly offered as he checked his instruments i know you dont like airplanes and this isnt ideal flying but the dornier is a tough tough craft we should be fine there was a long silence and hart thought maybe drexler was paying no attention then the german finally replied do you really think i care what happens to me right now i only want to find shelter for schwabenland my fear or lack of it is inconsequential after my error he swallowed i tried and failed all i have left is duty just what we need romantic fatalism hart thought fine but i still have my hide and your duty is to help me keep it so keep a lid on the german stoic crap please and try to help us survive drexler refused to turn to look at him and if you vomit do it in the head or you can walk home the nazi swung around then if you do any of your damned aerial acrobatics i will make sure i vomit on you harts mouth set into its characteristic half grin of tension i see we understand each other contact there was a barking cough and then a roar as the engine came to life the pilot ran it to full power and gave a thumbsup answered by the catapult crew the stern began to slowly pivot and the american spotted an icefree lane in which they could put down if anything went wrong the waves dangerously heaving when they were almost centered his thumb went up again there was the bang the hiss the jolt and then they were off the ship awkwardly tipped a moment because of the lean of the stern dipping a wing toward black water then climbing banking to skim past a massive iceberg the familiar feeling of liberated exhilaration came back hart wished he had fuel to fly all the way to america theyd decided to search eastward since the ship had yet to explore that way the problem was visibility towers of cloud were everywhere leaking snow from long black tendrils a milky haze hung on the sea hart looked over at drexler his skin wasnt green but the germans hands still clutched the seat and cockpit rim hart rapped on the compass to get his attention start counting if they were going to find the ship again the political liaison would have to keep scrupulous track of their direction speed and winds to allow them to deadreckon where they were in relationship to the schwabenland drexler swallowed hard blinked and then bent to get paper and stopwatch he was sweating slightly but favored hart with a wan expression of reassurance the plane hit an air pocket and sickeningly dropped drexlers hands dropped with it seizing the seat and spilling his clipboard then the plane rose again bouncing and his mouth set in a firm line of determination this time the german picked up the clipboard and began writing the pen shook slightly but he did it they flew in silence for a while hart realized he was sweating too despite the cold there was a very real chance theyd find nothing and the germans would have to try to limp across the stormiest waters in the world in a punctured ship worse he and drexler might be unable to get back aboard he could see little but gray overcast these were the conditions he always feared a featureless blankness that swallowed planes whole drexlers needless showdown may already have doomed them you dont like us very much do you it was startling to have the quiet broken the germans voice was flat who us the germans national socialists hart considered a moment maybe he decided to be honest maybe i just dont like you yes thats obvious many people dont i know im not popular respected perhaps but not popular im serious obsessed with my work with the party with germany people resent that dont understand it they know im not like them that im not content with competent mediocrity hart looked over at him you just need to stop trying to carry the world on your shoulders thats all drexler smiled of course and yet at some point we all carry that which we might rather not because its become a part of us yes hart sighed we all struggle with who we are jurgen but i dont think ramming a ship and starting a battle is excused by ones personality nor is it the best way to win friends and influence people you know a book on that subject came out recently an american book maybe you should read it ha americans obsessed with friends with popularity so much that they write and read books about it yet i dont think youre popular either hart maybe i havent read the book no i would guess not one trick in this book i suspect is to figure out why people truly dont like you you sound like youre trying to figure that out whether in other words it is really me they dont like or something else a jealousy an envy a desperate longing to belong belong to what a cause a country a purpose now hart gave a short laugh envy of black shirts and skull insignia and silver daggers the trouble with you nazis is that youd rather be feared than liked theres no menace intended youre referring to the uniform of our hitler guard our schutzstaffel mountaineers its simply an elite unit like your american marines the marines dont dress like gangsters or pirates thats naive every strong nation has its fierce traditions similar uniforms and insignia were worn by some of the elite prussian regiments that fought napoleon the swastika is a medieval design theres nothing sinister simply pride in the order and discipline that we stand for too much pride thats why kauffmans dead and our ship half sunk thats why i dont like you jurgen nazi pride no owen its something else and you know it you envy my sense of purpose of belonging even if you wont admit it to yourself the pilot didnt reply the island when they found it seemed so favorable in its geography that hart would later have an eerie sense of predestination it initially loomed like a cloud bank so illdefined that the pilot was inclined to dismiss it when drexler first pointed hesitantly in that direction as they neared however parts of the cloud took on rigid definition and what had seemed to be mist was suddenly revealed to be a hard ridge of snow a mountain rose out of the cold gray sea ice girdling its rocky coastline hart flew cautiously trying to discern the islands outline in its shroud of swirling cloud he made a long circuit and identified two peaks a dozen miles apart presumably connected but the islands lower reaches were too fogged to be sure drexler was intently scanning the coastline his unease in the air forgotten by the excitement of finding land i dont see a bay yet he reported im going to fly over the top to look for a break in the cloud we might bump a couple of times the overcast was thick enough that hart was quickly blind the plane jostled in the turbulent air and the pilot prayed hed climbed high enough that they wouldnt slam into an unseen peak a strong updraft hit the dornier and the pilots nose tightened whats that drexler sniffed sulfur a moments bewilderment gave way to understanding volcano i think were passing over it they came out of their own cloud and looked down at others it was as if the island was in a cocoon then a curtain of overcast parted to reveal a curving knifelike ridge with a crest of dark rocks like stitching on the snow the rim of another volcano beyond it the overcast thinned further water then snow again what the hell hart circled clouds teased them swirling in and out but slowly the terrain revealed itself like a series of snapshots part of the island was a crater a volcanic crater filled with water and at one point on the wall thereno clouds again yes a slot led from the caldera to the sea torn apart at one side by a violent explosion the old crater formed a bay of the southern ocean it was the snuggest harbor hart had ever seen a bowl with a gate perfectly protected from storm if the sea channel and lagoon were deep enough the schwabenland could obtain ideal shelter drexler uncharacteristically whooped and pounded on harts shoulder we found it then it was gone again shrouded by storm hart looked at the fuel gauge they might just make it can you find the ship again the german nodded newly determined of course with purpose the old confidence was returning he studied his notes steer westnorthwest for two hundred and eleven kilometers he peered down at the whitecaps on the ocean we still cant land can we hart shook his head the wind would flip us like a toy before they could pick us up we need to find the ship drop instructions and get back to that crater before we run out of fuel i wish these planes had a spare radio drexler nodded already planned for next years expedition the galley had prepared three old flour sacks as aerial bombs filling them with dried peas for weight drexler calculated the islands direction and distance from the schwabenland copied it three times and inserted each in a sack and tied it up hart flew on through squalls the seaplane rattling fuel slowly eroding always looking for the ship at drexlers calculated rendezvous point they were flying in milk he dropped to three hundred feet to get below the ceiling no such luck he swung north christ it was the german the tooth of a towering iceberg passed just beneath the belly of the plane cant you pull up hart not if were going to find the ship then they broke clear and there it was tilted to starboard in a stormy sea streaked with foam its lights blazing as requested waves were throwing spray across the catapult deck get ready hart said ill pass over aim for the stack drexler nodded crawling back to the hatch there was a shriek of wind as he opened it the american approached the ship from its starboard side tiny figures waving he shot by at two hundred feet banked hard and the first bomb whizzed briskly past the smokestack and made a neat splash in the sea damn one fewer pot of pea soup on the way home drexler crawled back up i missed lets try again ill come in lower up the length of the ship he began to turn the stern of the ship came into view again come on hart breathed to himself it worked with ramona let go just before we reach the stern this time the pilot aimed his airplane directly for the stack determined to just barely clear it as he flew the length of the ship he roared over close enough that some of the sailors ducked yes he circled a group had clustered around the sack of dropped peas and then waved madly the hatch shut and drexler came back his face raw with cold perfect hit he said grinning one to spare he held up the third message sack save it until we get to a post office hart turned to the east again glancing at the fuel gauge one third left the german handed him the course and coordinates all business now his fear of the airplane under control good job jurgen the partnership gave him new respect for the man and good flying the german allowed the message aboard my stomach intact maybe gods on our side after all well know that when we put down inside that lagoon the island was not difficult to find on the return trip the overcast was breaking up and the volcanic shape became more distinct as they neared there were two main mountains hart saw the crater with its harbor and behind it a higher steeper narrower volcano with a wispy plume of steam coming off the top ridges and valleys connected the two and glaciers stuck out from the flanks like tongues feeding ice into the sea the crater looked too deep and narrow to fly into from above so he dropped to fifty feet and aimed for the slot in the volcanos flank skimming the wave tops no second chances the gas gauge was on empty the pilot hoped winds wouldnt blow them into the cliffs eruptions of spray were coming off rocks near the narrow entrance the seaplane passed over a small flat berg a sapphire in an otherwise monochrome world the engine coughed and the plane dipped an instant its propeller on fumes dont give up yet then they were in the slot through the side of the crater water welling up from the ocean swells below to curdle with foam wet basalt cliffs on either side spray spattering the canopy and on into the foggy caldera its shorelines shrouded the surface relatively calm hart dropped the seaplane quickly the floats skidding with a hiss they were safe the boreas at heel its nose slowly rotated looking for a place to tie up my god it was drexler he was looking back toward the caldera entrance hart turned too the airplane slowly pivoting in that direction the engine coughed again then caught come on baby just a bit more the pilot stared there against the shore its bow reaching vainly toward the harbor entrance was a halfsunken snowencrusted ship its stern underwater as if pulled down while trying to escape fog and flakes of snow whipped past its icecoated superstructure at its bow like a menacing figurehead was the muzzle of a harpoon pointed to the cliff face above i think weve found the missing bergen the german said the norwegians never came off this island chapter fourteen hart taxied the plane toward the wrecked ship jurgen theres a line in the nose compartment youre going to have to get out on the float tie it to the plane and then jump for the ship when i taxi over the sunken afterdeck be careful can you manage that i can manage the careful part i cant swim he bent to fetch a rope the derelict whaler actually proved ideal as a moorage point the seaplanes pontoons slid shallowly over its halfdrowned deck a wing tip just clearing some stanchions drexler leaped nimbly caught a railing and braked the aircraft hart swiftly shut down the stuttering propeller starved of fuel anyway then he came out the hatch grinning i guess god showed up for us after all pulling up their parka hoods and tugging on their mittens the two men stood on the ships slippery deck and looked around the caldera was easily two miles across hart guessed maybe more the swirling mist revealing no other sign of human habitation yet their protection from the storm was complete they were in a natural amphitheater in which the swells surging in from the caldera entrance quieted to a moderate chop it was a perfect natural harbor hitler luck drexler shouted the sound echoing away he sucked in the cold air obviously delighted to be out of the stuffy airplane his earlier gloom had evaporated what a supreme shelter for a base not yet recorded on any maps hart could imagine the mans sudden calculation of possibilities for rehabilitation heroic sea battle against foreign rivals discovery of an ideal harbor mapping of a continent sighting of whales assuming the schwabenland followed to pick them up i wonder what happened to this ship the pilot said they looked up the sloping deck one lifeboat still hung in its davits but its cover was off its hull filled with snow the other was missing uncoiled lines snaked down the deck twisted and frozen icicles hung off the bridge it looked like the whaler had been abandoned in a hurry lets check inside drexler said the first hatchway was so thoroughly rusted that the two of them together couldnt budge it a second yielded with a squeal of metal hart peered through the opening the interior was dim illuminated only by pale light from iceencrusted portholes he stepped over the coaming the deck was slick with frost there was utter silence this gives me the creeps its only a boat drexler replied he pushed his way to the front glad for a chance to reassert his leadership the cabin doors were closed and they were reluctant to try them but there was a companionway up to the bridge this way the german said it was as cold inside as out their breath steaming as they climbed the ships dying tilt making the stairs even steeper the wooden door to the bridge was also closed but drexler leaned grunting and it scraped open to push back a drift of powdery snow a window had shattered and let the weather in the german stepped through he was silent a moment then god in heaven hart followed and saw what drexler was staring at there was a body in the captains chair it was leaning backward mouth open back curved one leg straight out caught in a rictus of pain something a skua maybe had pecked out the eyes before the corpse had frozen solid now it was mummified by the dry cold a cap gone to reveal a wisp of hair on a balding head the skin had dried a deep brown spotted by black boils on the face the mouth its lips pulled back to reveal yellow teeth displayed the look of a man whod died quickly but not quickly enough in agony jesus hart murmured his breath making a cloud to confirm his own continued vitality what happened to him drexler gingerly approached some kind of disease i suspect but why is he here on the bridge and not in bed he looked around charts were still on a table stained brown from a toppled mug of coffee and spotted with bird droppings a wall calendar had stopped at december of the antarctic season before sea coats still hung on pegs pencils had spilled he looked at the wheel a brass nameplate greenish now read bergen everything was covered with a rime of ice food poisoning i dont know it doesnt make sense whatever it is i dont want to catch it a boot drexler pointed the german moved to the navigators cubicle leaving tracks in the snow the cubicle was curtained so its light would not destroy the night vision of the helmsman and lookouts pushing the curtain aside they saw that a body was sprawled inside once again the mouth was yawning open the eyes gone the expression one of horror the fingers were curved like claws as if trying to grasp what could no longer be grasped next to it was a dead bird dont touch them drexler advised if they were sick death and cold should have contained any germs but theres no need to take chances certainly something bizarre happened here and why the sinking what happened to the bergen who knows they could have hit one of those rocks when entering or trying to leave the harbor perhaps survivors were trying to scuttle her perhaps she was tied up and leaked after the crew died he took a deep breath at least it doesnt smell a benefit of antarctica yes hart wanted to go back to the airplane but drexlers curiosity was obviously aroused he insisted they explore further the galley was a tableau of shadows that wavered in watery light some dishes had slid off the tables and broken on the deck as the stern of the ship sank but others still remained bearing frozen leavings of halfeaten meals dirty pots were heaped in the sink cupboard doors hung open one dribbling a leakage of flour from a mysteriously torn sack there was another body in the pantry reaching on the deck below two cabins were empty but a third held a corpse his spine was hideously bent his frozen remains rigid feet on his bunk and head on the floor whatever had struck the ship had been monstrous farther aft seawater lapped corridors leading to the hold and engine rooms it was chill to the touch but apparently warm enough not to freeze over drexler nodded as if he somehow understood such calamity amazing he led the way back there was a moment of anxiety when confusion led them to try the rusted door again to the outside deck and they couldnt budge it a feeling of entrapment but then they walked to the other hatchway and got out on deck again breathing deeply my god hart said a plague you think perhaps but from where in this icebox drexler studied the snowdusted pumice slopes of the crater no antarctica is far too cold i think food poisoning perhaps something from a fish or whale who knows maybe schmidt or greta will have an idea but i think we should restrict access to this ship hart nodded hed no desire to go back inside the pilot would feel better when the schwabenland showed up damaged or not the presence of the dead bodies made it seem even lonelier here wind shrieking up on the crater rim he watched tatters of cloud stream across and dive dissolving in the calderas relative warmth and it was warmer here hart realized not just shielded from the wind but slightly less bitter than the open sea or the continent to the south he looked again at the mist on the far shore some was simply fog he knew but some the beach was steaming yes he was sure of it hot water well it was an old volcano the boreas provided a tube of shelter but the airplanes metal skin retained little heat the men had brought blankets and wrapped themselves suddenly realizing how tired they were they hadnt slept for thirtyfour hours what a long nightmarish day it had been the pair ate some cold sausage and bread hart was so exhausted he could hardly think still the long day deserved comment weird isnt it jurgen to find a refuge and then make such a ghoulish discovery like finding life and death at the same time drexler nodded wearily fortune is curious the phrase jogged a memory thats what otto kohl told me when i met him in alaska ah well otto is a survivor its the kind of thing he would say drexler lay back his eyes on the ribbed fuselage ceiling the trick otto told me is to recognize that every obstacle represents new opportunity i try to remember that when things go wrong like now drexler looked at hart with eyes unreadable in the shadows of the fuselage exactly like now and sometimes disaster simply means the end hart thought but he didnt say that it wasnt helpful as the pilot slipped into sleep he felt he was sinking into a well of bottomless water azure and pure a silver mirror above inky darkness below sinking like the stern of the doomed bergen or sinking like the harpooned passat flown into the abyss by the shattered body of reinhard kauffman chapter fifteen damn slop im frozen above the knees and mired in quicksand below youve combined the worst of two worlds owen youve found a subzero bog this is as much fun as a prostitute with castiron underwear you speak from experience fritz the little german dragged on a cigarette no i can simply imagine the worst its a talent like finding the only beach in antarctica thats so warm you wallow in it jesus mud in an icebox hart ignored the ribbing he felt good hed slept and then wakened to find the schwabenland anchored in the volcanic caldera a boat fetched the two aerial scouts for a hot breakfast everyone was jubilant at having found a temporary safe harbor and greta kissed both owen and jurgen on the cheek the relief was quickly undercut by the report of corpses on the bergen of course but the wrecked whaler was also a perverse reminder that the germans werent entirely alone in the world we may be able to salvage items we need for repair heiden said safety was the first question the expedition leaders including greta rowed over to the norwegian ghost ship to investigate the mysterious tragedy at schmidts insistence they went gloved and masked against possible disease dont touch anything you dont have to he warned hart was content to watch them go wanting no part of a return to the gloomy bergen instead he volunteered to explore the island for other clues to the whalers fate now he was off the cramped ship and on the crater beach with fritz who in truth seemed to relish the freedom as much as the pilot did the sailors complaint was understandable however the shore was as peculiar as the islands snug harbor it steamed from a seep of hot mineral water that made the black volcanic sand mushy instead of frozen walking was laborious the weather had improved the overcast breaking up hart preferred not risking the boreas in a takeoff in the confined crater it would be safer to wait for a catapult launch out at sea he advised but was willing to climb to the crater rim for a better look at where they were heiden had confirmed when arriving by ship that the island consisted of two major volcanic peaks and the usual mantle of snow and glaciers but knew little beyond that perhaps our mishap will prove fortunate if this sheltered harbor can serve as a future base the captain had mused at breakfast look around with that in mind hart it was the same benefitfromadversity line spouted by jurgen drexler maybe the germans taught it in school cheer up fritz the pilot now said im going to take you out of this mud he pointed to the crater rim at least two thousand feet above them should be good walking once we get on top the little german let his head tilt back to study the snowpatched pumice slope the sheltered caldera and its heat apparently prevented the heavy accumulation of snow normally encountered in antarctica god in heaven he took another drag on his cigarette perhaps youve confused me with those mountain nazis i went to sea to stay out of the infantry my friend no confusion i asked for you because youre the better conversationalist ha a donkeys ass makes better conversation than those robots as if ill have breath to gasp a word anyway exactly every trial has its benefits you germans keep telling me that if youre relying on germans for advice youve been on the ship too long they started up the mud ended immediately but the pumice was like climbing a sand dune their feet slid backward and puffs of ocher dust colored their trousers they began aiming for patches of snow preferring to kickstep their way up frozen crust the ships motor launch had landed them on the western seaward side of the crater harts plan was to climb to the top follow the rim around to where it faced the other volcano giving an interior view of the island and then descend to the opposite eastern crater shore climbing was hard slogging work they shed their parkas and paused frequently to rest the ships shrinking to toys beneath them the schwabenland churned out a steady stream of water the crew had wrapped its breach with canvas to let the pumps get ahead of the leakage but a more permanent repair was required before they returned to sea cold wind at the crater rim swiftly went from refreshing to chilling and they put their parkas back on the ocean beyond the crater was indigo this day dotted with icebergs and fractured platters of sea ice far to the south the mountains of the antarctic mainland formed a serrated wall across the caldera lagoon the peak of the other volcano poked higher than their own still gently steaming the raw beauty the wild emptiness the crisp tug of the air all were like an intoxicating drug to the pilot for a moment life seemed scrubbed clean again the horror of the bergen and the insane battle with the aurora australis could be forgotten gorgeous eh fritz aye the seaman was still breathing heavily though it would be better with palm trees and a stein of beer they started around the crater ridgeline of hardened lava and crusted snow looking down hart saw some of the troops carrying shrouded bodies out of the halfsunken whaler they were ferrying them ashore by longboat the pair reached the opposite side of the rim at noon and sat down to eat and drink the need to fight dehydration reminded hart of the importance of fresh water to any future german base melting snow or glacial ice was laborious here perhaps the earths heat would provide a more convenient source studying that portion of the crater lit by the low antarctic sun he indeed saw liquid water emerging from a point halfway up its inner slope the stream sank back into the pumice before reaching the crater lagoon but the beach beneath steamed with heat theyd take a closer look on the way back down he decided a peculiar valley linked their truncated cone to the higher steeper volcano that still steamed hart had heard talk of antarctic dry valleys but this was the first one hed seen a long cleft between knifelike igneous ridges with a frozen lake at its bottom the surrounding pumice slopes and basalt outcrops looked as barren as mars unlike the rest of the island some combination of wind heat and low precipitation kept the valley almost entirely snowfree it reminded hart of deserts hed visited in arizona i wonder what keeps the snow out elves fritz grunted tired enough to have sprawled on the rocky ridge with his pack for a pillow and his face turned to the chilly sun lava a toll gate who cares you dont want to investigate i dont see any women down there do you wheres your spirit of adventure fritz with my respect for your leadership lost in the first five hundred feet of that damned pumice slope they started back down the inside of the crater rather than aim for the beach where he intended to be picked up hart angled for the silvery cord of the emerging stream it originated from shadow at the base of a rocky outcrop on the crater wall a cave he announced the water emerged from a spring on the crater flank steaming in the cold just behind the small pool was a dark tunnellike opening lava tube it looks like ive seen them in the west magma runs through them and empties out leaving a cave behind so it goes into the mountain fritz asked stinks like it there was a faint odor of sulfur maybe hart took out a tin drinking cup to dip some water gingerly putting his finger in first warm but not too hot then he sniffed making a slight face minerals he offered it to the german smell it fritz was hesitant but did so crinkling his nose bilgewater he looked at the american skeptically we should have greta here to investigate hart said yes to keep you from poisoning us fritz pushed past him im more interested in the cave warmer i suspect he entered the opening it seems to go back a ways cozy despite the stink ow damn rocks hart followed him and stopped to let his eyes adjust to the dimness the sailor was rubbing his shin a number of volcanic stones had been pyramided to build a cairn and fritz had stumbled over it someone has been here before us the pilot said they left a marker wonderful in a place just dark enough that i could break my leg on it no they knew anyone coming to the island would eventually come here to look for water this tube is sheltered from storms a perfect place for what to mark something he looked around at the walls of the cave but saw nothing maybe to call attention to this tunnel or to bury something from the bergen perhaps he scratched with his knife at the soil treasure with new enthusiasm fritz began tossing the rocks to one side dismantling the cairn it was a whaler fritz not a spanish galleon they cached their blubber right here once the rocks were scattered they had to dig only a few inches before striking something metallic it was a steel box a foot square a simple food tin the label was illegible look at the rust the pilot said antarctic air was usually so dry and cold that wood would not rot metal would not rust food would stay frozen you can tell its warmer and wetter here science triumphs again of course i noticed that by putting my parka hood back but then im just a simple sailor hart pried at the box with his knife and it popped open easily no gold coins im afraid he lifted the object out a book he flipped it open and saw handwriting the pages brown with discoloration a notebook or journal he handed it to the german fritz carried the book to the mouth of the cave where the light was better its in norwegian from the bergen no doubt a diary of some kind see the dates hart looked over his shoulder why would they bury a diary the pilot wondered and just our luck that we cant read it i can said fritz slowly i learned when i fished with the norwegians while germany was in the depression it was the only way to scan the newspapers the supply tenders brought out but im as rusty as that tin a dictionary would help i think i saw one in schwabenlands library we did after all expect to meet norwegians down here can you make anything out the seaman flipped idly through i think it talks about the sickness they found here the author was a last survivor a piece of loose paper slipped from the book and hart snatched it before it was carried away by the wind it had just a few large words scrawled in ink he handed it to fritz what does this say the seaman studied it for a moment then looked soberly up at the pilot it says get off the island our island needs a name alfred captain heiden challenged what should we call it the geographer sipped his tea moodily studying the officers gathered after dinner in the schwabenlands mess destruction has occurred to me feder said sourly or cataclysm theyre appropriate for whatever explosion blew off the top of this volcano and created the fissure that let in the sea not to mention the bergen and our current plight my goodness alfred drexler said even the vikings had the sense to name their discovery greenland in hopes others might follow cant we be more optimistic how about opportunity island or at least destination i swear the fates mean us to be here i would agree to termination if it means we can end this expedition and get back to germany before we sink feder replied this harbor feels as snug as a trap to me with that damn ghost ship so nearby thats worse than your first two heiden laughed youre in too bad a mood to name anything all those bodies feder grimaced hart youve been ashore the captain said turning to the pilot owen had already reported the warm beach the view from the crater rim the spring of mineral water and the cave hed decided to keep news of the diary to himself for the moment fritz was trying to read it now in his cabin below any suggestions the pilot shook his head all we saw was pumice and snow and lets face it we dont know yet if this island will prove cozy or hostile the group was quiet a moment all had been disturbed by the wrecked whaler surely the former heiden finally said as hideous as the fate of the bergen appears to be its presence means we should be able to salvage some of its bow plate for a temporary patch the repair wont be perfectly watertight but should be good enough that our pumps can keep pace with it then we can go home everyone nodded since the seaplane tender had been damaged and one plane lost home seemed very far away indeed all this is predicated on the bergens being safe to work on heiden went on clearly something disastrous happened here and we dont want to repeat the experience so lets set the naming aside a moment and turn to that dr schmidt the germans hands were wrapped around a coffee mug for warmth and his thin frame was hunched even in the overheated mess its freezing on that wreck he observed but for us this is actually good it makes unlikely any chance of our own contamination heiden nodded ive inspected some of the corpses schmidt went on the contortions of the bodies suggest some assault on the nerves or muscles their fluidfilled lungs suggest a pneumonic disease something that can be spread by breathing or coughing a truly ghastly contagion and extremely quick judging from the place of death many collapsed at their station but violently virulent diseases tend to burn themselves out quickly the bacteria or virus usually dies with those initially infected if not the cold should have killed or immobilized the microbes so i think the chance of catching the disease is extremely slight though its best to remain masked and gloved to be surer im having the bodies stacked on the beach and will burn them with aviation fuel but with their removal and the confinement of our own sailors to the bergens outer deck i think the risks are acceptable after all we do have to repair schwabenland he glanced with irritation at drexler who ignored him good said heiden greta what has our biologist found dr schmidt and i took tissue samples she reported ive been examining them under the microscope unfortunately its a bit like trying to reconstruct a battle from a field of bones there are signs of microscopic trauma of bursting cell walls also remains of rodlike bacteria a shape we call bacilli similar to plague virus bubonic plague i doubt it the corpses dont quite match those symptoms it seems more likely in this clime that the norwegians encountered something new she hesitated taking a breath and glancing at drexler meanwhile im going to try to culture some of the samples meaning what feder asked grow the remains on a nutrient such as agar she replied the human cells of course will not regenerate theyve been dead over a year but one of the properties of some microscopic beings from small worms to tiny bacteria is that they can enter stasis or a kind of suspended animation when conditions are unfavorable for example when its cold and dry such as on the bergen then they resuscitate when things improve such as with the presence of liquid water you mean come back to life hart asked in a way these creatures dont really die or reproduce as we do they divide themselves forever sometimes microorganisms are killed of course but they dont expire of old age and sometimes they simply suspend all activity until their environment improves and then they begin growing again its possible the disease organisms will resuscitate in my petri dishes the men looked uneasy that sounds dangerous feder objected it is if youre careless drexler said greta is not he smiled at her encouragingly i really dont have proper laboratory facilities on board this ship the biologist cautioned glancing at drexler but jurgen and dr schmidt think it would be prudent to study the pathogen for science study it hart exclaimed didnt you look at the contortions of those corpses it seems to me it would be wise to throw your corpse tissues into that other volcano probably we will drexler said mildly after we understand it this organism may be the expeditions most remarkable discovery yet greta argued thats an understatement schmidt said its fastacting virulence is so out of our experience it could shed light on all kinds of interesting medical questions and no one should have to die like that again greta added the group was quiet again for a moment this culture if it works does it then become immortal in a sense drexler asked can we sustain it indefinitely for research i mean she nodded perhaps i must caution that bacteria arent always easy to grow most dont survive a laboratorys hospitality we dont know the right temperature or nutrient or moisture levels im trying as many variables as i have dishes and equipment for but it would help enormously if we knew its source in the natural world drexler nodded of course were going to try to learn that he paused a moment you know all this talk of laboratory resurrection gives me an idea for what to name this place how about restoration island the group thought about it for a moment not bad heiden commented but is it tempting fate after all we havent finished the repairs yet drexler smiled sailors superstition eh well how about a name connected to fate one of the greek fates perhaps you remember their names said feder i forget very little there were three i recall but clotho and lachesis have little poetry by my ear atropos island however is a name i believe might work it has a certain music dont you agree the others looked uncertain except for schmidt who smiled wryly heiden finally shrugged why not its as good a name as any and those who judge such things will think us literate ha then he sobered jurgen you and your men have given the bergen a pretty good inspection can you tell us anything more about its fate well the ships log ends in late december of last year without mention of the disease it must have struck extremely swiftly so swiftly that men died where they stood if so were dealing with something unprecedented said schmidt exactly said drexler thats what intrigues me the meeting broke up and the doctor drew the political liaison aside im impressed by your classical education jurgen at the time i thought that classroom mythology was useless yes and your talk of the fates sparked memories of my own then you might fully understand why i think my choice was appropriate max drexler poured himself a brandy schmidt nodded clotho if i recall spins the thread of life lachesis determines its length very good doctor and atropos cuts it off like our fascinating microbe someone was knocking at harts cabin door it was late the sky dark the ship quiet after an exhausting day and the pilot had already fallen asleep he awoke groggily and pulled the door half open it was fritz two survived without asking for permission the seaman pushed past the pilot and closed the door he was carrying the norwegian diary and sat down heavily on harts unmade bunk his eyes were red from reading two lived and they themselves werent sure why they took one of the lifeboats and sailed north they knew their chances were slight but what option did they have hart sat on his cabin chair did they know what had happened fritz shook his head the disease came quickly after theyd been on the island for several days these two henry sandvik and svein jungvald had been poking into the cave quite deeply apparently others had been exploring the island they were excited about making a whaling base here because its so far south and so well protected from the weather then the disease began to strike the captain and crew panicked tried to sail hit a rock and began to sink henry and svein were the only ones still healthy enough to man a lifeboat they fled the ship and went to the cave to get out of the cold and wait for the end but it never came neither got sick why they wondered if the source of the disease was contaminated food they were afraid to go back to the ship and get any the bergen was wrecked and they were thousands of miles from help they had the emergency food in the lifeboat water from the spring and a sail they left the diary as a warning and a testimonial jesus two men an open boat minimal food they couldnt have made it no fritz shook his head unless they capsized their end may have been slower and more agonizing than the disease its not a pretty story owen hart pondered it couldve been food i suppose but the timing is coincidental with their arrival at the island and these two in the cave maybe something blew onto the ship while they were underground fritz shrugged i dont know the two norwegians wondered that too but this island makes me uneasy my friend the steam the emptiness do you realize weve not seen penguin or seabird colonies here its too damned quiet i want to finish the repairs and get out of here theyll try to finish tomorrow said hart thats the plan i think everyone wants to leave as quickly as possible it cant be too soon this crater reminds me of an open grave everyone except jurgen and maybe schmidt the sailor grinned wryly they could stay behind no theyre just interested in the disease like a couple of damned frankensteins medicine my ass im worried theyll keep us here until we catch it and gretas going along with it shes a good german or should i say a practical one meaning what meaning shes attracted to you but her future is with him hart was brought up short how do you know that shes ambitious like any bright young scientist no hart said impatiently how do you know shes attracted to me fritz laughed its obvious every time she looks at you my god how did you ever get a pilots license if youre so blind what does she have to do rip open her blouse i wish you two would get it over with so the rest of us could relax hart flushed im not trying to bed her fritz thats exactly the problem hart glowered at the sailor but fritz seemed to pay him no mind flipping idly through the diary she would be happier with you i think but this is just fritz talking im on the lower deck the dutiful seaman i know nothing fuck you fritz grinned still reading the shadows in his cabin were dancing an odd light was glimmering through the porthole hart stood to look fire he announced theyre burning the bodies fritz came over to join him and looked out at the pyre on the beach fueled by aviation gasoline the flames roared skyward with greasy black smoke the light shining on the water heiden must have decided to do it at night and get it out of the way before it could affect morale hart speculated i tell you it makes me feel better to see their diseased bodies cremated like that yes said fritz and worse to know your girlfriend still has bits of them on board our ship here hart ignored the sarcasm i want to know what theyre doing with those cultures careful my friend its when you know too much that you get into trouble in the third reich chapter sixteen hart brooded the flames were dying down the diary lay open on his bunk where fritz had left it before retiring two survived what did that mean he didnt trust jurgen drexler he wanted to talk to greta what were the words fritz had used to describe her yes he remembered now your girlfriend was his interest in greta so transparent had he unwittingly entered into some competition with drexler that he was destined to lose conflicting impulses tore at him he realized he was beginning to lose his certainty about why he was here about what his role was he slipped into the corridor the ship was quiet everyone exhausted from the events of the past three days he made his way to gretas cabin and rapped softly greta there was no answer maybe she was asleep maybe she was ignoring him he stood undecided wasnt the diarys news important he tried the knob her cabin was empty guiltily he glanced about it was neat impersonally so there were no photographs no decoration a white nightgown hung on a closet hook the rooms sole concession to femininity that and its scent of perfume the bed was made its blanket displaying a military tautness hart swallowed was she with drexler he eased the door shut again just go back to sleep he told himself but answers might be in her laboratory maybe she was still working he moved quickly down a ladder and along a passageway the laboratory had no lock but someone had posted a crude sign on the cabin door entry forbidden there was a skull and crossbones drawn above plain enough hart thought but he knocked anyway there was no answer he tried the knob and it opened the laboratory was dim lit by two lamps on a center table no one was there shes with jurgen he thought again the awful certainty of it made him reckless to hell with german rules and secrets he slipped inside closed the door and flicked on the main light he wanted to know know as much as jurgen drexler did the laboratory was as neat as her cabin but crowded two microscopes on a bench shelves with formaldehyde jars ranked like soldiers filled with fresh organisms shed netted from the sea notebooks similarly cased and neatly labeled a large storage locker beyond stacked with nets and buckets and oilskins and rubber boots and on a table in the center were rows of covered glass dishes petri dishes shed called them each half filled with a golden gelatin and labeled some on ice some on a hot plate some under the lamps some covered by dark cloth her cultures none of them looked like anything to him had she failed he heard voices and footsteps her feminine tone so unique on the ship and then drexlers low and anxious both coming this way he doused the main light and looked around in a panic of potential embarrassment he quickly retreated to the shadow of the storage locker and slipped behind the hanging oilskins the door swung open and drexler stalked in looking impatient greta followed her face tight they were fully clothed hart noticed immediately in the same outfits theyd worn at the afterdinner meeting relief washed over him shed never gone to bed i understand your concern greta drexler said tiredly taking out a gauze mask from a box and handing it to her then tying on one of his own both pulled on rubber gloves but the expedition is in crisis and the risk is acceptable this is the kind of discovery that can make your career back in germany that can change your life our life or end it jurgen i think were playing with fire here we have a chance to use this like fire as a tool for germany for advancement he bent over the petri dishes its encouraging they grew so fast which ones she pointed unenthusiastically there and there and there he held one to the light just white dots each speck is a colony enough presumably to kill us all if you are careless and it is me isnt it jurgen i who have to culture a plague i who have to safeguard it this isnt a proper laboratory its crazy bringing this aboard its only temporary until we know what were dealing with he put the dish down and laid a hand on her shoulder greta listen to me norway will be breathing fire over that unfortunate incident with the whaler theyll be in full cry demanding compensation boldly asserting their claims it was critical we find something that would offset that irritation throw the expedition in a positive light now god has put that something in our grasp an organism unlike any other a bacterium that seems to kill with a speed and lethality that makes other plagues look like a common cold and you are the key scientist all of us are depending on you you alone are going to know how to culture this thing how to study it the worlds expert on what i dont know maybe well even name it after you what an honor her voice was sarcastic or not whatever you wish my point is that to simply burn the corpses and sail away would be even crazier perhaps we can stop a future plague with our discovery make this island safe for a base understand a new polar biology greta were doing the right thing then why the spores why does schmidt care about the spores hes a scientist like you no he isnt hes a doctor and hardly even that a quack pathologist cracking open those norwegians chest cavities like a greedy coroner to look for spore coats why to understand the biology to locate the source im not stupid jurgen to learn greta she shook her head i read the literature i know what a government could do with the right plague bacteria like the british in scotland with a sporecoated microbe like the british and anthrax their sly little experiments on the possible eve of war you dont know that for sure i know far far more about such matters than youll ever know he failed to keep a note of condescension out of his voice greta youre a good biologist but youre as naive about politics as that illeducated american the great powers want to crush the reich darling crush it before it grows too strong because we represent the future and if something like this can buy us time dont talk about him like that who owen hes good at what he does and yet you always mock him insult him hes nosy and contentious and you always flirt with him thats a lie youre so insecure im simply tired of that damned american and tired of you defending him we should never have asked him aboard now i simply ask that we you and i focus on germany dont patronize me with your nazi patriotism schmidt doesnt want to buy time he wants to build a weapon to counter their weapons to make their evil unusable cant you see that schmidt thinks weve stumbled on a power never before seen and germany can use it to preserve a balance of power jurgen i dont want to work on this she said in frustration not with that ghoul schmidt i saw him at that funeral pyre on the beach he was completely in his element lets just go home get on with our lives this is our life and you will work on it listen to me these dishes could kill us what if they break i swear ill destroy the cultures her warning sounded real he stared at her then with surprise a surprise that swiftly evolved to barely contained outrage his face was tight from lidded anger and his voice quieted with menace now you listen to me greta heinz you will work on it as a loyal member of a reich expedition or by all the saints ill not protect you from the consequences when we return im not going to allow your childish and simplistic view of things to derail our future my future she looked so shocked at his vehemence that her look halted him he bit his lip struggling to regain control of his emotions his face twisted with the inner pain of selfbetrayal he took a deep breath what you dont understand is that i love you he finally managed more weakly i love you greta and all im asking is that you do this one thing work on this one discovery for us for us and for the reich for germany as the right thing to do her face screwed up jurgen i cant she pleaded im frightened im frightened too by the possibility of failure he looked at her solemnly his expression confessing his need you cant let that happen to me he took off his mask and gloves and leaned stiffly to kiss her rigid cheek then he walked out hart stood still frozen there was a small sound greta was weeping the tears were running into her mask and she lifted her rubbered hands up to try to brush them then she angrily tore the gloves off flinging them and the mask in a corner damn it she sobbed damn all men damn these plates im so afraid of these cultures it didnt kill everyone her head jerked up hart felt he could hardly breathe it didnt kill everyone he repeated he clumsily stepped out from the storage locker she whirled you we found a diary and he lifted a hand toward her instantly her anger fastened on him my god how long have you been standing there how dare you greta please im sorry i didnt mean to i came to the lab to share this news but you werent here and then i heard footsteps and and it sounded lame he knew her face was shiny with tears what did you hear how long were you there he shrugged you heard everything didnt you yes but i wasnt trying get out leave here now two survived the disease get out get out get out god i hate both of you so much he backed to the door cringing from her rage and then shut it behind him leaning against it his eyes closed inside he heard her wail god how i wish i could get off this cursed ship hart couldnt sleep his mind a tumult of emotions always a disaster every time he went near her would she tell drexler hed be lucky they didnt throw him overboard as a damned spy lord he was tired then there was a thump and he found himself stunned he realized hed slept finally and not just slept but descended into the drugged sleep of the exhausted now he had rolled out of his bunk the deck was sharply canted and bright polar sunlight poured through his porthole what the hell were they sinking again the pilot became aware of loud banging and clanging but realized groggily that it was the noise of purpose not confusion there was a deeper rumble of pumps he looked at his watch it was early afternoon hed slept a long time groaning he stood unsteadily against the tilt feeling gritty the norwegian diary had skittered across the floor and he picked it up and inserted it under his mattress then dressed clumsily and made his way to the top deck the schwabenland was moored against the halfsunken bergen sailors swarming over both cables from the higher german ship had been strung to winches on the norwegian one some of the german cargo had been temporarily unloaded onto the bergens deck and more the numbered crates that had puzzled him were being ferried ashore selective flooding of compartments and winching had tilted the schwabenland far enough to port to allow the breach in the hull to clear the water lifeboats had been tied alongside the long gash and sailors were beating cutting and riveting metal at the raised bow of the norwegian ship a section of plating was being cut away with a shower of sparks ropes had been strung to bar entry to the interior of the norwegian whaler but even so the sailors wore precautionary gauze masks heiden was stalking this way and that closely observing and issuing orders hart looked for fritz and didnt spot him he approached heiden why are supplies going ashore are we staying no heiden replied jurgens idea a cache for next year so the germans planned to return have you seen fritz the captain shook his head no if you do tell the lazy bastard to get to work do you know when we can leave when my ship is repaired the tone was impatient and short the pilot backed off and went to the stern looking morosely out across the cold lagoon once more antarctica had proved a disaster drexler despised him despite their successful flight together greta apparently hated him the clash with the whalers had probably eliminated any chance of cheerful publicity fritz had disappeared he felt utterly alone and then she was at his elbow the hood of her parka down her red hair stealing softly across his shoulder as she leaned on the railing he started it was so sudden who survived her question was clinical betraying nothing she looked at him flatly well who survived owen two of the sailors he half stammered the norwegian whalers they lived and took a lifeboat and sailed out of the lagoon i doubt they finally made it she nodded absorbing this how i dont know they didnt know they were exploring a cave and they came out and then the disease hit except that they didnt get it a cave what cave the one fritz and i found i mentioned it last evening at the meeting there you can see it from here he pointed across the caldera to the crater wall she followed his arm then looked back again her tone was still peculiarly detached as if shed used up all her emotions the night before what was in the cave i dont know they didnt say we didnt explore theres a hot spring and a sulfur smell i think its an old lava tube and thats all i know i thought you might know thats why i came to your lab she thought a long time about this do you know what the temperature of this harbor is no one point eight degrees centigrade comfortably above freezing peculiar no is it the ocean outside the crater is below the freshwater freezing point only salt and pressure prevent it from turning solid but in here the water is warmer theres no ice and the crater slopes have little snow this is a warm place yes its a volcano greta she nodded exactly alive with heat and energy she looked across the water studying the cave i remember you spent part of your childhood spelunking correct he grinned uncertainly the best years of my life owen i want a cure a what an antidote to whatever killed the norwegians do you think it could lie inside that cave thats what i came to ask you last night i mean i im sorry i listened you should be sorry she smiled sadly do you know why i dont always like you owen he didnt answer because you always seem to know a little too much about me just like jurgen he didnt know how to respond well i have reproduced a microbe and now i want a way to kill it as a safety valve as a way to retain control over whatever you crazy men try to do next and im intrigued by this cave will you take me there me i thought you were angry i am angry but im also calm i cant afford the luxury of my anger so is this for jurgen or for germany you wont help me i didnt say that she bit her lip its for science ah like this voyage and for me he bowed his head in acknowledgment then ill do it and for us which us she didnt reply you want to go now she shook her head tonight when jurgen cant see hed never let me go with you well be looking for a cure well be looking for something to make all this madness worthwhile chapter seventeen it looks dark its a cave greta they were standing by the spring the brief night of late antarctic summer was ending and the dome of brilliant stars above the crater rim was fading into a ceiling of faint blue across the dark caldera the lights of the schwabenland illuminated its embrace with the crippled bergen up to this point greta had been bold and assertive collecting exploration gear from hanging lockers commandeering a row ashore from the night watch on the vague pretext of inspecting the ashes of the pyre and shouldering a pack for the hike along the beach shed said little determined to get away from the ship while the other officers were still asleep now that she and owen were facing the mouth of the lava tube with its scent of sulfur he could hear a note of hesitation in her voice going underground did that to people hell was imagined deep within the earth thousands of years ago people used caves for shelter hart said trying to be reassuring and well have plenty of light he snapped on a flashlight and led the way to where he and fritz had unearthed the diary then a gas lantern was pumped and lit they blinked in the glow reassured by its steady hiss well go slowly you pick the direction and ill try to find the way he gestured to the lengths of bright cloth hanging from his belt well tie a survey ribbon at every turn and junction like hansel and gretel leaving bread crumbs she smiled at that memory all right he knew that despite her natural uneasiness shed made up her mind to go in just like drexler he admitted another german who doesnt back off unlike a limestone cavern there was nothing colorful about this volcanic one the tube was like entering the encrusted circulatory system of a smoldering heart the basalt was a dull blackred and there were no stalactites in a few places water dripped for the first hundred yards the entry tunnel was fairly level and broad a few openings branched out to tempt a detour but harts flashlight revealed that they ended quickly in collapses of rock slabs of basalt had also fallen off the ceiling of the central tunnel periodically forcing the pair to squeeze around them the pilot didnt reveal his uneasiness at the possibility of a cavein but wondered how often eruptions or earthquakes occurred giving some reassurance was the occasional boot print the norwegians had come this way and nothing had disturbed their mark in the year since the tube deadended at a chimney or at least thats what it seemed like to hart a large vertical tunnel hundreds of feet high and deep led upward and down into the mountain he shined his light to where the beam was lost in the gloom the fissure giving him a slight sense of vertigo here we are at the elevator shaft greta murmured studying the cleft wheres a button to push this must have been a major lava corridor when the volcano was erupting when hart pointed the light downward it illuminated some boulders choking the shaft dark openings indicating a way around them there was a welter of boot prints on the shelf the norwegians were as uncertain as we are fraulein biologist which way should we go she glanced around thinking greta still had a remote distracted air of cool professionalism it was the first time hart had spent this much time alone with her and yet she wasnt focused on him at all he accepted this philosophically he realized that for the moment he was a means to an end a way to reassert her independence from jurgen drexler still he was here and drexler wasnt he smiled at the thought of the germans reaction in the morning when the night watch reported the pair had gone ashore together and not come back greta knelt peering over the edge down i think if you can get us back up he nodded well leave one of the lines tied here i dont know how far these tubes go but most shouldnt be this steep i hope i want to go down because the waters from that hot spring must ultimately come from deeper in the mountain where the source of heat is life needs energy and heat yes so i think we should descend maybe the antidote if there is one isnt biological hart reasoned could it be something chemical minerals in the water i dont think so if the bacteria are indigenous to this island they should have adapted over the eons to the local chemistry yet who knows maybe these two sailors simply missed the initial infection or had a natural immunity or didnt develop symptoms until they escaped by boat this may be a hopeless quest but what im looking for are two forms of life in uneasy coexistence the disease bacteria and something toxic to it evolved in selfdefense a biological stalemate if you will something that can keep that terrible plague in check youre the scientist down it is he tied a line on an outcropping of rock and let it uncoil into the darkness another line doubled lowered their packs im not really a climber or even much of an amateur cave rat but i know enough to go slow he advised move only one hand or one foot at a time and dont hug the rock it makes your foot want to slip off its hold lean out a bit so your body is vertical he tipped his hand to show her all right she looked uncertain but determined after you he went first guiding her progress with the flashlight in truth hart admitted she was as good at the descent as he was not as strong perhaps but balanced lithe if she was afraid she didnt show it they climbed down a hundred feet to a point where a boulder had jammed in the tube she arrived breathless but elated goodness she laughed i know i can go down but can i get back up the way youre going youll be carrying me he led the way down again there was a squeeze around the boulder then a drop of another twenty feet from there the tube descended at more of an angle its floor jumbled rock it was slow rugged going the cave continued to warm as they explored deeper and soon they shed all but trousers and shirts the bitter chill of antarctica seemed far away the floor smoothed but the ceiling continued to get lower suddenly hart paused hed felt a tremor from somewhere there was the distant echo of falling or shifting rock like the groan of something disturbed what was that her elation had disappeared earthquake i think a small one my god this is dangerous greta i have to warn you of that were in a volcano after all do you want to go back there was a silence as she considered no i have to know all right he led on soon they were stooping then on all fours finally it narrowed ahead to a bellycrawl owen are we going the right way i dont know wait here hart crept ahead then came back i hear water but are we at an end not necessarily there were tight places in the caves in montana and then youd squeeze through and find a big room maybe this will be the same but we can also squeeze and get stuck or if were not careful pop through to another elevator shaft so im going to tie a rope around my waist and youre going to play out the line ill show you how while i explore with the flashlight can you do that of course he wriggled forward as the ceiling pressed down his beam of light continued to be lost in the dark vacuum ahead an encouraging sign the rough rock began scraping on his pack and so he shrugged that off leaving it for a moment a final tight spot and then his arms and head were jutting into empty space and he could hear the sound of a river echoing off rock walls he shone the light around he had found a grotto the beam danced on flowing water owen what do you see her call seemed faint behind him maybe what were looking for he climbed out of the tunnel and dragged out his pack lowering it to the floor below on his instructions greta doused her lantern and shoved her gear ahead as he slowly reeled in the rope her head poked through and he grasped her under the arms and pulled she slithered out and instinctively grasped him as she landed and he held her a moment longer than he needed to his face in her hair imagining he could feel the rush of her heart then she gently pulled away i think we should light the lantern she said the grotto was a rock chamber about two hundred feet long and thirty feet high it was split by a stream that emerged from a different dark opening and disappeared down a chute at the far end a jumble of boulders occupied most of the floor but the water had deposited a sandy bar in the middle dry and soft a hot spring bubbled nearby and its water joined the main flow the cave was pleasantly warm rocks near the spring radiated like heaters we should eat greta said im famished they sat in the lanterns pool of light each had brought a blanket in case their stay became extended and they unfolded these now on the sand there were tins of ham and cheese and a rich brown bread from the schwabenlands ovens owen pulled out a bottle of wine i liberated this from heidens stock in the galley he confessed she smiled its cozy here warm almost like a little restaurant im getting used to the dark and do you think were near what were looking for i dont know ill look at the water after i eat its so strange being down here they didnt teach us about caves at the university i have no idea what to expect she took a swig of the wine there were no glasses she used her fingers to dab at the corner of her mouth the biologist sat then looking at the sand lost in thought shes so pretty hart mused admiring the facial sculpture of highlight and shadow in the gaslight some hair had come loose from where shed bound it in a ponytail and it trailed across her cheeks so alluring yet so remote what drove her to risk penetrating this dark hole greta he said why are we here what to explore to search for an antidote of course yes but why the sudden urgency and why the turnabout you didnt seem to mind making the lab cultures at first not at the meeting but then something happened with schmidt last night you talked about spores why are they so important oh him she shook her head as if dismissing her other thoughts and took a bite of bread everything has happened very fast owen the norwegians the iceberg this island the bergen it made sense to me to try to find out what happened to those poor men if for no other reason than to protect ourselves thats why i agreed to do the cultures but schmidt was ahead of me i think and jurgen they wanted to understand where a disease came from in such a sterile environment and so he searched the lungs and respiratory tracts for spore coats which are a casing a bit like a seed coat or an eggshell some microbes develop them when displaced from their preferred environment theyre like a cocoon and the organism is in stasis within waiting for favorable conditions when it can break out and multiply schmidt thinks this could explain the infection the spores were on the island from an unknown source somehow the norwegians got into them and breathed some in the bodys enzymes cracked them open like a trojan horse and they began doubling every twenty to thirty minutes first two then four then eight in a single day you can have billions people begin coughing and sneezing finally the muscles seize the nerves burn like fire the organs dissolve and youre dead so youre afraid these spores could strike again she nodded yes thats a possibility but im more worried by jurgens talk of creating a lethal new weapon is that really possible with most diseases id say possible but not practical after all how do you store them how can you prevent being exposed yourself the complications are many but diseases that develop spore coats are ideal the coating solves many of the problems and neither schmidt nor jurgen care about the morality of it all she laughed bitterly schmidt hes as amoral as they come jurgen hes relentlessly moralistic and its a circle you see at the two extremes the means to achieve an end come together he and schmidt concur he said last night that he loved you yes i know he does he means it and do you love him she smiled her eyes still downcast ah were back to an earlier conversation i think greta considered as if the question had never occurred to her no well yes i do there was a note of doubt in her voice but not in the same way perhaps as im fond of him when he relaxes he can be affectionate you know i admire him his sense of purpose his moralism if you will his certainty hes a strong man intelligent he intrigues me youre talking yourself into it greta she looked troubled i dont know owen he also frightens me sometimes with his intensity the fight with the whalers i dont know what i feel or what im supposed to feel this love it confuses me she waited there was just the sound of the river the hissing of the lantern me too it sounded inadequate yet he was uncertain what else to say she nodded solemnly swallowing and thats good i think easier her voice caught a bit because i want to do what we came down here to do explore this cave she briskly thrust the remains of their meal back into the pack and stood up she was all business again so you come with the lantern while i study this stream greta hart stood he was struggling for the right balance afraid of being too bold and startling her into bolting like a deer in a meadow she put a finger to his open lips quieting him owen its better for the work to let things be they explored along the water the main stream was clear and cold her measurement showed it was degrees centigrade the hot spring tributary in contrast was forty degrees hot to the touch it was crusted with minerals and a kind of slime owen look at that the biologist said with a touch of wonder no light and yet something lives fueled by this underground heat perhaps i wish i had my microscope she found more slime on rocks downstream from the confluence which warmed the river and then at the end of the grotto there was a chute and the stream splashed toward darkness below her flashlight played across its surface and something undulated in the current like luxuriant hair a plant hart asked not down here no sunlight but a growth of something primitive an odd algae that gets its energy from something other than photosynthesis or maybe an animal colony like a sponge or a coral maybe what the norwegians found let me get a sample better wait until i can rope us up but she was already wading ahead and unable to hear him she reached down to seize the wispy organism grasping it just as her boots slipped on the slime of the underwater rocks greta and then with a cry she was gone are we catching a train is that it is there a railroad track at the end of this valley that i dont know about because that i suppose could explain this frantic hurrying this wheezing for breath that im enduring perhaps i can understand it if theres an express to munich or if youve spied the lights of a beer hall shut your mouth you whining weasel ss sergeant gunther schultz growled at fritz with no confidence his order would have any effect christ what a complainer why had drexler saddled them with this hobbling slacker the political liaison had sent them off the ship and into the mysterious dry valley at dawn the previous day jurgen sleepless and sour and nagging from who knew what setback probably the damned woman the ss troopers whispered by late morning the soldiers were over the crater rim and they camped that evening in the valley bottom cut off from the ship the field radio didnt work unless they climbed up a side slope to communicate the soldiers werent happy schmidt had assured them there was no risk but they werent stupid theyd carried the bodies out of the bergen sweating under their gauze masks and so instead of their usual delight at being able to stretch their legs they were no happier being so far from the ship than fritz was this is a dead place a death place one of the soldiers had told schultz while gazing down the arid frozen valley i just want to get back on the boat and go home but drexler wanted the island scouted for some clue to the disease and the assumption was that nothing was to be found on the islands shroud of ice so they would look here in the depths of the valley eating windblown dust fritz had been a lastminute addition the political liaison had obviously decided to penalize the sailor for his tiresome sarcasm calling him a damned communist before assigning him as a guide because of his previous trip ashore with the american fritz of course knew not a thing about where they were going except that he had no desire to go there ive seen that valley from the rim and it has all the charm of a gravel pit hed warned them before they left the ship a sewage ditch is more inviting of course if there is no train then it might be possible to take a rest right here fritz now went on we are next to a lake here albeit a frozen one have some lunch order a stein talk about gardening fine schultz said in exasperation im sick of your moaning you stay with the gear while we push to the end of the valley well be back before dark youre leaving me alone and good riddance one of the soldiers said oh you know ive felt safer in a hamburg back alley if you dont stay here and shut up youll never see hamburg the mountaineers trudged on schultz looking sourly at the enclosing hills of red pumice it looked like pictures of another planet the sergeant thought the ice of the lake was old never thawing and sculpted into uneven frozen waves by sun and scouring winds they nursed their water dr schmidt had warned them not to risk drinking anything that could be a source of disease now they saw there were hot springs ahead at the base of the second volcano the pools steaming placidly in the cold air the mineral water spilled down a series of terraces stained yellow and ocher the hot trickles melting a thin wedge of ice at the end of the frozen lake upslope a glacier from the second volcano had bulldozed to a halt its ice and snout of gravel debris hanging over the springs schultz climbed up to the pools to look about some had dried leaving behind a residue of brownish dust carried up from inside the earth but no sign of prior norwegians nor clues to the disaster a gust of wind caught some of the dust and a plume of grit blew over the squad of mountaineers forcing them to squint against it jesus what a damnable place the sergeant muttered and we havent found a thing that is useful a soldier nodded in wan agreement then he sneezed chapter eighteen greta hart had crept as close to the lip of the chute as he dared wild with despair and hopelessness then in the blackness below he heard it faint against the roar of the falls owennnnn oh my god owen im in the water please help me her voice was like an electric shock to his system im coming he shouted hoarsely hang on the pilot scrambled back to the packs grabbed a line and the lantern and hurried back splashing down the middle of the stream he set the lantern on an overhanging boulder where it would serve as a beacon tied off the rope and cast it down the falls seizing the rough hemp he began lowering himself backward cold water foaming over his thighs a flashlight tucked downward in his belt offered meager illumination shed slipped down the chute as if carried on a log flume owen i see you she called im in a pool a lake the chute grew steeper as he went down bending until it was vertical the chimney the water fell down opened into a much vaster space hart leaned out he could see light reflecting on black water and could hear her down there pleading with him to hurry his own arms ached from the effort and his heart hammered down down he was out of rope he hesitated only a moment there really was no alternative was there he would rescue her or he would die trying because the alternative was unacceptable he let go and plunged he was braced for a shock of cold water the kind that sucks away air and threatens to stop the heart instead he hit a black pool that was surprisingly warm when he surfaced spitting out water that had a brackish taste she was on him sobbing joyfully clinging to him in a warm dark lake underneath a frozen fiery mountain they were alive he kissed her fiercely possessively and she kissed him back this time as greedy as he they sank while holding each other in a hug of reunion and then broke apart to struggle up laughing and coughing drowning in a volcano and we think its funny he sputtered she was treading water the light so dim she was only a silhouette it is funny owen i was terrified when i fell certain i was about to smash onto the rocks but now youre here and the water is warm its like nothing is real anymore they swam back to the base of the cliff where the stream poured down grasping a wet ledge to rest far above hart could see the lighthouselike beacon of the lantern and across the black water was a blue glow he pointed to it whats that she looked blinking away the water ice it looks like so strange a glacier i dont know stay here and rest he swam out toward the glow noticing as he did so the play of warm and cold currents across his body and a swirl of matlike organisms against his arms and legs a diaphanous fuzz that seemed to dissolve when he tried to grasp it the rock ceiling gave way to ice above he finally saw an arching vault of frozen water spangled with millions of tiny crystal icicles fed from the pools condensing steam the ceiling of ice seemed to dip down to the water somewhere in the gloom beyond pale blue light from a remote sun seeped dimly through what must be an immensely thick lid the lake was under some kind of ice cap perhaps it was the frozen lake of the valley he and fritz had observed and in the juncture between hot underground volcanic springs and frozen overhead ice was this tepid netherworld dusky and secret laden with some kind of strange growth he swam back to greta she was plopping handfuls of the organic mats on the ledge by the waterfall creating a pile of brown goo this is weird he said in her ear above the rush of water she nodded i suspect we have a kind of loop meltwater descending heating rising carrying minerals from the depths of the island and these primitive growths fed by what chemical energy can life thrive underground it is amazing if it doesnt kill us if it does ive at least lived to see this her head kept rotating to take it in excited as a child and maybe something like this vegetation will save us that goo there he said doubtfully have you heard of penicillin she asked smiling mischievously it comes from mold or lysozyme it comes from the stuff in your nose the joy of slime remind me to stay away from biologists she laughed splashing him he splashed back stop im wet enough he reached out more tenderly and brushed beads of water from her forehead combed watery jewels from her hair she shivered but didnt shy from his touch then she turned abruptly and scooped another palmful of living fuzz and slapped it onto her cache and how am i going to get this back she looked at the sloppy organic mess instead of him all science again here hart shed his wool shirt leaving a sleeveless white undershirt he scooped the organism onto it and tied the sleeves youre going to owe me a cleaning miss heinz if you can get me back to a laundry ill clean it she shivered again from cold this time theyd been in the water too long and were beginning to feel chilled despite its heat owen how are we going to get up that chute he looked at the distant beacon of the lantern the rope isnt too far above maybe twenty feet he pointed the stream comes out of a tunnel or chimney if we can climb to that we can wedge ourselves our back to one side and our feet on the other and then climb she looked up doubtfully i dont know if i can you will because you must come on before we get so cold we cant function with a thrust of his arms he boosted himself to a sitting position on the ledge greta watching the play of muscles in his shoulders he took off his boots and tied them around his neck instructing her to do the same for a better grip on this wet rock he ran his belt through the makeshift sack of algae and awkwardly stood leaning away from the falls to search for handholds the basalt was rough enough that they were plentiful but the plunge of cold water seemed to want to pry them off the cliff greta seemed stuck incapable of climbing up farther wait hart said he scrambled up by himself shouldering through the water until he could brace himself in the chimney and reach the rope he jammed the shirt with its algal cargo into a crevice and dragged off his pants no time for modesty and hell it was dark anyway he tied one leg to the rope and let the other drop another four feet at least he looked down to where greta was clinging she nodded then let herself go and fell into the lake treading water she shed her shirt and pants as well swimming back to the cliff face she flung them up he added them to the rope and pulled to test it seemed strong enough he let himself down felt her reaching arms on his leg seized one of her wrists and slowly she began climbing he let her scramble up him and clutch his chest and shoulders for reassurance greta was panting her skin goosebumped by the cold are you all right she nodded try to climb up past me greta took a deep breath and continued pushing against him she reached the rock tunnel and wedged herself grasping the rope and resting a moment hart climbed up next to her and brought the bottom of the rope up untying her shirt here or youll scrape your back she braced her wet skin against his as she pulled it back on she was slick cold now that they were closer to the lantern he could see the tiny shadow of erect nipples in her wet bra as she buttoned he wanted to touch them youll make us both fall you ass if she noticed his look she gave no sign that was the worst were going to make it greta wordlessly she turned her head and kissed him again her expression solemn then she grasped the rope with both hands try not to be late as she climbed past him he noticed her bare legs were bruised from the fall rivulets of water ran down her thighs he wanted her so much she was standing in the stream and breathing heavily when he hauled himself over the lip of the water chute he was clad only in his underwear with the bag of algae belted to his waist and felt faintly ridiculous but she looked beautiful in the lantern light wet and gleaming her shirt still half unbuttoned ended at her thighs her hair was a wild tangle hart knew his own desire was all too apparent as he looked at her he didnt care without speaking she turned and waded back upstream toward the sandy bar the pilot coiled the rope untied their clothes from its end took the lantern and followed she was waiting pale and perfect she had unbuttoned the shirt and it hung open letting him see the rise of her breasts above her bra her neck was high its line and the clavicles of her shoulder making an arabesque of curves echoed in her waist her hips her thighs he ached to possess her we must dry these she said all business except that her voice caught a bit she reached for the soggy bundle of clothes and turned away to climb up to the hot rocks around the steaming spring draping the clothes on them he watched the delicate architecture of her back as she worked the play of bone and muscle then she stepped down and stood to face him again shaking her head to get wet hair away from her shoulders he could see the aureole of her nipples through her soaked bra they looked like twin dark moons the triangle under her wet panties was a shadowy gate and yet she was hesitant she crossed her arms to hug herself still cold her thighs pressed together he stepped toward her we didnt plan this she said softly no we didnt the tips of his fingers touched her cheek and he brushed away a drop of water or was it a tear hold me owen im so cold his arms enclosed her and she huddled inside them he leaned to nuzzle her ear her neck she was shivering again i love you greta please dont say that the plea was unconvincing i love you more than i thought it was possible to love anyone ive loved you since i saw you beside the fire at karinhall but didnt fully admit it myself until you fell and for a terrible moment i thought id lost you forever i love you and would rather die than not have you id half died before i met you id gone numb after antarctica he kissed finding her neck her cheek her lips the tip of her tongue and you made me alive again owen please im still confused i think this may be wrong you know it isnt wrong it must be jurgen the expedition but then she kissed him hard and hungry aching unfolding her arms to grasp his shoulders she broke away to gasp this is so irrational so emotional you know how right this feels he kissed her again so unscientific to hell with science her eyes were wet luminous her breath coming in quick gasps she blinked them shut i think i love you too and it makes me afraid that i love you so much he stroked her back the wet cotton on her rump and she arched under his hand sighing youll catch a chill unless you get all these things off he whispered in her ear his voice thick greta bit her lower lip and nodded she broke free and turned presenting her back he unfastened her bra and she let it drop the white straps slipping down her white arms hart could see the ripe swell of her breasts at her sides then she tugged her panties down too wiggling a bit to get them off her hips her bottom round and firm bending she laid her underwear on the rocks carefully smoothing then she turned to face him naked trembling she held out her hand your laundry mr hart he peeled off his undershirt and shorts and gave them to her he was erect and rock hard his blood pounding in his ears he was shaking too how long he thought how long since hed been with a woman he truly loved she tossed his things on the rocks and then they were together again she melting against him this time clutching desperately opening her mouth to his kisses hungry for them and an exultant roaring filled his head that blotted out the sound of the river his hands ran down her back slipped over her buttocks felt her soaking wetness and his penis was nuzzled by her damp fur as she pressed hard against him he cradled a breast and as he bent to kiss her stiff nipples her hair enclosed their faces for a moment like a tent to create an intimacy my god owen i have felt so alone he carried her to the blankets then she curled in his arms with her face pressed into his neck he knelt to lay her down gently and then he held and stroked and kissed her for a long time she unfolding to him stretching their bodies growing heated and eventually her cries echoed in the grotto unheard by anyone but them chapter nineteen something was wrong the schwabenland was still coupled to the bergen and the seaplane tender had righted itself the repairs to its torn hull apparently done yet crewmen were running along its decks in seeming panic sailors were shouting orders and hoisting cargo back into the germans hold and the ships stack was already smoking the seaplane tender was preparing to get underway some of its supply crates still scattered on the beach meanwhile clouds were mounding over the crater the weather was turning bad again the two spelunkers had been dirty but happy after their climb out of the cave light greta exclaimed with relief at the mouth of the lava tube she hugged hart and he kissed her again grinning and they marched along the crater shore in a contented mood of new partnership but when the motor launch came to ferry the couple back to the ship they awkwardly reverted to a pose of proper distance out on the schwabenland they saw the figure of jurgen drexler on the wing of the bridge watching them stiffly let me talk to him greta whispered they left their gear on deck the biologist removing one bottle from her pack and slipping it into her pocket schmidt met them on their way to the bridge did you go into the valley they shook their heads he appraised them warily come on then it should be safe id like to see jurgen alone greta said no time for that now ordinary seamen had been dismissed from the bridge but heiden feder and drexler were there there was an uncomfortable silence as the germans studied the couple trying to assess how much had happened greta let her gaze drift to the ships wheel owen stared back evenly jurgen stood rigid his humiliation at her recent absence plain the political liaison couldnt keep his eyes from flickering from one to the other finally heiden spoke we thought you were dead we went to owens cave greta said now glancing at drexler he stonily looked back at my request to study the underground biology of the island you left the ship without permission the captain complained you were absent without leave thats tantamount to desertion were not in the navy for christs sake hart replied you go overnight and leave no word drexlers voice was tight we were frantic with worry he looked at greta i thought youd caught the disease she shook her head no we left to investigate a scientific hypothesis to explore and did you find what you were looking for feder asked slyly he looked from the couple to drexler striving to keep a straight face greta ignored him drexlers gaze fixed on hart that was irresponsible and in violation of every safety procedure and you know it you could have killed her thats ripe coming from a guy whos had her culturing plague viruses shes here isnt she looking like you dragged her behind a truck listen why dont you enough the roar was heidens he pointed at them as drexler had his finger accusatory you both know you broke every commonsense safety rule of this ship leaving like that was irresponsible and caves are dangerous he shook his head in disgust youre lucky you returned when you did or we might have left you behind were departing as soon as possible leaving greta protested some of the men are sick with the bergens disease we think its time to flee before more die oh my god who said hart a squad of the mountaineers they were exploring that dry valley schultz some others how many five no six the mountaineers and eckermann what i thought it was time fritz exercised his legs as well as his mouth drexler said grimly now his wit has gotten him into trouble jesus christ are they in the infirmary no ashore youd better tell us what happened greta said worriedly looking at drexler with dismay we dont really know said heiden eckermann radioed from near the crater rim this morning he reported theyd entered the valley the day before and by yesterday evening some of the men began developing symptoms he said he still felt fine and was going back to help the source of the contagion remains unclear though he babbled about dust in any event we cant take chances and jeopardize the expedition they havent radioed again and weve no sign of them were going to leave before someone comes down with the disease here youre just going to abandon them hart asked incredulous under the circumstances we have no choice we dont know where they are and cant help them medically if we did even if we could get them back aboard they might turn this ship into another bergen its time to leave this cursed place it was a mistake to send them perhaps but whats done is done the crew is near panic youre not going to catch anything out in this lagoon objected hart and how do you know that given that we have a ghost ship of a whaler tied to our side countered drexler you dont know how or where that disease will strike if theres a chance that those people are alive gentlemen it was schmidt sounding impatient it seems to me that we have a more immediate question whether to quarantine our two awol explorers were not a risk said greta you dont know that maybe i do said greta she turned to drexler and heiden the reason we went ashore is that owen and fritz found documentary evidence a diary that some norwegians survived theyd been in the cave owen and i went there to learn why we thought it would be quicker to just go without telling anyone she glanced apologetically at drexler we werent trying to alarm you he looked at her gloomily she took a breath we found an interesting organism there an algae or spongelike animal colony tied to a subterranean heat source and possibly independent of the need for sunlight my hypothesis is that this organic growth may have evolved toxins to stave off the bacterium thats common enough in nature perhaps the norwegians who lived drank cave water we fell into an underground lake and inadvertently swallowed some of the water so far without ill effect and before we left the ship i filled this small bottle with a culture of the disease from my laboratory she brought it out of her pocket and held it up at that time the solution was a cloudy white from the explosive growth of the bacteria so i added some of the cave organism as you can see it has turned perfectly clear the germans looked confused schmidt took the bottle curiously what does this mean heiden asked slowly that there might be an antidote to this disease greta explained a naturally produced antibiotic and if it kills this bacteria perhaps it will kill others just like flemings penicillin that british research was a failure schmidt objected fleming couldnt find a way to efficiently grow purify or store his mold he gave up thats why german laboratories have developed a chemical alternative prontosil yes but penicillin worked better than chemicals in the tiny amounts fleming could isolate greta countered his mold didnt damage healthy tissue and this may work too at least for an emergency she turned to drexler cant you see jurgen this could be far more important and exciting than a ghastly new microbe infection killed millions in the great war what if we had a way to battle it we cant leave on the verge of such a discovery drexler studied her considering hart almost felt sorry for the man his wound so obvious clearly the political officer was still deeply in love with greta and to have to listen as she lamely defended her leavetaking while standing next to the man shed gone away with well it must have been tough and yet the pilot could see jurgen mentally squelching the pain compartmentalizing it as he thought furiously of the broader picture gretas betrayal the risk of disease a new microbe the chance for the expedition to become a medical success led to this island by jurgen drexler the german swung his gaze to hart what you say is intriguing drexler said carefully but all we have at this moment is a bottle of clear liquid and two people still alive after crawling through a hole in the ground he considered and an opportunity for an immediate test he nodded toward the captain yes said heiden cautiously its obvious see if this slime you found helps those soldiers and fritz hart amended exactly drexler agreed god has given us a chance to try for a miracle perhaps if youre right and if we can find them ill find them hart said owen greta touched his sleeve jurgens eye following her hand no hart looked at drexler im not leaving live men behind ill find them from boreas if theyre alive ill land to either distribute the drug or ferry them out then ill go with him greta announced out of the question snapped drexler its my discovery jurgen no im not risking you again and youve neglected your cultures long enough if you want to study this cave slime the best place is your lab she looked frustrated hart on the other hand is our last fit pilot lambert is still bandaged up and hes right the airplane is the fastest way to locate the squad then we can decide what to do next greta knew better than to protest further she flashed a pained look at hart the pilot met her gaze then turned to heiden this bowl is too narrow for takeoff we need to launch and recover from outside the crater is the ship seaworthy enough to do that i hope so thats been the point of our repairs the planes radio is still out ill fly find them and return i want the skis attached to the bottom of the pontoons in case i have to land on snow will you need a man to come with you again feder asked drexler scowled no hart decided its senseless to risk more lives than necessary let me check on their condition and well proceed from there what if you dont come back schmidt asked he shrugged sail without me no greta cried thats crazy ill be back he turned and took the biologist by her shoulders greta ill eat the organisms myself and go with a mask we cant wait to test this drug further we have to bet on it now lives are at stake i trust your judgment will this stuff help fritz and those men will it keep me alive my god owen i cant promise that for raw pond scum based on a single bottled experiment even drugs that work well for one person dont always work for another maybe the organism loses its effectiveness as it dries or with time and those men may already be dead this is an incredible risk her eyes were troubled please dont go alone please a short flight a check on their situation and im back he turned to schmidt if theyre alive if theyre not too far gone we can quarantine them on the aft deck where passat was tethered you can isolate me too so how long before you get back feder asked hart shrugged the valley is too dry for the skis so ill have to find an ice field upslope to land four hours six demanded greta no said feder the barometer is dropping again and this patched tub is going to be out on an ocean awash with icebergs it must be quicker eight said drexler or more he looked at greta im not abandoning anybody either hart launched as planned from the open ocean climbed around the flank of the harbor volcano and squeezed over the valley ridge beyond flying below a thickening ceiling of dark cloud the valley was like a brown trough with the white platter of frozen lake running up its center its eroded ice far too rumpled to land on despite the landscapes sterility the pilot flew to the second volcano without seeing anything the beleaguered squad was surprisingly hard to spot from the air he turned and dropped in elevation going back the way hed come still nothing then a rock sprang to life and began waving frantically hart waggled his wings and circled studying the barren pumice slope to finally pick out the forms of still humans the mountaineers were sprawled like scattered sticks one stood apart dancing energetically it looked like fritz owen began looking for a place to land glaciers nosed into the valley but were too steep and broken to serve as a safe runway hart flew over the enclosing ridgeline again and scouted the smoother slopes on the seaward side there was a promising plateau of snow near the flank of the volcano that formed the islands snug harbor the pilot put down there and climbed out squinting at the darkening sky the wind was rising so he ran lines from the wings and tied them to metal swastika stakes he found in the back of the plane the first practical use of these damned things the whole trip he muttered to himself driving the stakes into the hard snow he wrapped a tarp around the engine cowling and another around the cockpit bubble and set out with his backpack and the drug the empty panorama was intimidating but the pilot admitted he actually liked being alone again for a moment it reminded him of his independence in alaska the most direct route led down the face of a glacier cut by crevasses but he decided it would be safer to circle to the flank of the volcano and descend its smoother slope into the valley the hiking was uncomfortable his feet slipped on snow patches and loose rock and the gauze disease mask warmed his face but also tended to ice up when he reached the frozen lake at the bottom he confirmed that its ice was as strange as the rest of antarctica pockets of dust had melted into its thick covering at a faster rate than more reflective places producing a labyrinth of waisthigh undulations or frozen waves he hurried on as he neared the site where hed spotted the sprawled ss soldiers fritz skittered down a pumice slope to meet him waving his arms to get owen to stop short the sailor was masked with a handkerchief like a bandit they paused at a cautious distance dont come any closer owen as much as id love to give you a hug my friend your airplane made me happier than a lingerie merchant in a heated harem dont be too enthused before you get to fly away you have to walk to the dornier fritz several miles better than sitting here i was about to freeze stiffer than nazi protocol hart smiled well your tongue is still working at least is the rest of you sick he nodded i thought maybe id escaped but im beginning to ache the truth is im frightened im babbling because ive seen what the disease does to others its monstrous the pilot threw him a canteen drink this it may save your life fritz lifted the bottom of his mask and took a swig ach he sputtered and coughed what is it penguin pee medicine i know its vile ive had some myself so of course you want to share he cautiously drank again greta thinks it may be an antidote an antibiotic that fights the plague microbes its terrible but youve got to drink as much as you can we found it in that cave fritz drank some more and grimaced marched diseased now poisoned ive had better cruises still if this doesnt help im going to die my friend his eyes were somber the others gone already horrible pain some of them contorted like pretzels yet youre too unsociable even for microbes no just for schultz god rest his soul he was so tired of my complaining that he left me not far from here while the rest went to the end of the valley by the time they got back a couple were already coughing i put on a mask and moved away you can imagine how popular that was but its the only reason im still alive i took the radio up the slope to alert the schwabenland and then came back to try to get the survivors moving before this storm hits it was too late schultz was the last and he died two hours ago my god were in hell owen a cold hell hart hoisted his own canteen and drank wincing youre probably contagious well have to share the drug and then be quarantined on the deck of the schwabenland fritz nodded drexlers been dreaming of that the whole voyage i suspect though the best reason to live is to see his face when he realizes im the only survivor he took another mouthful but that assumes you can get us out of here some snowflakes were beginning to fall i suggest we hurry to your plane chapter twenty why hasnt he returned greta stared out at a darkening world atropos island was gray fogged by increasing snow and the sea was growing rougher they could see spray hurling skyward at the caldera entrance as the swells built the schwabenland wallowing miserably as it crept to maintain station in case boreas came back icebergs drifted by like dreadnoughts heiden periodically snapping orders to change course slightly to stay out of their way yet there was no sign of owen hart nor had the field radio taken by the mountaineers issued any more calls the crew was anxious even high on their bridge the officers could hear the labor of pumps keeping thudding pace with the slow leakage around the iceberg patch in the hull the leak was still manageable but as the swells had mounded and the ship creaked the invasion of cold seawater had grown worse i told you it was madness to let him go feder fretted and madness to stay here waiting when we should be making for a proper port we seem determined to compound one mistake with another how can you say we shouldnt wait when he may just be pinned down by weather greta demanded because if we wait too long we may be pinned as well thats quite enough alfred heiden growled were in no danger of sinking and if you two hens want to cackle at each other do it off the bridge feder scowled i just want it on record that i pointed out the dangerous weather the first time we got into trouble out here recorded now silence drexler saw an opportunity and moved close to greta careful not to try touching her yet i know how fond youve become of hart he offered quietly i understand your worry but hes a resourceful outdoorsman im sure hes all right she sighed its just so frustrating to have him all alone out there so soon after she stopped its just so hard to wait jurgen and what if i was wrong about the cave organism what if he trusted me and flew off to his death from the disease thats nonsense you acted on the best knowledge you had were all struggling you hart myself and didnt you try it in your bottle it must do some kind of good i just wish i was sure could you try it on the cultures owen took all the antidote she hesitated and besides the cultures are gone what i destroyed them jurgen i warned you i would weve had enough death he looked at her in shock careful he thought control your emotions or youll lose her shell run away are you angry he swallowed surprised he managed it seems unscientific she looked away well his face twisted in dismay id hoped to bring something back to germany but preserve what you have some instinct told him he tried a different tack you and i have had some differences greta but that hasnt changed my my feelings for you whatever has happened please remember im still your friend she nodded looking relieved thank you i value that jurgen he turned away to hide his wince the hike to the plane exhausted fritz the boreas was behind a ridge on the opposite side of the lake from where the mountaineers had died and the little sailor insisted on minimizing the distance by cutting across its frozen surface but as hart warned the eroded frozen waves proved a slippery nightmare difficult to scramble over they both fell several times worse their subsequent direction up the valley wall in the growing snow drifted off course and they got themselves onto the snowy crust of a glacier they trudged mindlessly up its gloomy slope until there was a crack and fritz almost dropped out of sight my god he cried scrambling away now the island is trying to devour me hart cautiously crept to the edge of the crevasse and peered into its blue twilight from its depths he felt an even deeper chill from walls as hard as steel youre lucky and your guiding skills have not improved conceded are you all right fritz sighed i ache owen its frightening the pilot gave him more of the drug the supply was already nearly gone hart carefully led their way back off the glacier and up a snowdusted pumice slope eventually breathing hard they gained the ridge and came out on the plateau the wind was shrieking the seaplane was still there snow drifting against its skiconverted floats and its wing tugging against the anchored swastika stakes the ocean beyond was a blur of gray streaked with white the schwabenland couldnt be seen because it was around the flank of the volcano hart was conscious of time draining away surely the germans would realize he couldnt fly back in a storm can we take off in this wind owen maybe and maybe fly in it maybe even find our way back to the ship but landing on the sea with that scudding ice fritz shivered they were cold dangerously so should we wait it out in the plane if we have to but the skin has no insulation and the fuselage will be freezing hart looked around where else then the pilot pointed inside the mountain maybe its warmer there the sailor followed his finger there was a dark opening in the snow like a lidded eye i noticed that on my hike down and the snow hasnt covered it up that means it might be an overhang or a cave if the latter its better than the plane and if not climbing will keep you warm can you manage the pain fritz paused to take internal inventory actually im beginning to feel better maybe that piss of gretas really works they slowly plowed toward the distant eye breathing hard their goal lost at times through blowing snow the wind howled harder as they worked higher gusts snapping the ends of their parkas the cold stung their lungs and rasped their throats harts feet and hands were growing numb and he knew the little sailor must be far worse it hurt to live then they reached a chesthigh wall of lava rock part of an outcrop on the volcanos snowy flank there was a shelf on top and then the small cave owen lifted the weary sailor up onto the ledge and pushed him ahead the entry tunnel was tight forcing them to crawl on hands and knees but there was a livingroomsized chamber beyond that was floored with sand they sprawled gratefully the sound of the wind had abruptly dropped and the temperature had soared i think were going to make it owen said do you want some food the sailor looked at him wearily like your canteen yes book paste and paint thinner please i cant get enough of your cooking harts promised fourhour absence went by gretas six hours drexlers eight still no sign of the pilot night came and the schwabenland uneasily maintained its rocking station at sea the crew grumbling nervously as large bergs swept by and smaller floes clanked and skittered along the damaged hull snow coated the decks before finally stopping at a gauzy dawn greta was sleepless her eyes red the mood on the bridge was somber its time to consider our situation said schmidt we should either reenter the shelter of the harbor or consider going back north with the season growing to a close the weather can only grow worse owen asked us to remain out here greta said there was silence well ive said what i have to say and im not saying it again feder reminded heiden drummed his fingers looking out the bridge windows the entrance to the caldera is still stormy they could all see the spray i dont want to risk the fate of the bergen and hit a rock now that were outside i prefer to stay outside until the weather calms and how long do you propose to stay schmidt asked the leak has gotten worse again slightly worse the captain looked unhappy there cant be any surprise at the pilots absence the doctor insisted weve all seen what that disease can do we dont know that greta protested we know that every man who has ventured into that valley has failed to return greta looked at the officers imploringly most shifted their gaze away drexler didnt listen he said ive been thinking our problem is lack of information not lack of will we all want to do whats best for the american and the mountaineers but weve no word from any of them so we cant act let me try to rectify that what do you propose said heiden take the motor launch back into the caldera that way we risk a boat not the ship you cant even swim swimming is pointless in this cold water he dismissed and i dont want it said i abandoned the american he glanced at greta she cast her eyes down your plan asked schmidt ill ask for volunteers well go ashore and climb up to the crater rim no farther hart and eckermann did it safely when we first arrived so we should be able to as well ill see if i can spot any sign of the men or the plane if we do we can plan from there and if we dont then the best thing is to leave he heard greta take a sharp breath im sorry but we cant indefinitely endanger the many for the few our primary duty to germany is to return and report our claims they waited its a reasonable course of action heiden told her maybe hell even fly back while jurgen is scouting she nodded miserably this trip will also let me accomplish another task drexler said i think we should blow up the bergen why asked feder two reasons one the hull could retain traces of the disease despite our cremation of the corpses theres no reason to endanger future explorers and second its removal would eliminate any competing norwegian claims to this island with the bodies burned and the ship gone no one will know the whalers ever got here it could still make a splendid german base once we understand the disease the cached supplies mark our claim youd come back here greta gasped with proper expertise and equipment in fact if the reich allows ill come next season but first things first do i hear volunteers feder smiled grimly ill go if it will speed our getting out of here when am i going to learn not to follow your lead great god in heaven its just a tremor fritz at this point this is the fastest way out they were suspended in the cave like flies on a wall ironically their present precarious situation had only been made possible because of fritzs improving health the remaining drug organism food and the warmth of the cave had done wonders in restoring the sailors strength consequently hed been persuaded to help explore the cave while they waited for the storm to abate harts pack still had the lantern and flashlight and candles hed used on his trip with greta and they wound down a steep tunnel toward the interior of the mountain but just when fritz believed theyd reached the point of necessary return the pilot had instead become enormously excited far from turning back the crazy american wanted to go on its the elevator shaft hart had cried the what greta and i followed this downward to the lake where we found the drug that seems to be saving your life we entered it halfway up while this tunnel breaks into its top the two cave entrances are connected wonderful by a pit so deep we cant even see the bottom hart had shone his light around the chimney is hundreds of feet deep but not bottomless and look it has ledges and handholds halfway down is the horizontal tunnel greta and i entered before this shaft can lead us back through the mountain to the caldera while were there i can even return to the lake and get some of the drug now that we know it works you want me to climb down there only halfway if the germans have any sense they brought the schwabenland back into the lagoon once they realized the seriousness of the storm well walk out and meet them and if they dont have any sense which is my judgment of this entire expedition then you wait by the spring while i climb back over the rim of the volcano to get the airplane in the meantime youll have more medicine why am i letting you talk me into climbing a sheer cliff because that direction is all downhill he clapped fritz on the back dont worry well rope up ah we can fall together fritz actually did fine until the small volcanic earthquake came then the cave wall shuddered and a few loosened fragments of rock cut through the air past them exploding into stony shrapnel somewhere far below now the sailor was trembling i dont like caves were almost out of this one fritz the pilot shone his flashlight see theres the ledge were making for much closer than trying to go back the cave is unstable but we wont be here long christ im never getting off the ship again i dont care what pighead orders youll already be a hero you wont have to hart drove a final piton into the rock and threaded the rope through it then led fritz down its double length on the sandy ledge where he and greta had hesitated it seemed like centuries ago he reeled in the line the pilot was cheerful hed be seeing her again soon the pair walked to the entrance of the craters cave blinking in the gray light of a new dawn the storm was dying but wind still whistled up on the crater rim and spray pounded the caldera entrance there was no sign of the schwabenland which was worrisome but if drexler was as patient as promised it should still be waiting at sea at least hart hoped so ill go quickly down to the lake to get you enough of the organic mats if they still havent returned by the time i get back ill get the airplane the storm should be completely over by then then ill find the ship meanwhile just get some sleep fritz looked out tiredly utterly spent you know owen were not the two most popular members of this cruise do you really think theyll wait of course greta will make them wait later that morning jurgen drexler and his volunteers sailed the frostcoated motor launch through the heaving swells of the caldera entrance the open boat surprisingly stable as it surfed the breaking waves into the choppy lagoon except for the scattered crates of abandoned supplies onshore that formed a mournful monument to a seemingly thwarted mission the crater was empty hart was deep in the heart of the mountain and fritz was asleep drexler used his binoculars to scan the crater rim no one waved or shouted the political liaison was put on shore with feder to climb up the crater wall while the remaining volunteers motored to the bergen to ready it with explosives the two germans hiked steadily to the top the geographer panting hard and came tentatively over the crest feders urge to cringe from an imaginary assault of germs was dampened by a stiff wind that blew from their backs sweeping the mysterious menace of the dry valley away from them even so both wore a gauze mask sticky on the inside and frosted on its surface the valley was desolate and deserted as deserted as drexler had secretly hoped as the hours had ticked by on the ship the idea that the annoying american might not be coming back had filled the political liaison with rising excitement it would solve so many problems still he hiked along the rim to make sure he had to know for both greta and himself after a quarter mile he found the radio that fritz had hauled up from the valley bottom snowcrusted and abandoned a hundred yards below the rim im not going near it feder said then wait here we must check drexler slid down the outer slope sweating at even this tentative descent into the valley of death but he made himself do it a try revealed that the radios batteries had died in the cold he couldnt reach the ship otherwise there was no sign of fritz hart or the mountaineers drexler considered a moment then climbed back and pointed along the rim we hike on feder unconsciously had backed a foot away from him as if he might already be contaminated for gods sake jurgen theyre gone lost no i want a view along the ridgeline of the valley drexlers heart initially sank when they spied the flying boat so the pilot hadnt crashed the germans could see it tethered on the snow far below and studied it carefully for a sign of life it was a quiet relief that they saw none the plane was crusted with snow its surroundings trackless hart had obviously left before the storm and not come back do you see anything drexler asked lowering his binoculars only an abandoned airplane my god wouldnt hart have returned by now if hes still alive he said four hours and its been a day the political liaison nodded glad to have a witness perhaps we should climb down and inspect he offered carefully no the launch might leave us do you want us all to die one by one looking for each other im going no nearer that pestilence than right here its time to go back drexler made a show of reluctance looking out across the island with binoculars then youre right alfred even hart advocated prudence it was obvious he told himself the american had landed descended into the valley and died from the microbe or exposure as much as he would like fresh tissue samples of the disease it would be suicide to search for the bodies it was over his rival was dead he exhaled realizing how tensely he had been holding his body so we saw the plane abandoned and no sign of life agreed i told him not to come wed better return to the launch theyll be wondering what happened to us finally im freezing when they turned the wind was bitter in their faces jurgen led the way back brooding as he turned events over in his mind the whole episode was a tragedy yes he was willing to admit that but who could have foreseen that a simple scouting expedition would lead to so many deaths and theyd learned valuable lessons to prepare them for return his men hadnt died in vain the disaster demonstrated the power of this strange new microbe potentially an awesome new weapon he continued to muse as he and feder picked their way down the slope atropos island the fate that scheduled death the fate that was going to resurrect his career once he restored the cultures by returning next year too by consigning hart to some unknown end fate had resurrected his relationship with greta after reviewing the chain of events his conscience was clear everyone had done the right thing as best they were able everyone as the pair neared the bottom of the crater they saw the motor launch pulling away from the derelict whaler to meet them for the trip back to the schwabenland suddenly there was a flash of light and they abruptly halted their descent watching the whalers bridge explode the demolition had begun then another explosion and another the whaler was being ripped apart smoke and water spewing skyward drexler could feel the sound and pressure in his bones as the energy punched across the volcanic bowl then the column of smoke began to dissipate black caldera water smoothing over the wreck site the germans in the boat below cheered suddenly there was a new rumble and drexler turned to the noise the explosion had triggered a snow and rock avalanche on the crater wall he saw at a point right above harts damnable cave jurgen couldnt help grinning at the spectacle a cloud of debris was sliding over the entrance in a great plume of dust helping to erase bitter memory the cavern of betrayal was history my god an awesome detonation feder breathed id no idea we had that much explosive aboard as i told hart we germans like to be thorough drexler watched the plume of dust dissipate in the wind the cave entrance had disappeared yes suddenly exhilarated he began bounding down the slope toward the approaching boat as the geographer clumsily followed the pairs shoes kicking up gouts of pumice dust it was time to look to the future not to the past it was time to comfort greta fritz was jerked awake by a roar hed been sleeping in the cave and was disoriented by darkness only after a second or two did his eyes swing toward the light of the caves entrance as the source of the noise there was a whole series of thuds outside and he staggered toward the cave mouth to see what was going on the whaler had erupted in a plume of spray and debris he saw fragments still raining down into the lagoon groggily he realized the schwabenlands motor launch was also in the harbor for rescue he lifted an arm to wave then there was a deeper nearer roar and the lava cave began to tremble rocks crashed across the tube entrance and then a sluice of dirt and snow began pouring down to blot out his view jesus christ dust billowed in at him and he began to cough what had the fucking nazis done now the sailor began a stumbling run back into the tube to get away from the avalanche at the entrance confused by this calamity suddenly there was a splintering crack and a huge slab from the ceiling thudded down behind him cavein the floor shuddered and the air quaked and as more pieces hinged down he was running madly the noise growing and then he was swatted down and time stopped blackness he woke to a hand shaking his shoulder a voice was saying his name it seemed a cruel thing to do he felt not so much pain as leakage his life force draining away why call him back fritz it was owen still alive that was something fritz what happened the sailor spoke or tried to it came as a croak he was frustrated that he couldnt do better than a fucking croak that he wouldnt get back to the ship to surprise pighead what the pilot bent closer fritz managed a hoarse whisper get back to her owen he spoke in a swoon of pain dont give up again and then the last of him drained away sky the icedotted ocean as vast and brilliant as the cave had been close and dark now hart was flying in its terrifying emptiness with a leaden cargo of sudden devastating loss it seemed he was utterly alone in the world the cave destroyed fritz dead the ship disappeared greta gone he was too late as hed instructed theyd sailed without him the pilot watched the fuel gauge measure the sinking of his hope at the very end he planned to dive steeply into the sea the crash would be quicker than frigid water but hed hunt until the last drop of petrol hed already come so far hed been halfway to the lake when the cavein occurred the deeper mountain quaking ominously with a guttural rumble what in hell pondering the mystery he decided on a quick retreat when he scrambled back to the chimney it was full of choking dust alarmed he climbed up the shaft to a lava tube suddenly littered with broken rock he found his little friend at the inner boundary of complete collapse half buried and bleeding great god why a cavein then the timing was monstrously bitter and as fritz slipped away owen spent precious time grieving giving way to selfpity at lifes unfairness he numbly gathered purpose only by remembering greta and then began the long lonely climb toward the caves back door praying that it had not been sealed as well one by one his lights had died first the flashlight then the lantern and then the candles he crawled the last hour in utter darkness guided only by his knowledge that there was a way out and it lay somewhere at the top of this labyrinth of tunnels twice he hit dead ends backtracked and tried a different tunnel three times he almost gave up lying in the dark with only the sound of his own breathing drops of meltwater eventually prodding him to climb on yet finally he was on the snowy shelf again dazzled by polar light blood pounding the cold an electric shock taking in great shuddering breaths of frigid air groaning at the inexorable drainage of time how long would they wait hed eventually hiked wearily to the plane dug it out unleashed its wings unwrapped the tarps and laboriously warmed its engine he was slow clumsy tired and it took forever forever always he was conscious of the minutes and hours ticking by the dying light the diminishing chances and yet when he finally brought the engine to a roar skidding down the snowy plateau and lifting away at last from the cursed island he still had hope that he could catch them that he could reach her the crater lagoon was empty even of the bergen so was the sea he swung his head in anxious search until his neck ached and saw nothing he flew over an ocean so lifeless that perhaps he had died and now was in a cold heaven or endless hell he was so damned tired his head was nodding his body ached his heart was a stone of sorrow how could life be so briefly sweet and then turn so quickly and frustratingly wrong again why had he left her at all god he hated antarctica and then from the corner of his eye he spotted a dark point amid the shards of icy white as he flew closer he realized it was extruding a tendril of smoke he glanced down the gas gauge was past empty and here was a ship realization slowly penetrated a ship it was greta hed made it elmers angel he wept as he put boreas in a long flat gliding dive to stretch his fuel leaning forward pushing the dornier by sheer will and then as he landed the plane on the sea a final time clipping the wave tops he finally saw the name on the hull he was chasing it was the norwegian whaler the aurora australis turning slowly toward him part two chapter twentyone pain subsides but memory just roots deeper greta was burned into harts brain like the afterdazzle of flash powder her face framed by fur as she watched icebergs the color of her eyes her body bathed by lantern light in the womblike grotto of the cave her fingers touching his sleeve as she asked him not to leave the ship not to leave her and that bright remembrance was shadowed by the darker tumor of jurgen drexler other mental images were etched by acid and sun fire the bite of polar wind the diseasecontorted bodies the tantalizing crack of light that made him crawl for the surface when muscle and will seemed utterly expended the ominous disappearance of schwabenland and the bergen antarctica was a song so exquisite and so vile that he could not get it could not get her out of his head and because of that he couldnt forget her nor replace her nor move past her hed lost her and yet somehow it wasnt over he knew it couldnt be over until they met again initially he simply gave way to despair as he lay on a musty cotton mattress in a storeroom of the aurora australis confined by the distrust of sigvald jansen lit by a caged bulb the steel chamber mercifully prevented much contact with the norwegian sailors still furious about their confrontation with the germans murderer one muttered at the pilot as he slid food through the doorway one of the whalers had been killed in the gun battle and two wounded hart learned for a while the whalers waited grimly for him to exhibit symptoms of the dread new disease he talked wildly about waited in both anticipation and fear but no symptoms appeared so he existed for a while outside of normal time in a debilitating fog of grief and longing and regret the sudden loss of greta and fritz was torment so great that at first he didnt think he could live that he would ever again want to live and yet he did live numbly automatically and slowly it was as if he was on a rack that was being ratcheted down day by agonizing day the loss became more bearable his choices became inevitabilities never to be reversed and his defeats a bitter peace the alternative was madness and as days turned to weeks while the whaler finished its interminable season and then slowly steamed home the hole in his heart began to scab over the future began to replace the past and determination eclipsed despair even if the expedition had become a tragic fiasco even if hed been given up for dead couldnt he get back into gretas life that must be his goal the norwegians whod been so thirsty for revenge that they gleefully rammed the boreas and sent the empty flying boat to the oceans bottom were puzzled was hart a german spy deserter or the refugee he claimed nothing he said could be verified the american claimed to have escaped from a new plague but had no sign of it he claimed to have found the bergen but had no proof in fact he claimed there was no proof that the missing ship had mysteriously disappeared from the caldera of a mysterious island its lagoon empty the last time he flew over so in the end jansen simply locked the american away and brooded about the strange clash with the nazis keeping hart confined all the way to norway the pilot promised jansen that a woman some german biologist could confirm his strange story and he even confided to sigvald his fantasies about reunion and rehabilitation he would describe to authorities the forbidding island he said then norwegian scientists could return next year armed and cautious but the pilots hopes came to nothing the american was a diplomatic and legal conundrum and so was confined in oslo while the norwegians considered what to do hart had not a shred of evidence and norway was reluctant to challenge nazi germany over such a baffling and in the context of recent developments trivial incident greta heinz not only did hart have no address there was no mention in the german press of her nor of the expedition for that matter or of the return of the schwabenland had the crippled ship gone down it was very odd hart pondered its the disease he suggested they want to keep their microbe secret their very silence proves what ive been saying of course and did hart have papers or passport all left on the ship he explained of course as the weeks and months passed the germans made no announcement of discovery of a new island and no complaint of a norwegian whaler interfering with reich biological sampling the norwegians in turn saw no reason to reveal to the germans the survival of the aurora australis the rescue and confinement of owen hart or his report on the fate of the bergen the nazis would learn all that when they returned to the island one day to find a norwegian flag fluttering in the harbor ahead of them assuming it even existed the pilot was freed in september by the turn of events poland had been invaded by germany and france and england had declared war brought to a hearing room hart was informed he was no longer wanted in norway but had limited options if he tried to make his claims public the government would be forced to respond to rumors of a tragic antarctic confrontation and the logical action would be to try hart the only member of the schwabenland in custody for the murder of the norwegian whaler whod died promised silence however would enable his release then let me go back to germany hart pleaded i need to learn what happened i need to find greta heinz im afraid its too late for that a minister said the reich has closed its borders weve arranged with the american embassy to issue new papers and a ticket out of norway if youll sign these forms absolving all parties of liability and agreeing to confidentiality about regrettable incidents in polar waters we prefer not to complicate our relations with germany at this time hart asked to be sent to england hed look for greta from there london absorbed him readily enough in its mammoth anonymity but contacting expedition members proved impossible if they were alive theyd been swallowed by the reich as remote as if on another planet the vacuum of information was maddening it was as if hart had dreamed the entire voyage he realized how little he knew about greta the sound and smell and touch of her was as vivid as his remembrance of what she looked like but her past was opaque he wrote letters unsigned and with only a london post box as a return address he assumed the letters would be steamed open and read by the german police to the reich interior air force forest and hunt ministries anything remotely connected to goring dear greta if you can read this thank god youre alive so am i in london can you join me they were cryptic he knew he wasnt a writer and besides he had no idea if she was alive or dead married or alone had she returned did she think him dead what was her situation what was her mood there was no reply at times he thought the uncertainty would kill him but of course it didnt kill him and day simply followed day nothing was getting in and out of germany that the nazis didnt wish like a hornets nest being wrapped in everdeeper layers of paper the third reich was being sealed up the political exodus of jews and intellectuals from germany was increasing and hart held unrealistic hopes that greta would materialize in the locomotive steam of a london train station expelled and ready to make a new life aimlessly gripped in depression he went to the platforms a few times and threaded through the crowds looking for her face in an exercise he knew was patently ridiculous other avenues proved a dead end the german embassy had closed the red cross had no record on its refugee lists his vigil was hopeless he was told and yet he had no interest in returning to america and being an ocean away from germany no interest in other women no interest in the larger world while world war ii walled off germany it also proved a psychological salvation for hart suddenly he was not alone in his inability to control events millions were being swept along a great dark river and he found refuge in work the american became a flight instructor for the royal air force throwing himself into the task with grim purpose the pilots were so young many confided they hoped a glamorous skill might keep them out of the trenches of this new war their escape became his own he lost himself in the air the training fields raf flight captain slowly befriended the quiet remote american once expressing curiosity at harts reluctance to take advantage of wartime opportunities with women the pilot confided his despair over greta in love with a jerry the man marveled best to keep a lid on that little secret old chap and better to give her up and get on with your life if shes alive shes entombed in a bloody madhouse shes the only reason i want a life owen responded shes the one who let me come back to life dont let her rob you of it now yugoslavia greece north africa russia a drumbeat of defeat if greta was still alive she was caught in a web of monstrous dimension a new empire that stretched from normandy to the caucasus and from the arctic circle to the sahara then came pearl harbor with americas entry into the war hart joined the us army air corps in england and was tapped for reconnaissance and intelligence because of his fluency in german harts superiors did not appreciate his opinion that the germans were no more likely to crack under strategic bombing than the british had but they acknowledged his skill at interrogating captured enemy pilots on a few occasions hart volunteered for reconnaissance flights over europe his planes were pounded by flak and hounded by fighter planes and yet he found the experience oddly dispassionate his emotional shell his spore coat he thought wryly had grown so necessarily thick that it was like watching his own peril from a distance even if he could still fear the long agonizing minutes it would take to plunge from twenty thousand feet death itself promised a certain peace his emotions were further confused by the realization that in an indirect way he could be helping to kill greta he sometimes looked at the great fires raging below and imagined her trapped within them and yet when he was honest with himself he did not think she was dead or likely to die he felt he would know instantly if that happened that the whole fabric of the universe would seem to come undone and moreover that destiny had more in store for them for owen hart then most of world war ii was a period of endless waiting waiting so prolonged and dreadful that time itself seemed to have been repealed yet finally it was the fall of the allied forces had liberated most of france and the pilot experienced one of those encounters that suggest fate rules life a meeting that replaced five years of despair with a thread of hope enough hope to fuel desperation a prisoner was asking for owen hart and his name was otto kohl american military policemen saluted smartly as major hart strode down the gloomy corridor of a former mental hospital his boots echoing on hardwood floors that neglect had robbed of any sheen the pilots face was a mask struggling to hide rising excitement kohl owen had occasionally searched the ballooning lists of german prisoners for some connection to the past but had known it was as futile as elbowing the crowds of london train stations and yet here was otto popping up out of nowhere asking for him one of countless germans whod been swept up after the fall of paris his fleeing mercedes reportedly found overheated and sprung out from the weight of wine cases gilt picture frames a hoard of jewelry and a gallic mistress thirty years his junior the french woman had been seized by nearby villagers and shaved bald the german however was whisked away for an interrogation in which he boasted of highranking connections the selfimportance had won him temporary confinement in a political prison established at the abandoned mental institution during the occupation its regular inmates had mysteriously disappeared the war had left its dreary mark the steel bars were pastdue for painting the elevator cage was grounded heavy with dust the green of the walls had darkened from restful to sick a gurney had been abandoned in one corner its gray sheet stained with gray blood the small office used for interrogation was barren except for a table and two chairs lateautumn sun made a geometric pattern on the walls from the wire mesh on the windows the temperature was cold and there at the table was otto kohl dressed in prison fatigues with his ankles manacled the german blinked and tentatively smiled as hart came in looking almost shy he stood awkwardly owen kohl greeted hoarsely back from the dead hart sat down and kohl hesitantly followed the german looked older his hair grayer and yet the war seemed not to have treated him badly well fed just back from antarctica otto the ship didnt wait kohl bobbed his head anxiously yes obviously not but then the report was that youd died in a heroic aerial rescue attempt its a miracle my finding you alive like this fortune is curious no not half as curious as i am so the ship had definitely survived he stared at kohl remembering the dinner at karinhall greta in the firelight what in hell are you doing here kohl nodded excitedly exactly exactly the right question ive been telling my captors for weeks that i have no military connections that im simply a businessman a government facilitator a minor functionary i dont belong in a cage i should be employed in reconstruction in reconciliation where i can help people its a tragic waste my being here hart appeared to consider this then he opened his folder it says here you looted half the loire valley thats an outrageous interpretation i simply served as an importexport link to germany that you had a chateau there and a town house in paris that you cut a social swath in occupation and vichy circles that you wore a swastika in your lapel by day and haunted the cabarets at night that you were a black market profiteer a womanizer that you arranged the transshipment of slave labor no kohl shook his head vigorously anxiously no no no reports spread by the jealous by my enemies by captives anxious to save their own skin by spreading false stories all with no basis in fact i was simply directed to help with the economic integration of germany and france when my presence in washington became impossible hart said nothing ive tried to explain to your supervisors that im a man of business owen a man of vision a man of science i cited the antarctica expedition that was the true otto kohl organizing expeditions to explore the natural world id even included an american i said an international effort and then one of your interrogators a colonel cathcart mentioned you he said that youd referred to such an expedition and that you were here alive in france and it was electric revelatory a bolt of lightning i couldnt believe it and so of course i asked for you owen hart my old friend the man who could identify me for what i really am hart studied the german dubiously i could learn nothing about the expedition after its return yes it was kept confidential not even word of my own fate it was as if id vanished no mention no credit no reward do you think that didnt trouble me to have recruited you and then such a cruel illness it was a tragedy and we wanted of course to send your back pay but there were no relatives no address how did you know that but then the entire antarctic expedition had gone seriously awry and how did you know that otto he stopped know what that i died of an illness earlier you said i died in a heroic aerial rescue attempt he frowned did i say that did i say illness i meant that was my assumption our assumption it was the natural we were in antarctica not panama there are no illnesses there except perhaps frostbite so what did they tell you of my death kohl appeared to be doing an inner calculus weighing what owen wanted to hear well there was talk of a discovery a dread new disease you were one of the casualties people felt very bad about your death drexler declared his intention to return the following season to perform more cuttingedge research except except the war the british navy was blocking the way hart stood restless and paced around the small room kohls eyes nervously following five years of questions were bubbling in the pilots mind he stopped and studied the german narrowly so you know of no weapons program arising from the expedition absolutely not i simply met the ship and learned you were missing along with some other crew members heiden told me theyd escaped from this disease and crazy whalers there was damage it was very bewildering other crew members who else was missing well no one really that i knew soldiers i guess certainly the important people were all there heiden drexler greta there was a pause kohl gave his interrogator a careful look no harts spirits sank not at first not at the docking but she came up afterward with drexler she seemed quiet subdued hustled off to the station rather quickly probably couldnt wait to get off the ship hart leaned forward where did she go kohl bit his lip considering dont get me wrong owen im hesitating only because of what i heard there was talk on the ship that that you and greta were more than simply colleagues more than friends is this true where did she go dammit so you were lovers hart was quiet looking at the calculating kohl then he leaned slowly forward again his voice tight why ask questions when you know the answers kohl leaned away from the american he was sweating despite the rooms chill and wiped his forehead with his sleeve its funny how our positions have reversed isnt it owen why did you want to see me otto kohl automatically glanced about fritzs german glance instinctive after more than a decade in the third reich and leaned forward himself his own voice fell to a whisper i can help you hart sat back thats rich how can you help me i have information you want always the salesman hart said making no effort to hide his contempt so what are your wares i can help you get greta out hart went rigid what get her out of the reich germany is losing the war owen everyone can see that the noose is tightening but youwe could get her out you and me before its too late hart felt unsteady why he managed why would we do that because even though she believes youre dead shes never stopped loving you she would escape with you im sure of it my idea well my plan is that you and i will contact her and then youll fly us both to safety thats why i asked for you you can find her oh yes why should i believe you believe it i know the exact address no the part about her still loving me why would she confide such feelings to you because greta heinz is my daughter kohl said hart jerked as if struck and he continued jurgen drexler is my soninlaw chapter twentytwo like a wilderness lit by lightning germany was a dark flickering void at night the necessary wartime blackout robbed it of the illumination of civilization turning its nocturnal hours as opaque as those of the middle ages from the air where hart and kohl flew in a light plane only far horizons blinked artillery and antiaircraft fire distant flames the searchlights of probing air defenses these were the signs that the third reich remained inhabited somewhere in the abyss below greta still lived hart had simply left it was a necessity the american air force would never permit him to go behind enemy lines to look for a woman so hed taken a plane and risked the loss of one empty life in a gamble for another kohl had thought their scheme through the pair commandeered a jeep telling harts superiors that the wily german was going to lead owen to a cache of stolen art near paris in return for the americans plea for leniency but instead of hunting for impressionist loot hart accompanied kohl to a forger who supplied them with reich papers in return for all the dollars he could extort from the americans savings this was followed by the borrowing of a light plane to allegedly fly the informant otto kohl reputed vessel of critical strategic information to third army headquarters it will work if we move quickly enough kohl promised and it had once the fugitives were aloft they turned and streaked low in the night for berlin skimming treetops to stay off radar screens theyll presume youre shot down and missing kohl explained if it soothes your conscience you can play the spy your superiors would gladly give up a light plane to get a ground observation of conditions in berlin how do we get back kohl exuded confidence i have a farm on the outskirts of the capital we hide the airplane there contact greta then fly to switzerland i have access to money enough to grease the proper palms the swiss will help us invent new lives and well go on to wherever we want to go and greta will come with us thats up to you of course hart had gambled everything she would and yet he couldnt help wondering about her marriage to drexler should he believe ottos assurances that it was a loveless union that greta carried a torch for her sofarassheknew dead american pilot was the relationship that of two people leading parallel but separate lives he questioned the german more closely i never quite understood the hold jurgen seemed to have on her he said what is the basis of it kohl stared somberly out the cockpit window seeming to pluck memories from the inky darkness even before jurgen he began there was a man a husband in fact an older german biologist at the university of hamburg in retrospect the attraction wasnt entirely surprising gretas mother had died in childbirth and i well i was abroad a lot the girl was raised in convent and boarding schools kohl shook his head wearily her childhood was lonely owen that was my fault of course he went on to explain that the awkward union abruptly ended when professor heinz died in an automobile accident for greta it was a crushing blow and not just because of the loss of his security shed curtailed her own studies for the marriage its end meant her career as an unproven female biologist in a maledominated profession suddenly held meager promise both her mentor and her academic momentum were gone kohl had come back to germany from washington dc to help his daughter decide her future and improve his own connections to the reich government he quickly decided she must find a new husband some bright young official likely to emerge at the top of the new regime a man who would prove as useful to him as to her and so hed cultivated drexler the posterboy nazi who in turn saw kohl as a quickwitted advisor with friends and connections kohl took greta to a party celebrating the fuhrers birthday and persuaded drexler to be there too the young nazi was clearly smitten a moth to a flame yet she was hesitant yes he was handsome bright and ambitious yes his vision of germanys future was heady even thrilling and he campaigned for her doggedly it was flattering women thought him gorgeous hes just a bit cold papa she confided i mean preoccupied i suspect hes already married to his career all successful men have the mistress of their work that man could be your future our future hell open doors for you she sighed i know hes an amazing person but he doesnt always seem to see what i see care for what i care for sometimes we run out of things to talk about hes actually a bit awkward with women perhaps not with the people in power then drexler let slip the coming antarctic expedition boasting that hed been picked to represent its political side goring himself was the power behind it those who accompanied it would become heroes and the science team for the voyage was being assembled for kohl the expedition was an answer to a prayer it just so happened that he had a brilliant young biologist to suggest for the ships company and while her presence as a woman was unusual for a reich sea voyage it would give drexler the time to really get to know her greta was uncertain what if she and jurgen fell out but she was also thrilled antarctica shed be the first german woman to visit the place it was heady momentous the biologist felt her abilities merited a second chance to establish her professional reputation she asked the young nazi if he was recruiting her as a capable scientist or as a woman im recruiting the best person i can find drexler replied the memory of the day greta received confirmation shed been accepted for the expedition came back to kohl now as a gust of wind buffeted the plane you should have been there owen the german said she was delirious never had i seen her so radiant suddenly his face darkened the exact opposite of the girl who was returned to me three months later when the schwabenland tied up at the hamburg docks hart continued staring straight ahead though his fingers were beginning to feel moist and clammy on the controls she told you about about us kohl nodded through her tears after her narration of the events leading well to your death she went back to being numb i wasnt sure quite how to deal with her what to say but jurgen was whats your american term johnnyonthespot he made it his mission to distract greta from her grief i tell you the man was a force of nature he would not be denied and in time greta relented she had no momentum of her own no direction and jurgen he is direction kohl smiled bitterly myself i thought this is the best thing for her but it wasnt said hart his eyes lowered to check the compass heading still on course jurgen is very complex admirable in so many ways but also ive come to realize undeveloped he is like a child who battles for a toy only to tire of it once it ceases to be an object of contention i have no doubt that were someone to try to wrest away his plunder he would show his claws but it is not because he derives much enjoyment from it my daughters loneliness is profound the dull ache that had resided in harts chest since returning from antarctica now filled him completely but he said nothing germany dark wounded continued to unreel beneath them their plan was hopeless in its sheer simple audacity the pilot knew somehow get into berlin somehow find greta somehow persuade her to abandon her husband somehow avoid drexlers claws somehow escape to switzerland somehow make a new life somehow it was the clearest plan hart had had in six years they flew on and the sky began to lighten fires glowed on the horizon and by harts dead reckoning they were about twenty miles from berlin soon theyd cross the flak batteries to be aloft at daylight would be suicide wheres that farm of yours swing that way we cross the autobahn and then several miles beyond hart was nervous their plane had american markings we have to get out of the sky soon or were going to be jumped by a prowling fighter if we dont get the plane hidden well be trapped in germany be patient they flew in anxious silence for several more minutes then kohl pointed all right werders in that direction and i recognize my buildings beautiful from the air you can put down in that pasture they bumped down in the dawn light and taxied up to the barn climbing out stiff and weary somewhere a rooster crowed it looks like the germany i remember hart said glancing about tidy caretakers come but not for a few days here help me push this plane into the barn they rolled it forward the wings sliding over empty stalls another vehicle was already inside under a tarp and hart peeked a mercedes no petrol kohl explained and a vehicle invites inspection well bicycle its several hours into the city hart nodded i didnt know you were so athletic otto im not merely cautious were in the heart of nazi germany there were only occasional signs of the war at berlins edge a bombers burnedout husk had skidded to the edge of a school yard silvery strings of chaff dropped by allied planes to confuse radar were draped on autumn trees like christmas tinsel a line of waterfilled bomb craters marched across a field to record an allied miss as they pedaled into the suburbs they found a checkerboard of normalcy and destruction here a street retained an aura of prewar order there a stick of bombs had fallen to splinter four houses and a park at berlins core the ruin became more complete they passed whole neighborhoods that had been reduced to ridges of shattered masonry blocks and streets undulating like a series of sand dunes rising above this manmade talus were the ghostly ruins of gutted buildings that had not yet completely collapsed empty window openings lighting apartments that no longer existed kohl wobbled his bicycle around a litter of broken glass and stopped to pant are you all right otto not my tailbone i may never walk again the pause made hart nervous passing germans barely glanced at them but half the men he saw were in uniform a word from kohl and he was betrayed what reassured him was the devastation kohl wouldnt wish to stay here and owen hart was his only exit is she nearby she was grimacing he hoisted himself back onto the seat pray that your airplanes havent gotten to her neighborhood they pedaled on jurgen and greta had been lucky the town houses on their treelined avenue stood ranked and redoubtable with prewar confidence a milk wagon trundled reassuringly down the pavement normalcy kohl pointed that one it was four stories as fashionable as a new york brownstone jurgen drexler had done well it seemed confronted by the mans intact home hart suddenly felt doubt it was the kind of house hed never had and perhaps never would have strong secure stylish the kind of home a woman would like i cant visit her in his house no of course not kohl said that would be dangerous they have servants and maybe even a security guard who knows jurgen is a standartenfuhrer now a colonel in the civilian branch of the ss he moves in the highest circles which means his telephone is probably tapped but ill approach briefly any staff present should take only casual note even if im recognized they may assume i escaped france and am on routine travels ill explain the situation and then leave to do some business i have some money to assemble in berlin before we go now as for you theres a statue of frederick the great opposite the bebelplatz not far from the hotel adlon where you once stayed do you remember it about a mile east of here hart nodded uncertainly meet her there in an hour understood yes but what if she doesnt kohl held his hand up looking back at the imposing town house hart noticed now that its windows were blank covered with blackout coverings it would be dim inside shell come chapter twentythree king frederick was another casualty of war his tricornered hat had been chipped by shrapnel and one of his eyes had become an empty socket some of the buildings surrounding the bebelplatz remained intact but others had folded in on themselves debris spilling from their pulverized interiors like an avalanche chute hart arrived early and too anxious to sit paced around the plaza stepping around fragments of masonry and keeping an eye on fredericks mounted figure passing germans ignored him hurrying by on missions of their own no one had checked his forged papers the robotic bureaucracy of the third reich was beginning to corrode from the prospect of defeat but his anxiety at meeting greta had grown almost six years shed been twentyeight and unmarried then he braced himself for a betrayal of memory and yet betrayal didnt come as she approached through the square he recognized her instantly the walk the plume of glorious red hair even the upright bearing of her head when so many faces seemed cast downward he sucked in his breath she was as lovely as he remembered and much more stylishly dressed her erect carriage reflected the assurance of high station she strode past the ruins in a long wool coat trimmed in fur and in fashionable boots her heels clicking on the paving stones a string of pearls was at her neck drexler hart admitted was a good provider yet when she slowed and then stopped several feet short of him looking without expression hart noticed something more a new gravity in her face a tautness from emotions held in check her gaze was so objective so analytical he feared for a moment that whatever hold hed once had on her was gone erased by time she blinked in wonder so it is really you her tone revealed nothing hello greta he said swallowing i told you id come back her eyes roamed his face taking it in i thought you dead and yet here you stand in the middle of berlin she judged him clinically youve hardly changed youre prettier i think she gave no reaction to the compliment looking at him as if he was a phantom her detachment disturbed him he swallowed and reached into his coat pocket i had this made in london in ive been waiting a long time to give it to you he put out his hand draped on his fingers was a gold chain with a locket please take it after a moments hesitation she did so their fingers touched and she gave a little jerk as if shed been shocked then she held the jewelry looking at it as if in a trance open it the locket was gold and shaped like a penguin she clicked it open there was a word engraved inside hope and a dull pebble the pebble is from the cave i found it in my boot its a gift like the penguins give she looked at the pebble for a long time as if shed never seen a stone before he waited watching her sway slightly in a rush of memory then she began to tremble lifting eyes that were misting with tears shed allowed herself finally to believe her mouth opened oh owen her voice caught its really you and then the space between them seemed to dissolve of its own accord and he was holding her clutching her through the rich wool of her coat his face buried in her hair and inhaling her wonderful scent i thought you were dead she exclaimed i thought id killed you that id failed you she wore perfume he marveled she dressed up for me and then her cry was stifled as he kissed her tasting the salt of her tears kissed her heedless of who was watching kissed her with the urgent longing of six missing years she kissed back with desperate need aching and then pushed him away owen my god do you know how many times ive dreamed of such a moment but not here not now please he glanced around grinning in triumph an old woman with a string bag scowled but a younger one smiled in passing wistfully he held greta by the shoulders unwilling to let go i tried to write he explained tried to reach you but nothing seemed to get through the tears were running freely down her cheeks i thought youd died she repeated all these years not a word not a whisper and yet here you are come back to life come back to this earthly hell of berlin she was taking deep gulping breaths her breasts rising against his chest her eyes still wide with wonder come back to me and then she threw back her head and gave a shout of laughter suddenly shockingly gaily and now at last for just this one instant i am so happy my whole life and all its pain made worthwhile by this single moment she smiled her face glistening hart tenderly stroked her wet cheek whoa whoa he said with a grin its just a pebble no wonder the male penguins find it so effective she shook her head such a different world such an age ago antarctica has seemed like a dream and a nightmare and yet here you are resurrected how why my god the questions your organism worked greta it worked on me it even worked on fritz but then we captured your father and flew its a long story she nodded uncertainly bewildered but excited it worked it cured fritz i know it did then he was killed in the cave the entrance collapsed my god her gaze turned serious brooding we should have tested it more thoroughly have you heard that the allies finally succeeded with penicillin how many germans could we have saved in this war she shook her head always regret so many regrets well she looked at the locket she was still holding deciding and then looked at him shyly will you put this on me he glanced around with amusement do you dare would it raise questions she looked out at the ruined buildings immensely sad for a moment yes of course it would raise questions but right now i want to feel its weight on my neck ill wear it inside my dress and take it off later he took the chain and locket and she turned pulling her hair up to reveal the ivory of her neck he fastened it she fingered the penguin a moment smiling shyly now and then slipped it down the front of her dress she shivered it makes my heart beat faster he smiled greta ive come to get you out from germany and the war she was sober thats impossible no it isnt i have a plane your father has money and papers owen things have changed so much otto told me about the marriage he also said you still loved me thats why i came greta her head lowered its a marriage in name more than practice she admitted i thought i could change him teach him happiness he thought he could win me give me purpose but too much had happened in antarctica so you dont love him i do in a way her voice was very small he was there for me owen when you werent just not in the same way he touched her cheek ive never stopped loving you greta never for a moment i thought id have to wait to search for you after the war but then otto appeared like a miracle and i came in an instant ive left my unit ive thrown my old life away and now i want you to come away with me you know germany is finished the nazis have made a mess of the world your father and i want to fly you to switzerland to a new life she shook her head trembling owen it isnt that simple there are vows duty country greta if you stay here with jurgen youll be killed berlin is going to become a battlefield we can have happiness if we have the courage to grasp it she closed her eyes i married jurgen owen married him if youd come back with us it might have been different but you didnt did you know he even went ashore in the rough seas at the end of the storm to look for you he said there was no sign my airplane was there i was in the cave there was a collapse greta shook her head i dont know about all that it was a painful subject for both of us i didnt want to remember she glanced around my god leave everything my work my home my husband for happiness greta you owe yourself that she looked torn all this is so sudden so bewildering papa appearing at my door you back from the dead i feel dazed she shivered collecting herself then looked at him with fierce hope i want to start over owen you must know that i want to start over far from germany and far from antarctica as far as we can get she nodded but i dont want to hurt jurgen i accepted his comfort i must think about all this greta youre all ive ever wanted i couldnt bear to lose you again she sighed torn when would we leave now well walk to your house for your things then we disappear before jurgen even knows im alive he put his hand out fingered the chain of her locket no she said shaking her head i must think she held him away think for myself instead of for the men in my life you and jurgen and papa she took a deep breath ill give you my answer tomorrow owen here at noon ill bring what i need to escape if ive decided to come with you but you have to wait until then hide in the ruins and speak to no one greta please life doesnt give many chances we have to go now before its too late she seemed to waver then clenched her fists in resolve are you going to meet my father later it was a groan tell him noon tomorrow she put her finger to his lips give me time owen time to listen to my head and to my heart chapter twentyfour greta wandered the citys battered streets alone for a while trying to reassert control over her emotions she didnt expect happiness anymore not after losing her first husband and then owen and then in a different way jurgen a man whod taken her back and then come to regard their soulless union as his own fitting selfpunishment refusing to give her up and taking some kind of perverse strength from the pain of their proximity shed traded happiness for the surface accomplishments of home and career traded hope for resignation and dully moved through a succession of days she waited she supposed for a bomb to take her now shed been shocked back into life shocked back to longing to desire and yes to betrayal the impact of seeing owen again was enough for her to consider leaving her husband her home her country and the dry possessions of an empty existence she could almost taste the promised freedom her finger traced the golden chain around her neck the penguin locket warmed by the skin of her breast jurgen had given her gift after gift and become frustrated that his presents didnt help but rather hurt seeming to add to her selfimposed burden of sin at having let owen die shed hated herself for hating jurgens effort now everything was turned upside down her husband again a victim of her romantic confusion she dreaded going back to their home to face him dreaded having to decide whether to betray him once again but autumn dusk was falling on an increasingly dangerous city and her town house beckoned as the only sensible destination at its steps she unfastened the locket and slipped it into a pocket of her dress frau drexler its late we were worried are you all right yes ingrid greta pulled off her coat and handed it to the maid who slung it over her arm i had to walk and think and lost track of time is jurgen home no not yet of course not yet as the war deepened drexlers days had grown longer he often missed dinner pleading work greta suspected a mistress or at least the periodic whore and was secretly relieved at not feeling guilt over that aspect of their estrangement as well while polite and companionable in public they slept in separate bedrooms in the toolarge echoing town house rattling about while tens of thousands remained homeless from the bombing the houses size allowed them to avoid their marriage i wont be requiring a formal dinner tonight ingrid im feeling a bit under the weather and will just take a bite in my room tell herr drexler i retired early as you wish todays caller he disturbed me ingrid a face from the past please dont mention the visitor to my husband as you wish she bit her lip ingrid confided that instruction to arnold the cook as she collected a light dinner i think the fuhrer would say a german wife doesnt keep secrets she commented disapprovingly i think the fuhrer would say the german servant does what she is told he responded greta distractedly paced her suite struggling with her emotions why hadnt she just run away with owen why come back here to torture herself because she did retain some feelings for jurgen she told herself for his loyalty and for the pain of his disappointment when he realized shed never love him as he loved her she sat on her bed and stared numbly at her open wardrobes what would she take if she left practical clothes some money but not all of it she couldnt do that to jurgen not much more than a shoulder bag to keep from arousing suspicion the resulting narrow choice was daunting and yet it was odd how little the clothes meant to her now that she contemplated giving them up they seemed like an anchor she could finally cut loose from the problem was deciding to take anything of this past she lay back on the bed thinking of owen wishing shed kissed him longer wishing he were beside her now wishing theyd never met and she didnt have this monstrous choice she awoke with a start shed fallen asleep it was dark the house quiet groggily she sat up and turned on a light after midnight there was a tray of untouched food that ingrid had left on the night stand her bag and clothes were strewn next to her on the bed she got up went to the door and opened it quietly downstairs was dark the house filled with shadow everyone must be asleep she closed the door again restless her mind churning perhaps she should draw a bath to relax she shed her clothes on the cold tile and waited impatiently for the tub to fill idly she stooped to retrieve the locket from her dress pocket the penguin would go in her shoulder bag until she and owen were safely away she opened the piece again and looked at the pebble smiling to herself in remembrance her fear of the cave the frightening and strange lake their lovemaking on the rough woolen blankets impulsively she closed the locket and slipped it on looking at herself in the bathroom mirror it hung just above her breasts as if nesting between two hills its glow fueled by her own warmth she studied herself critically turning to look at her back the swell of her hips would owen still think her attractive hed told her she was pretty shed liked that no one had told her that in a long time she went to the tub shut off the taps and carefully stepped in the water was hot her feet tingling after the chill of the tile floor she stood a moment in pleasure as steam rose to dew on her hair the down of the soft delta between her thighs curling slightly then she lowered herself gasping gratefully and lay back floating in the heat she felt herself calm as the warmth crept inside her she looked down her breasts floated like twin icebergs the penguin swimming between them and the image brought a smile meeting owen already seemed like a dream except that here was tangible evidence smooth and hard for nearly six years hed carried this jewelry it was an amazing thought she soaped a sponge and squeezed a glacier of suds slid down from her neck to melt into the southern ocean greta the white continent she let her knees break clear of the water atropos island her lap was the volcanic caldera and the cave well she knew where that was she felt herself there it was as if her body was awakening from a long slumber faintly embarrassed she pulled her fingers away her mind had hibernated as well she realized owens reported death had destroyed her interest in antarctica shed published no papers and written no reports from the voyage which was veiled in official secrecy anyway it was beginning to come back to her now the whales the krill her microscope the hideous petri dishes and their spawn she hugged herself think of owen she told herself think of his strong hands his mouth on your throat the whales the war had severely curtailed research of the natural world her university supervisors remained condescending and opportunities to collect new specimens had been shut off it had become impossible even to keep up with developments in biology and after the inevitable german defeat what then it would not be easy for the countrys scientists in america however science would explode could she reconstruct a career the possibility intrigued her she was going to leave with owen she realized the decision had been made she was planning a future something she hadnt done in a long time then the lights went out startled she sat upright it wasnt unusual to have the power fail during the raids and yes there it was the mournful wail of an air raid siren prodding at the sleeping city in the night damn shed never been caught in the bath before and it was disorienting she stood water streaming off her doors were slamming as arnold and ingrid and jurgen hurried downstairs she was so tired of retreating to the cellar in the night but then that was the point of the raids wasnt it to make jerry tired she lifted one foot out of the tub put her weight on it and slipped coming down with a crash water sloshed out with her spilling across the floor clumsy greta she fumbled in the dark for towels it felt comical to be mopping naked on her hands and knees in the dark the siren droned on she stood finally sore and felt her way to the bathroom door her bedroom was just as dark she groped toward the end table with her arms outstretched scolding herself planning to find the oil lamp and matches so she could have light to get dressed then the door burst open greta it was jurgen he was dressed in hastily pulled on trousers and a sleeveless undershirt holding a lamp instinctively she used her hands to cover what she could of herself and they both froze a moment in surprise he hadnt seen her nude in years he stared his intended statement choked off what are you doing here she managed you should be in the cellar so should you he closed the door behind him and stepped forward emboldened by their words i was worried when you didnt come i thought perhaps you hadnt awakened with the sirens his voice was hoarse his eyes roamed her she didnt like it she turned and briskly lifted her beds comforter heedlessly spilling her bag and clothes on the floor she pulled it around her standing straighter this is my room you never come to my room he set the lamp on a table aroused now irked at her covering our room were married remember my room you know you keep to your own that was your decision as much as mine my goodness you frightened me storming in like that the bombers caught me in the bath i nearly broke a leg he was looking at her hungrily sadly she looked away it made her uncomfortable guilty wed better get to the cellar she limped to a dresser and pulled out a nightgown please dont watch surprisingly he obeyed she dropped the comforter and swiftly pulled the bedclothes over herself while his eyes cast impatiently about the room they came to the heap by the bed a look of doubt appeared when she tried to move past him he caught her arm wait he pointed to the clothes and bag whats that are you going somewhere she looked at the heap as if surprised it was there im simply sorting clothes in the middle of the night jurgen i fell asleep they could begin to hear the stuttering pop of antiaircraft guns hurry we must go she pulled but his grip tightened a bath too in the middle of the night to help me get back to sleep stop holding me he seized her then by both shoulders yanking her close ill hold you all i wish im your husband dammit jurgen she twisted in his grasp she couldnt stand this intimacy not now not this night if you dont let us get down to the cellar were both going to be killed he bent then to kiss her roughly angrily and she turned her face away stop it pulling one arm free she slapped him the impact stinging her palm get control of yourself for a fraction of a second he looked shocked then he instinctively shoved she went flying backward slamming down on her bed with a whoof they glared at each other panting somewhere they heard the dull concussion of falling bombs finally he nodded sneering fine find your own way to the cellar live alone frigid like an ice queen he picked up the lamp and moved toward the door stopping to contemplate her you know ive given you everything greta in return for nothing no she said without thinking i lost everything bitch he seized the handle to go out then he stopped hesitated and swung about again what did you say she was silent what do you mean you lost everything when what are you referring to jurgen just go he was suspicious now he raised the lamp peering at her whats that her heart began to accelerate whats what that thing on your neck he walked into the room again striding toward the bed instinctively her hand went up to her throat shed forgotten she was still wearing the locket just some jewelry she grasped it in protection leave it alone his hand fastened over hers the powerful fingers prying hers open then he grabbed the locket and yanked the chain snapping he held it up the golden penguin swung rhythmically in the dim light she stared at it dumbly a penguin he said this flatly considering shades of antarctica an odd choice given our history i dont recall giving you this she was flushed her skin prickling she hoped he couldnt notice in the lamplight i found it myself in a shop two christmases ago when we went to bavaria really he snapped it open hope he read now theres an appropriate sentiment for this stage of the war he turned the locket over and the small pebble fell into his palm and a piece of grit left inside sloppy no he tossed it onto the carpet where it was lost in the dark watching the frantic flicker of her eyes yet i dont remember this piece and i remember everything the thud of bombs was growing in volume she closed her eyes jurgen please lets go to the cellar where its safe this wouldnt have caught my attention except for the visitor you had today some mysterious older man and then you put on your outdoor coat and disappear in a hurry not returning until dark why was that greta i think youre mistaken not according to ingrid he smiled thinly ingrid who knows better than to keep secrets from me ingrid is a silly gossip who exaggerates he laughed i think its called telling the truth my dear if she is talking behind my back i want her fired when you have no power greta everyone betrays you everyone he dangled the penguin in front of her face a mysterious visitor a new bauble the disorder of packing my darling wife what is going on another bomb closer this time the window rattled how dare you pry into my private business how dare you keep things from me he swung the penguin again from his fingers studying her carefully she watched as if hypnotized thinking desperately she dared not betray owen it its from my father she finally stammered he came today a quick visit as he passes through ingrid she knew might have passed on a description that jurgen would recognize as fitting kohl ah he flipped the piece up and bunched it in his fist then looked hard at her otto in berlin how surprising i thought hed disappeared in france he just showed up i was startled he gave the locket to me he said he got it in paris that it reminded him of me of the expedition hes worried about the bombing and invited me to to accompany him on a trip a business trip i was going to ask you about it at breakfast drexlers face was impassive i see theres no secret jurgen ingrid thought there was you know how she jumps to conclusions silence he probed and were you going to come back from this trip she looked at him then a long time summoning her courage this was the point of no return wasnt it this was the time to finally tell the truth to him and to herself no im leaving you jurgen she tried to keep her voice steady but it caught he still thinks owen is dead she reminded herself so his face betrayed the hollowness that antarctica had left in their relationship youre leaving me here now at a time when germany is in such crisis i dont love you anymore her voice was a whisper but she realized suddenly that the statement was true i never learned to love you as a wife should and i want to get out from under the threat of the bombs theres nothing in our marriage to hold me here papa knows that hes known for a long time drexler looked as if he was in physical pain when when will you leave tomorrow i think my god how long have you been planning this i havent planned it it just happened im sorry jurgen you should leave berlin too but not with me i cant abandon the reich his tone was still stunned ill never abandon the reich you know that she nodded i know and i wont sacrifice my life for it not anymore i want my life back jurgen i want me back we each thought we could change the other and we failed his eyes roamed the room as if looking for a clue but i still love you it was plaintive there was another boom and the window rattled nervously the bombs were getting closer im sorry jurgen please lets go to the cellar if that window shatters we could be hurt he nodded but didnt move is this why otto sneaked back to get you she shrugged he was thinking aloud yet why would a coward like otto kohl risk coming back to berlin to fetch a daughter hes ignored his whole life somehow i doubt it to fetch some illgotten money his war profiteering that i could understand jurgen the bombs there was another explosion nearer and the window rattled again and how did he get here jurgen i dont know please and he buys you jewelry he looked at the penguin puzzled then he slipped it in his pocket well would you have informed me at all if we hadnt had this little confrontation i doubt it left even a note probably not she cast her eyes downward i might have followed you know jurgen please this is hard i dont want to hurt you just let me go ah of course just say goodbye to six years of marriage poof well its charming this little reunion of yours with papa but i feel left out as im sure you can see otto kohl magically materializes very odd i think i want otto to come for dinner tomorrow night my curiosity has been aroused well discuss the future then yes greta swallowed and nodded shed be gone by then and youll let me go another bomb went off and he stood ive never wanted a woman who doesnt want me his voice was strained as he said it hurry then lets go to the cellar the next morning there was a stranger in gretas kitchen he wore a black ss uniform and was reading the newspaper as if he owned the place his chair was positioned near the rear door whos this greta demanded the security policeman gave no answer ingrid making an elaborate show of polishing the teapot glanced at the man as if noticing him for the first time your husband invited him here for your security she said she avoided gretas eye i need no special security herr drexler said you do now the maid looked at her smugly as if this had been just what she expected greta could have strangled her oh really and where is herr drexler hes gone out then im going out too she marched to the front foyer to fetch her coat there was a second ss man there his chair by the door he watched her impassively as she put the coat on saying nothing when she moved toward the door he stood politely braced im sorry frau drexler your husband has deemed it unsafe to go outside today weve been asked to ensure your protection in this house nonsense i have an appointment get out of the way im sorry frau drexler she hesitated am i a prisoner in my own home im sorry frau drexler may i take your coat she stood in the foyer frightened and furious the night had been dreadful and she was tired jurgen had said nothing more during the air raid but appeared to be brooding instead of going to his bed after the bombing hed gone to his study and began working the telephone searching for intact lines shed been furious with him for keeping her locket but feared that an argument over the jewelry might betray owen so shed gone to her own room but couldnt sleep worrying how much hed guessed their own telephone had rung early in the morning and jurgen answered immediately now he was gone if she missed the noon rendezvous papa and owen might dare come here did jurgen really think her so hapless she surrendered her coat to the sentry well in that case greta retreated to the dining room and ate breakfast alone what did jurgen know what would jurgen do she went to the study to check the cache of reichsmarks and gold coin theyd stored for an emergency it was gone of course she had to act before he did if i am to be a prisoner in my own house she announced loudly in the kitchen then im going to take a nap i barely slept last night ingrid and arnold avoided her defiant gaze they knew something was seriously wrong you two she said pointing at them had better dust and polish thoroughly for once my father is coming tonight arnold shot ingrid a sour look ill check on your progress at noon she packed hurriedly her mind set and her indecision gone underwear a pair of trousers a sweater she wore a wool dress and the boots from yesterday plus her strand of pearls maybe they could be hocked if the couple needed money she found the pebble on her bedroom carpet wrapped it in a fragment of ribbon and slipped it inside her bra hope she whispered to herself touching the bump she glanced about her room but felt no nostalgia it had been a cell long before this morning shouldering her bag she slipped out of the bedroom and locked the door behind her then she climbed to the fourthfloor servants quarters and went to the attic hatchway reaching up to pull a ladder descended goodbye jurgen she whispered she climbed and closed the hatchway behind her the attic was dark illuminated only by the small portholes of round dormer windows on the slanting slate roof unlike the rest of the house they werent covered with blackout coverings because there were no electric lights the floorboards were thick with dust and littered by mouse droppings shed seen workmen use the attic to reach the roof for repairs she went to the small dormer windows the front one appeared to be painted shut but the rear had a latch she saw she moved the lock open and pushed the window didnt budge she shoved harder did she need some kind of a tool she felt foolish in her ignorance what if shed had to escape this way someday because of a fire she considered then put her shoulder bag to her shoulder and ran against the window it popped open with a bang she waited a moment no sound from below she looked out the overcast was breaking up the air cold the slate roofing tiles looked steep and slick she was on the rear side of the town house and beyond the lead gutter was a dizzying drop of three and a half stories to the small garden below pulling herself out a bit she looked up the peak of the roof was about a bodys length away and led to the flatter roof of the haupsteds next door she could hear the faint sound of the telephone shrilling what if it was for her there really was no alternative using her arms she boosted herself out through the window and balanced awkwardly on the sill facing the roof leaning against the slate without looking down she stepped precariously up onto the top of the small dormer roof slowly she stretched upright her hands sliding up the tiles of the main roof the pebble between her breast and the slippery slate not quite far enough she pushed up on the balls of her feet feeling her toes begin to slip as she stretched frantically finally her fingers closed over the ridge yes she pulled scrabbling with her knees and got her torso and then a leg over the ridge then she was straddling the roof breathing hard she looked down at the street the tree branches were a lacy net a municipal worker was sawing one off his obscuring hat like a saucer he would black market the wood as fuel she suspected she hiked herself along the roof peak until she reached the haupsteds where she could shakily walk on the flat crown of their mansard roof there were four roofs to the corner two ridged like her own one by one she mastered them moving as quickly as she could remembering her climbing in the cave at the end of her block was an iron ladder leading to a balcony below she waited until the residential street was empty of traffic climbed down and then dropped from the balcony hitting the street cobbles and slightly twisting an ankle she glanced about no one seemed to be peering through the curtains of the surrounding houses at the corner she looked again there was only the wood thief on her own street she would have confronted him if she had time instead she took a deep breath freedom limping slightly she headed for the frederick statue just once did she look back at her home she smiled at the thought of the ss sentries sitting arrogantly in her entry as she walked away the tree trimmer straightened to watch her disappearing form then dropped his saw climbed down and ran lightly up to her front door giving a quick knock it swung open and an ss sentry looked out you can tell colonel drexler shes on her way he said gunther will pick up the tail on the avenue the man nodded hes already arrested his fatherinlaw and found an airplane with american markings amazing what one learns about ones relatives no kohl is beginning to talk the ss agent threw off his hat and began peeling the coat and baggy pants that concealed his uniform foolish woman she doesnt appreciate how lucky she is married to a powerful standartenfuhrer yes and if shes married to colonel drexler she should know theres no escape from the reich chapter twentyfive greta arrived at the statue first and hunched on a bench in the bebelplatz she was wary of the people passing by but no one seemed to take notice of her she glanced over the damaged buildings at a sky that seemed to promise escape smoke was hanging on the horizon from the previous nights raid but pale sunlight shone above it an autumn sun low like antarcticas it was quiet in late morning birds had disappeared from berlins plazas as completely as cars and trolleys had left its streets theyd flown away as she planned to do for a moment she smiled remembering the world as it had been still it was difficult to relax a policeman strutted aimlessly near some chipped steps hurry hurry she whispered and then owen came as promised striding across the plaza with an open swinging gate that advertised him as an american to anyone with reason to suspect the walk was reckless she would have to teach him circumspection yet it made her chest ache with fondness to see that easy freedom it was the manner of the place they were going to she hoped he looked grimy and unshaven but triumphant at seeing her again knowing that her bag announced her decision so she jumped up and hurried to him her cheeks flush from the cold they kissed quickly greta instinctively glancing around hart laughed at her the german glance fritz called that if you lived here owen you too would learn to look over your shoulder its a good habit to get into she hesitated embarrassed besides theres danger i told jurgen i was leaving with my father he sent soldiers to keep me at home and i had to escape across the rooftops jesus christ were you followed i dont think so but one can never be sure hart looked worriedly around the plaza youre right im learning the german glance then a thought grabbed him wheres otto he met me last night and promised to be here do you think jurgen has had him picked up anything is possible she said frowning what if he doesnt appear then well have to fly without him her eyes scanned the people passing to and fro looking for some glimpse of kohl i wouldnt like to leave my father in this city not with the enemy approaching not with my husband does jurgen know about ottos farm i dont know weve never visited i think we should go to the plane hart considered i trust your instincts the thought was cut short by a rising mournful wail the people around them stopped in midstep and squinted at the sky then broke into a hurried trot another air raid damn hart said bombing weather they could see nothing yet the american bombers flew so high wed better go to a shelter owen it doesnt make sense to risk the raid maybe my father will find us down in the ubahn hart shook his head with amazement now ill be able to say i was bombed by both sides a friedrichstrasse subway station was nearby they joined a stream of people clattering down the steps and complaining in a babel of languages swept up from across the nazi empire the city was full of slave laborers mistresses collaborators and opportunists slavs in padded jackets blond danes smartly dressed french women dark and thin italians who looked cold and miserable in their doomed embrace with germany despite the variety everyone looked gray and tired the station was gloomily lit and crowded smelling of sweat and fear the sirens went on and on hart pulled greta into a corner of the waiting platform and they sat on the concrete hugging each other how long do these last she shrugged an hour sometimes more you get past caring time loses its meaning i wish your father would come he held her in silence for a while stroking her hair her eyes shut and she leaned into him they began to hear the distant bang of antiaircraft guns and then the heavy tread of bombs the lights in the tunnel began blinking a few people moaned and a baby began to cry its mothers anxious lullaby echoed in the enclosure the baby cried harder the bombs came closer a giant walking and the shelter quaked dust filtered down from the ceiling a light popped casting the enclosure into half gloom she opened her eyes and looked at him they were shining in nearly six years ive never been so happy she whispered a bomb hit close and a few women screamed greta reached up to touch his face and then kissed him again long and deep this time it was a kiss with hunger in it he kissed her back with urgency and wished irritably that they were already alone then she curled into him nesting ive been lonely owen empty somehow my husband never became my friend he hugged her closer was he cruel she sighed no he struck me once at the beginning when he was frustrated and then stopped in embarrassment later he treated me like a piece of china we could never achieve the right tone with each other and that was partly my fault i think in my sorrow after antarctica i let him be the solution to my future without caring what kind of future it was he knew hed won me or captured as much of me as he ever could and decided apparently that that was enough for gods sake why did he marry you i dont know she closed her eyes he desired me he hoped i could give him what he needed even though neither of us ever understood what that was and he simply cant stand to lose theres something wrong with him some fundamental insecurity once i agreed to marry him he seemed strangely satiated as if marriage for him was not the beginning but the end the relationship itself was inconsequential jesus they were silent for a while did you ask for a divorce i asked if he wanted one he told me fate had brought us together and that the future would reveal our purpose for germany its insane always for germany so what did you do all day i continued marine research but it was increasingly difficult biology was engulfed by the war and my colleagues made me uncomfortable the reich wants its women at home so i made a domestic effort as well socialized with the other empty wives read thought of you i waited for life to play itself out hart looked pained im sorry i didnt get back the storm came we sought shelter in the cave and then part of it collapsed something triggered an earthquake fritz died and by the time i got out the island was empty the schwabenland was gone and we couldnt find it even the bergen was gone jurgen blew it up what why to pretend germans got to the island first to rewrite history she thought for a moment we could hear the roar of the explosion even outside the crater could it have been powerful enough to have caused your cavein he looked surprised id never guessed that maybe that explains it he shook his head fritz told me to come back to you you know he told me not to give up she swallowed its so strange how our lives have intersected sometimes i wonder why god brought the three of us together so much pain so much lost time and im not surprised you didnt find the schwabenland did you know that we went east before we went north still exploring despite that hull patch because of it captain heiden said he wanted a following sea while he improved his repair after a day we turned north the leak was so well under control by then that we didnt stop until we got back to germany do you think jurgen went that way to avoid you i dont know subconsciously perhaps by that time i think we were all acting more than thinking and reacting more than acting god what a mess he was quiet for a while remembering events in his mind will you miss him she leaned back against the tile wall of the station platform ill think about him i cant help that and while it will be a relief to escape his fervor i cant help but respect his commitment so few people have that look at the horror outside hes committed to the wrong things she closed her eyes i know that but he was also committed to me im sorry dont be sorry for what none of us could avoid he kissed her then aching to be alone with her imagining her enveloping him the bombs marched this way and that rattling their shelter then he became dimly aware that there was a commotion in the crowd that people were complaining he straightened to glance around a group of men were trying to walk across the densely packed platform stepping or stumbling on huddled bodies to cries of pain and anger sit down sit down some of the shelter dwellers yelled one of the trenchcoated figures flashed some identification and the complainers grew quiet the intruders eyes were sweeping the crowd like radar then one pointed at the couple the finger was accusatory police hart said quietly standing up gestapo maybe he glanced around the station the bombing could actually give us cover to get away if we can reach the surface do you want to risk it of course im not going to be trapped down here he grabbed her hand and they started for the southern ubahn entrance away from the one used by the approaching police it was like wading in deep water someone grabbed gretas leg by the ankle and she turned and stomped on the mans hand setting off a howl of pain then they lurched ahead again hart looked back over his shoulder i think we can beat them they were nearing the exit when there was a clatter on the tile stairway and a flurry of black boots came into view descending the south entrance like pumping pistons an ss detachment was cutting them off there was a civilian in their midst damn hart said its your father kohl looked pale as the soldiers reached the platform he was pushed toward the couple his face bruised and his suit jacket torn an ss man pointed and otto nodded miserably im sorry greta hart swung around the police were still coming from the other direction the crowd parting from the authorities like a biblical sea greta pulled at owen the tunnel the trains are dead with the electricity cut if we can reach the tracks we can run to the next station the germans were fanning out to block them pistols were being drawn and someone began screaming the squeeze of the crowd was like being mired in quicksand then otto whirled turning in a circle like a dervish with one hand thrown out paper spouted from his fingertips and the crowd erupted into frenzy it was money some of the reichsmarks that kohl had collected run the german shouted the ss leader savagely struck gretas father across the face and he went down in the tumult run the couple bulldozed toward the edge of the platform the air was filled with fluttering bills confused oaths and people springing to catch the notes the police were shoved this way and that like boats in a storm their leader howling in frustration the platform ended at a brink of darkness that hid even the tracks always with you it is some cave greta said wryly only because i enjoyed the last one halt there was a bang and something hot and angry buzzed near their heads whining off tile on the far side of the tunnel they crouched do you have a gun yes he glanced backward in france she gripped his hand and launched them into the blackness when they sprawled on the cinders something squealed and greta lurched up and kicked out a tunnel rat scuttled away a german mark fluttered down past them there was another shot and again a bullet bounced off the tunnel greta come on wait she stooped picked up a handful of rock cinders cocked her arm and threw the aim was imperfect but the effect was like hitting a wasps nest several people yelped and a fight broke out the platform crowd became even more agitated with shoving people the police were stuck in greed and anger as if gripped in tar you throw like a girl hart judged perfectly they began trotting past the stunned faces of berliners peering down at them uncertain what to make of the excitement the rumble of bombs overhead added to the confusion none of the shouts could be clearly heard above the background thunder then they were in the tunnel and it was black she kicked out again are you all right except for the damned rats theyve gotten fat and bold with the war dont stop she pulled at his hand her palm slick the air was dusty in the lulls between explosions they heard hurrying boot steps and the confused shouts of their pursuers jutting his arm out blindly like a football player to avoid a collision with an unexpected wall hart broke into a trot greta following suddenly there was a series of pistol shots and the pair fell flat for a moment a riot of bullets pinged around them stop it you fool someone yelled the sound echoing youll hit the police coming from the other end are you hit hart asked anxiously no but im scared me too they got up again and staggered on the pilot looked for an emergency exit but could see nothing slowly he noticed light glowing from the next station ahead and saw blocking figures on the track silhouetted against the illumination damn the pair of fugitives were still hidden by the dark but appeared to be trapped hart let go of gretas hand for a moment to grope in the gloom weve got to find another way out he said desperately feeling along the ribs of the wall a door a ladder as if in response there was a roar and the tunnel air cuffed them knocking them down hart managed to roll on top of greta as a blast of heat pulsed by followed by a spray of rocks and dirt smoke choked the air and yet the blackness had given way to a brighter light the pilot blinked an american bomb had hit a weak point and punched into the tunnel where it joined the next station replacing the waiting police with an avalanche slope of new rubble the escarpment led upward toward a smoky sky come on greta grunted shoving owen off herself and getting to her knees we can get out that way they both were shrouded in dust her fine coat torn her strand of pearls spilled like tears along the tracks a trickle of blood ran down his forehead god i love you he breathed i love you too they began clambering up the collapsed tunnel ceiling toward the light her hand in his the noise of the air raid was much louder with the ceiling gone an arrhythmic pounding that seemed to reverberate in their bones as they emerged he saw the sky far above was freckled with black puffs of flak there was an unnerving rattle as spent bits of metal from antiaircraft fire rained down on the city like hail they clambered out the crater separating them from the shelter theyd nearly been trapped in they just needed to run the other way an apartment building adjacent to the gaping bomb crater had caught fire its smoke serving as a screen my ankle greta gasped she was limping hart draped one arm across her shoulder and they began staggering passing by two bodies sprawled on the cobblestones he soon decided she was too slow and scooped her up in his arms to begin a stumbling run he could see little and was terrified that all he was going to accomplish by coming to berlin was getting greta killed was the frequency of explosions lessening he emerged from the smoke and slowed then came to a stop hell striding from the entrance of the next station was jurgen drexler holding a pistol greta saw him and then clutched owens neck and buried her face in his chest hart turned to go back the other way but ss men were emerging from the crater smoke blowing through their blond hair they had guns too it was over drexler stopped a dozen feet away and lowered his automatic a moment staring at hart in amazement youre alive he blinked twice as if not believing his senses but how a moment passed then ah now im beginning to understand at least part of this hart gently put greta down he didnt want her to get hurt jurgen please she entreated still leaning on owen just let us go you lied to me greta you lied about the locket you lied about running away you told me owen was dead she countered said his plane was missing i truly thought he didnt make it and was quietly glad but it appears the joke is on me how long have you known he was alive a day and that quickly you decide to leave me she looked at him unhappily i never had you jurgen thats been the problem you never let anyone have you you never let anyone get inside your spore coat he started at her choice of words and examined hart more curiously then you knew what i was like he objected obviously thinking about more than that clearly the wheels were turning he looked hart up and down how did you survive the disease the antibiotic worked owen said shrugging greta was right you should have had more faith jurgen you might have saved all of us a lot of pain jurgen nodded thoughtfully that calculation again perhaps i can learn from my mistakes he looked at greta that slime was effective then evidently greta said impatient with the discussion what did any of that matter now and this organism could it have been reproduced manufactured greta seemed puzzled by his intensity well never know hart glanced about the bombing had stopped and the sirens were sounding an allclear emergency workers were spraying water into the burning apartment building and berliners were emerging from the underground stations look at this mess jurgen he said berlin is a charnel house why dont you just put that pistol down and come with us ill fly you out too its time for everyone to start over drexler looked at him with amazement fly away with the adulterers were not adulterers greta protested we just shut up drexler roared shut up shut up shut up greta looked like she had been slapped do you think im an idiot he hissed struggling to control the volume of his voice so his men could not hear do you think i dont know your dreams have been filled with this ghost come back to life and now im to go with you abandon my country and my career shake hands and let this man steal my wife he shook his head listen to me greta youve betrayed me betrayed me if not physically then mentally many many times as a result the days of my being the proper husband are over over understand from this moment we have a new relationship a relationship defined by the needs of the state both of you are in my power now the reichs power your only chance your only chance is to obey every command i give you there was a momentary silence while hart shot greta a look it said stay calm drexler drew a few steps closer to the couple so now that we understand each other i have a question for you hart only one if you were well the ss colonel said scowling why didnt you fly back to the schwabenland why didnt you come off the island i was trapped in the damn cave by a cavein probably caused by your erasure of the bergen by the time i got out youd left i flew and stumbled on the norwegians drexler looked at him with genuine surprise you were in the cave when that avalanche occurred and so was fritz he died and if you triggered the collapse then you killed him thats absurd i had no idea anyone was in the cave to begin with you cant blame that on me and what the devil were you doing there getting out of the storm my god drexler shook his head the ironies of history and now the cave is sealed cutting off the source of the wonder drug pity suddenly his eyes narrowed but theres a problem with your story hart youre here after the avalanche how did you get out of the cave the pilot started to answer and then stopped now it was his turn to calculate indeed how did i get out jurgen drexler studied the pair speculatively more police were arriving with them was a bleeding and wincing otto kohl his complexion was gray ah the man who betrayed his daughter drexler greeted his gaze swung to the agents were discussing a matter of state security he addressed them leave him here a moment ill be with you shortly reluctantly the men backed away kohl looked at the ground im sorry greta they made me tell them where youd be his voice was subdued they went to the farm and found the plane its all right papa a tear ran down her cheek jurgen learned that you were in berlin from me you did your best in the shelter throwing away money a wry grin that was hard for me how touching drexler interrupted otto we were just discussing the fate of your family the question it seems is whether i should put all of you up against that wall hand you over to the gestapo or find a use for you youll do what you wish we all know that exactly thats why youve always been useful otto youre a man who grasps reality and the reality is that the war is lost everyone knows that so take me if you must but let those two go let someone salvage something thats where youre wrong otto victory can still be ours im beginning to think if you help he looked suspicious what do you mean you remain i believe a close personal associate of reichsmarschall goring isnt that correct the title reflected gorings military promotion our formal relationship has been in abeyance and your informal one kohl bit his lip dont think im unaware my fatherinlaw was a key facilitator in gorings shopping expeditions in occupied france two patriots united by greed and because of that otto you may still be of some use to me because i need your help to see the reichsmarschall again now an emergency hell listen to you possibly you can get me to him i dont know you remember he was less than satisfied with our expedition but that was a long time ago why should he see you now because the expedition he was disappointed in may turn out to have held promise after all promise at a critical juncture of the war kohl looked skeptical and what do i get for this help your life he barked a bitter laugh my life here to do what learn russian drexler gave a thin smile and an exit you can leave as you wished with my savings of course no that part is gone your property is now the property of the state what that money is mine im an honest german businessman nonsense thats my lifes work jurgen my lifes work im not going to surrender that now id rather be shot you may not have the luxury of being shot you may not have the luxury of getting to hermann goring they stared at each other drexler heated kohl implacable finally jurgen grimaced all right you can have back what we seized if everyone cooperates including your daughter cooperates with what thats what were going to talk to goring about he raised his voice to speak to the nearby soldiers johann a holding cell for each of these he pointed to owen and greta and abel the man came over quietly and drexler bent to whisper to him get me in touch with maximilian schmidt hart looked at him curiously what are you up to now jurgen why owen didnt i tell you once that from crisis comes opportunity chapter twentysix karinhall seemed to have crawled under a blanket hiding from the sky its gingerbread rooftops were tented by camouflage netting the disguise supported by stripped firs and a spiderweb of cables like the rigging of a circus tent hermann gorings aerial armada had been dissipated in a thousand farflung battles and now the onetime lord of the air had to pretend his castle had sunk into the ground lest allied warplanes find it the lawns around the great house had been torn up by the treads of military vehicles and its trees shaded a protective camp antiaircraft guns nested in sandbag emplacements barrels jutting upward with this humiliation had come the evaporation of much of the reichsmarschalls influence in nazi germany hitlers designated successor was only rarely summoned to councils of war as germanys fortunes worsened gorings mind had escaped to a habit of mindless acquisition as distracting as drugs accordingly it wasnt that difficult for one of his mercantile agents otto kohl to get through to the reichsmarschall once again otto back from oblivion the reminder of heady plundering in france and so the german facilitator once more came to the estate at dusk karinhalls lights hidden now behind blackout paper drexler and schmidt shared the rear of the staff car attired in fulldress ss uniforms kohl was in a business suit retrieved from his farm outside berlin his forehead still bandaged from the scuffle in the air raid shelter the promise of his eventual escape from germany was shadowed by fear that drexler would somehow betray him once they saw goring he was trying desperately to guess jurgens game displaying a bluff heartiness he didnt feel so here we are again kohl exclaimed as the staff car grated to a stop in the gravel outside the entrance the door flanked this time by sandbagged sentry posts with machine guns it brings back memories of a happier time drexler looked out at the huge dim house it brings back memories of how far weve fallen otto he replied he was in no mood to reassure his fatherinlaw were in desperate times so youre going to have to charm desperately for your daughters sake if it was up to me shed be out of germany and safe by now if it was up to you id be cuckolded by an american flyboy living on the loot you plan to pirate out of germany kohl sulked a fine mood youre in on this critical evening the eve of gotterdammerung interjected schmidt to break off the squabbling the twilight of the gods time for the unsheathing of the sword kohl looked skeptically at this somber companion id no idea you were a man of literary allusion max im not a man of literature otto the doctor extinguished his cigarette before stepping out of the car im a man of will guard dogs produced a volley of ferocious barking as the men stepped from the vehicle prompting the trio to hesitate at the bottom of the steps then a harsh command silenced the animals and a luftwaffe captain trotted down the granite to greet them they were escorted into karinhalls shadowy foyer where sentries briskly checked for weapons there was no apology the bomb attempt on hitlers life the previous summer had tightened security procedures throughout germany this way gentlemen the luftwaffe captain directed the large banquet table was covered by white sheets suggesting it hadnt been used for some time oil paintings and tapestries had been taken down from the walls leaving ghostly imprints the pictures were stacked next to wooden crates for shipping to underground safety all of germany was burrowing the library was less changed its books no more read now than theyd been six years before a fire burned and they could see a figure in a highbacked chair his back to them your guests reichsmarschall goring waved over the top of the chair yes bring them in he sounded slightly impatient come come gentlemen no ceremony here they stood before him goring was in a silk dressing gown one slippered leg up on an ottoman the damn gout hed aged his face lined and pale his eyes sunken and he appeared to have lost some weight his presence had shrunk as well he no longer seemed to automatically dominate the room let alone an empire still the reichsmarschalls gaze retained a cold gleam of calculation he studied his guests with a half smile taking in the uniforms and the folder under drexlers arm very military he gestured to three chairs arranged in a semicircle in front of his own please please be seated memories of no im honored you remember sir drexler bowed oh i remember how we had to put a lid on the entire affair drexler hesitated and now may be the opportune time to unwrap it they sat its good to see you well and safe reichsmarschall kohl offered yes and you too otto he grinned impishly at his old friend and what have you brought me this time just myself im afraid i narrowly escaped from france just me and my friends here with their interesting proposition goring grunted his acceptance well you did splendidly in france for as long as you could this champagne he said pointing out the bottle to the two others was in a shipment otto shopped for me the man has extraordinary taste an orderly stepped forward and began pouring they sipped do you agree otto has always known how to live drexler noted who to know and how to please them indeed and now instead of impressionist paintings or vintages from bordeaux he brings me you two and i do remember our little mission to the bottom of the world what an opportunity you had he shook his head ah the promise of that time now lost its tragic no hesitantly his visitors nodded what depresses me about the march of events is that i am at heart a builder not a destroyer a builder what dreams we had of what we would build in our new world now i have to hide under that vast damned blanket overhead and bear insults and complaints from oafish idiots like that bunker worm bormann even the fuhrer mocks me well it wasnt i who decided to take on the entire world at once he sipped again do you still believe in victory reichsmarschall drexler finally asked goring regarded the ss officer with small dark eyes of course colonel drexler my belief in the fuhrer and his destiny is unshaken the superweapons our secret plans its only a matter of time god will not desert us in the end no it was a rote affirmation perhaps hes already sent us a miracle really goring drained his glass yes which is why were here reichsmarschall why we asked our friend otto my fatherinlaw to expedite our visit youre related yes im married to ottos daughter greta the woman who accompanied us to antarctica ah i remember her lovely girl i always remember the women he barked a laugh stopping when no one joined him then i heard nothing more but of course youd claimed her and hid her away well heres to happy marriage drexler smiled thinly and lifted his glass indeed kohl studied the fire and your miracle drexler leaned forward from an unlikely source we suspect weve found a potential key to victory its a long shot i admit far from assured but desperate times deserve desperate remedies no goring looked skeptical not if they drain away valuable resources one submarine drexler said one submarine and i we can win this war or at least force a favorable armistice but we need your backing to do it reichsmarschall and if we succeed youll be the leader who saved germany goring laughed youre going to win the war with one boat its too bad you didnt join the navy in and save admiral donitz a lot of trouble drexler smiled we only need the uboat for transport to return to antarctica and fetch something potentially powerful enough to reverse our fortunes ah youre referring to your microbe again yes reichsmarschall you remember our discovery a weapon so powerful so swift so deadly that it will force our enemies to sue for peace a weapon easy to multiply and easy to deliver in these difficult times but we knew of this weapon in and didnt return for it as i recall it was deemed far too hazardous to fool with plus the war intervened correct but circumstances may have changed in our favor drexler turned to schmidt doctor can you review for the reichsmarschall exactly what this microbe is capable of the nazi doctor sat straighter at this cue first it appears to be highly contagious needing no third organism like a rat or a flea or mosquito for transmittal it develops in the lungs and is spread by coughing sneezing even breathing second in its dormant state its extremely stable it encases itself in a coating or shell that allows it to survive extremes of temperature humidity even a disturbance such as the detonation of a shell or bomb this hardiness makes it easily deliverable third it can kill with unprecedented swiftness in as little as twelve hours from infection individuals become incapacitated death of virtually one hundred percent of those exposed follows in a couple days its far more lethal than the more familiar bubonic or pneumonic plagues or anthrax in all my years as a doctor ive never seen anything like it goring pursed his lips in consideration and then slowly shook his head which is why trying to harness it would be opening a pandoras box when you play with a witches brew like plague it can bounce back at you he nodded significantly at drexler as those mountaineer troops of yours learned too late drexler put up his hand conceded but i discovered something else on that island reichsmarschall an underground organism which some on the science team speculated might neutralize the microbes effects how is that significant because when opening pandoras box one must possess immunity from its effects as the spaniards did from the european diseases that destroyed the aztec and inca empires obviously goring said impatiently so if you found a cure why didnt you bring it back with you the expedition was in crisis men were dying the ship in danger the antibiotics effectiveness on humans had not been fully demonstrated after a futile effort to reach the ss squad during which our small supply of the antibiotic was depleted the cave where the substance was found was blocked by a cavein for safety reasons we had to destroy the microbe as well with the limited containment equipment we had there was no way to ensure nonexposure but now how has anything changed goring said tired of drexlers obliqueness the ss colonel played his card sir just two days ago we made a remarkable capture that set our thinking on an entirely new course do you remember the american pilot owen hart he was here at karinhall i remember the name from the reports not the face he was one of the missions casualties we thought but it turns out he survived the microbe after all not fortyeight hours ago he made a secret flight to berlin to contact my wife once in custody he admitted hed survived the disease after ingesting the antibiotic hes living proof a cure exists goring frowned idly twisting one of the rings on his left hand contacted your wife yes you see its greta my wife who did much of the pioneering work on these discoveries in antarctica hart now an officer in american intelligence was apparently given a mission by his superiors to abduct greta and force her to use this biology against us fortunately her loyalty to the reich allowed me to foil such a plot he glanced sideways at kohl the german businessman swallowed and nodded in faint support my point drexler went on is that we may be in a biological arms race and the fortuitous arrest of hart gives us the upper hand if we could return to atropos island we could collect enough disease spores to culture and grow the microbe we could also collect the antibiotic organism and begin reproducing that as well we then destroy the source of both strike before the americans and force an end to the war your wife will help with this of course her loyalty to the reich and myself is beyond question the other two sat as if made of stone goring folded his hands and rested his chin on them infection plague this isnt the kind of war i like to fight how many millions do you intend to kill how many tens of millions have already died schmidt responded the nation that can force a successful conclusion to this war before the last greatest battles will have performed a humanitarian deed we will have saved lives goring tapped his fingers considering this is fraught with difficulties and it seems foolhardy to involve my daughter in this dangerous scheme kohl interjected worriedly shes necessary drexler said with irritation the risk is acceptable to save germany you want to take your wife with you the reichsmarschall asked shell go if i explain the need well remarkable woman still otto is right this is an extreme gamble at this point it seems a gamble germany must make yes goring thought then pointed to a clock the key problem of course is time schmidt nodded time to get to the island time to get these organisms time to massproduce them with the allies pressing it will be difficult but here gentlemen i have information that may make your task less hopeless than it seems goring paused considering then winked he enjoyed demonstrating that he still occasionally played a part in the reichs inner councils this is most secret of course but germany is not as finished as the enemy believes the fatherland is going to strike back this winter hitting the americans and british where they least expect it the fuhrer is confident this will bring victory im less so but am confident our offensive will prolong the war enough perhaps to enable you to deliver us some kind of a miracle he pondered this will require just a single submarine to win the war drexler promised when we return well need biological facilities to massproduce both the disease and its antidote a laboratory perhaps located in a mine should suffice germs are far cheaper than tanks or airplanes goring laughed our mines are getting crowded so much has been moved there still it would be nice to be in control of events again well he seemed to have regained some of his old energy he boosted himself to his feet grunting a bit in pain lets discuss the details of this further over dinner jurgen i agree with otto that the odds are stacked against us but the idea of having an option of last resort intrigues me well determine if this is truly feasible and you can tell me more about antarctica id be delighted reichsmarschall open it drexler stood before the steel door in immaculate uniform his jackboots shining and his pistol freshly oiled with a clank the steel door was unlocked and hauled open by a thick brutish ss guard his arms roped with muscle and his head jutting forward an animal set to guard animals drexler stepped through the guard throwing on the light from an outside switch greta jerked awake she was on a bunk huddled for warmth the cell was otherwise bare except for a steel bucket drexler carried in a camp chair and sat hello greta she sat up blinking in the harsh light she looked disheveled exhausted and very small it was painful to see her in such surroundings humiliating yet its necessary he reminded himself necessary for her to understand how desperate their situation really was show no emotion drexler told himself feel no emotion every time youve surrendered to your heart youve regretted it still he found it difficult to begin it was greta who finally spoke so youve come to look does this please you what youve done to keep me in germany her sarcasm shattered his hesitation it was he who was in control do you think i enjoy seeing you like this my wife jailed for trying to run away with an american intelligence officer the gestapo is actually becoming suspicious you may have revealed key information to the enemy ive spent all my political capital keeping this arrest quiet to protect both our reputations your impulsive selfishness has nearly destroyed me greta ruined me all i wanted was to be let go you know the reich cant do that the only debate your keepers have is how slowly you both should die this is the reality of war greta this cell is your situation without my protection without my fine home without my life and career and connections wake up because what can happen in a place like this is indescribable all that stands between you and that is me she closed her eyes wheres owen waiting for your decision waiting for you to rescue him what decision i ask you to look at your situation he leaned toward her an american intelligence officer in the heart of berlin a spy by any nations definition a german woman consorting with him both of you could be shot certainly in fact ive been working very hard to keep you from being shot it would be a relief to have it over im sorry to hear you say that for hart though it wont go so quickly the gestapo will have questions for an american spy inquiries that will take days to complete by the end hell be begging for a bullet she looked him up and down as if seeing him for the first time you came here to tell me this no of course not i am your husband greta our relationship has of course changed im hurt im angry but despite your betrayal i still came here to help you so you can help me she looked wary i need your help greta he nodded solemnly germany needs your help no i dont want to see you dead i might like to kill hart but i cant afford to see him dead either because somehow he found his way out of that sealed cave which means he can find a way back in accordingly i want to offer you both a chance at redemption a chance for us to work together again for a common good what chance her tone was skeptical to return to antarctica she had a sharp intake of breath no thats where all this started to develop your cure greta i didnt think it a real possibility until i saw hart and the need was not entirely apparent to me when we first visited atropos island but the war has brought it home what if we had a new antibiotic it would make all the difference in our hospitals jurgen theres a war on we cant get back to antarctica but we can on a submarine the reich is willing to make one available but the time its so late in the war this war may go on longer than you think her eyes became skeptical no youre going for the microbe he shook his head considering his words carefully im afraid dr schmidt was one step ahead of both of us greta he kept his gaze dead level with hers trying to communicate the utmost sincerity i assumed all the cultures were destroyed as you said but it turns out schmidt quietly created some of his own cultures borrowing from your dishes what he brought the disease back to germany and its been tested in the camps drexler lied the reich is desperate and may be forced to use it all this came as a complete shock to me goring shares my fear but there is growing pressure coming from the fuhrers headquarters bormann maybe other advisors i dont know so the reichsmarschall wants us to return to antarctica to get an antidote as a safety valve to get your antibiotic to save lives not take them he watched her closely to see if she saw through him you just want the drug yes she looked confused tired hopeful if i helped youd let owen live i need hart to help get us back into the cave quickly i cant risk the chance hed lie in directing us on such a dangerous trip i need him there to show us and i need you to persuade him i need you to help gather and culture the compound i need you both just as you now need me a partnership she shook her head in wonder the three of us returning again greta were all in desperate straits do you think this is what i want you in a prison cell thats no victory but harts appearance perversely means we can do something together to produce a good in this war in partnership with my wife even if she no longer loves me weve all made mistakes greta great and terrible and bitter ones and i thought harts return was the worst mistake of all then i realized hes a sign of new opportunity a chance to try again its late very late but not too late perhaps jurgen it was a groan as she tried to sort out his motive he took a breath the war will end someday in victory or defeat or stalemate who knows and then therell be an accounting of what was done on all sides i want that accounting to include a miracle new drug a drug that we discovered this is our chance to salvage something from catastrophe greta regardless of what happens between you and me something that will be remembered in the postwar world so come with me to antarctica to do the expedition over more completely this time to correct the mistakes of the past to succeed instead of fail and afterward you and me and owen your heart is your own ive learned that to be honest i still hope to change your mind but go where you will with him if you must my mission is for germany do it and well all be saved she closed her eyes what do i have to do convince him greta convince him he must cooperate to save his life to save his to save your fathers and to save yours she looked at her husband her eyes sad contemplating a return to the island finally she nodded ill talk to him chapter twentyseven greta inhaled the night air of the harbor northwestern spain was cool in november but still warmer than germany its sky ablaze with stars smells both sweet and odorous wafted from the port of vigo the scent of sea and forest and fishing quay a heady reminder of better times for two weeks she and owen had been locked in a sterile world without windows a succession of cells paneled trucks and then an airplane its viewing ports taped over with blackout paper theyd been kept more than twentyfour hours at opposite ends of a frigid metal hangar in switzerland sleepless and cramped on its hard concrete floor now still stiff from the long journey she had a moments respite on the edge of the atlantic in a nation that still granted refuge to nazi ships a few lights twinkled on the water and music drifted from the whitewashed buildings stacked around vigos natural amphitheater this is what life is like without war she remembered it was only a glimpse stone steps slick with seaweed led to a landing being approached by a motor launch across the bay was the low dark shadow of a uboat an impatient schmidt was already down the steps his gaunt silhouette identified by the glow of his cigarette hed not so much as glanced at the beauty of the harbor despite being within fifty feet of her husband and her father and the man she loved greta felt helplessly alone jurgen had been warily polite otto had been kept separate and any contact with owen was prevented by the squad of granitefaced ss troopers that had flown with them out of germany the isolation hurt she didnt think shed survive to stand on a temperate shore again and before being sealed into the submarine she wanted to share this final moment with the man she loved for just that reason drexler wouldnt allow it while he needed both owen and greta to accomplish his plan he didnt need them together not yet the pairs last conversation in berlin had been hasty and anguished drexler had reluctantly agreed to allow his wife to go into owens cell alone to persuade the pilot to come on the new expedition but the ss colonel was hammering on the door and hollering time long before theyd said all they needed to say greta had presented the cruel choice antarctica or a painful death quickly never doubting that hart would agree to come its all right hed assured her i know im not done with that place yet or this war and i have an idea but she wept when he agreed hating herself for asking him to come and yet enormously relieved that hed do so now owen remained caged inside a spanish truck waiting for transfer to the submarine her father stood morosely next to a decrepit warehouse watched over by a yellowhaired giant named hans and jurgen was brisk and confident reanimated by what he clearly saw as a second chance to make his mark in the reich and work together with greta he still wore his formal black uniform to emphasize his authority now he watched the motor launch from the uboat putter to the stone steps of the quay the submarine commander who climbed out of the boat declined to return drexlers hitler salute instead coming wearily up the quay steps in worn sweater and stained officers cap and offering a brief nod at the top he looked tired his eyes red from long hours colonel drexler captain joachim freiwald commander of the u greetings captain youre the skipper of a very new submarine i understand so new i would swear the paint is still drying im sorry for not being on shore to meet you but the timing of your arrival was unclear and our orders were quite sudden we ran the atlantic gauntlet from the shipyards at kiel and have been scrambling to provision since our arrival in spain all for an ultimate destination weve yet to be informed of he looked at jurgen quizzically ill inform you of our mission once were at sea captain the haste is necessary im afraid the war is at a critical stage and were under a tight deadline freiwald looked uncomfortable my orders from uboat command are less than clear only to take on an unusually large number of added personnel for an unusually long voyage ive radioed for clarification of my instructions theres no need i take my orders from berlin he pointed to his ss contingent these men take their orders from me and so do you as these papers will make clear an orderly handed over a folder we cant afford to waste time with jurisdictional confusion so i had these orders drawn up making clear my authority and im in a hurry i want us underway before dawn captain freiwald looked surprised i understood our departure date as tomorrow night colonel some of my men are in town on leave your directive has just changed your mens shore leave must be canceled our success depends upon speed colonel weve been working ceaselessly to commission and then provision here in spain my men havent had any rest since tonight captain time is of the essence they can go ashore after we win the war freiwald pursed his lips and opened the folder there was enough illumination from a warehouse floodlight to make out the signatures and stamps he closed it his face a mask yes colonel departure at hours you can reassemble your crew he shrugged i know where to find them the amusements of vigo are limited good next the biologist accompanying us is a woman my wife as a matter of fact though that is irrelevant to your treatment of her her expertise is critical to this mission and as a woman shell need a private cabin youll arrange this please the skipper blinked submarines are cramped colonel even our new type xxi i have a cabin and theres the first officers compartment it has only a single bunk that will be satisfactory i wont be sharing her quarters my apologies to the first officer but im sure hell understand now i also want a compartment reserved for my nine schutzstaffel soldiers and myself perhaps the forward torpedo room youll reassign your crew accordingly but and the laboratory space its been cleared that necessity has made storage tight and those cages the heavy weather gear has arrived yes and we also have a prisoner an american intelligence officer with critical information for our success where can we confine him freiwald looked even more confused nowhere colonel a submarine has no brig then just lock him somewhere to a pipe or bunk the captain frowned is he a threat potentially colonel that wont work not on a long sea voyage hell be in the way if chained to one place and it wont be good for morale submarines are more casual than what youre accustomed to in berlin what do you suggest captain where can he go what can he do believe me hell never be alone in the confines of a submarine especially with so many extra soldiers on board we simply watch him there was a dissatisfied grunt very well just keep him away from the woman my wife i mean hes not to talk with her freiwald looked more baffled than ever that will be all for now you can begin transporting my men and their gear to your ship its called a boat colonel but drexler was already walking away otto kohl watched the submarine commanders discomfiture from a distance secretly amused at the obvious friction the uboat chief had just been given a short course in the way drexler briskly arranged the world to fit his own designs kohl had expected to be allowed to stay in switzerland but jurgen had ordered him to continue on to spain for a while kohl had feared being impressed into the submarine as well but there was no sign of that instead he had to stand like a penitent schoolboy in the shadow of a gigantic ss goon watching his only child standing alone nearby depressed and probably afraid her isolation shamed him drexler in contrast looked positively jaunty as if embarking on a pleasure cruise it occurred to kohl that his soninlaw had quite possibly snapped the nazi strode up this is where we say goodbye otto he kept his hands clasped behind his back youre a lucky man to wait out the war here simply a sensible one deciding to try one last time kohl gestured toward the hills of spain it could end for all of us jurgen youre beyond the reach of the dying reich make a separate peace and just go youve done enough you still dont understand people like myself do you otto jurgens voice had the disdain of pity that some things are more important than ones own brief spark of existence that there are such things as country and duty and honor that sometimes the individual sacrifices for the many in the right cause your fatherlands cause is the right cause always you no more choose your fatherland than you choose your family and you no more abandon your fatherland than you abandon your family kohl was quiet he was abandoning both destiny has put me at this harbor drexler went on destiny has given me the chance to reverse the tide of war god led me to that island as surely as if hed erected signposts and you and owen hart fell out of the sky like trumpeting angels i thought it a nightmare at first then i realized it was the solution to all my problems god what a grandiose selfimportant fool no one knows what god intends kohl warned quietly if you must take this risk then do so jurgen but please i beg of you leave my daughter behind you dont need her ah but i do do you think hart would help me without greta as leverage besides your daughter is a remarkably intuitive scientist time is of the essence with the allies knocking on the west wall im counting on her ingenuity to give us a head start on our plans and besides i need her for one more reason whats that you what do you mean do you really think i trust either one of you that im relaxed about turning otto kohl loose to run around spain while i carry out a secret mission to antarctica no shes my guarantee dear fatherinlaw you wont do anything foolish because if you did it would endanger her if we fail shell be the first to suffer the consequences you cant make greta hostage to my behavior thats not our agreement exactly i agreed only to let you go but we said nothing beyond that now ive filled in the blanks filled it with blackmail i learned from the master kohl fumed its not as if i was going to talk anyway im no traitor then you should welcome this arrangement were allies kohl wished hed never met jurgen drexler when do you return in less than two months i hope by that time you should know vigo like a native im not about to sit waiting in this runt of a port barcelona perhaps or over to lisbon in portugal i have the money to go where i wish now he gestured toward the two leather satchels on the dirt near the truck watched by an ss guard they were stuffed with currency gold and bank certificates that kohl had assembled in switzerland after they flew there from berlin to refuel if i have to waste my time for two months it shall be in some comfort said otto he moved to pick up the satchels drexler put a hand on his arm no otto theres one other amendment to our agreement whats that youll get your money as i promised but not until our safe return just one more reason for you to wish us a bon voyage it goes on the submarine with me what youll be issued enough pesetas to keep you at vigos finest for two months and to light a lamp for our homecoming but you go nowhere else if you care about the fate of your daughter early in the new year well have a family reunion then youll be a rich man and i a powerful one not before thats outrageous that money is mine think of me as your banker jurgen you son of a bitch there there otto drexler said smiling we mustnt have acrimony among family members he nodded toward greta now say goodbye to your daughter tell her how important her cooperation is kiss her cheek for me he was in a good mood kohl struggled to master his composure he watched jurgen nod to a guard who hoisted the satchels and carried them down the quay steps for transport to the submarine then resigned to the loss kohl went to speak briefly to greta she touched his hand before an ss guard escorted her to the launch as well next came hart his hands cuffed the boat pulled away with this first load drexler came back beside kohl was it a warm sendoff she told me she didnt expect to come back ah well she always underestimates me and you me kohl said im not your puppet jurgen i refuse to be any mans puppet anymore of course not otto youre lord of vigo the newest spanish don and with patience youll have your new life they watched the motor launch aim for the waiting submarine they could see greta looking back at them her expression invisible then she melted into the dark and drexler put his arm around kohls shoulder and guided him to a waiting car the german sulkily got in and drexler bent to the open window your daughter and your money are safe with me i think the stars promise luck for us dont you agree kohl looked straight ahead goodbye jurgen when he said nothing more drexler shrugged and the car pulled away otto half expected a detour and a quick bullet on the drive into town but it didnt come a mistake he thought if you knocked down a person you finished him he suspected jurgen didnt quite have the stomach required for his schemes kohl was escorted to a hotel room with a view of the dark harbor your accommodations have been paid for he was informed from the balcony of his room he could see the light of the motor launch as it ferried back and forth the submarine was too low and dark to be visible kohl sighed sat on his sagging bed and contemplated the ruins of his life then he took out the object greta had pressed into his hand keep this safe for me shed whispered it was a scrap of soiled white ribbon he unwound it to find a pebble inside dull and brown he supposed it had something to do with owen with it was a scrap of paper carefully inked the issue is greater than us papa you must stop this boat kohl lay down on his bed for the first time in many years tears fogged his eyes he was frightened at such sentiment for reassurance he felt the lining of his jacket where hed sewn some currency inside then he considered what to do part three chapter twentyeight the u was one of a new class of uboat that was years ahead of its time its displacement was more than twice that of the standard german uboat and it was thirty feet longer giving the necessary range and cargo area to reach antarctica a new schnorkel provided the breathing capability to stay underwater long enough to escape the coast of europe even its appearance was futuristic with a streamlined conning tower that reminded hart of a fancy prewar desoto the submarine boasted interior amenities that earlier uboats lacked a freezer a single shower and a hydraulic system for faster reloading of its torpedoes it could dive to six hundred and fifty feet yet despite all this it remained a claustrophobic tube noisy and damp the vessel was crammed counting himself and greta owen schmidt and the soldiers drexler had brought thirteen extra people on board unlucky thirteen some of the sailors muttered to add to the normal crew of fiftyseven bunks had to be shared one sailor crawling into the heat and smell of the prior occupant as watches changed additionally making space for a crude laboratory and antarctic supplies meant provisions were stuffed into every available space the sailors walked on tins of food in the torpedo compartments and one head was temporarily occupied by smoked meats and sausages the boat was so tightly packed that the sailors joked that they had to lose weight in order to squeeze through to fetch their food to hart who loved the expansiveness of sky and sea the cylinder was grimly oppressive from his assigned bunk in the aft torpedo compartment he listened with disquiet to the rumble of pumps and gush of water as the uboat dove after clearing vigos breakwater imagining the oceans dark squeeze as they began their long underwater run he was still lying there when drexler suddenly appeared it was the first time theyd been so close since berlin the german had exchanged his uniform coat for a navy sweater he also wore an expression of distaste already seasick jurgen hart needled simply sick of your proximity said drexler and ill chain you up again if i have to but ive refrained for now id rather we put aside our personal differences and form the necessary professional partnership to complete our mission the result may save many lives can i trust you to behave correctly hart pretended to consider this as much as i trust you i saved you from the gestapo saved a man who planned to abscond with my wife i did so on her promise that youd be of use to us now i want your promise you cant always have what you want ah but i can and now i do he reached into his breast pocket and pulled out something golden then let it dangle from his hand remember it was the penguin locket and hart started despite himself he looked at the tiny bird swinging back and forth with growing anger thats gretas you son of a bitch you stole that from greta like you stole her from me owen lifted himself onto his elbows in warning you know jurgen i could become a dangerous man if i were you i would get out the handcuffs who knows what i might do youre the least of my fears drexler said sneering im only trying to smooth our voyage but if you make trouble you have reason to be afraid of me with that he turned and walked away the encounter left the pilot depressed confirming his feeling of impotence he felt as guilty for rushing to berlin and endangering greta as he knew she felt guilty for allowing them to be caught chains or no chains hed never felt so helpless he lay thinking for a long time the german sailors glancing at him curiously as they passed the enemy at last given a face then he suddenly swung out of his bunk he couldnt allow paralysis he had to be ready to act if opportunity came he decided to explore and if possible talk to greta at first no one addressed him as he moved through the hatchways still a ghost thought owen but word of his movement went ahead of him and captain freiwald swung around the periscope to block him in the control room his look was not unfriendly only assessing the american stirs he said hart swung his gaze around the control room just admiring this latest example of german engineering too bad its too late to affect the war colonel drexler doesnt think so colonel drexler is a danger to himself and to others freiwald paused at that and what are we to make of you im a little uncertain of that myself captain owen glanced around at the half dozen crew members manning instruments they regarded the american curiously im an american officer who left my unit without permission to try to rescue a german woman from this crazy war im your enemy and yet i agreed to lend my spelunking expertise to this mission but only after i was given a choice between this boat and a gestapo basement as was frau drexler he paused a moment to let freiwald digest this noticing the german officer glancing toward a curtained cubicle where he assumed greta had been assigned theres a connection between you and our biologist we knew each other before the war and yet she is married to colonel drexler who forces you on this voyage hart nodded life gets complicated and what cave does the colonel wish you to explore hasnt jurgen told you where were going yet no believe me youre happier not knowing i doubt well be coming back freiwald frowned is that a threat no simply a prophecy but theres a solution he raised his voice slightly ill accept your surrender now and we can sail for norfolk the war is over captain freiwald laughed unfortunately it isnt not for you or for me and my loyalty remains with my country so i think ill decline your terms he scrutinized the american his curiosity not satisfied my crew informs me that in talking to colonel drexler just a few minutes ago you used the adjective dangerous to describe yourself hart shrugged any man is dangerous when pushed into a corner yet im not as dangerous to you as jurgen i promise just dont threaten my boat hart i have a fondness for the u i respect a mans fondness for the things he loves then he stepped around the captain and moved on greta he stopped outside her curtained cubicle owen are you all right one of the ss men suddenly filled the passageway he was thickly muscled and his face was mapped with a relief of scar tissue wounds from the front hart guessed the mans irongray hair was in a stubby crew cut bristlehead the pilot mentally dubbed him youre not to talk to frau drexler she may be ill she gets seasick i need to check on her were submerged there is little roll she may be sick anyway bristlehead leaned into his face youre not to talk with frau drexler stay away from her away from this part of the boat youve no business with the colonels wife i like this part of the boat if you try to stay ill tie you up in the engine room hart considered then the yellowhaired giant hans came through a hatchway as well towering over them both the pilot studied their faces in america this is called an ugly situation he turned greta he called softly theres something i havent told you about the island something that will give us a chance then he looked defiantly at the ss men and retreated while the new submarine could cruise for days underwater progress was still swiftest on the surface as they came abreast of africa the germans elected to risk surfacing at night with the swells came motion as the submarines sausage shape rolled word filtered through the boat that the woman whod kept closely to her cabin was queasy drexler had been uncomfortable approaching her ever since shed tried to escape with hart now he used her seasickness as an excuse to look in on her are you ill im all right i have a bucket i can have schmidt look at you god no please leave me alone he considered perhaps it would help if you were more active jurgen come with me it was not a request he pulled greta out of her cabin and led her to ladders that descended two decks to the boats lowest level she looked down sulkily whats there our future the compartment at the bottom had a clearance of only six feet and was shaped like a trough the bulkheads curving inward toward a narrow deck above the keel i had them set this storage compartment aside for you he said encouragingly as your laboratory she glanced around there were two metal cabinets and a number of wooden crates on the floor but no sink or workbench pipes and cables snaked over the surfaces it was cold this low in the boat the light was clinical and harsh near the ladder shadowy and inadequate in the recesses they could feel the throb of the engines just astern in the soles of their feet cozy she said without enthusiasm something moved in the dark and she peered closer caged animals she realized with a start recognizing their smell she went to inspect you brought animals is this an ark to test your drug i didnt think humans would readily volunteer i had no idea they were on board weve kept them out of the way so as not to make the sailors uneasy one of the men jacob looks after them so will all this work for what to win the war greta im trying to help you will this satisfy your needs she bit her lip its impossibly cramped and inadequate but perhaps with modifications we need a bench a drain he nodded encouraged he went to a crate and lifted a lid your old biology books i had them brought along to help he lifted the one on top it was the text on whales hed given her on the schwabenland the memory startled her it had been so long she looked around again its actually like a refuge down here she acknowledged less crowded the roll is less too near the keel she even laughed at that convince my stomach in an emergency youre to come here this is your battle station the hatch will be sealed and youll be isolated but out of the way and as safe as any of us she shrugged he reached out then to tentatively touch her shoulder but she pulled away greta im sorry things came to this that everythings so awkward but now in the end maybe we still have a chance to do some good together she was in no mood to reply to this and they stood in separated silence when do we get to antarctica she finally said in order to say something two weeks perhaps less and when do we get back that depends on you doesnt it she summoned her courage are you going to she couldnt bring herself to utter the word kill are you going to leave us down there jurgen drexler was taken aback he swallowed no he shook his head at first i wanted to leave him but what would be the point youre about to help me achieve what i want and eliminating him wont win you back so if you cooperate ill set him free possibly ill put him in a life raft off some port of refuge port stanley in the falklands perhaps or ushuaia in argentina even cape town and what about me thatll be your choice i cant stop you from joining him she looked incredulous i wont stop you from joining him if thats still what you want he saw the look of new hope on her face and realized he may have been too soothing of course this promise is contingent on both of you doing your jobs properly so you can play with disease no to combat it he grimaced frustrated listen i know you hate me right now but this trip isnt as awful as you think when the time is right ill explain my plan in full and you may see our mission and me in a different light and then you can choose between us jurgen ive chosen why cant you accept that i think i have as much as could be expected he is on this boat after all then let me talk to him no look at this clutter let him help me down here no i trust you but not him if you wish to talk talk to me if you need some help come to me sailors and soldiers of the third reich drexlers voice crackled over the intercom as many men as possible had crammed into the control room where he was speaking because it was easier to hear him in person than over the crude intercom system others cocked their heads toward the loudspeakers all were curious about their fate i bring you greetings from our fuhrer adolf hitler and from his designated successor reichsmarschall goring we have set out on a long voyage to a distant destination all of you of course are wondering about our mission and you men of the navy must wonder about so many new faces here on board i apologize about the added crowding these soldiers i assure you are vital to our success hart was lying on his bunk frowning at the nazi squawking next to his bunk an engineer had his head tilted up listening our destination is antarctica drexler paused for dramatic emphasis there was a murmur of excited comment throughout the boat the engineer frowned a cold place but not as dreadful as you might think our northern winter is antarcticas summer and we hope to find tolerable weather as we go south with strength endurance and will we should be able to accomplish our task rapidly and go home greta stood in the passageway by her cubicle looking somberly at her husband and what is that task the chance to change history is given to few men to us of the u that opportunity has been granted we are setting out for the distant continent to retrieve a new drug an underground organism significant enough to affect the tide of the war security prevents me from explaining fully the purpose of this compound but clearly berlin and uboat command wouldnt risk one of germanys best submarines on such a distant mission unless it was vitally important heads nodded this isnt a combat mission with luck well never encounter the enemy were like a silent cat stealing stealthily across and under the sea yet if we do meet opposition we must battle to the last ounce of human will because what were attempting to accomplish on this mission could truly save the lives of our loved ones in the reich drexler looked at freiwald there are rumors of allied superweapons clearly germany requires superweapons of its own to defend the fatherland this is our mission to obtain the key to a superweapon and you men are the agents of deliverance were journeying to an antarctic island and should be back home early in the year as heroes and saviors for a while our purpose will remain a military secret but when its finally revealed the world will gasp at your achievement he nodded confident i believe divine providence has made this voyage possible i put my faith in his will and the will of our fuhrer drexler let his gaze sweep the control room then lifted his arm heil hitler and rising like a phalanx of spears the other arms in the room came up heil hitler came the roar through the boat hart pressed his hands over his ears otto kohl was tired sore and broke his escape from vigo had cost him all he had buying him miserable truck donkey and cart rides across dusty mountains his suit was filthy and torn his feet blistered his assurance and authority gone but the american intelligence officer had come out of the embassy in lisbon to meet him anyway now the german nervously licked his lips considering for the thousandth time what he was about to do maybe he had been corrupted as drexler had claimed or saved yes the attache said a bit impatiently my name is otto kohl he began your records will show i escaped from american army custody in france ive been to germany and i have the most extraordinary story to tell you chapter twentynine alarm alaaarm dive dive dive the klaxon blasted through the boat setting off a tumult of cursing frantic hurtling men water roared into the submarines ballast tanks and the vessel began to nose downward hatches slammed and valves were cranked anything unsecured began to tip onto the floor my laboratory greta caught her coffee mug as it began sliding off the edge of the tiny mess table and plunged into the torrent of sailors hurrying to their battle stations shoulders cuffing her side as she struggled to the midships ladder dive hurry dammit dive dive captain freiwald came sliding down the conning tower ladder and banged onto the control room deck with his binoculars swinging and his cap knocked sideways what is it shouted lieutenant erich kluge the first officer airplanes carrier patrol probably freiwald looked up toward the tower that the sea was now enveloping as if he could see the sky damn were already south of the equator how did they pick us up greta noticed kluges accusing look as she rushed past the first officer had pointedly avoided her since shed displaced him in his cabin and now clearly viewed her as bad luck resigned she descended the ladder in a half fall and once at the bottom seized the labs hatch and banged it down after herself as shed been instructed turning the wheel locked in she dropped to the steel flooring a box was sliding with the tilt of the deck and she put out her foot to stop it the klaxon switched off battle stations report the intercom squawked one by one the submarines compartments complied laboratory secure she shouted at her turn her voice breaking from the tension then she sat on the box heart pounding one hand on the ladder to brace herself against the slope of the diving boat she could hear the nervous rustling of the rabbits hi she jumped he was sitting in the shadows at the rear of the compartment half hidden by boxes owen youre not supposed to be down here her tone was delighted by my reckoning im not supposed to be on this boat at all yet i cant seem to get off it the attack seemed a good opportunity to let people forget about me for a moment so i decided to drop in she shoved off the ladder to grasp him thank god they hugged fiercely ive been so lonely she buried her face in his chest i know he said meaning it they kissed for the first time since the air raid in berlin for a blessed instant they could forget where they were the tilt of the boat continued to steepen there was a thud from the first depth charge and the hull lurched theyre going to get closer he warned hold on she nodded grimly grasping a pipe and watched his lips move as he counted the seconds there was a second detonation a throbbing boom this time that jerked the submarine as if it had been rammed she felt the shock punch her body and was thrown violently sideways hitting the curved bulkhead hard enough to have the wind knocked out of her jesus hart groaned he too had been tossed theyre right on top of us another explosion rang the plunging submarine like a gong rolling it sideways a cabinet popped open and vomited a spray of supplies the lights blinked and went out owen it was a pained gasp the tilt of the deck was increasing greta are you all right i think so just stunned the boat bucked again shuddering and then again they could hear shouts from the sailors on the decks above yet these explosions were slightly less violent than before less close she found him in the dark and clutched at his clothing crawling up his length so they could hold each other again weve got to stop meeting like this he whispered more lightly than he felt they waited in the dark as time ticked by with agonizing slowness they could hear a gush of water but didnt know what it meant the hull creaked were going deep she observed two more blows more distant now the airplanes were depthcharging blind the slope of the deck kept increasing and the ruins of gretas laboratory cabinet slithered along the floor the laboratory rabbits were scrabbling at their wire mesh there seemed no end to the dive owen are we going down he couldnt answer the sailors above had fallen silent and the steel in the hull was groaning there was a sharp report somewhere in the submarine like the bang of a gun and then another whats that something giving way i think bolts valves how deep is the ocean here he asked worriedly she hugged him harder i dont know three kilometers deep enough more explosions but distant enough that they just echoed through the hull making it quake the submarine hull squealed it sounds like a whale she whispered then the tilt began to lessen it was as if freiwald was hauling on the reins of a horse bringing its head up the leveling was agonizingly slow but it was happening the boat creaked like a complaining hinge they were sweating waiting for it finally the keel was even i think weve stopped sinking he whispered as if a noise would point them down again they sagged in relief now what we hide suddenly blue emergency lighting came on the glow was eerie the chaos was not as bad as it had sounded while things broke in the dark but the floor was littered with debris they examined each other your arm is cut he said pointing she nodded numbly he tore a scrap of clean rag and bound it and they began boxing what they could its stuffy can we open that hatch he shook his head not until were safe the air will get worse before it gets better he used a folder to shovel up shattered laboratory glassware then found a storage tarp to lay on the deck and protect them from remnants the submarine on battery power was quiet now the crew trying not to make a sound the germans were trying to creep away having secured what they could owen and greta sat companionably side by side there was nothing to do but wait do you think theyve given up no theyll be orbiting overhead waiting for us to surface and calling for destroyers with sonar they wont give up easily how long hours i suspect hours and hours she leaned against him good they were quiet for a while slowly recovering their equanimity in the calm then their conversation started up again drifting lightly from topic to topic theyd almost succeeded in blocking out the seriousness of their situation when suddenly they heard a ghostly faroff echo ping uhoh ping whats that my navy were still being hunted they listened her head on his chest she could hear the thud of his heart ping ping ping theyre getting closer he pushed her upright grab the ladder again brace yourself she pulled away reluctantly if they hit us will it be quick yes in truth he didnt know ping ping ping ping they could hear the screws of the destroyer the submarine trembled slightly freiwald was trying to accelerate and turn away wham a wrenching concussion as powerful as the first one and then another and then a third the light went out again and greta gave a short sob involuntarily as the uboat heeled their bodies lurched sideways feet kicking hanging on with their arms owennn she moaned the deck began tilting again god hes trying to go deeper ping ping ping ping hang on twin thuds shaking the submarine to its core the power of the explosions throbbed through their bodies and hart felt he was clenching his jaw to keep his teeth from rattling there were more bangs and they could hear oaths on the deck above and a roaring hiss of water the u was groaning the depth squeezing it in on itself she crawled to him in the dark im going to hang on to you she whispered ping ping ping were pulling away from them i think wham the boat shook not quite as hard this time maybe it would be best just to end it like this she whispered in each others arms easier no were going to beat him he did not mean the destroyer more explosions farther away this time sluggishly as if waterlogged the deck once more leveled i wonder how deep we are now he could sense the sea pressing like a vise tons of dark water it was oppressive slowly the depthcharging receded the gush of water and the cries slowed then stopped the boat was quiet again a crypt he sank his face in her hair she sighed reaching up to stroke his head jurgen told me hes going to let us go oh really i asked him if he was going to leave us in antarctica abandon us the question embarrassed him he said if we do what he wants hell put us off the submarine in a raft near a foreign port and you believe that i dont know what to believe he seems unpredictable i think he still loves me in a way but i no longer know him greta he cant let us go why not if he gets what he wants because he thinks hes going to win the war with a secret we know because were sitting in germanys newest submarine because he needs your expertise to manufacture what hes after im an american intelligence officer greta do you think hes going to collect this drug for a plague and then put us ashore to talk about it the only way hell put me in a raft is if im already dead they were silent for a while is he evil owen is germany evil he smiled wryly i think were supposed to call it moral confusion besides you told me hes simply dedicated no she shook her head he wants to destroy what he cant possess thats wrong they lay waiting listening the sonar had grown more distant like confused dogs the destroyers and airplanes were circling somewhat feebly the blue emergency light flicked on again hart let go of the ladder and slid down on the tarp holding greta hell be angry i sneaked down here you know dont worry she said kissing him he cant get too vindictive just yet he needs us yes but i wonder how much those soldiers of his would find the cave entrance eventually and someone schmidt maybe can find and collect the goo the image made greta laugh somehow i dont see dr schmidt as a swashbuckling spelunker but her lightheartedness was cut short ping damn they waited ping the interval was longer the sonar had lost them again im hot she finally complained suddenly restless sweaty without ventilation the temperature in the submarine was rising i feel like im buried like im dying buried alive me too she sat up shaking her head no i can feel you youre alive youre hard down there she pointed greta its hot and were in danger and i want to take my clothes off take them off before i die please take them off me owen i want to make you harder he swallowed and glanced at the hatch if we surface thats what makes it exciting she hauled off her sweater im tired of dying ive been dying for six years she unfastened her bra and tossed it aside then she bent her breasts brushing him and worked at his buttons ive been dying and losing my life and now i have this one moment and no longer care about the next one or what anyone thinks so hurry hurry before the destroyers come back im very sweaty and very wet jesus he yanked at his clothing and then hers frantic with desire and uncertain what to pull off first it didnt seem to matter as they kissed and tugged soon she pushed him onto his back and was astride him her eyes dilated her mouth partly opened i want you more than anything in the world she whispered and then she enveloped him like liquid fire arching her own back his hands on her nipples their bodies slick with sweat and heat their breath short and gasping in the increasing closeness of the chamber as she rocked up and down before he could control himself he exploded inside her greta giving a stifled cry as he bucked then she leaned over him to let him suck a breast her whisper hot and urgent in his ear i hope the destroyer keeps hunting because were not done you know ping they were spent the couple lay breathing shallowly half unconscious and drifting in troubled dreams from the lack of oxygen after their lovemaking the destroyers had come again hammering on the boat with remorseless fury theyd hung grimly to the ladder and to each other jaws clenched as the explosions wrenched them again and again and again the light died once more then a pipe had burst with a spray of water like cold needles and owen had hauled himself up to grope in the dark for the shaken valve to shut it off leak secured greta had gasped to the intercom in reply to freiwalds anxious question the hatch remained shut they slumped their lungs starved waiting for another pass from the warships above it didnt come time crawled the eerie blue light came on again like the glow from an antarctic ice cave she sighed now would be a time to end it after weve made love no he stirred greta listen we do have one chance its a desperate one probably a crazy one but its the one reason i agreed we should come along before i escaped from the island last time i found something i could use to try to escape the chance is too slim for you to attempt it but if im gone again jurgen will probably let you live go back with him on the submarine to germany if i make it ill find you there no im not leaving you again he touched her cheek the side of her face listen hes going to kill mekill me once i show him the way back into that volcano unless i can escape this is my best chance your best chance is to stay put and try to keep jurgen and the others from hunting me down she looked doubtful what is it when i crawled out of the cave i found a cove he whispered to her for some time she lay there deep in thought but how will you get that chance i dont know she rested her head on his shoulder i suspect it will be up to me to make it he could say nothing to that eventually they slept the roar and shudder of the boat woke them hart looked at his watch sixteen hours the ballast tanks were finally being blown and the submarine slowly rising it was like being lifted from molasses they groped hurriedly for their clothes hauling them on you stay behind for a moment greta said try to sneak back in the excitement perhaps no one will notice where you were i want him to know where i was exactly where i was so theres no confusion no you have to survive owen survive until your chance dont lose your head they could hear a rising excitement from the decks above and when the schnorkel broke the surface a cheer rang out the diesel engines rumbled into life and a cool breath of air came from the vent like a spring in a desert so its not over after all she sounded almost sad we must go on for a while someday this is going to be over and were going to be together someday were going to have time yes someday just remember to stay away from jurgen she hugged him and moved toward the hatch the handle was turning she hoped to go up before anyone spotted owen but when the hatch clanged open she had to jerk her head back from the fall of a pair of boots drexler thumped to the deck looking concerned greta are you all right i was worried about you then he froze it was the damned american greta had backed to stand with hart fresher air was pouring in through the hatch and the couple took deep shuddering breaths holding each other in support jurgen himself looked haggard his face lined with sleeplessness and his shirt soaked with sweat he stared at the pilot in disbelief i told you to stay away from her he said hoarsely yes you did god damn you drexlers movement was swift he yanked greta away shoving her against the bulkhead and then whirled at his rival the pilots fist struck him square in the face and the nazi flew backward slamming into the ladder with a grunt he toppled stunned onto the deck hart clutched his fist wincing get up you son of a bitch owen dont theyll kill you there was a riot of shouts above and more booted bodies fell from the hatchway filling the crowded laboratory it was the storm troopers drexlers goons hart hauled his fist back to strike again but hans lashed out expertly with a leg and the pilot went down with a bang the wind whooshing out of him greta screamed and sprang scratching and was cuffed aside as hart boosted himself off the deck a boot caught him in the midsection and he dropped like a bag of sand another struck his head he blacked out greta was sobbing bristlehead loomed over her waiting leave her alone it was drexler the words slurred by a bleeding mouth he stood up stiffly humiliated his body shook as he strove to contain his emotion he pointed to hart i want him chained this time until we get to the island the ss men nodded then he pointed to greta and her i want alone down here with me they dragged the unconscious american up through the hatch and it clanged shut she stood stiffly trembling drexler turned his face a moment to spit some blood then licked his lips as he stared at her his chest rose and fell his eyes wounded you did it with him didnt you the tone was of utter disbelief did it with him right here on the goddamned boat right in front of seventy men my god she closed her eyes a tear sliding down please dont hurt him hurt me but not him hurt you his voice filled with wonder hurt you my god what could i possibly do to you that would remotely approach what youve done to me youve destroyed me youve obliterated any scrap of pride i had left youve buried me with shame youve made me a laughingstock hurt you what a joke i told you she shouted her eyes bright and wet i told you and you wouldnt listen i told you i loved him and not you so you put the three of us together on this damned submarine like a crazy man babbling about working together what did you think was going to happen he looked defeated a last measure of civility tears were running freely down both cheeks dont you see its too late for that he nodded dully indeed she waited but he made no move so what are you going to do jurgen he turned back to the ladder save germany chapter thirty hart woke slowly he was woozy his body sore when he turned there was a rattle and he blearily opened his eyes he had a manacle on his wrist surprisingly heavy a chain led to a stanchion supporting his bunk the submarine was rolling he dimly noted its diesels drumming a steady rumble that pounded in his head they were on the surface and moving fast well hell he tugged feebly on the chain slowly remembering what had happened it was a wonder drexler hadnt killed him apparently he really was needed wake up you need to eat the pilot opened his eyes again it was a sailor who bunked near him jacob his name was holding a mug of soup you should stay away from women theyre bad luck hart sat up painfully and sipped the broth seemed like it was flowing directly into his veins my luck is due to change not on this mission i suspect hart sipped again were past the destroyers running on the surface jacob nodded for now but we had to release some fuel to make them think they scored a hit and were rapidly burning whats left i want to get out of this coffin so does every man in the uboat arm dont expect any sympathy from me hart drained the cup good jacob said now you go see the captain i dont want to see the captain that doesnt matter he wants to see you the pilot lifted his manacled arm the sailor took out a key to unlock the chain the captain said to release you if the colonel objects he can take it up with freiwald groaning hart swung out of his bunk and followed jacob to the control room up there the engineer pointed hart looked questioningly at the ladder the captains on the conning tower here take this coat and hat the tower well was shockingly cold after the long confinement in the submarine cold enough to almost take his breath away then he inhaled deeply sucking in clean air and felt lightheaded almost intoxicated it was glorious shut the damn hatch the pilot stood next to the captain it was night the uboat was racing furiously through the swells rocking with an easy gait as water foamed in a glittering rapid down the narrow foredeck hart hadnt realized how far south theyd come the germans were in a realm of lunar light so intense that icebergs glowed like the white mountains of the moon the milky way was as palpable as a silk ribbon stars and moon so reflective in the sea that there was an illusion they were sailing into the sky or sailing upside down theyd entered the southern ocean and he could pick out the southern cross antarctica lay somewhere ahead hart pulled up his hood freiwald was leaning forward on the conning tower bulkhead to watch for ice while a sailor kept watch from the antiaircraft gun mount behind too far to hear what the pair said out here it seemed as if they were the only people on the planet weve made good time captain these boats are incredibly swift underwater and incredibly strong weve just broken a depth record thats why youre alive right now if we had enough of them we could control the atlantic he shook his head but we dont we in the navy knew this war was madness in donitz told us to be prepared to fight for seven years well be lucky if we last that long jacob said you fooled them with a release of an oil slick confused them at least our satisfaction may only be temporary we no longer have enough fuel to get back and so ive had to radio for a milch cow a supply submarine to rendezvous on our homeward voyage it was a risk to make the call uboat command claims its scientifically impossible to break our codes and yet why are all my friends on the bottom i prefer to stay off the radio what are our chances then perhaps you know better than i the captain said searchingly the pilot laughed my chances are lousy i make a hash of things in antarctica even in peacetime and now youre doing no better in war his irritated tone sobered the pilot meaning i called you up here because its time i learned whats going on between you and the drexlers i dont tolerate fighting on my boat i dont like my thirteen new passengers i dont like arrogant ss pricks pretending to command my submarine i dont like women showing up where they dont belong and i dont like my insubordinate american prisoner i want to hear a reason why i shouldnt throw all three of you overboard before you cause more trouble well hart considered you cant toss me because im the only one who knows how to get into a mountain to fetch what germany wants you cant toss greta because shes the only one who knows how to process the drug were going to find you could toss jurgen i cant see that hes any use at all freiwald scowled why did you go to the laboratory during the attack you knew that wasnt your station i didnt see how it mattered where i was i have no combat duties on board dammit answer my question why did you insist on seeing the woman after you were told not to hart hesitated only a second im in love with greta captain and shes in love with me shes married to jurgen drexler in name only we fell in love before the war on a prior expedition to the island were going to i was delayed returning to the ship drexler reported i was dead and eventually he persuaded greta to marry him when i learned she was still alive i stole a plane flew to berlin and convinced her to run away with me as you can imagine this has produced some tension among the three of us god in heaven freiwald frowned does the high command know about this of course not if they knew the truth drexler would be in an asylum but then so would half the high command freiwald threw him a sour glance but didnt dispute the point and you why do you go along with this mission you feel no loyalty to your country to its cause quite the contrary hart said grimly he paused wondering how much he should say finally he decided he had nothing to lose by being frank captain theres a famous proverb about a peasant who angers a great king sufficient to have the king order his death just as hes about to lose his neck the peasant yells out to the sovereign wait if you give me an additional year to live ill teach your horse to talk the king thinks it over and deciding he has nothing to lose grants the temporary reprieve afterward a friend of the peasant approaches him and asks why hes struck a bargain he obviously cant deliver on the peasant replies a lot can happen in a year i could die the king could die even better the kings horse could teach himself to talk freiwald smiled at the punch line youre amusing hart amusing and i think very much a wild card in this whole thing you make me nervous i guess i have to hone my relationship skills freiwald shifted slightly to put his back to the wind this drug everyone keeps referring to tell me about it a drug to control a new plague the worst disease youve ever seen jurgen drexler wants to unleash it on the world and he needs your help to do it and you think this is wrong i think its evil to obtain an antibiotic a cure is the only safe way to unleash the disease surely youve figured that out by now jurgen says theres more to his plan has he told you what it is no nor me captain you mustnt help him with this freiwald looked out at the icebergs drifting across the sea have you ever been to hamburg hart yes the earlier expedition left from hamburg have you ever seen a firestorm its effect he swallowed no the british caused a firestorm in hamburg a city burning so hot that it sucks oxygen toward its center like a whirlpool winds so powerful they can sweep up little children did you know that in one night more people died in hamburg than in your american battle of gettysburg not soldiers women children old people i saw the london blitz captain youre describing modern war exactly and thats why jurgen drexler is no monster hes simply a modern man a modern warrior religion has been replaced with ideology the centurions of morality are gone the walls of order breached we live in a barbaric age captain if you follow drexler to the bitter end i swear hell kill you his cause is disaster dont risk death for this man i dont risk death for this man whose mind and character i find dubious at best i dont risk death even for our fuhrer but i do risk death for the fatherland i do risk it to save germany and i dont fear death do you know why no why because ive already died and the man you see standing before you is a ghost you see my family was in hamburg that night and they were roasted in that firestorm and all the good in me died with them he nodded so you will help us hart because in the modern world terror must be met with terror somewhere it has to end captain and jurgen drexler promises he can end it so now youll go below so jacob can lock you to your bunk again chapter thirtyone atropos island loomed on the horizon like a thunderous cloud towering and shadowy the white of its glaciers evaporated into mist that billowed to form fantastic canyons of creamy vapor the confection topped by the darker syrup of a volcanic plume from the second peak the increase in eruptive activity did not appear to be threatening enough to prevent their reentering the caldera anchorage but the drift of ash added to the unease of the german soldiers and sailors on deck as they approached the island the sea was a flat calm the submarine threading slowly through dark water between rafts of pack ice the temperature was below freezing and the conning tower was frosted the sky overhead was a patchwork an occasional squall would send a brief snow flurry across the boat followed a few minutes later by pale polar sun as they rounded the flank of the island some of the flakes were grayer and grittier volcanic ash the sailors were told they held up their mittens in wonder even hart was allowed to come up on deck he watched the tail of volcanic smoke with disquiet wondering what this change meant for descending underground and yet when the u nosed through the caldera entrance the harbor seemed not to have changed at all in six years there was still the same pinto pattern of pumice and snow still the absence of any bird or animal life still the lonely beaches that steamed in the cold even the crates of supplies left by the schwabenland remained undisturbed he shivered but not from the temperature the familiarity of it after so many years seemed chilling the bodies of the mountaineers he assumed still lay where they fell stained a coffee color and mummified by the dry freeze of time freiwald anchored not far from the underwater wreck of the bergen and the uboat men on deck began assembly of a prefabricated motor launch antarctic clothing was dragged out of storage and ropes buckets lanterns lamps and packs were readied despite the smoking volcano there was an air of excitement aboard now that theyd survived the attack and reached antarctica here would be a tale to tell ones grandchildren about hart was issued a parka boots a backpack lights food and climbing gear that included an ice ax he joined five other ss men on the foredeck last to emerge were jurgen and greta it was the first time the pilot had seen her since the depth charge attack and she granted him a brief reassuring smile but didnt attempt to speak she was solemn as she looked at the island owen was relieved that her face was unmarked drexler seemed subdued but determined heres where you earn your keep hart he growled keeping between the pilot and greta i could blast and dig my way into the mountain the old way but it would take time and we have no timbers to shore up the ceiling the alternative you found will prove more expedient i hope it might be a tight squeeze for some of your gorillas jurgen those boys afraid of the dark the storm troopers looked scornfully at the pilot my men arent afraid of anything but failure which is the only thing you should fear as well well get what we came for one way or another but if you and my wife assist as promised things will be easier for everyone hart looked evenly at the soldiers looking forward to their company especially hans there the one with the big boot the yellowhaired giant grinned at him they clambered into the launch motored ashore and the party shouldered their packs the pilot led off switchbacking up the slope of the crater soon they were sweating in the cold the submarine shrinking in the lagoon below as they neared the rim hart noticed the launch had returned to the submarine and another party was boarding the pilot thought he recognized among them the cadaverous hunched figure of schmidt where was he going they moved on up to the crest and out of sight of the submarine drexler bringing up the rear with greta it was clear he wasnt anxious for the american to talk to her but the german maintained his own stiff distance from her as well whatever their exchange after the depth charge attack it hadnt been a friendly one owen decided to be patient despite the situation his spirits had revived somewhat with his escape from the confines of the u even the dour ss men brightened the air was sharp and cold and exquisitely clean the unaccustomed walking brought an almost welcome tightness to their muscles hart paused frequently drink lots of water he kept admonishing its arid here despite the snow they circuited the crest in a window of brilliant sunshine hart looking down the dry valley where he knew the husks of the dead germans still lay scattered was that where schmidt was aiming to get the bodies or the spores the pilot decided against pointing out the deadly vale to his group of germans like it or not they all needed each other to descend safely into the mountain panic wouldnt help beyond the valley he could see the other volcano exhausting unevenly sometimes the plume would be dark with ash and other times it would lighten with steam the snow around its top had been stained charcoal he wondered what elmer would make of this the island doesnt want you to be here the old eskimo would have said i dont want to be here either hart would have replied when theyd hiked the rim to the seaward side of the crater hart abruptly turned off the crest below was a panoramic view to his left was the sea the island skirted by a fractured maze of pack ice directly ahead was the snowy plateau where hed landed the boreas bordered by the adjacent jagged ridge of rock that linked the two volcanoes behind to his right was the valley without a word he led them skittering downward on the snow of the volcanos outer flank they stopped on the shelf of bare basalt that extruded from the mountain a third of the way down its slope hart looked back up its tough going back over the rim of the volcano he told the soldiers youre going to get a workout packing our cargo to the submarine were not afraid to work hans said hart nodded of course we did have a tube leading right through the mountain right out to the caldera but colonel drexler demolished that one back in you can ask him about it on the way back up it was an accidental collapse hart and keep your tiresome history to yourself yes my commander he gave a mock salute and pointed with the tip of his ax the exit i found is right there still looking like a sleepy eye a dark slit of a hole looked out at the ocean and its mosaic of ice were crawling in there rudolf the man hart knew as bristlehead asked doubtfully its bigger inside they paused to get out the ropes and lights including miners helmets with headlamps as the others finished preparing to enter the cave hart looked intently down the volcanos flank at the small relatively icefree bay far below his eye swept its shoreline as if searching for something then while drexler was bent over his pack he moved quickly to greta its still there he whispered she looked down the slope quickly not seeing what hed spotted and then glanced at the sea the oceans so vast she worried but possible she stole a touch of his gloved hand hart are you ready drexler snapped he was following their gaze with suspicion obviously irritated at the whispering but not wanting to make a scene the ss men looked at the trio with interest im ready then do your job and lead the initial crawl led to the sandy room near the entrance then the tube became tight again as it led down into the mountain hart explained that hed leave a colored flag every ten meters or so to mark the convoluted route the cave would temporarily widen when they reached the long vertical chimney the elevator shaft that he and fritz had descended so long ago then narrow once again before the grotto theyd fix climbing ropes along the route the group worked slowly bracing themselves against a sudden fall periodically a rock would break loose and roll down through the spelunkers banging its way ahead of them into the pits below dammit this is worse than that midgetdesigned submarine hans complained after sliding through a tight spot on his back dragging his pack behind him at least its warmer in here than outside bristlehead responded its warmer anywhere than outside hart had to pause several times occasionally backtracking the lava tubes were a labyrinth itd been a miracle hed found his way back out in the dark now he deliberately took a periodic wrong turn trying to develop a mental picture of where all the alternate routes led the rest of the party rested gratefully while he explored i nearly died in here once and i dont want to make a wrong turn again he explained the chimney remained the most daunting the lava tube descended to its roof with the dangerous pitch of a childrens slide then opened to a vertical well hundreds of feet deep owen cautiously let himself down on a rope to that junction and letting his legs dangle in space dropped a rock to emphasize the need for caution it fell into the blackness without a sound for what seemed like an eternity of time finally banging and bouncing somewhere far below its echoes drifted up to them jesus one of the ss men said this dung hole is virtually bottomless were climbing down there not only that said hart but youre going to have to climb back out with a heavier pack than you have now i hate this fucking war finally we agree the pilot unreeled a rope into the darkness and started down pausing periodically to drive climbing pitons to anchor the line gingerly the others followed at the shelf where the tube from the old entrance joined the chimney hart paused until the group reassembled everyone was breathing hard he glanced at greta shed been compliant but silent freezing the nazis out and the soldiers tended to keep a wary distance drexler stayed nearer always between his wife and hart and yet avoided looking at her she was gazing down the chimney to where theyd descended before lost in memory when hart jerked his head down the horizontal tube and said this way gretas mouth opened in surprise and then closed they walked as if exiting the mountain from the tube that had collapsed jurgen hart called can you come up to the front i want to show you something drexler pushed ahead the beam from his headlamp picked out a wall of cascading rock from the cavein and it was obvious that hart had led them to another dead end he was impatient with the frequent detours but had refrained from complaining he still needed the american what is it he asked grumpily the result of german purpose hart was searching with the beam from his own helmet there he pointed greta gasped bones lying broken in a heap of rubble was a body decay far advanced in the relative warmth of the cave the skull still had a few leathery scraps a buckle buttons and a pocketknife were ensnarled on the web of tendrils clinging to the skeletal ribs rocks still obscured the mashed legs drexler had gone rigid why its fritz jurgen hart said lying right where that cavein you started crushed the life out of him there was a murmur of unease among the ss men this is bad luck one muttered drexler looked balefully at hart whats this got to do with our mission just underscores your deep concern for the men who serve under you spare me the finger pointing hart smartmouthed communist or not eckermann was not someone i wished dead he simply was in the wrong place at the right time well were going to bury him we dont have time for this maudlin pity hart crossed his arms were staying here until hes covered with rocks and a prayer said over his grave no one wanted to spend more time arguing in the depth of the cave the little german was swiftly covered with stones and hart led the others in the lords prayer a couple of the ss men stumbling over the words then he turned to the others this was one man before we go farther on this mission i want you to imagine burying a million others the victims of a new plague were all tired of your moral pretensions hart drexler added theres a war on and were down here to save lives not kill them to get a cure not a disease i suggest the first life you should worry about is your own so lead on owen looked at them sadly very well he pointed we go back to the shaft the men moved off anxious to get away from the body drexler led this time the pilot caught up to greta looking at her with concern are you all right she nodded yes we only quarreled it worries me to leave you alone with him im not afraid of jurgen i am the american intelligence officer sat on the embassy terrace in lisbon the contents of a folder spilled across the table it was evening the night cool but not unpleasant the naval attache had called them there maybe the kraut isnt a liar after all he told them come on sam the oss man scoffed he doesnt have a shred of evidence for his wild story and how do we know he didnt just murder hart the german is either a plant or a psychotic i thought that too the attache pointed to the papers except that his story is beginning to check out what do you mean six days ago an escort carrier task force transiting to the indian ocean put up a routine air patrol and encountered a german submarine in the south atlantic far away from any convoy route or the normal battlefields a big boat the pilots thought and their guess was that it was heading for japan on some kind of swap mission they depthcharged and got a slick they couldnt confirm the kill however so two days later we intercepted a coded radio message from a sub even farther south it said the pigboat was short on fuel and needed resupply to get back to germany asked for a future rendezvous with a milch cow but not immediately it was going somewhere first the timing is odd not enough time to get to japan certainly south america possibly or antarctica the oss man frowned think about it phil the naval attache reasoned this man kohl shows up raving about a secret mission and then we independently find a submarine about where he predicted it would be besides why would this kohl come here when hes an escapee from france because he wants us to divert resources way the hell down into antarctica its a nazi ploy maybe but what if hes right what if hes really changing sides an opportunist like him this late in the war sam weve got a destroyer at punta arenas weve got the biggest damn navy in the world hitler is on the ropes tell that to the guys getting pasted in the bulge and we can afford to divert one ship dammit phil what if hes right or what if the krauts are building some kind of secret hideout down there the deputy ambassador interjected quietly to hole up after the war i think sam is right i think we should ask the navy to check this out i dont know if we can convince washington we can if we promise them a sub to bag the attache said and we can put that damned oily nazi on board the deputy ambassador suggested to either help us find this sub or be left down there for causing us the trouble chapter thirtytwo greta felt violated the grotto in the cave had been a secret place a sweet memory shed clung to during all the dark years of the war now jurgens ss ruffians occupied it like lords their coarse laughter a despoiling sacrilege it was as if fate was determined to ruin all she held dear she loathed jurgen for coming here even if he didnt know what had happened on the blankets then perhaps he could guess and if he guessed it was like an invasion of her deepest privacy her fondest moment the memory had become stained owen was wet and shivering the germans were using him as a slave theyd rigged a rope down the chute of water that led to the underground lake and sent him down with small steel buckets hoisting up his harvest of the mysterious drug organism the lake was as warm as ever owen had reported but the constant soaking and the exhausting climb left him weary and chilled now hed been allowed a respite to throw his soaked clothes on the hot rocks and wrap himself in a blanket he looked frustrated and helpless sometimes greta caught him looking at her sadly and she had to look away not wanting to reveal her own despair as she squatted on the banks of the underground river the biologists own muscles ached as she sieved the slime into a concentration that would be packed to the surface two of the ss men had already departed with a load now jurgen came over and gazed downward at her his gloom had metamorphosed into nervous excitement now that the work had begun is this what we want he asked is this going to cure the disease she put down her sieve and tiredly rocked back on her heels i dont know jurgen yes this is what owen and i found but who knows if it can be grown in mass quantities this is such an unusual place a dark cavern its water full of unknown microscopic life and chemicals it may take a long time to duplicate in a laboratory we dont have a long time we barely have even a short time thats why its imperative to start experimenting now in the submarine i want to know whats necessary for success before we leave this island if we have to pump some of this water to propagate this organism well do it she wearily wiped her forehead with her arm so germany can unleash your microbe no so i can end this war she looked up skeptically jurgen cant you see how insane this is why do you insist on seeing me as a monster maybe because im a captive she stood stiffly her hands at the small of her back maybe because you named this island after the greek fate who ends life he scowled yes i looked it up listen i dont want a captive he said impatiently i want a partner i wouldnt have had to confine you if youd exhibited the loyalty and faith of a proper german wife and when have you ever behaved like a proper german husband when have you ever let love compete with ambition he half raised his hand at that and the ss men looked their way with interest then his hand dropped for gods sake lets stop this silly quarreling he hissed six years of marriage and still you dont know me still you dont understand me i understand that unless we move cautiously nothing good can come of this he looked impatient and thats where youre wrong only speed can win success he considered a moment youre right our motives are more complex than what i revealed in berlin but not in the way you think i told you i had more to reveal about my plans and now is the time i think time to comprehend what were doing here time you learned the true jurgen drexler he turned to the american hart come over here then he turned back to greta ill tell you both and then youll understand why weve come back this long hard way the trio moved out of earshot of the remaining three ss men and drexler stood thinking about what he was going to say their triangle looked bedraggled hart was wet his eyes tired and greta and jurgen were grimy no one had slept properly in weeks listen drexler finally began do you think id be down in this dank asshole of the earth processing scum if not for a great purpose i mean my god this is hell i think he waved at the grotto interesting that you claim to know jurgen hart said drexler scowled shut up for once you uneducated buffoon im tired of mockery from a man who has accomplished nothing with his life except the theft of my wife he let that hang has it penetrated your dim brain yet that i dont need you anymore now that youve led us back into the mountain that youve become superfluous to our expedition one more sneering comment and ill shoot you myself the pilot opened his mouth then thought better of it drexler took a deep breath all right good now its true that when we came to this island the first time my initial interest was solely in the disease a tool for german defense i thought or at least for research but then my men got sick and died and it seemed over at least until we could return so why not leave it be she asked im coming to that will you please listen he looked at her with frustration we reported what wed found of course but reich strategists pointed out such a disease was too dangerous for us to use unless our own troops were immune and then the war began our victories were stunning antarctica was far away and the matter receded from my mind but as the reichs fortunes darkened my thoughts returned to this island i remembered gretas excitement after your exploration of this cave and wondered if id been too hasty and then you appeared hart a personal disaster yes but also a revelation an inspiration because i realized that in our personal problems was a key to success not to destroy but to end the destruction to force an armistice to this war jurgen the wars ending soon anyway hart objected maybe by christmas thats where youre wrong thats what you dont understand even as we speak germany is launching a great new offensive in the west that will take the allies totally by surprise and this is only the beginning of what our fuhrer promises this remarkable new submarine that saved your life is merely one of hundreds being built that will soon reverse the tide of the naval war the reich has developed a new kind of airplane with a revolutionary jet engine and germany is building rockets capable of reaching america the war is not nearly finished hart it could go on for years years and years unless we act unless we succeed and you wouldnt disclose all these secrets unless im about to be sacrificed the pilot thought gloomily and so the idea that came to me is to use this microbe not as an instrument of mass murder but of mass salvation to put an end to this war once and for all to bring the world to its senses because with your antibiotic greta suddenly were not threatening death were offering life what look even if we could unleash this plague and perfectly protect our own people germanys peril would not be over the other side would still seek to retaliate there are rumors the americans are working on a superweapon of their own some new kind of bomb german scientists think such a bomb is years away but who knows what if we escalated the war and the united states replied in turn killing begets killing thats been the lesson of this century but what if we offered life what if we offered the allies the opportunity to cure a terrible plague in return for agreeing to an armistice what if we could achieve a ceasefire on our terms yes peace by an emergency effort of german doctors and nurses to end a pestilence in washington or london or moscow the couple looked confused but jurgen greta objected how would such a plague get started by rocket he answered matteroffactly or plane or submarine or even truck wed have to deliver the spores the swiftest would be a v air burst at night whole cities could be held hostage to the germ the clock ticking but no one would have to die if the allies agreed quickly enough to german help in return for peace and then the war could end youd infect a whole city yes and then save it to end the war you see to balance terror with mercy and thus bring peace in the final accounting well be heroes he looked at them expectantly but women children greta objected people will flee the problems with distributing an antibiotic those are details it will work it will work if we make it work and it begins here in this cave so you see im not a monster greta im a man of vision the one man who can clearly see how to end this war on german terms she looked at him with dismay hart spoke up well i quit drexler sighed hart you cant quit until i say so the threat was clear jurgen greta said despairingly just let the war end by itself no i refuse to be a victim of events when i have the opportunity to direct them what we have here is a dazzling opportunity far more dazzling than what we hoped for when we first came to antarctica this is what ive been waiting to tell you this is what ive been waiting to share with you will you help greta studied her husband for a long time then slowly sadly she nodded ill do what i have to do jurgen are the charges ready schmidt asked mildly hunching in the cold wind of the dry valley his voice was muffled behind the visor of his gas mask yes doctor it should be quite a show the ss man was splicing the wires to the detonator schmidt looked sourly at the smoking volcano above them the vista blurred by the scratched eyepieces of his mask the plume of ash had made him nervous the whole time they were collecting spores at the upper end of the frozen lake and he wanted to get back to the submarine before the damned woman did she might become irrational if she knew he was collecting more than a few spores to test the antidote if she realized theyd come to stockpile the disease as well as the cure that was not the only reason for his impatience he hated the outdoors and couldnt wait to get back to the controlled environment of the uboat he also hated the clammy rubber of the mask but knew it was all that was keeping him alive until greta returned with the antidote the mummified bodies theyd passed in the valley had been warning enough he dared not breathe a spore it was obvious the bacteria were carried to the surface in hot springs spores drying on the surface and then carried by wind across the island it might be impossible to permanently shut off the source but it seemed feasible to hide it at least until the end of the war lest the allies come here the reich had enough spores now to begin mass propagation in laboratories at the rapid rate of bacterial growth thered be plenty of plague within weeks their flowering would coincide with the readying of the rockets schmidt thought drexlers elaborate scheme to hold allied capitals hostage to peace was absurd too complicated better to kill as many of the enemy as possible while waiting for additional german superweapons to reach the field war was about killing not psychology but drexler was most energetic when allowed his naive dreams so the doctor let him prattle and the question was moot until both disease and cure were in hand schmidt was content to leave the final strategy to others as a man of science he preferred the purity of research he longed for a cigarette and wished he could tear off the mask to light one well at least the first step was done time to start back home detonation he ordered calmly the soldier twisted the crank a boom thundered on the glacier that hung over the end of the valley and a geyser of snow and dirty till erupted into the air cracks racing away on the ice then another and another and another on and on some explosions quite high on the frozen snout their crack was counterpointed by a deeper rumble of avalanche a slurry of snow chunks of ice and glacial rock debris started down pushing a billowing white cloud before it splendid the mask made schmidt look like a gigantic insect behind it his eyes glowed as he watched the mantle of the mountain slide down the ss squad faced away as a shock wave of air hit and staggered them a momentary blizzard of snow and dust blowing by then the avalanche clattered to a stop and it was quiet again the hot springs covered with a rubble of rocks dirt and chunks of ice wisps of steam curled upward the ss men cheered the sound muffled behind their masks the doctor studied their handiwork thered be some melt but the terrain was covered enough to discourage others from collecting the secret was sealed gentlemen the reich now holds a monopoly on the trump card of history he told them lets take our prize back to the boat chapter thirtythree greta was exhausted slumped on a crate in the submarines makeshift laboratory after almost thirty hours of nonstop work she was alone schmidt having succeeded in multiplying the microbe so they could test the antidote had finally pleaded the weariness of age and staggered off now she sat breathing through a gauze mask her hands rubbered staring at the cages with a sense of ashen victory four of the rabbits were dead their bodies elongated as if tormented on a rack she could see the small white teeth of their final grimace it was clear that the cave organism didnt immunize against the disease giving it to the animals before they were injected with plague had done no good at all the rest of the animals had survived however after being infected first by the microbe and then treated with antibiotic theyd sickened briefly some writhing in their cage and then recovered as a cure the stuff worked she hated killing the laboratory animals but maybe she had a bizarre tool now to save human lives and stop a greater madness as jurgen suggested had she done the right thing or was she making the unleashing of the microbe even more likely by combating it in her weariness she felt shed lost her moral compass and suddenly envied the certainty of the nuns shed grown up with but then what dilemmas did they ever face the sheltered sisters she wished she had owen to talk to the biologist stretched desperately tired and yet too tense to sleep conditions were so crude a single water pipe and a crude drain an alcohol stove planks had been set to make a workbench for schmidts microbial cultures the originating spores harvested from the dry valley the doctor hadnt wanted to draw on germanys safely guarded microbe supply he said because of the risk involved in taking the cultures aboard ship sans antidote better he explained to her to wait until they arrived at atropos to bring spore samples aboard the cultures were lined under lamps now petri platters of disease next to them were other cultures of more mild diseases which they had felt safe bringing along so far the antibiotic seemed equally effective against them greta intended to recommend destroying all the disease cultures before the uboat sailed their usefulness had pretty much ended and what was the point of taking chances the experiments suggested the expedition would be a success early tests in a vat showed promise that the drug organism could be grown and multiplied in germany gretas experiment at reducing the scum to a more stable storable and usable dry powder with heat and evaporation had also succeeded rabbits injected with it had recovered as rapidly as those given the compound raw so the antibiotic worked at least on animals or when swabbed or dripped into a lab dish admittedly drugs were so mysterious and variable that the organisms true value couldnt be determined before clinical human tests at home still they had the drug and that meant jurgen must keep his promise owen would be released from the cave and would come to her again here in the submarine wouldnt he unexpectedly the idea depressed her owens return would mean he would then attempt his escape and even if he succeeded which he admitted was unlikely theyd be separated again at least until the end of the war with owen gone the submarine would be sealed again for its long voyage home and shed once more be imprisoned in a microcosm of the reich shed come to despise locked together again with jurgen drexler she longed to run away with owen but knew that if she did the alarm might be raised more quickly and their chances cut to zero aboard she might delay or confuse any pursuit to save him she had to give him up that was their plan the necessity was terrible with a sense of grim purpose she reached into a drawer for the backpack shed pilfered and set out for the ships galley where she hoped to steal enough food to keep a man alive on the open sea for dare she think itseveral weeks hart groaned hans was awakening him again by jabbing him with the tip of a boot it was morning or what passed for morning in the sunless dungeon of the grotto the pilot was still sore from his tantrum the evening before the nazis arrogance had finally prompted hart to take a tired wild swing at the yellowhaired bastard and owen had found himself expertly flipped onto his back the nazis knees on his chest youre too easy hart i like to fight but you dont even make it fun hans had slapped him almost casually but enough to cut his lip you should learn to fight its part of being a man hart spat at him and was cuffed so hard that his head rang then he lay still defeated hes a pussy hans said to rudolf hart was also tired from the increasingly long swims into the lake to gather the diaphanous organism the ss men wouldnt help him sitting instead at the top of the waterfall to haul up his harvest and playing cards in the lantern light he knew they were trying to sap his energy as carefully as he was trying to conserve his strength he was a slave and when the gathering was done his life would be over as well no opportunity for escape had yet presented itself as if to remind him of that there was a clanking as he shifted his leg to get up each night hans shackled him with a manacle to a cluster of cooking pots that served as a crude alarm like the bell of a goat the storm trooper had said now a new ss man named oscar had descended for breakfast unshouldering his heavy pack with a relieved grunt the pans were unlocked from harts leg rinsed quickly and a small camp stove was turned on to heat water hart limped over to accept some bread they didnt give him enough to eat for the work he was doing when hed complained bristlehead had kicked his soup into the sand youre in luck american the nazi now growled weve got nearly as much as we can carry out of this hole one more day youre tired of swimming no im tired of swimming yes and you should learn to be tired of women he waggled a spoon at the pilot they bring nothing but trouble look at you the ss men laughed look at me hart chewed morosely then thinking oscar he finally ventured thats a big pack you brought in if all were doing is climbing out heavy yes but i get to leave it here leave it the men looked at each other hans shrugged explosives bristlehead explained to finish what the colonel started back in seal this place up so that only germany has this drug kaboom he spread his hands smiling then he squinted in mock suspicion you dont have other exits up your sleeve do you do you think id tell you he sneered youd tell me anything if i wanted you to well the answer is no but i think this place is going to blow anyway have you felt those tremors that other volcano like the cavein before hans and oscar looked uneasy but bristlehead nodded good well give mother nature a hand he brought his hands together with a crash now enough dawdling time to go swimming hart the pilot wearily stood and shed his boots and outer garments stuffing them under a rock near his blanket then he trudged to the lip of the water chute and grasped the fixed rope wincing as he stepped into the cold of the underground river if he was going to escape hed have to give those thickheaded bastards the slip on the climb out of the cave first the shadowy lake however i could use more help he called we have to pack out your damn scum said oscar thats help enough the morning watch had begun and schmidt had risen with the sailors unshaven and with his gray hair matted and tangled up on deck he took a drag on a cigarette and stared thoughtfully across the lagoon reflecting on how splendidly the mission seemed to be coming together hed already cached a plentiful supply of the spores in a sealed container and the last of the antidote organism was due to be gathered today assuming frau drexlers testing still showed it was effective they were home free the next step was to process the remaining cave sludge before more came aboard he descended to the laboratory greta was already there peering uneasily at his microbial cultures on the lab bench ah i see your appetite for the work has you up early too schmidt said she glanced up im not used to such enthusiasm so early in the morning doctor why the good cheer why not reflexively his hands went for another cigarette but then he remembered the injunction against smoking belowdecks were about to set sail for the reich where the high command is bound to be delighted at the gifts well be bearing i assume your data still suggests one hundred percent efficiency when the drug is reduced to a powder there are no guarantees until we administer it to human subjects i just hope the antibiotic is effective against a broad array of bacteria if as i suspect this substance is many times more effective than penicillin there are many sick people well be able to help yes of course he gazed at her with wonder did she really think they were here to cure a flu greta noticed his look not that you care i know you and jurgen have a different goal do you now schmidt looked amused she leaned back wearily i can halfway understand jurgens point of view hes a soldier he wants to win but youre a doctor schmidt you swore an oath the only vow i took was a personal one to follow knowledges path wherever it led me these organisms you and i have harvested these past few days our respective contributions to the reich they are a higher form of efficiency a purer biology only the ignorant walk away from knowledge especially knowledge that can be used in defense of the homeland greta looked at him sadly you lied to me didnt you you never had the microbe in germany you collected the spores not just for these tests but to take back home if you figured that out frau drexler youre the last one on the boat to do so the collection is necessary only because you threw your indignant fit in and destroyed your cultures betraying science so if i hadnt agreed to come back here this time to save owen there wouldnt be a threat of plague her tone was hollow dont exaggerate your importance i would have come for the bacteria anyway still ill concede youve been useful now you have your drug and i have my microbe weve gathered more than enough spore material for our purposes and if the enemy retraces our steps theyll find nothing what are you talking about do you think were reckless enough to let other nations follow our example we set explosives to bury the springs where the spores emerge let the allies poke where they will if they come theyll find rubble and by march the reich will have cultured enough to wipe out all our enemies greta looked at him in dismay yet her heart began to beat faster a flicker of excitement pushing aside her weariness then what we have on this submarine are now the only microbes and spores she clarified more precious than gold schmidt enthused he gave greta a wary look and i suppose youre about to volunteer to help me safeguard our stash protect them as you did on the schwabenland well you neednt bother the microbe has become a matter of state security and ive found a spot aboard for the remaining spores that i alone know about she looked at him with disquiet thats dangerous max what if a sailor stumbles on them what if freiwald finds out what youve tucked around his uboat safer than putting them in your custody safer than leaving them in this lab she had no comeback for that schmidt turned to go the spores are mine the drug is yours my advice keep your mind on the drug since your purification process appears to work i suggest you concentrate some more of this cave slime to make room an additional load will be coming on board from the cave soon chapter thirtyfour the gloom of the underground lake abruptly deepened hart stopped treading water it wasnt completely dark because there was still a faint blue glow from the ice roof but the reflected light that came from the lantern at the upper end of the cave waterfall had gone out he waited a minute for the storm troopers to restore it but nothing happened the pilot shouted there was no answer he could just make out the pale glimmer of the falls and he began breaststroking toward it the light didnt come back on he reached the rock shelf at the base of the waterfall rested a moment and then boosted himself up with growing apprehension he sidestepped along the ledge to the waterfall and groped in its spray for the climbing line the rope had disappeared hans he yelled rudolf silence theyd abandoned him so much for drexlers promise greta must have succeeded with the drug and the couples usefulness was at an end worriedly he wondered if drexler would harm her hart had expected them to wait until the last of the lake growth had been delivered to the sub his escape plan it was more a desperate hope than a plan had always called for gretas assistance shed organize a distraction of some sort make sure he had at least some supplies enough to attempt the unthinkable by simply leaving him in this dark hole though drexler seemed to have foreclosed that possibility he tried to think they must be satisfied he couldnt follow even though hed mentioned his climb out in the dark before how could they be so sure what were they counting on of course rudolf had said it they were going to blow up the cave my god he shivered dont panic if you panic youll never get back to greta he realized he had one chance they must have allowed time for themselves to get clear of the grotto fritzs skeleton had forcibly demonstrated how unstable the tubes were during a nearby explosion the lantern hadnt been extinguished that long it was plain hed have to catch them before the timer went off he clenched the cliff he would catch them hed climbed this waterfall and chimney so frequently along the rope learning hand and footholds that he should be able to do it blind without one now that would be tested reaching up in the cold water he groped for a familiar handhold found it and pulled placing his foot next yes just as he remembered think go slow enough to think when would the explosion go off he pushed himself up as the water beat on him in the dark leaning out to gasp for breath damn them but anger spoiled concentration so carefully three points on the rock at all times reach only with one hand or one foot up it was disorienting in the dark but he climbed until echoes told him hed reached the point where the water fell out of its pipelike chute toward the lake he reached in back of himself and his palm slapped rock yes he pushed off his back slamming against the other side of the chimney to wedge himself now he could ascend with more confidence how many minutes had passed how long would the timer be set for progress was painful at one point the chute widened so much that he had to brace with his arms instead of his back trembling from the strain then he was past it and sound and touch told him he was finally near the chutes upper lip bending and bracing he brought himself around to a point where he could lunge facefirst into the rushing river above the edge of the falls frantically grabbing for slimy handholds to prevent himself from being swept back down into the lake then he kicked and pulled furiously until he was up kneeling in the level stream chest heaving one hand around a vine for support a vine he dropped it as if shocked it had to be the wire of the demolition charge jesus christ he stood swaying as he caught his breath it was pitch black he carefully shuffled forward against the current until his shin brushed the wire and elaborately stepped over it a thought occurred to him if the germans had bothered to set explosives on the downstream end of the grotto where the river would eventually cut a new path anyway theyd certainly wire the upstream end as well hed have to watch for explosives there too how much time he counted his steps upstream trying to visualize the grotto one chance one chance he kept telling himself by his calculation he was near his sleeping spot there wasnt even a spark of illumination it was blacker than night as black as a tomb but if theyd been hasty he crawled out of the river and groped in the sand the mineral smell of the hot spring giving him a crude compass yes the wool of his blanket he scrambled across it banged painfully into a rock felt its underside thank god theyd left what hed stored there his parka boots and helmet the miners helmet the bastards had been too arrogant or too lazy to pack his gear out too stupid he sobbed a prayer of relief he found the battery and flicked on the light its modest glow seeming brilliant hastily he hauled on clothes and boots and sprang up with the helmet on his head the beam stabbing wildly around the lip of the falls he spotted a drooping wire connecting two charges on either side of the water a box a clock he inspected the timer hand had stalled at the zero point had the demolition failed he bent closer peering and realized there was an audible ticking the timer hand was simply close very close two minutes to go he didnt have a clue what would happen if he tried to disconnect the wire he began running upstream water spraying and the beam of his helmet bouncing madly ahead was the dark hole of the tunnel that led out of the grotto he jumped wedging his arms into the tunnel and kicked upward another wire caught on his coat damnation gently he lifted the parka free and humped over it like a worm losing the thread of seconds hed been counting in his brain his boot snagged and he tensed for an explosion that didnt come then he was past the wire and crawling furiously through the narrow tunnel his sphincter tightening at the thought of the charge about to go off at his back he came to the tight squeeze he and greta had found and wriggled through it like a madman his clothes a smear of dirt then on and on each yard a measure of safety something kicked him hard from behind and a roar clapped his ears the explosion actually lifted and shoved him forward hot as hell the roar blasting his helmet off and sending it sailing ahead of him until the battery wire yanked taut then he came down with an oof and a gout of heat and smoke and gritty debris rattled past him choking his throat with dust somewhere he could hear the crash of immensely heavy rock falling crawl dammit crawl he was clawing now the helmet jammed back on his head wriggling forward until he could rise to his hands and knees then to a crouch staggering as fast as he could with his bent back scraping rock air kept pummeling him as the ceiling gave way behind each collapse triggering another in a chain reaction he managed a stooped run just as the roof of the low tunnel gave way with a roar something heavy clipped him like the swipe of a claw and then he was beyond the cavein coughing painfully in a swirling cloud of dust and smoke his head ringing and the miraculously shining beam of his headlamp knocked awry for the moment at least he was alive he stood a minute dazed then he dimly remembered he didnt have time to rest the storm troopers were well ahead of him no doubt readying another explosion at the outer entrance he stumbled on finding the haze beginning to clear as he climbed up the slope of broken basalt boulders ahead was the vertical chimney that led out of the mountain he climbed to the plug that choked the chimneys base anxiety plagued him had they blown the outer entrance no not yet of course not yet the germans hadnt had time to climb out themselves get a grip panting he worked around the jam of rock to where he could see up the immense chimney flicking off his headlamp far far above was the bob of lamps like his own as remote as stars as elusive as fairy lights it was them the storm troopers they were still hoisting themselves and their packs of lake organism out of the cave slowly inching up the chimney toward the tunnel that led to his alternate exit the lights were like a taunting beacon somehow hed have to outrun them he groped along the wall yes they were packing out so much cargo theyd failed to carry out all the ropes and why bother with the initial explosion the american was certainly already dead the cave useless so theyd left in place the climbing line that followed the first pitch up the vertical shaft he grasped it and pulled as hard as he could with grim satisfaction should have cut it bristlehead should have stopped to make sure too cocky too lazy he put up a foot to climb the cave quivered then and he put out a hand to brace himself another explosion no a tremor from the sister volcano a sympathetic echo to the manmade bomb he heard cries of alarm from the germans far above and behind him there was a growl of settling rock shards rattled down the chimney and he crouched listening to them whine and shatter christ what a hellhole hed found then the cave quieted again the shouts echoed away both hart and the germans resumed climbing the pilot going as hard as he could while watching the lights above at least he wasnt burdened with a damn pack he was gaining twenty feet fifty seventy all by feel up the rope the cave so dark it was as if he was climbing in space it became a kind of rhythm his trance broken only by another falling rock this time dislodged by someone above he hugged the chimney wall as it sizzled past with terrifying energy its fragments clicking like angry insects when they ricocheted back up the shaft around him the rock had to be an accident he told himself there was no way the germans could be throwing at him no way they could see unlit owen hart the stalking ghost he reached the tunnel shelf where he and greta had first entered the cave and risked a quick blink of light another climbing line was still in place he grasped it what was that the voice came from far above what i thought i saw a light he waited the headlamps above had paused i dont see anything youre spooked someone growled come on lets get out of this pit it was hans the pilot guessed id feel safer on the russian front the lights began moving again hart following as he heard them shouting instructions to each other to belay their heavy packs finally the lamps began to wink out the germans had reached the steep tunnel at the top of the chimney that would take them to the outside and were slowly climbing into it he waited a moment until the last one disappeared and then gratefully flicked his own headlamp on momentarily half blinded one more rope to go he still had a chance the damn nazis would have to pause at the top exit to set further charges hed catch them there with his light on he could move faster hed never worked so hard in his life lungs aching muscle fiber screaming up up up the dread of being trapped in the mountain electrified him somehow he would get to greta take the food say goodbye goddamn the oath made hart jerk in alarm there was a bang and a bullet whined off the face of the shaft the pilot instinctively ducking his head then another closer this time he switched off his lamp what is it the american hes following us up the rope another shot what impossible cut the line cut the line no wait i think i can hit him another bullet slammed inches above the pilots head owen planted his boots on a ledge and hugged the cliff face trying to melt into it more shots wilder this time in the dark then a headlamp beam was dancing as it tried to find him there he is hart froze in the illumination ive got him the rope went slack no hart clutched the cliff jesussss the cry above dissolved into a scream and the headlamp beam began revolving one of the germans had cut the line while the shooter was still hanging on it the rope slithered down past hart its end slapping him in the face and the gunman hurtled by at the same time his body cleaving the air his wild screams echoing and reechoing as his light tumbled down into the pit there was a sickening thud far below and the lamp went out god in heaven what happened it was oscar he went back down the rope you fucking idiot a moment of silence then wheres hart how the hell do i know if youd just shot him at the bottom like i told you shut up im going back down to look for him no theres no rope a pause he cant follow us maybe come here the voices grew quieter were they climbing again hart was trembling afraid his fear would shiver him right off the cliff there was nothing to do for it but struggle upward he risked his light tensing for a gunshot and then when no bullet came picked out handholds hed used before amazing what the brain remembered so he climbed like a man possessed his gaze fixed on the tunnel hole at the ceiling his lamp was growing faint his muscles trembling his mind screaming at itself not to think about the hundreds of feet of yawning blackness below and then at last he was at the tunnel too jamming his exhausted arms and kicking his way upward his breath coming in gasps sweat stinging his eyes he switched off his lamp to disguise his success and crawled hard up the lava tunnel time time soon theyd be setting the last charges as he crawled upward sometimes banging painfully into unyielding rock he tried to listen for sounds of the germans ahead silence were they simply outrunning him suddenly light blazed and he was squinting into the glare of a headlamp hans was filling the tunnel ahead with his giants body his head uphill grinning at hart over the cocked readiness of his upraised knees now we fight one last time yes the german greeted then he lashed out with his boots hart reared back the leather missing his nose by the width of a sole the pilot skidded downward into safer shadows braced and yelled too slow you nazi gorilla come here hart fight like a man you coward owen reviewed his mental map of where they were switching on his lamp for an instant he spied a side tunnel he turned the light off and writhed into it you kick like a girl hans you fight like your mother cursing the german fired a pistol bullet whined off the rocks then more shots an angry fusillade more to vent anger than hit anything he heard the click of a fresh clip being slipped into the gun hart the pilot was silent hans worked down the tunnel after him owen waited hart there was silence hart where are you cautious now his gun out the german slid past the side tunnel dropping toward the junction of tube and chimney hart did i get you yellow man the pilot pushed off into the main tube and dropped toward the german hans twisted with a curse trying to bring his gun around in the restricting tube but before he could get his arm free owen struck with his own boot catching the storm trooper on the nose the man howled and slipped toward the abyss his vision blurred by his own blood the gun skittered out from under him boots hurt dont they the american growled hans had jammed himself into the tube at the lip of the chimney his legs kicking in empty air as he arrested his fall you bastard he roared im going to choke the life out of you im going to squeeze until you beg fuck you hans owen braced himself uphill from the german and pulled on a loose rock yanking it free and shoving it downward as hard as he could the exertion cost him his own grip and he slid after the small boulder as it banged down toward the storm trooper hans instinctively put out his arms to protect his face a fatal error he lost his grip on the tunnel shit there was a thud as the boulder hit a howl of outrage and a rattle of loosened rocks then hanss light disappeared he was gone hart thrust out his own arms and legs to brake himself at the edge of the chimney and skidded to a stop listening in horrified fascination to the long trailing scream then it stopped abruptly the sound dying in its own echoes two down one to go panting the pilot began climbing again yanking away the routemarking ribbons hed left on their initial descent when he neared the surface he switched off his light and crept ahead cautiously had the remaining nazi simply set the charges and fled hart almost hoped so he was too exhausted for a fight he debated sweating then he risked a shout rudolf the yell echoed through the cave hart the voice was wary owen tightened his voice as if he was in pain its hans hart hurt me but i got him help hans help me dammit i cant climb out i lost my light there was an uneasy silence then a scraping as the german began to slowly descend im coming he added a cautious warning i have a gun for gods sake dont shoot hart slipped down into a side tunnel hed explored earlier help me im bleeding try to climb up hans we have to hurry the timers are set please it hurts fuck the german scrabbled lower his light began to glow on the tube walls hart retreated into the side tunnel in here there was a splash of light bristlehead followed swearing its too tight what are you doing in here im lost hart groaned hurry then he dropped quickly and silently to the main tube and began to double back toward the surface hans where are you hans quickly now very quickly christ the markers are all gone hans silence where the hell are you time how much time realization dawned hart hart you son of a bitch bristlehead began to climb back a dead end where are the damn markers hart you sneaking bastard owen switched his lamp on to hurry bristlehead must have seen its receding glow because another shot rang out far below him its energy consumed by ricochet hart the pilot staggered into the small sandyfloored room at the cave mouth his battery was nearly exhausted its light duller than a candle in the feeble gleam and the pale light from the nearby entrance he saw explosives wired as before behind and below he could hear the german swearing furiously as he tried to find his way up the cave the pilot looked at the timers eleven minutes too long taking a breath he shoved the minute hand on the dial to one praying he hadnt disrupted its mechanism times up rudolf he whispered he hurtled forward on hands and knees toward the low slit of the cave opening clawing for its brightness his head popped out into the shock of antarctic cold and he rolled out onto the shelf and over its lip to the snow below landing with a thud and digging in with fingers and toes to arrest his slide then he pressed his face into the slush and waited the flank of the mountain heaved there was a roar and a fountain of rock debris made an arcing plume from the cave entrance the fragments sailed over the pilots head and spattered onto the cone far below harts position he could hear the grinding collapse of rock inside the mountain was it over then there was an ominous rumble outside this time he lifted his head beyond the haze of smoke and dust at the collapsed tubes mouth farther upslope a slice of snow had sheared away and was avalanching downward like an advancing wave hart staggered upward to the basalt outcrop and threw himself at its toe thundering snow blasted over his head and crashed onto the slope where hed lain moments before churning like a threshing machine eating space he pressed himself into the outcrop then the avalanche guttered out on the slopes below and the mountains quivering stopped sound growled away numb he stood up the cave was gone erased by a smear of rock he was alone and the world was still turning he looked out over the immensity of antarctica a clean sharp wind snapped at his filthy clothes the cove far below still beckoned he took a deep breath it was time to get back to greta chapter thirtyfive the u was quiet again most of its crew asleep it was dark outside and the submarine rocked slightly in a rising wind waves splashing against the side of the boat greta sat on her bunk impatient and angry owen should be back by now with the men from the cave had jurgen betrayed them she felt with her heels under her bed instead of one crammed pack there were now two filled with food shed quietly stolen from the antarctic stores as well as some rope and twine shed made a decision if god granted her wish and she saw owen again she was going to go with him shed begun seeing her situation with unusual clarity since that mornings conversation with schmidt she now knew if indeed shed ever doubted it that she lived in a dark world of betrayal if she remained in the sub sailed home with jurgen the darkness would only deepen jurgen would continue his power over her keep her around as a witness to his bizarre schemes so hopeless so crazy the unspeakable misery theyd cause contemplating her future the only light she saw was owen she was enough of a realist to realize the light would be brief that two people couldnt survive the smallboat ocean crossing he hoped to attempt but at the moment of her death there would be a certain satisfaction she would know that even if she hadnt lived her life well shed ended it well with the man she loved to hide her preparation shed been snarling at anyone who so much as bumped her cubicle curtain claiming a right of privacy as a female it had the desired effect the sailors giving her a wide berth now she could only wait where was he restless she got up to confront her husband schmidt met her in the corridor before she could reach a ladder carrying a sturdy metal tank the size of a large sausage another safe for your microbes max she asked caustically for your antibiotic actually the drug powder should fit in this gas cylinder the toughest container i could find in case were attacked again on the way home ah well in that case the lab cultures you made from the spores need to be boxed or destroyed too we cant risk them breaking yes but im experimenting with growth variables one colony is really exploding i should be able to use these findings to accelerate production when we reach germany i want to give them as much time as i can dont worry ill see to the cultures before departure she looked at him doubtfully youve already hidden your spores from me dont take foolish risks with the ones youve hatched and grown no risk frau drexler we doctors respect disease she bit her lip at that and gestured down the corridor is jurgen in his quarters no on deck preparing to go ashore the last soldiers havent returned from the cave hes leading a search party she started looking dismayed did something go wrong who knows schmidt smiled at her weakness for the pilot thats what hes checking greta put on her parka and climbed to the deck it was very dark and the strength of the wind caught her by surprise she had so little sense of the elements inside the submarine the sky was like a tattered sail streamers of cloud blowing past the stars a storm was building and the realization dismayed her would nothing favor them the motor launch was alongside bumping against the hull as jurgens search party of storm troopers boarded by the illumination of flashlights she walked along the wet deck whipped by spray going for more microbe spores he jumped at her bitter voice what are you doing up here what are you doing hunting for fresh diseases like the good doctor he squinted at her sourly irritated at her complaint of betrayal safeguarding our mission you lied to me again he shrugged does it matter anymore the indifference hurt no not anymore she looked at the boatload of men so where are you going he considered his reply if you must know im looking for your damned pilot why isnt he back yet drexler looked out at the walls of the crater thats what were going to find out hans and rudolf and oscar havent returned either its a dreadful night and i dont want them getting lost in a storm you wont leave without him this time he looked at her resentfully not if hes alive what does that mean nothing for gods sake can you stop mooning for one moment over owen hart go below and get some sleep you need it she stood frustrated part of her wanted him to assure her to promise owens safety but what were jurgens promises worth anymore nothing this time shed have to trust in god saying a prayer to herself she turned and went below hart watched the lights of the launch pull away from the submarine with quiet satisfaction finally he felt savagely energized despite his cold and hunger he was alive and his tormentors some of them at least vanquished he felt a powerful freedom he hadnt enjoyed since his capture in berlin after the explosion hed slid down to the snug little cove visible from the lava outcrop and checked again on his discovery from six years before satisfying himself that his desperate plan was not entirely impossible then hed wearily climbed back to the volcano rim and sat catching his breath and looking down at the submarine in the caldera like a raptor eyeing prey when dusk fell hed descended into the crater and sheltered at the mouth of the lava tube he and fritz had found so long before enough of an overhang remained after the cavein to shield him from the wind for hours the uboat remained stubbornly impregnable anchored in its cold lagoon with the motor launch tied alongside yet he knew that the disappearance of the ss men would sooner or later raise questions now the nazis were coming to answer them giving him a chance to get to greta the last stars were gone and a few snowflakes were beginning to fall perfect the storm would obscure his tracks confident that the dark hid him from view he left the cave and loped down the slope to the crater beach then hiked along the shoreline toward the point the running lights appeared aimed at the grumble of the launch engine faded and the lights went out suggesting the boat had reached shore after a few minutes new lights switched on and he watched them swing as the storm troopers began moving up the crater slope lanterns for the search then there was a bang and a red star went wavering up into the night flare hart fell flat the illumination was poor in the growing snow and he knew the light was more to attract the lost ss men than to actually spot them still it revealed to him that one man had stayed with the boat a sentry when the wavering red glow flickered out the pilot sat up removed a boot and methodically filled one sock with beach gravel the thought of what he was about to do didnt give him pause at all then he put his boot back on and walked ahead he dropped as a second flare arched skyward tenminute intervals he guessed when the night darkened again he hurried forward then sank to a crouch and crept the last several yards the sentry was hunched over with his back to the wind a glow showing that he was drawing on a cigarette harts feet crunched on gravel the sentry turned fumbling with a submachine gun caught under his parka whos there oscar hart replied thank god we feared youd the pilot swung and the sock exploded on the storm troopers temple gravel spraying the man sprawled and hart was on top of him in an instant hed salvaged a sharp steel climbing piton from the cave hard enough to be hammered into cracks of rock now he felt under the dazed mans parka hood with it thrust and cut the squirt of blood splattered owen despite his instinctive lurch back grimly he let the sentrys head flop down there was another bang and a lurid glow of red hart stood quickly to become the sentry to anyone watching from the submarine or above the snow was thickening as the flare died he watched the chain of bobbing lights climb up and over the crater rim no alarm had been raised owen could still hear the sentrys dying gurgle he felt nothing except relief that was four of the bastards he yanked the submachine gun out from under the dead man wiped it on the soldiers parka and threw it into the boat pockets yielded a flashlight dagger an extra clip and some papers hart took an envelope emptied it crouched and slipped a pebble inside then he dragged the dead nazi into the cold water looping a mooring line around his torso the pilot shoved the boat off the beach jumped aboard and pressed the button to start the engine remembering the procedure the germans had used backing out he turned and headed toward the uboat at the halfway point he slowed and cut the mooring line the towed body sank from sight when he banged inexpertly against the submarine a sailor on watch caught the boat where are the others the seaman asked still searching hart prayed the man wouldnt recognize his voice the colonel sent a message for the woman he handed over the envelope shes assembling additional supplies shes to come up and confer with me hart dared not venture into the submarine with his recognizable face and his parka spattered with blood the man hesitated ill stand watch hurry dammit its fucking cold the sailor disappeared down the hatch hart hauled the submachine gun onto his lap and studied it hed never fired one before he found the apparent safety but dared not squeeze the trigger to confirm his discovery simply setting it aside where it would be ready then he bent to the emergency sailing rigging stored in the bottom of the launch and began taking it apart fumbling in the snow and cold the sail and its lines he set aside he looked restlessly about hoping to see greta dreading their imminent goodbye the necessity for her to ride home with the germans her only realistic chance twisted his stomach he wanted her needed her yet it was madness to go with him the hatch banged open and a pack emerged falling over on the deck then a second the sailor came out and then bent to offer his hand to greta and there she was a slim silhouette dragging the packs down the ashand snowcrusted deck and heaving them into the motor launch hart started the engine not knowing what to expect she jumped aboard thank god youre here should i report anything to the captain the sailor asked from the deck only that you should have been quicker hart growled get back on watch he hoped hed mustered the right tone of ss arrogance the sailor hesitated a moment resentful then spat into the water and backed to the conning tower did something happen in the cave greta whispered when that sailor told me the motor launch had returned i feared it was jurgen to tell me of your death and then when i opened that envelope i almost screamed for joy hart smiled the pebble had scored again the soldiers tried to leave me in the lake and wired the cave with explosives i got out just before the detonation they didnt so jurgen lied about letting you go she stiffened with resolve owen ive decided to come with you we can just take this boat and flee jurgens on shore well maroon him there touched the pilot shook his head greta you cant im going to try to cross the stormiest ocean in the world its impossible even more impossible to try alone no its foolish for us both to die besides theyd raise the alarm too soon if we took this launch im going over the volcano as we planned and you stay on the submarine she shook her head owen i cant watch you leave me again i wont whatever our fate is please lets face it together no he didnt want to kill her and had to dissuade her if you flee theyll come after us its a big ocean owen and if jurgen thinks im sulking and huddled in my cabin theres a possibility i wont be missed for hours he looked at gretas face the certainty of staying together even if it risked death trumped the possibility of permanent separation she wasnt going to take no for an answer all right he said finally swallowing his eyes were moist its crazy but all right if we die ill still have you she nodded we still have to leave this boat on the beach so they wont hunt for it with the submarine he pointed out we still have to hike to the cove i understand so hurry lets wait she sat straighter wait wait you told me the cave was blown up what happened to the last batch of lake organism sealed with the nazis i suppose my god she seized his parka we can stop them what dont you see the only lake organism left is on the submarine and schmidt hasnt locked that away yet hes still expecting more from underground when jurgen returns if we destroy it they cant reproduce any in germany theyll have the disease but no cure and unless theyre totally insane they wont dare unleash it we can beat them owen if we hurry go back inside theyll recognize me greta theyll ask too many questions i know ill do it its late people are asleep ill hurry what if someone notices what youre doing ill do it quickly quietly no its too risky trust me owen and then before he could grab her she was springing back on deck and trotting to the hatch she yanked it open and disappeared inside the sailor came clambering down from the conning tower the pilots hand drifted to the submachine gun and he waited tensely i thought she was going with you the question was troubled suspicious the sailors features invisible in the dark hart shrugged she is but she forgot something he spat you know women chapter thirtysix greta climbed down to the main deck and listened the submarine hummed with the ceaseless oilscented drone of a warship but was otherwise still the desultory sailor on watch in the control room barely nodded as she slipped down the midships ladder to her laboratory her pulse hammering she opened the hatch cautiously empty she closed it after her despite her abortive efforts at straightening the lab clutter remained schmidts tank of drug was in plain view on a crate used as a makeshift table the drug storage tubes hed emptied into it scattered around remaining canisters of the organic sludge sat on the deck along one bulkhead the workbench with its bacterial cultures of disease was on the other beakers and flasks and pots remained crusted with paste the surviving rabbits skittered in their cages at her entrance no doubt afraid of another needle shed thought she was done with this claustrophobic warren and yet here she was again she moved decisively a sampling of the drug sludge went into a bottle slipped into her pocket then she lifted the heavy canister it came from and began pouring the remainder into their drain pipe the unprocessed organism would go into the uboats waste system and overboard it glugged with glacial slowness but at last emptied she let the canister drop to the deck and picked up another she was sweating in her heavy outdoor gear there was a click and a bump as the hatch opened again she started but kept pouring probably jacob the animal tender and she could outbluff any sailor it would be enough to point to the disease get out go away its dangerous down here boots thumped onto the deck she prepared to turn suddenly in irritation what do you think youre doing she jumped it was schmidt she looked at him in guilty surprise as he watched her pour he seemed confused and haggard max i thought you were asleep having coffee his expression began to narrow sleep has tended to elude me of late and a chance mention by the watch of your being down here got me curious his look became grim i shudder to think what might have happened had i not decided to investigate put that damn container down now reluctantly she did so i only only what only wanted to destroy everything we worked for back away from that drain pipe frau biologist thank god more is coming from the cave he paused considering her clothes her midnight appearance or is it are you finally ahead of us greta do you finally know something i dont that would be difficult max given that you know everything her expression was one of intense hatred also of triumph bitch his hand cracked across her face and she went flying against the remaining algal containers knocking several over the cap snapped off one and its contents began sloshing across the metal deck grating draining into the bilge she shook her head dumbly the blow was so hard she was dazed her vision blurred violence seems to be your forte max she said glancing sideways at the stillfull algal containers suddenly she turned and grabbed for the bottles getting a cap off one before schmidt was on top of her get your hands off that he seized her by the hair and hauled her backward trying to strike her with the other fist his clumsy blows were blocked by the arm she lifted to ward off his attack he was taller but old and not particularly strong she twisted and kicked making him wince then they grappled greta punching and biting and scratching for her life he managed to get behind her with an arm around her windpipe and began choking they stumbled locked in a pained dance her voice cut off and schmidt wheezing as he desperately tried to master a woman thirty years younger than himself she realized she was beginning to black out and groped wildly with a free hand looking for a weapon her fingers skittered on a glass cylinder rejected it then seized it again yes one of his damned hypodermics she stabbed the needle went into schmidts shoulder near his neck and the doctor squealed letting go to claw at the agonizing sting as he did so she shoved as hard as she could he lurched sideways and there was a splintering crash the crude workbench broke from its supports and the beakers flasks and glass petri dishes with their agar films of plague culture shattered bits skittering across the laboratory like a reproducing fungus a puff of spores from a broken test tube blossomed into the air schmidt ensnared in the wreckage looked goggleeyed in horror the hypodermic needle jutted from his shoulder as if sucking at the droplet of bright blood that appeared there bits of glass and microbial culture littered his skin he lifted himself on his elbows youve infected me he gasped in disbelief reaching he jerked the hypodermic out of his shoulder groaning he was so weak to bring you she brought the cylinder of algal drug powder down on the doctors head there was a solid thud and he fell back unconscious shut up you old ghoul the words were a croak from her sore throat she listened but all she heard was the hum of the ship schmidt would have closed the hatch when he came down so think consider the variables she took a shuddering breath god what a mess numbly almost automatically she tipped the remaining containers of the cave organism toward the oily bilge it was the best she could do with her shaking tremble schmidt remained still she had no idea if he was alive or dead and was too frightened to inspect him too much in shock to care think she hefted the cylinder of the drug the germs were loose thrown everywhere by the fight she probably carried some on her clothes she needed to treat herself and owen and the hum of the ship my god she looked at the ventilator opening exchanging air sucking in spores but if she took the remaining drug with her if she took it and the submarine turned into a bergen all these men would die the realization made her ashen and if she left it if they lived they could still return to germany with the disease and enough of the cure organism to begin culture and reproduction if they lived they could still hunt owen and herself down schmidt groaned stirring unless she wanted to kill him right now she didnt have much time what would her nuns say what would owen say schmidt moaned again damn him she brought the cylinder down on his head and he slumped a second time lying still she taped his mouth hands and ankles why hadnt he stayed away then grimly tucking the drug tank under one arm she climbed out of the uboat and hurried back to the motor launch jumping aboard its done she whispered owen said shed done the right thing the only thing theyre murderers greta they tried to kill me the couple were driving hard for the beach fearful that schmidt might somehow stagger out of the laboratory and sound the alarm every yard of cold water gave them an added feeling of safety it was the ss that tried to kill you owen not the sailors she shivered her eyes moist nonsense those bastards gave the nazi salute when jurgen laid out his plans theyre part of it she leaned on him i know i know but to condemn sixty men fellow germans to they condemned themselves do you think that will keep them from my dreams dreams what about our waking nightmare god willing youve saved millions of people millions the only person you havent saved yet is yourself a white shelf appeared out of the dark the beach they crunched against it and hart cut the motor from here we walk hed thought about their situation while waiting by the sub for greta to return if we take the launch theyll hunt us by sea but if we leave it theyll comb the island first that should buy some time her face drained if we leave it jurgen will reach the submarine owen nodded looking at her hard i want him to greta she said nothing i want him to catch the plague she looked out at the night in horror listen greta i cant make this choice for you i cant and expect you not to doubt me the rest of our days so you can take the cylinder back right now save those men and sail for germany youll be a savior to those sailors and far more likely to survive than if you come with me you can be loyal to the reich you can save your husband or you can throw it all away every bit of it and come with me on this one wild crazy scheme to get away from this island a chance that will probably kill us both she actually smiled at that youre so persuasive so why would i ever come with you because i love you she nodded you make a good argument she said finally its exactly the one i would make for an instant she looked up at the stars seeming to search for something then she said i go with you he smiled then lets hurry before dawn comes well share the antibiotic when we get out of sight of the sub drexler led his men down off the crater rim at dawn cold and exhausted the storm was blowing itself out but it had been an abominable night of grim slogging and futile shouts and fired flares the three ss men had simply disappeared what a foul island jurgen was frustrated the mouth of the cave had been blown up as hed ordered had the idiots somehow killed themselves there was no sign or gotten lost in the storm again no sign something tickled in the back of his mind some part of their search that remained uncompleted yet he couldnt think what it was now everyone was half frozen and uneasy they needed some food and warmth and rest in the submarine the launch was where theyd left it grounded on the beach but the sentry was missing jurgen scowled in disgust wheres johann the ss sergeant frowned he was supposed to stay with the boat he should be right here i know he should be right here where is he perhaps he went back to the uboat in the storm how could he get back to the uboat without this launch idiot the sergeant stiffened yes sir drexler fumed the elimination of hart hadnt left him feeling triumphant this time he dreaded having to face greta and tell her the american was missing again lost in the cave or the storm he doubted shed believe him it would be a relief to finally be done with her he told himself yes a relief this damn island is swallowing my men i dont like it i want to get out of here he looked at the others there was no disagreement well into the launch they motored to the uboat have you seen johann prien drexler called to the sailors as they climbed wearily aboard came alongside last night one replied tiredly as you requested drexler frowned what to get the woman the packs greta my wife yes he said you sent a message and then she went with him he peered curiously at the group noticing the missing ss men were not there i sent no message the man looked surprised and a glimmer of dread began to shine on drexlers brain you actually saw johann yes of course in the boat i mean you saw his face you recognized him the sailor began to comprehend no it was dark no one could recognize anyone last night drexlers men were already dropping down the hatch into the submarine the colonels disquiet was growing could this man have been the american i thought the american was with you jesus christ and greta went with this man yes the sailor looked at drexler with a cringe of sympathy fuck it was a snarl fuck wheres dr schmidt below i suppose i havent seen him drexler dropped down to the main deck and yanked off his parka stomping aft in his boots max he roared he found freiwald wheres our damn doctor the captain looked at drexler with dislike i dont keep track of your party colonel how would i know try your laboratory drexler peered down the hatch was closed but that was normal he climbed down and opened it max no answer there were shards of glass on the deck the chamber stank he dropped into it with a premonition of dread great god it looked like a bomb had hit the planks of the workbench had splintered and the deck was littered with shards of petri dishes and their microbial goo there was a stench reminiscent of the underground lake all the containers so laboriously carried from the cave were empty schmidt lay writhing trussed in tape his head was bloody the uboat captain descended the ladder after drexler and then stopped in fearful shock get out of here the ss colonel ordered close the hatch jurgen began cutting schmidt free as the tape was yanked painfully off his mouth the doctor howled he gasped for breath was it hart max did that pilot do this schmidt spat clutching his head frau greta drexlerschmidt pronounced the name with acid did this she caught me by surprise and shoved me into the lab bench she contaminated the ship now drexler was ashen remembering the horror of the bergen shes a serpent he muttered i married a medusa is she insane she is when the american is around i thought he was supposed to be dead jurgen ignored this do we still have the weapon do we still have the cure schmidt sat up holding his head and looked around with a wince i secreted the spores away because i remembered her emotional fit the last time but not the drug it looks like she dumped what we had and took the concentrate with her did you bring more from the cave drexler felt a tiresome buzzing in his head as he contemplated the wreckage of all his plans all his hopes no my men never emerged well we can get more yes no max the cave is demolished my men may never have gotten out but you just said hart was out thats my suspicion he said it in a small voice greta would never do this alone he looked at the splinters of petri dish this means were dead men max unless we catch her if she has the drug shes our only hope he swallowed and glanced at the ladder i closed the hatch maybe it wont spread you must be joking schmidt pointed at the vents were talking about escaping germs not escaping rabbits its been sucked all over the ship by now everyone is infected it will be like the bergen why on earth did you trust her drexler looked hollow i didnt trust her i thought i could control her then he glared at schmidt thought you could control her my god trussed up by a woman by a sneaking conniving drexler held up his hand suddenly weary all right enough enough recrimination how much time do we have before the symptoms appear schmidt shook his head hours maybe a day and where did she go where on the island did they hide another cave good point said schmidt they cant have gone far on an island maybe we can find them and get the drug back he thought a moment and they cant operate a submarine not alone they cant leave antarctica without us if we die they die no i dont think they plan to die theyre too infatuated with each other for selfsacrifice then they have an alternate plan schmidt reasoned a radio a rescue an airplane mention of the plane jogged drexlers memory the lonely dornier hed spied on the snowy plateau the last trip the seaplane that had allowed the americans escape so there had to be a vehicle this time as well yes but where ah of course now he remembered now he realized what theyd missed on last nights search the couples furtive discussion at the cave mouth the tiny bay theyd surveyed together that was their escape hatch there was something there something to get them out that was where theyd run he hauled up schmidt i know where theyre going i think a bay on the other side of the volcano below the new cave we can intercept them there not over the rim that takes too long around by sea if we do that we live schmidt looked at the ss colonel with hope they banged open the hatch and climbed out freiwald the captain was in the control room looking worried arent you letting out the its already out drexler said brusquely its all over the ship youre breathing it now the submariner looked aghast never mind that how soon can we get underway our plan was not to go for a day or two our plans have obviously changed the captain frowned i had the engineers strip the diesels were doing some routine maintenance it will take several hours to put them back together what we cant sail before noon schmidt looked dumbly at his watch good god we cant wait that long jurgen said ill take the motor launch and my men to catch them you follow in the submarine captain if you dont get this boat moving soon all of you are going to die do you understand owen hart and my wife have escaped with the antibiotic and theyre our only hope freiwald nodded fearfully and opened his mouth to say something instead he sneezed god bless you said schmidt chapter thirtyseven the slender reed that supported the couples hope of escape looked to gretas weary mind like a cradle in the snow a refuge into which she wanted to curl and sleep until they were far far away it wouldnt be that easy of course the lifeboats very presence was a grim reminder of how difficult it might prove to get away from the antarctic island the two surviving norwegians from the bergen had tried and failed when hart first crawled out of the cave six years ago it was utter exhaustion that had allowed him to spot the craft hed collapsed on the lava ledge too tired to even lift his head and as his eyes adjusted to the stark polar light he found them idly tracing the fractal geometry of the shoreline far below it was the leafshaped regularity of the abandoned boats gunwale that caught his eye hed risked the time for inspection and found that the artifact was the norwegian lifeboat perfectly preserved by the antarctic dry freeze the memory had stuck in his mind ever since the overturned craft now remained impervious to time its wood was bleached gray but it seemed as sound as when it had first left the bergen the crafts fittings were only lightly rusted a few cans of food a blanket and a seamans wool watch cap were frozen onto its bottom floorboards in defiance of gravity even the lines were still there stiff with cold but little decayed the mast had been unstepped and hastily lashed to the thwarts and its fringe of tattered canvas told what must have happened the norwegians sail had blown out in a storm and theyd been driven back to the island either a wave had tossed the boat high on shore or the whalers themselves had dragged the boat away from the reach of the sea then the men had disappeared the pilot supposed they were somewhere nearby entombed in snow its not the best of boats to change our luck in he admitted to greta i think its beautiful because its ours she replied the first part of our new life they used ice axes to chop the boat free from its frozen fusion and then rolled it onto its keel hart stepped the mast fastened the boom and tied on the sail hed liberated from the motor launch using as rigging both the lines in the boat and additional ones greta had stuffed in their packs the fit was inexact but would serve then they put their shoulders to the stern and pushed heave hart shouted heave with all your might she leaned and let out a valkyrie cry the lifeboat broke free and tobogganed into the water owen snaring the stern line to keep it from drifting away she glanced back up the volcanic slope above the cove no sign of jurgen they havent found us yet we might just make it if we hurry were a long ways from the open sea and well have to row quite a distance to weave out of this pack ice do you still have strength for rowing ill row to new york to get away from here the floating pack ice was a problem for the german launch as well after motoring out of the caldera entrance drexler and his ss detachment of five surviving men had to swing wide around the flank of the island to avoid its encircling rind being outside the protective crater and on the open sea made drexler nervous he really didnt like antarcticas expansive emptiness he admitted to himself the excitement hed felt about the continent when the schwabenland had first cast off from germany had long since disappeared what made it such a dreadful place he thought was that it was beyond human control not a house nor a light nor a refuge nor a path to his mind there was nothing liberating about such wilderness he felt like he had to squeeze himself to prevent being pulled apart by antarcticas vacuum pieces of him sailing off in all directions like an explosion in space accordingly hed been looking forward to the cubbyhole embrace of the steel submarine on the long voyage home his victory ensured in ranks of neatly labeled bottles of a revolutionary biology now he was driving through water so cold it was like dark syrup a sea so chill that the snow which fell on it didnt melt but instead undulated on its top like gray skin a monstrous place he was struggling to fight off gloom the antibiotic was gone the cave destroyed and the uboat contaminated the other volcano was smoking more than ever and a fullscale eruption might make a return impossible which meant his dreams had been utterly imperiled by the woman hed loved almost destroyed lord how he hated her there was a rattle and he looked down to see bits of ice rasp along the side of the launch he shivered he still couldnt swim and he wondered how deep the ocean was here it seemed bottomless seals one of the storm troopers pointed there was a group of them on an ice floe as indolent as ever drexler remembered that greta had claimed some of them were fierce predators huge and swift the thought was absurd the sluggish beasts barely moved except to yawn and defecate they stank and whelped and did nothing more worst of all they were indifferent to the germans caring nothing for what they were up against it was a kind of arrogance that annoyed him it was like the indifference of god give me your gun my gun give it to me the lazy animals had no fear of man that must change he pulled back the lever on the submachine gun to arm it and fired a burst the rattle surprisingly clamorous in the hushed whiteness one of the seals recoiled barking in surprise and pain and suddenly the snow was bright with blood in a flash the animals slithered off the ice and into the water damned slugs drexler threw the gun back at the soldier the storm troopers looked at one another uneasily bad luck what was that gretas head had come up hart looked around uneasily maybe just a glacier calving or a breakup of ice he frowned it had sounded like a burst of gunshots theyd been rowing slowly and carefully picking their way through the ice toward the open sea now the pilot clambered forward to where the mast was stepped pulling himself up its short length and clinging with his legs careful greta warned the boat rocked dangerously hart squinted across the ice he didnt see the german boat so much as spy movement motion in a place that otherwise was calm and still he slid down heartsick its them in the motor launch somehow they saw us or realized what were doing theyre trying to cut us off by sea how did they figure it out she looked pained then determined jurgen always figures it out but im not going back with them were not to that point yet im going to raise the sail maybe we can outrun them in this ice there was just breeze enough to fill the canvas he hoisted the sail and it caught the lifeboat heeling slightly theyd lashed the rudder amidships and now he untied it and began to steer meanwhile grasping the boom line stay on the upward side of the boat to help balance she nodded ive sailed i can help tack when you give the word they began coasting dark water gurgling up from the stern how many thousands of miles to go hart looked in the direction of the germans and greta youd better unlash the submachine gun she nodded they may be surprised that we have it colonel a sail the ss men were pointing and drexler lifted his binoculars it was them trying to ghost away as if they were making a pleasure sail on the havel outside berlin he could imagine them laughing together thinking theyd infected all the tiresome germans and joking about the fool theyd made of the cuckold jurgen drexler except that jurgen drexler wasnt ill not yet and even if he already was even if he felt perhaps the murmur of fever in his brain it was still just a whisper he had plenty of time to catch them and punish them and swallow the cure full power full speed the engine roared as the helmsman gunned it watch for ice but go go go the added breeze from their acceleration was colder while the helmsman steered the other ss men checked their weapons and then crouched low behind the gunwales for shelter a peeking pride of lions speed dammit a small floe banged against the hull and drexler was forcibly reminded of the schwabenlands mishap but be careful he spotted a wide patch of open water to port and pointed go there they were faster than the sailboat and could afford to loop around the unpowered craft blocking the fugitives from the ocean with that pathetic mast sticking upward like a pointing flag the adulterous lovers couldnt hope to hide he had them oh he had them the germans charged across the open water spray arcing off their prow a tendril of greasy engine smoke drifting behind each swell that lifted gave a better view of the fleeing sail tacking first this way and then that predator and prey strong and weak the way of the world now the storm troopers were between the lifeboat and the open sea owen and greta were caught against the island now that way into that lead there well pin them the motor launch wake churned the flat water of the ice lead its wake heaving the floes up and down the sail was getting tantalizingly close flapping aimlessly now as the couple hunted for fickle wind he could imagine their panic he could feel their dread it was sweet revenge imagining what they must feel like as the soldiers inexorably gained on them would she weep at the end if she did it would no longer move him he was sure of it they churned through a tiny connecting channel and then they were in the same polynya of open water as the sailboat where had they gotten the craft drexler suddenly looked around as if the american might have allies ready to attempt a rescue but no the horizons were empty still it was as if hart was some kind of magician able to conjure improbable escapes and sudden resources at the last moment it baffled him the pilot had been a plague since that first night at karinhall well the showdown had finally come no more tricks the sail abruptly dropped and the pair unshipped their oars they were going to try to reach the edge of the ice and escape on foot drexler calculated the nazis would catch them a few feet short of their goal faster suddenly there was a burp of gunfire in drexlers ear spouts of seawater flew up near the fleeing lifeboat one of the ss men had opened fire drexler cuffed him not yet you fool not until weve recovered the drug morons was he the only person on this voyage capable of thought then hart bent sat up and there was a flicker of muzzle flash in return hes got a gun the helmsman cried as water and wood splinters filled the air and one of the ss men cried out the motor launch veered abruptly away lurching toward the ice on the opposite side of the watery channel they hit with a glancing blow and drexler and the other men landed in a tangle on the bottom get off me dammit he struggled upward the pair were rowing again taking advantage of the nazi confusion the couple hit the other side of the ice and scrambled out dragging their packs behind them damn make for them but hart had already staked their boat to a line and the two were jogging away like a pair of taunting foxes fuck now well have to catch them on foot there was a groan and drexler looked down in irritation it was walther one of his ss men he was hit in the stomach and spewing blood all over the damn boat well hed be envied if they didnt recover the drug and if they did it would be too late to save him anyway the groaning would stop soon enough were leaking one of the men cried watching water stream into the motor launch from a bullet hole no matter drexler said well have their boat chapter thirtyeight it occurred to greta that perhaps she was trapped in a dream the chase had the hallucinatory slowmotion quality of an unending nightmare the world was a monochrome of black and white the ice under her feet cracked and sighed as they painfully trotted across its powdery coverlet of snow her head was dizzy from the constant gasping of brittle air for mere minutes it seemed theyd been free then jurgen had materialized again as if he read every thought in her head knew every plan she laid she longed to wake up to have it be over with the germans were following them like a pack of wolves five in all owen said he thought hed counted six at first so perhaps hed hit one not that it mattered how could they fight so many owen i cant go on much longer she was panting her pack as heavy as the cross theyd be run down in minutes he nodded me neither we have to leave the packs and lose the soldiers then circle back maybe i can slow them down first they stopped at a fissure where the pressure of the shifting ice had heaved several blocks into the air the barrier briefly shielded them from view well put the packs here hart said take the cylinder with the antidote and go ahead aiming for that trapped iceberg im going to give them something to think about he threw down his pack and untangled the machine gun are you all right she nodded tense try not to be late there was an eruption of shots behind greta and she could hear shouts and screams from the pursuing germans the soldiers let loose with a fusillade of their own the bullets kicking up a small blizzard at the top of the ice blocks then owen was away and running low after her faster now without his pack and gun i got one of the bastards and the others went flat he reported the gun is empty and so is my stock of ideas we still have a chance she said hopefully they should have the disease if we can just keep away long enough it should begin to slow them down i hope that bacteria hurries they look pretty damn healthy to me the iceberg was a gnarled hill of ice that had drifted in the sea until ensnared in the flat pack ice the vise that held it was made of two large islands of ice separated by a dark lead of water that stretched hundreds of yards in either direction the iceberg was the only bridge across this channel hart hesitated glancing back the germans had paused to fall on the couples packs like ravenous dogs looking for the drug not finding it they were loping after them again more warily their guns ready they didnt know hart had hidden his empty submachine gun in the snow owen come on why are we stopping he glanced ahead icebergs can sometimes be unstable they slowly melt and as they change shape their center of gravity shifts and they roll sometimes the weight of a person or a seal or even a penguin can make the final difference if we climb onto it and go into the water were dead she looked impatient if we wait here were dead i know i know you go first then to minimize the weight i think if i stand here theyll hesitate in case i have a gun then ill follow now it was she who hesitated go quickly greta leaped a thin crevice of seawater and began scrambling across the iceberg trying to ignore its ominous rock as owen had expected the pursuing germans slowed cautiously when they saw him standing there one fired a tentative burst but the distance was still too great the bullets went wide hart looked the other way greta had disappeared over the crest of the berg he leaped and the iceberg heaved unsteadily beneath him hart followed in gretas tracks praying their bridge would stay stable more bullets whipped around him as he scrambled over the crest then he was sliding down the other side toward a gap of dark water and jumped again the flatter ice cracked as he landed on it but didnt give way greta seized his hand hurry on they went the world a white miasma they had no sense of direction except to get away hart oweeennnn hart they looked back it was drexler standing on the crest of the iceberg and hoisting a machine gun your lives in return for the drug hart it isnt too late to make a bargain they stopped to confer if we agree said greta they might survive to take the microbe back to germany and kill us anyway hart raised his arm drexler lifted his binoculars focusing a middle finger came into view bastard the nazi charged down the iceberg after them then his men swarming over the crest just behind the germans came down in a tight group neared the edge the iceberg rolled the movement was as spectacular as it was sudden the hill of ice upended like a sinking ship the end nearest owen and greta dipping into the water the storm troopers screamed as they tumbled desperately trying to claw away from the gulping water drexler leaped his legs churning his arms outspread he landed flat on the stable pack ice the air going out of him with a whoosh the iceberg continued to roll behind him and the three remaining storm troopers slid into the sea thousands of tons of ice flipping to drive them deep their scream was chopped off as abruptly as the fall of an ax jesus hart whispered id heard of it but never seen it the overturned iceberg was pitching uneasily now seeking a new equilibrium seawater poured off its flanks in a hundred small waterfalls drexler slowly got to his hands and knees then one of his soldiers surfaced like a cork thrashing save me the sound exploded from his lungs but was thin and frail across the broad expanse of sea ice jurgen looked dully back over his shoulder the mans hand was clutching at the air he has no chance hart said the waters too cold the soldier had flailed his way to the edge of the pack ice and frantically hauled himself up on it flopping like a fish he was pleading saying something to drexler that they couldnt hear the nazi didnt respond at first but as the soldier began to crawl pitifully toward jurgen the ss colonel finally got to his feet the soldier was slowing a rime of ice was forming on his clothes drexler regarded the man solemnly and then walked over to point his submachine gun the storm trooper lifted his head there was a short burst and the soaked soldier jerked and lay still then the ss colonel looked at the two fugitives a hundred yards away across the ice grimly he began trotting after them again the uboat sounded like a tuberculosis ward men were hacking and sneezing sweat beginning to dot their flushed faces schmidt felt ill as well but for his own protection from angry sailors he stayed near freiwald in the control room clutching the periscope at least the submarine was beginning to move again theyd find drexlers motor launch learn where hart had gone hunt down the antibiotic he looked around the enclosing chamber bleakly time time he noticed a calendar near the helm almost christmas rocket assembly should have begun by now laboratory space was being readied in the mines of the ruhr warheads were being testfired with anthrax they were so close so close how he longed to squeeze the life out of that traitorous bitch how late in the disease can we take the antidote and live doctor freiwald asked he shrugged who knows youd better damn well know schmidt sighed the rabbits lived a seaman on the first voyage drank some after infection and lived hart damn his soul lived so we have to hope the captain looked bleak myself i dont care about but my men if they start to die doctor theyll blame you for bringing the spores aboard you know that schmidt nodded no matter im older less resistant and i was infected first he smiled broadly lips drawn back from yellow teeth ill beat them all to hell oh my god owen only open water they stopped panting theyd run and run and run always the remorseless dark figure of jurgen drexler tagging behind as tireless as a shadow theyd run until their clothes were soaked with sweat in the bitter cold run until their lungs were on fire and their sides ached now they could run no more the ice pack had ended in a wide lead of water as dark and shiny as tar there was no way around they were pinned between jurgen drexler and the sea the couple looked back their pursuer had slowed to a weary walk himself now his submachine gun leveled lest they try to dash along the edge of the ice he had to be as exhausted as they were he had to be feeling the plague but theyd run out of time to wait for his collapse hart glanced around the world was a gauzy gray chill and bleak the ice was an inhospitable plain its only mark the trail of their footprints the volcano behind was smoking more furiously and for the first time they could hear its low rumble had they succeeded they would have gotten away from the damnable island just in time he thought hell was breathing fire and ice im sorry greta i dont have a weapon i dont even have any strength he looked at her fondly sadly at least i knew her he thought and because of that ive had a good life its all right owen she replied as if reading his thoughts she held his hand jurgen stopped twenty feet short pinning them on a small peninsula of ice his breath steamed his parka covered with frost he looked ill so we come together for the final time give it up jurgen hart tiredly tried your men are dead the submarine is contaminated its over no hart he coughed what you dont understand what youve never understood is that it isnt over until i say so do you really think im going to let you destroy my work and sail off with my wife i dont know which to be more impressed by your irredeemable stupidity or your irrepressible persistence a lesser man would have surrendered by now you know perhaps youre not such a coward after all excuse me if i dont give a damn drexler nodded no at times like this other things seem more important yes im sick youre helpless we all think of what might have been jurgen please greta pleaded we can still choose life life he looked at her in amazement life my command butchered my crew poisoned life in this wasteland look around you greta do you see anything alive anywhere in this kingdom of the dead he coughed again then swung the machine gun at owens chest so ill give you a final choice hart you can be shot down or drown go to hell greta glanced away as drexler spoke studying the opening of dark water something had moved to catch her eye producing a dark eddy then it sank soundlessly she slid her hand inside her parka and pulled out the steel tank jurgen wait if you kill owen ill throw the drug into the sea youll die of plague a horrible death he was still breathing hard then give it here you can have it for the gun then well all live he licked his lips no give it here or ill simply shoot you and take it do you promise not to kill us i promise to kill you if you dont hand that over she glanced at owen he shook his head she cocked her arm no said drexler dont throw it she threw god damn you the cylinder landed in the snow at the edge of the water almost going in neither man was certain if shed been aiming for the water or drexler im sorry i was never good at throwing pathetic bitch keeping the machine gun aimed he sidled to pick it up my life was ruined from the moment i met you do you realize that you never understood anything not me not germany not science he bent the water exploded hart jumped back as if hed been shot there was an astonishing blur and the momentary flicker of a yawning pink mouth with white teeth then with a scream and a titanic splash jurgen drexler was gone christ the pilot cried leopard seal said greta grimly it thought he was a penguin the cold was like fire the shock so powerful that drexler didnt even notice the animals teeth had punctured his thigh the gun and the tank of drug slipped away then dismayed by the strange mouthful of cloth and flesh it had seized the seal let go the nazi couldnt swim but the shock drove instinct he thrashed toward the surface in a cloud of blood erupting with a shriek save me hart considered only for a moment then he sprang forward and grabbed owen no the pilot ignored her he heaved and drexler slithered up on the ice gasping why did you do that because he has something that belongs to us ice was forming on drexlers clothes his body was shaking uncontrollably his strength and coordination ebbing his brain shutting down please ill never understand you jurgen hart said squatting you had heaven you had greta and you chose hell he yanked open the germans parka and began feeling his pockets where is it dammit please owen the cylinder went in the water with him its gone she looked at the smoking volcano gods will perhaps thats not what im looking for he hoisted drexler up off the snow and ripped open the flap of his chest pocket here then he dropped the german and backed away drexlers lips were blue his mouth still open his eyes had lost focus the pulse of blood from his bite wound had become sluggish his movements were ending greta stared without expression i dont feel anything except release owen she confessed my compassion has died he killed it and in the end hes luckier than he deserves the plague would have killed him more slowly he turned to her and opened his hand it was the penguin locket this is why i pulled him out he showed me hed kept the thing to gloat yanking his gloves off with his teeth he opened it inspecting lost the pebble i see he unfastened the chain put your hood down she did so and bent her head tenderly he reached around and hooked the locket she let it dangle a minute on the outside of her parka so he could see it i gave the pebble to my father she said so he could keep it safely for us you trusted him not to sell it it was a grin he wouldnt sell it not anymore hart pulled her hood back up we need to conserve every bit of heat and energy we can now they glanced down at drexlers body youre a widow again she nodded not with sadness but release yes but a widow with prospects her look was shy his look was a combination of pleasure and apprehension i should say so if we can survive the sea chapter thirtynine owen and greta were quiet on the long walk back to the boat exhaustion was taking its toll and the trek was grim they skirted the frozen soldier by the iceberg rounded the open water and worked back to their packs where they gathered their supplies they passed the body of the other man that hart had shot and found a third lying in the halfsunken motor launch the pilot had hoped to transfer to that larger craft and use its engine to get clear of the ice but his gunfire had holed it the dead storm trooper lay in pink water that had risen halfway up to the gunwales its surface freezing into slush so the couple restowed their gear in the whalers lifeboat and pushed off from the pack ice rowing numbly after several hundred yards they stopped and hart tethered the boat to another ice island they crawled into the bottom of the boat and covered themselves with a blanket and tarp a light snow was falling and it dusted the covering they kissed wearily in their cocoon and cupped like spoons greta nested into owen then they slept for the first time in weeks dark dreams did not plague them the pair woke stiff but somewhat recovered crawling out from under the tarp like burrowing animals hart looked around the panorama was gray water the color of lead the ice was dull under a ceiling of cloud hed no idea what time it was or even what day it was time had stopped or become irrelevant atropos island continued to thunder the volcanic plume bulging under the overcast like a sagging belly mist fogged the distant glaciers and flakes of snow spat at them in lazy fashion everywhere hart looked there was utter emptiness a land and seascape absolutely vacuumed of life of warmth of history they were in a frozen limbo and the only sound in all that chilly vastness was the drum of their own pumping blood the only sparks of heat the ones each carried in their core all that mattered in the end he realized was each other i feel like were the last living things on earth he told her she was biting off a piece of bread her eyes shining to have awakened this morning was like awakening from her terrible dream shed never felt such relief no owen the sea is still alive look she pointed there was a hiss a cloud of rank vapor evidence of another huge beating heart puffed above the water the surface roiled as the small hillock of a whales back appeared then it submerged again and the tail broke the surface waving beckoning them to the sea its a good sign she promised that despite all the kilometers ahead were going to make it hart unhooked the boat from the ice and they began to row following the whale slowly they worked out of the pack ice that clung to the island as they neared the open ocean the wind began to pick up they hoisted the sail and huddled for warmth in the stern the lifeboat taking on an easy motion as it slid up and down the swells an iceberg passed by on the starboard side and they saw penguins standing on it yes there was life after all how far to land she asked about four thousand kilometers to africa my god the impossibility was obvious we have to try they sailed on strangely their mood was not despair but contentment they were alone and with each other it was enough the sea was gray the swells cresting with foam but not yet threatening to overpower their little boat seabirds appeared and began trailing them riding the wind in long looping circles the overcast broke and a tantalizing rift of blue showed through behind the island began to look simply like a gigantic dark cloud hours passed greta dozed in owens arms lulled by the roll of the sea then she lazily came awake again watching the water it was hypnotic swells marking a timeless rhythm she squinted her gaze caught on something that broke the pattern something above the surface something hard my god is that a ship she pointed he followed her arm eagerly then looked uneasy i think its the submarine i think its the u no she put her arms around him this is too much he studied the craft it would be except it isnt trying to intercept us i think hasnt it spotted us should we drop the sail to hide no he said now more puzzled than alarmed thats not it the sub isnt trying to do anything i think its dead dead plague he aimed for the vessel the uboat was wallowing sluggishly drifting as if it had lost all power the main deck was awash only the conning tower clear of the sea it rocked back and forth like a lonely buoy i dont see anybody greta said quietly owen hove to and then watched the submarine for a while in grim wonder no he replied i suspect theres no one to see its a ghost ship now like the bergen so i really killed them im looking at their tomb no they killed themselves she crossed herself he turned the rudder and began sailing away the conning tower looks like its slowly sinking she judged staring after the disappearing uboat maybe freiwalds taking her to the bottom maybe theres a leak so its really over isnt it that part is they sailed on the day getting late they took turns eating and steering catching snatches of sleep both felt immensely tired the euphoria of escape was wearing off and lifes insistence at worrying about the next danger was pecking persistently at their mood night fell a cloudy one as dark as the cave and then the gray dawn revealed mostly empty ocean a few icebergs drifted miles from their position but the island was lost below the southern horizon i want to talk about our future greta said a future that will keep my spirits up all right hart thought a moment what kind of house shall we have a sunny one she said promptly with a tree and a table under the tree not big like i had in berlin but bright he laughed it sounds affordable and what kind of car do ordinary people really have cars in america yes some of them you need one the countrys big well then i want one of those too but not black a happy color like in a childrens book exactly the clouds parted briefly and for a while the horizon sparkled then the weather closed again and the wind began to rise ominously the tiny boat was like a leaf on a prairie the sea slowly building and breaking white the sky was darkening hart shortened sail they call this latitude the furious fifties he said now well see why the boat was beginning to toboggan down one side of the swells and climb laboriously up the next the wind singing in the rigging spray breaking across the prow began to wet them it would be a long second night greta looked across the cold seascape her hair blowing past her cheeks with a sad faraway look that reminded the pilot of their days on the schwabenland he wondered what her picture of america was and what she would think of it if they ever got there the boat rolled steeply and she shifted her body automatically to help balance a streak of foam hissed away from their stern she began to bail barely keeping pace with the rain of spray were not going to make it are we owen she asked finally when she rested we could never make it like you said he was looking out across the water his eyes narrow his mouth in its half smile of concentration i was wrong well make it ah the optimistic american she couldnt help smiling you dont give up easily do you not anymore and how do you know that well make it mr hart well for one thing weve only got three thousand and nine hundred kilometers to go much less if you count in nautical miles she laughed i hadnt realized we were so close and for another thing you have an angel on your shoulder oh really she turned to look very small i think but thats what your eskimo friend promised yes hart nodded and elmer was right she slumped in the bottom of the boat huddling against the cold i wish he was but i dont see this angel owen the angels have deserted me i suspect no they havent he pointed i can see it she didnt bother to look this time her eyes closed greta he said impatiently hmmmm please get out the flare gun you packed what her eyes opened wide for your angel he pointed again and this time she swung to look there was a gray shape on the horizon another ship my god its true owen was beaming now his face stung with spray his hair whipping in the wind of course its true because of the person im with i suspect he leaned and seized and kissed her passionately happy get out the flare dammit she did so and a red star shot skyward in the gloom they waited a few minutes then another the ship began pointing toward them owen whooped waving his hand wildly as if they could see it at such a distance then he beamed at his companion did i ever tell you that women are good luck the american destroyer reuben gray picked them up at dusk greta went up the rope ladder first sailors eagerly lifting her the last few feet and marveling at the novelty of a woman then a sailor pointed to the ladder urgently and gestured at hart speak english kid the pilot asked his mouth dropped open you sound american montanan never thought id see so much fucking water in my life the norwegian lifeboat was heavy with it he realized accumulated spray sloshing under the floorboards they wouldnt have lasted the night he grabbed the ladder and hoisted himself aboard whered you come from the sailors wide eyes looked out at an empty sea heaven and hell hart looked down at the lifeboat a last time with appreciation on its second chance it had done its job big wave someone called from the deck pointing the two men looked a dark hill was mounding aiming for the destroyers stern quarter hang on the sailor shouted shoving hart the pilot needed no encouragement he wrapped an arm around a metal rack the stern of the ship dipped a mountain of gray water looming over it then the wave broke spray crashing against the stern like breakers on a rocky coast there was a splintering crack the stern rose twisted dropped again the destroyer tilted as it sought equilibrium hart let go and looked back over the side the norwegian lifeboat had been hurled against the steel ships side and shattered it was gone except for a scrap of wood attached to one line the destroyer began to accelerate and steered a more favorable course into the waves steadying and at last the island seemed reassuringly remote they were safe but what was an american destroyer doing way down here owen walked across the fantail to a hatchway where yellow light beckoned greta was there her hood down and a halo of illumination around her hair and there was someone else too fortune is curious isnt it mr hart i dont believe it otto kohl smiled like the proprietor of a private yacht youre lucky we found you in time and im lucky you found us i think the captain was ready to pitch me overboard if i didnt find a submarine to sink or an island to invade and i feared i was going to help him kill the two of you instead i saved you now perhaps you can convince him of the truth of what ive been saying hart stepped inside feeling himself sagging in the relative warmth ill try but what are you doing here i went to the americans i confessed all they didnt believe me until they intercepted a radio signal from your uboat then they made me a captive guide exhibiting a sorry mistrust ive only slowly been overcoming well its too late to guide them otto theyre all dead even jurgen the submarine is gone the island volcano erupting the disease and cure lost forever i hope it would be insane to go back there the submarine gone it was full of plague and slowly sinking the last time we saw it this destroyer can look in hopes of practicing its naval gunnery but i dont think theyll find it and was anything salvaged from this vessel of course not you want a souvenir kohl sighed no just that jurgen was holding some papers of mine ah i saw those come aboard important the german thought about that then he shook his head no not important not anymore because life goes on i think because its time to start over and make up for the past no hart nodded admiral byrd once remarked that antarctica can provide a man with a chance to remake himself maybe he was right but im sorry about your papers otto i dont know what other evidence we have to back up your story he shrugged yourselves certainly how else did you come to be down here in an open boat the pilot nodded theres that and one other thing greta fished into her clothes and pulled out her bottle an algae or a sponge a strange organism perhaps some scientist will confirm its novelty greta you saved some the pilot was surprised just this raw sample when i destroyed the rest im curious as a scientist you know otto peered this is what all the fuss has been about this and how humans could misuse it kohl nodded that i understand he paused then considering the way the couple looked at each other well would an engagement present be appropriate it would be very appropriate hart said greta smiled good because ive been carrying this halfway around the world and dont have a clue as to why he reached into a pocket and took out a scrap of soiled ribbon handing it to greta but i kept it as you asked she looked happy as she unwrapped the pebble what the devil is that rock she lifted the locket out of her clothes and unsnapped it its memory papa she slipped the pebble in and closed the tiny container it goes here near the heart her father nodded and now you two go on to california i hope greta looked shyly at owen its warmer than montana i hear and i want to be near the sea to study whales not to hunt them but to learn from them and you owen i think commercial aviation is going to increase after the war i want to fly and i suspect california will be as good a place to start as any i once spent some time there good and i think i want to help rebuild some of what we destroyed after the reich finally dies they will need otto kohl i think an ensign stepped into the room the captain wants to talk to you three you have a lot of explaining to do of course of course kohl nodded what a story we have to tell lead the way young man he put a cautious hand on harts shoulder captain reynolds and i are slowly becoming the best of friends he whispered its taking time but hes warming to me i think so you of course must let me do most of the talking as the trio climbed toward the vessels bridge owen hart slipped his arm around the woman he loved authors note this book was inspired by a true incident in germanys hermann goring did send an expedition to antarctica on the seaplane tender schwabenland its pilots were the first to fly over the coastal ranges of queen maud land and they assigned some names to the region that persist today the germans did drop swastikaengraved darts from their flying boats to establish a claim to the continent and did greet curious penguins with a heil hitler they named the area new schwabenland except for hermann goring however all the characters in this novel are imagined none are meant to represent the actual members of the schwabenland expedition the history recounted here is solely the authors invention to the degree possible however this novels descriptions are based on historic accounts of the places times people and mores of the nazi era those readers familiar with antarctic history and geography will recognize some sources of the novels ideas atropos island is inspired by reallife deception island for example dry valleys such as the one described do exist so do leopard seals the disease depicted is fiction but scientists have recently discovered underground ecosystems of bacteria fed by chemicals and the earths heat energy the drug was suggested by the story of penicillin discovered accidentally in when mold spores blew through a scientists window and fell on plates of bacteria the strain that was developed as an antibiotic in world war ii penicillin chrysogenum came from a single moldy cantaloupe found by a researcher in a supermarket garbage bin in peoria illinois proving again that truth is at least as strange as fiction this book would not have been possible without the opportunity to make two visits to antarctica as a science journalist writing for the seattle times under a fellowship program of the national science foundation i am grateful to the times the nsf and all the people i met there they and the southern continent affected me deeply antarctica is an extraordinary place which tends to have an enormous impact on those who visit it no continent on earth has quite its combination of hostility and beauty in the twentyfirst century antarctica is likely to come under heavy pressure from nations eager to exploit its resources it is imperative this unique place be preserved as the wilderness and research park it is today i am in debt to the encouragement of my agent kris dahl and the patient guidance and support of my editor rick horgan and i am at a loss to adequately thank my wife holly for her help with this book she became my collaborator on this novel under difficult circumstances across a vast distance we became closer and i will always be grateful for that more william dietrich please read on for a bonus excerpt from getting back prologue everything he knew was useless now there was a cold clarity to that realization a crystallization of hopelessness that in its own odd way was bracing it was the first coherent thought to penetrate ethan flints panic in some time he acknowledged with an acceptance that was calming that he was probably doomed the cries of pursuit were growing closer the heave of ethans chest and pounding of his heart had quieted enough to hear the sound drifting across the desert its harsh rasping reminding him of the caw of crows hed grown up with the urban birds watching them multiply on songbird eggs until they flew across the endless rooftops like plumes of smoke and they spoke in a language hard and aggrieved it was a relative of that sound the fugitive heard now human calls that were shrill excited and without remorse it was a yipping designed to induce fear and at first flints brain had screamed the need to think so urgently that it drowned out every other thought now his peril was being more rationally more grimly absorbed he was being hunted but why by whom the day had climaxed into an oven of punishing heat the air so dry that ethan seemed hardly to sweat he understood this was an illusion he was parched and rapidly dehydrating despite his knowledge of how dangerous such a condition could be there was so much hed memorized before coming to the desert the proper salt balance his necessary caloric intake the dimensions of a solar still or how to splint a bone or identify an edible plant or make fire with a lens hed sought to be an aboriginal engineer a wilderness technician a lot of good it was doing him now the plane crashed his friends dead his carefully chosen gear a growing deadweight and now this unexpected pursuit when running for your life you dont have much time to indexsearch the precepts of wilderness comfort on disk he observed wryly his peril would be funny if it wasnt so damned frightening perhaps it was a bad dream certainly australia seemed unreal the sand was too red the sky too blue the desert brush a vivid improbable green like a childrens coloring book the landscape shimmered and danced its insubstantiality matching his sense of being trapped in a nightmare but the pain was real his head ached and every attempt to rest gave the flies a chance to find him again their buzz was as tireless as the sun the impossibility of his situation seemed so enormous that he had difficulty processing its logic he was a sheeter slang for a computer engineer who matrixed corporate spreadsheets into fourdimensional game theory and his whole life was built on mathematics he was an artist of the rational his boss had praised him a wizard a master a lord of the logarithms ethan had swaggered through code like danielfuckingboone it was all worth squat right now a fact that seemed cruelly unfair shouldnt all his work all his education and all his technological expertise give him some kind of edge no of course not cops credentials resumes diplomas thousands of miles away and hed asked for this paid a small fortune to do it enormously funny really a tremendous joke on him clearly something had gone monstrously wrong so nonsensically and outrageously wrong that he thirsted not just for water but retribution oh what rank incompetence this confirmed among the bastards whod sent him here what lies theyd told by not telling him enough if he got home hed what somebody would listen wouldnt they if he got home ethan glanced back his glimpse of his pursuers produced an instinctive shock of fear there was an animal wildness about them a shedding of restraint that was as unbound and tangled as their hair he was so disoriented drugged for the flight awakened in wreckage the harried pilot who unstrapped him displaying none of the cool aplomb hed come to expect the aviator had punched out parachuted down and moved in anxious jerks desperate to get away from the wreckage that smoked like a beacon the plane had broken into two parts the forward section with his dead friends skidding to the far side of a low rise ethan had wanted to go there but the pilot refused you dont want to see your friends instead the rattled aviator had unscrewed a tail panel and unbolted an orangecolored electronic box cursing as he struggled with the tools then he brusquely jammed the added weight into ethans alreadystuffed pack this is whats going to keep us from having to walk to the beach the man had explained gruffly if i can get the rest wait here ethan waited as the pilot trotted toward the nose and when hed become bored sitting in the heat and sand and finally trudged up the rise thinking he was hallucinating a curious murmur of voices hed seen a swarm of scavengers who looked like urban groundlings theyd pinned the pilot against the blackened fuselage like a trapped rabbit their movements quick their tone mocking and their skin brown and hard as bark get back theyd howled at the pilot so flint had run before hed fully realized he was running confused by the impression of faded synthetics and wooden spears wire decorations and ragged hair a melding of stone age and information age st century huns now he could hear their crowing getting closer drawing near the address in daniels city was in the tower of an anonymous skyscraper cluster forty minutes away by tube discreet lettering in the lobby announced the firms presence on the thirtythird floor the elevator opened to reveal a number of nondescript small offices a title company a financial newsletter a laserlift skin clinic the tour agency door was solid wood plain and locked outback adventure a tiny sign read in letters slipped into the kind of bracket that could accommodate a rapid turnover of tenants he glanced at the ceiling a vidsnake was watching him daniel hesitated then knocked silence he looked at his watch on time he tried the knob but it didnt budge he knocked again nothing dammit it wasnt lunch but there was no sound from the other side he eyed the keypad lock and punched some numbers at random without effect quickly becoming bored hello finally he retreated across the hallway and slid down the wall sitting expectedly on the floor hed wait for the bastards with that there was a buzz a click and the door swung quietly open he stood awkwardly and walked over poking his head through the inside revealed a small waiting area with ugly plastic molded chairs a desk and a pretty receptionist she smiled close the door behind you he stepped through and the door clicked shut your appointment to see mr coyle he said grumpily my name is daniel dyson please have a seat mr dyson she gestured at the plastic chairs ill inform mr coyle you didnt answer my knock yes we did eventually she regarded him with quiet amusement you dont want clients to come in eight percent of our applicants are turned away by that door and thats for their own good they wouldnt do well with outback adventure would they he sat while she announced his arrival the chairs were as uncomfortable as they looked the brochures on the table featured the same wilderness couple hed seen on his video wall there were pictures of empty desert redrocked gorges and bounding kangaroos the text was spare like primitive life itself this is a journey with no schedule no itinerary and no set destination except selfrealization a zen thing maybe there was a buzz and she looked up at him again smiling your counselor will see you now he went through another solid wooden door the man who met daniel reminded him a bit of the brochure ninja but without the knives elliott coyle was darkhaired tanned and dressed in a charcoal sport coat over a black silk crew shirt and dark pants he wore black duraflex slippers a silver pin on his lapel was the only bright point to catch the eye it showed a kangaroo that would be something daniel thought to see a wild kangaroo there are thousands of them hundreds of thousands where youre going coyle had followed daniels eye how do you know im going ive read your profile daniel you belong there you have a profile the screening questionnaire a background check we dont send just anyone on outback adventure its too expensive for both of us so we try to guess an educated guess but a guess nonetheless who truly belongs there the information we have on you is very promising ill bet it includes my annual salary if thats my fee coyle smiled touche secret passwords locked doors your company doesnt make sense he nodded you want to know more of course which is why im here he stuck out his hand elliott coyle the handshake was firm and brisk im your assigned counselor the man whose job it is to convince you the experience is worthwhile to help decide if we should give each other a try and then guide you through preparation if we come to agreement i feel its safe to say that what im offering what were offering will change your life who is we exactly outback adventure is a travel consultant that contracts with the umbrella governing arm of united corporations we have exclusive excursion rights to offer wilderness experiences in australia and australia is quarantined offlimits dangerous last i heard it was to keep management of the continent controllable we havent advertised its change in status instead we screen candidates to find the few who can realistically take advantage of what we have to offer youre in a select group daniel so how did you find me you found us remember thats the first requirement friends tend to tell likeminded friends we keep a low profile to discourage the casually curious we register as an export company if we didnt take such steps the screening would become unwieldy the idea would intrigue more people than you might think so how do i fit youre also the right age the right fitness the right temperament we think the only one who can really answer that is you daniel wanted to digest this for a moment if i go do i get cave girl he deflected he solemnly held up a brochure coyle laughed again i wouldnt mind time in the outback with her myself alas shes an actress daniel were offering wilderness not club pleasure youll have to find your own companionship if you want it he winked youve got to make a better pitch than that mr coyle especially for a years goddamned salary anyone who would pay that is crazy enough to go coyle nodded absolutely right so why dont you sit back and let me give you the spiel then you make up your own mind no pressure no sweat i think youll be intrigued at the very least the chairs were far more comfortable than the plastic of the waiting room daniel sank in one and donned headgear for the presentation adjusting the fit and sound a desert panorama opened up again gloriously empty the sky was a brilliant blue dried clear of haze the sand was a vibrant red coyle walked into view daniel knew he was simply giving his pitch in front of a blank screen and was being projected onto the headvid presentation but the combination was effective it was as if the two were together in australia every school child knows the tragic story of the australian continent coyle began the scene changed to rangeland being eaten to stubble by hundreds of browsing rabbits a virus concocted to control the nations feral browsers unfortunately mutated and jumped to humans while australia was effectively quarantined before the infection could spread both the targeted animals and most of the continents human inhabitants except for a handful of refugees were wiped out this was a key factor in passage of the genetic engineering reform act of course meanwhile this catastrophe was considered so threatening to the world population at large that the continent was quarantined the refugees were interned on the seychelles islands australia was permanently blockaded to prevent salvage companies or treasure hunters from landing and running the risk of contracting and spreading the disease to further discourage such illegal access all detailed maps coordinates and geographic information detailing the continent were purged from world databases to the extent possible australia was put out of sight out of mind as an emergency measure of public safety until now because united corporations turns problems into solutions because united corporations believes that everyone can win all the time daniel saw a picture of smiling backpackers winding down a palmshaded desert canyon the water pool next to them was turquoise the solution australia represented was an answer to the problem of wilderness coyle went on now seeming to lean against a palm tree the publics desire for natural preserves had first been accommodated during the population explosion of the twentieth century scenic areas of valuable land were deliberately set aside in countries such as the united states and canada to satisfy the demands of individualists who wanted to experience the outdoors the headvid panned a group of dirty happy hikers eating lunch along a mountain trail then the view lifted to show an alpine meadow and cascading glaciers the scenery was breathtaking despite such political generosity on the part of the national forerunners to united corporations none of these land seizures truly replicated wilderness all were relatively small quickly became crowded and were crisscrossed with trails they were surveyed mapped and offered rescue if something went wrong there were scenes of horrid overcrowding at the rim of the grand canyon in a yosemite parking lot at a yellowstone geyser long chains of recreationists wound along trails that had been trampled into trenches or mud bogs scraps of litter blew across an eroded clearing a mountain lake was shown posted for pollution the environmental extremists of the late twentieth centurythere was old tape footage of demonstrating greens demanded more they proposed gigantic new wildernessesa map showed green stains growing like amoebae on western and northern north america so vast that people could literally get lost in them but there was no room for more humanity needed resources to achieve our quality of life daniel was transported to a shopping mall where happy families strolled with packages under their arms he grinned sardonically hed never seen a family that happy until that is virus struck australia unfortunate tragedy has presented the world with an island as big as the united states but emptier of people than antarctica how dangerous would australia remain united corporations board membersthere was a picture of familiar faces meeting at the uc board table the men and women looking handsome and wise turned to science for more answers daniel saw hazardsuited investigators fanning out across the landscape like cautious moonwalkers these experts concluded australia no longer has plague the scientists had gathered back by their aircraft and were pushing their hoods back to grin in relief the scene dissolved to one in a laboratory zeroing in on a whitecoated scientist perched on a stool and looking like a favorite grandfather virus died with its human carriers the scientist assured daniel with a smile its as extinct as smallpox and aids then coyle was back posed now in front of the new york headquarters of united corporations it was then that uc saw a winwin solution the scene changed once more to abandoned derelict cities empty mine pits and droughtstunted grazing land australia had always been underpopulated dry thin the first european explorers the dutch didnt even want it asian traders visited only to obtain dried sea slugs sold in china as an aphrodisiac even after the english came they found mostly desert and arid savanna meanwhile environmental extremists continued to raise objections to some of the worlds most promising and necessary development projects accordingly united corporations saw opportunity where everyone else saw disaster our leaders quietly proposed a compromise we will preserve in its wilderness state this entire continent they offered in return for environmental compromise on other key issues greens will get a natural preserve of unprecedented size so long as they abstain from unreasonable obstructionism elsewhere and to show our good faith the most vociferous vocal skeptical and committed environmentalists are invited to be the first to test themselves against the challenge of outback adventure daniel saw a group of young ruddylooking adventurers waving goodbye from an aircraft he thought he recognized a couple of the faces from news shows the agreement must have worked he realized because environmental protest had indeed become muted this achievement was deliberately unpublicized the news organizations of united corporations recognizing that controversy is worthwhile only when it is the servant of consensus publicity would only invite tragedy australia would continue to be reported as unsafe to discourage thrillseekers looters or relatives of the dead wanting to make reckless pilgrimage the naval and satellite patrol of australias coastal waters would be maintained the board deliberately decided to maintain the continent in permanent purposeful decay the panic and rioting that broke out during the plague had already damaged australias urban areas and since then rot and rust have done much more the continents cities are deteriorating ruins and its roads are crumbled and drifted over more importantly most of australias interior was empty of people even before the plague and today little sign can be found that humans ever ventured there the island has reverted to a wilderness of sand broken concrete and scrap metal a wilderness so absolute in its isolation that its like is found nowhere else on earth electronic databases books maps films tapes and television shows on australia have been systematically pruned this fosters the decay not just of the nations physical infrastructure but its informational infrastructure as well true wilderness is not just the absence of the human footprint it is the absence of human knowledge to the degree possible united corporations has achieved both coyle had a look of solemn satisfaction today then australia is a place of purposeful mystery a deliberate step back in time a mythic place an eden and now the licensed consulting firm of outback adventure has been hired to screen a chosen few to experience the challenge of true wilderness exploration and personal selfdiscovery background music began to swell as the couple of the brochures walked into the glory of a desert sunset hand in hand these are people who are not satisfied with the everyday people who have advanced beyond mere recreation people who feel compelled to challenge the unknown those who graduate from outback adventure form the most select fraternity in the world as the headvid reached its climax australia dissolved to show mr bandoleer transformed into a ruggedly handsome captain of industry who walked like a lord across his factory floor his industrial robots bowing like nodding oil pumps his female companion was shown as the bride in a costly cathedral wedding and then as an executive moving into a highrise corner office with a stunning view of the city these are todays hardened heroes there was a final picture of green mountains climbing to snowy peaks and then a dissolve daniel removed his headgear somewhat dazzled from the images of australias vastness he was also visibly skeptical so what did you think a bit heavyhanded at the end there elliott his counselor who was now sitting across from him shrugged disarmingly you found the script a little corny so do i but theres truth in that corn daniel i dont understand why i havent heard more about this before i mean an entire continent for wilderness recreation and then you dont tell anyone about it to publicize it is to spoil it we dont want the refugee community lobbying to go back they have new lives now we dont want pilgrims or mourners or looters and united corporations didnt set this up to make big money or post big numbers we did it to satisfy the craving for adventure among a select few some of them frankly troubled with the idea that this might help both them and society winwin that this was the very best way to use the new australia daniel shifted uncomfortably how so be honest with yourself daniel are you fulfilling your full potential at microcore are you doing everything you could do for united corporations our superiors look at people like yourself and they wonder hes bright he thinks for himself but he also has trouble fitting in so we can leave him at a level job and let him stop growing becoming dead wood or we might find something that pushes him to the limit that tests just what he is capable of and thus which grooms him for future leadership in uc society outback adventure is meant to be a transforming experience those allowed to go are an elite but keeping it a secret to publicize the opportunity is to cheapen it the next thing you know thered be cyber underground guidebooks secret maps and so much speculation that the journey would contain as much surprise as planet disney daniel nodded slowly intrigued despite his doubts so who can go ah youre beginning to realize how rare this offer is the answer to your question of course is the fit the smart the committed the daring and the dissatisfied the ones to whom ordinary life is for some reason not enough the oddballs the misfits do you recognize yourself yet daniel said nothing you go only with what you can carry on your back maps are prohibited so is any weapon beyond a knife you can take electronic devices but only receivers take your solarcell tv if you must but leave your satellite phone at home our promise is that if you go you wont know exactly where on the continent you are or precisely where youre going or how long it will take youll be as blind as columbus as bold as magellan no other adventure company offers such realistic challenge we guarantee it a years salary for that listen to me everest is old routine you know that the sahara has become a holiday junket both poles have resort hotels every river has been rafted and every reef has been dived theres only one place of mystery left on earth outback adventures australia thats what the money is for daniel the ultimate challenge of the ultimate wilderness you bet it costs dearly you have to want it so bad you can taste it because thats the only kind of person who can make it there he took a breath he could taste it how does it work
