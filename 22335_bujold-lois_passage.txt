the sharing knife volume three passage lois mcmaster bujold map dag was riding up the lane thinking only of the chances of a bluefield farm lunch and his likelihood of needing a nap afterwards when the arrow hissed past his face panic washing through him he reached out his right arm and snatched his wife from her saddle he fell left dragging them both off and behind the shield of their horses snapping his sputtering groundsense open widerange still barely a hundred paces blight ittorn between thoughts of fawn of the knife at his belt of the unstrung bow at his back of how many where all of it was blotted out in the lightning flash of pain as he landed with both their weights on his healing left leg his cry of spark get behind me transmuted to agh blight it as his leg folded under him fawns mare bolted his horse copperhead shied and jerked at the reins still wrapped around the hook that served in place of dags left hand only that and fawns support under his arm as she found her feet kept him upright dag fawn yelped as his weight bent her dag straightened abandoning his twisting reach for his bow as he at last identified the source of the attacknot with his groundsense but with his eyes and ears his brotherinlaw whit bluefield came running across the yard below the old barn waving a bow in the air and calling oh sorry sorry only then did dags eye take in the rag target tacked to a red oak tree on the other side of the lane wellhe assumed it was a target though the only arrow nearby was stuck in the bark about two feet below it other spent arrows lay loose on the ground well beyond the one that had nearly clipped off his nose had plowed into the soil a good twenty paces downslope dag let out his pent breath in exasperation then inhaled deeply willing his hammering heart to slow whit you hamfisted fool cried fawn rising on tiptoe to peer over her restive horsefort you nearly shot my husband whit arrived breathless repeating sorry i was so surprised to see you my hand slipped fawns mare grace who had skittered only a few steps before getting over her alarm at this unusual dismount put her head down and began tearing at the grass clumps whit familiar with copperheads unsociable character made a wide circle around the horse to his sisters side dag let the reins unwrap from his hook and allowed copperhead to go join grace which the chestnut gelding did after a few desultory bucks and cowkicks just to register his opinion of the proceedings dag sympathized i wasnt aiming at you whit declared anxiously im right glad to hear that drawled dag i know i annoyed a few people around here when i married your sister but i didnt think you were one of em his lips compressed in a grimmer line whit might well have hit fawn whit flushed a head shorter than dag he was still a head taller than fawn whom after an awkward hesitation he now embraced fawn grimaced but hugged him back both bluefield heads were crowned with loosely curling black hair both faces fairskinned but while fawn was nicely rounded with a captivating sometimesdimple when she smirked whit was skinny and angular his hands and feet a trifle too big for his body still growing into himself even past age twenty as the length of wrist sticking from the sleeve of his homespun shirt testified or perhaps with no younger brother to hand them down to he was just condemned to wear out his older clothes dag took a step forward then hissed hookhand clapping to his buckling left thigh he straightened again with an effort maybe i want my stick after all spark of course said fawn and darted across the lane to retrieve the hickory staff from under copperheads saddle flap are you all right i know i didnt hit you whit protested his mouth bent down i dont hit anything much dag smiled tightly im fine dont worry about it he is not fine fawn amended sternly returning with the stick he got knocked around something fearsome last month when his company rode to put down that awful malice over in raintree he hasnt nearly healed up yet oh was that your folks dag was it really a blight boglemalice whit corrected himself to the lakewalker term with a duck of his head at dag we heard some pretty wild rumors about a ruckus up by farmers flats fawn overrode this in concern that scar didnt break open when you landed so hard did it dag dag glanced down at the tan fabric of his riding trousers no blood leaked through and the flashes of pain were fading out no he took the stick and leaned on it gratefully itll be fine he added to allay whits wideeyed look he squinted in new curiosity at the bow still clutched in whits left hand whats this i didnt think you were an archer whit shrugged im not yet but you said you would teach me whenifyou came back so i was getting ready getting in some practice and all just in case he held out his bow as if in evidence dag blinked he had quite forgotten that casual comment from his first visit to west blue and was astonished that the boy had apparently taken it so to heart dag stared closely but not a trace of whits usual annoying foolery appeared in his face huh guess i made more of an impression on him than id thought whit shook off his embarrassment over his straying shaft and asked cheerfully so why are you two back so soon is your patrol nearby they could all come up too you know papa wouldnt mind or are you on a mission for your lakewalkers like that courier fellow who brought your letters and the horses and presents my bridegifts made it oh good said dag yep they sure did surprised us all mama wanted to write a letter back to you but the courier had gone off already and we didnt know how to get in touch with your people to send it on ah said dag theres a problem there was the problem or one aspect of it farmers and lakewalkers who couldnt talk to each other like now for all his mental rehearsal dag found it suddenly difficult to spit out the tale of his exile just off the cuff like this fortunately fawn filled in were just visitin dags sort of offduty for a time till his hurts heal up true in a sensewell no not really but there would be time to explain furthermaybe when everyone was together so he wouldnt have to repeat it all over and over a prospect that made him wince even more than the vision of explaining it to a crowd they strolled to recapture the horses and whit waved toward the old barn the stalls you used before are empty you still got that maneating red nag i see he skirted copperhead to gather up graces reins from the way the bay mare resisted his tugging to snatch a few last mouthfuls of grass one would take her for starvedclearly not the case yep said dag stooping with a grunt to scoop up the geldings reins in turn i still havent met anyone i disliked enough to give him to and hes been ridin copperhead for eight straight years its a wonder that fawn dimpled admit it dag you like that dreadful horse she went on to her brother in a tone of bright diversion so whats been happening here at west blue since i left well fletch and clover was married a good six weeks ago mama was sorry you two couldnt be here for the wedding whit cast a nod at the solid stone farmhouse sited on the ridge overlooking the wooded valley of the rocky river the newlyweds addition of two rooms off the near end still in progress when dag had last seen it seemed entirely complete with glass windows a woodshingle roof and even some earlyautumn flowers planted around the foundation softening the fresh scars in the soil clovers all moved in now ha it didnt take her long to shift the twins they lit out about twenty miles west to break land with a friend of theirs only last week you just missed em dag couldnt help reflecting that of all his bluefield inlaws the inimical twins reed and rush were probably the ones hed miss the least judging from the sudden smile on fawns face she shared the sentiment he said affably i know theyd been talking about it for a long time yeah papa and mama wasnt too pleased that they picked just before harvest to finally take themselves off but everyone was so glad of it they didnt hardly complain fletch came in on clovers side whenever they clashed naturally which was pretty much every day and they didnt take any better to him telling them what to do than to her so its a lot more peaceable in the house now he added after a reflective moment dull really whit continued an amiable account of the small doings of various cousins uncles and aunts as they unsaddled the horses and turned them into the box stalls in the cool old barn with a glance at dags stick whit actually helped them put up their gear without being asked and hoisted dags saddlebags over his shoulder feeling that such an apologetic impulse should be encouraged dag let him take them as they made their way back out to climb the hill to the house fawn refused to give up her own bags to dag telling him to mind himself and thumped along under the weight with her usual air of determination despite their late difficulties she seemed far less troubled than at her previous homecoming judging from the smile she cast over her shoulder at him and he couldnt help smiling back yeah well get through this somehow spark together the farmhouse kitchen was fragrant with cookingham and beans cornbread squash biscuits applesauce pumpkin pie and a dozen familiar gowithsand the moist perfume of it all made fawn weirdly homesick even though she was home mama and clover both beaproned were bustling around the kitchen as they stepped through the back door and mama at least fell on fawn with shrieks of delighted surprise blind aunt nattie lumbered up from her spinning wheel just beyond the doorway to her weaving room hugged fawn hard and spared an embrace for dag as well her hand lingered a moment on the wedding cord circling dags left arm below his rolledup shirt sleeve and above the arm harness for his hook and her smile softened glad to see this is still holdin she murmured and aye dag murmured back giving her in return a squeeze that lifted her off her feet and made her grin outright papa and fletch clumped in from wherever theyd been workingwith the sheep from the smellwhen the greetings were all still at the babbling stage plump clover announcing that the food wouldnt wait sent fawn and dag off to put down their bags and wash up she hurried to set extra places and wouldnt let fawn help servesit sit you two must be tired from all that ridin youre a guest now fawn arent you her worried eyes added silently fletch looked as if he were wondering the same thing though he greeted his sister and her unlikely husband affably enough they sat eight around the long kitchen table filled with the variety and abundance of farm fare that fawn had always taken for granted but that still seemed to take dag aback having seen the austerity of life in a lakewalker camp fawn now understood why dag certainly did not disapprove praising the cooks and filling his plate in a way that demonstrated the ultimate compliment of a good appetite fawn was glad for his returning appetite worn thin as hed been by this past summers gruesome campaign and hed been pretty lean to start with with his height coppery skin striking bony face tousled dark hair and strange metallicgold eyes dag looked as out of place at a table full of farmers as a heron chick set down in a hens nest even without the faint air of menace and danger from his missing hand and the enigmatic fact of his being a lakewalker sorcerer or lakewalker necromancer as the bigotedor frightenedwould have it not without cause she admitted to herself fletch possibly in response to the penetrating looks he was getting from his bride was the first to ask the question im surprised to see you two back so soon youre not umplanning to stay are you fawn chose to ignore the wary tone just a visit were traveling through though i admit it would be good to rest up for a few days oh of course you can cried clover brightening with relief thatll be a treat id love to hear all about your new place she added in an arch voice so do you two have any good news yet beg pardon said dag blankly fawn who decoded this without effort as arent you pregnant yet returned the correct response no not yet how about you and fletch clover smirked touching her belly well its early days yet but were sure tryin our betrothal ran so long what with one thing and another there seemed no reason not to start a family right away fletch gave his bride a fond possessive smile as a farmer might regard his prize broodmare and clover looked smug fawn didnt always hit it off with clover but she had to admit that the girl was the perfect wife for stodgy fletch even without her dowry of a fortyacre field and large woodlot linked to bluefield land by a quite short footpath fletch put in we hope for news by winter anyhow fawn glanced at dag despite the unhealed damage to his groundsense at this range he would surely know if clover were pregnant already he gave fawn a wry smile and a short headshake fawn touched the malice scars on her neck darkening now to carmine and thought leave it be mama asked in a more cautious tone sohow did things go with your new people at hickory lake fawn with your new family dags family after a perhaps toorevealing hesitation fawn chose mixed dag glanced down at her and swallowed not only to clear his mouth of his last bite but said plainly enough truth to tell not well maam but thats not why were on this road nattie said anxiously those lakewalker wedding cords we made updidnt they work they worked just fine aunt nattie dag assured her he glanced up and down the table i should likely explain to the rest of you something that only nattie knew when fawn and i were wed here our binding stringshe touched the dark braid above his left elbow and nodded to fawns wrapping her left wristarent just fancy cords lakewalkers weave our grounds into them five blank stares greeted this statement and fawn wondered how he was going to explain ground and groundsense in a way that would make them all understand when they hadnt seen what shed seen when he also had to overcome a lifetime of deep reserve and the habitno imperativeof secrecy it seemed by his long intake of breath that he was about to try only you farmers use the term magic lakewalkers just call it groundwork or making we dont think its any more magic than than planting seed to get pumpkins or spinning thread to get shirts ground isits in everything underlies everything live or unlive but live ground is brightest all knotty and shifting unlive sits and hums mainly you all have ground in you but you dont sense it lakewalkers perceive it direct you can think of groundsense as like seeing double except that seeing doesnt quite coverno he muttered to his lap keep it simple dag his eyes and voice rose again just think of it as like seeing double all right he stared hopefully around taking the uncharacteristic quiet that had fallen for encouragement he went on so just as we can sense ground in things we can most of ussometimesmove things through their grounds change them augment them thats groundwork mama wet her lips sowhen you mended that glass bowl the twins broke whistled it back together was that what youd call groundwork stunning the entire bluefield clan to silence at that time too as fawn vividly recallednow that had been magic dag beaming shot mama a look of gratitude yes maam exactly well it wasnt the whistling thatwell close enough that was probably the best groundwork id ever done second best now thought fawn remembering raintree but raintree had come later and cost more very nearly dags life did they understand that this wasnt trivial trickery lakewalkers like to think that only we have groundsense but ive met a lot of farmers with a trace sometimes more than a trace natties one dag nodded across the table at nattie who grinned in his general direction though her pearlcolored eyes could not see him fletch and clover and whit looked startled mama less so i dont know if her blindness sharpened it or what but with natties helping fawn and i wove our grounds into our wedding cords as sound as any lakewalkers he left out the alarming part about the blood fawn noted he was picking his way through the truth as cautiously as a blindfolded man crossing a floor studded with knives dag went on so when we got up to camp every lakewalker there could see that they were valid cords which threw everyone into a puzzle folks had been relying on the cordweaving to make lakewalker marriages to farmers impossible dyou see to keep bloodlines pure and our groundsense strong they were still arguin about what it meant when we left papa had been staring at nattie but this last drew his frown back to dag then did your people throw you out for marrying fawn patroller not exactly sir sowhat exactly dag hesitated i hardly know where to start a longer pause what all have you folks here in oleana heard about the malice that emerged over in raintree papa said there was supposed to have been a blight bogle pop up somewheres north of farmers flats that killed a lot of folks or drove them mad whit put in or that it was a nerveague or brainworms that made folks there run around attacking one another its bog country up that way they say bad for strange fevers fletch added down at millersons alehouse i heard someone say it was an excuse got up by the lakewalkers to drive farmers back south out of their hunting country that there never was any blight bogle and it wasnt boglemaddened farmers attacking lakewalkers but the other way around dag squeezed his eyes shut and rubbed his mouth no he said into his hand and lowered it clover sat back with a sort of flounce she didnt voice it but her face said it for her well youd naturally say that wouldnt you mama and nattie said nothing but they seemed to be listening hard dag said there was a real malice we first heard about it when the raintree lakewalkers who were being overwhelmed sent a courier to hickory lake camp for help my company was dispatched we circled managed to come up on the malice from behind while it was driving its mindslaves and mudmen south to attack farmers flats one of my patrol got a sharing knife into itkilled it i saw ithe held out his left armthat close it was very advanced very umadvanced he paused glanced around and tried strong smart almost humanlooking leaving out how the malice had nearly slain him or that hed been captain of that company and source of its successful planfawn bit her lip in impatience heres the thing the important thing noback up a step dag he pinched the bridge of his nose im sorry theres too much all at once and im explaining this all backwards im sorry try this malices have groundsense too only very much stronger than any humans theyre made of ground they consume ground to live to make theirtheir magery their mudmen their own bodies everything they do theyre quite mad in their way his face looked suddenly drawn in some memory fawn did not share and could not guess at but thats what blight is its where some emergent malice has drawn all the ground out of the world leaving well blight its very distinctive well what does it look like asked whit reasonably it doesnt look like anything else said dag which netted him some pretty dry looks from around the table fawn pitched in its not like burnt fields or rust or rot or a killing frost though it reminds you of all those things it has a funny gray tinge like all the color has been sucked out of things first things die if theyre alive and then they fall apart at the seams and then they dissolve all through once youve seen that drainedout gray you cant ever mistake it it looks even worse to someone with groundsense i gather yes said dag gratefully mama said faintly youve seen it then fawn yes twice once at that malices lair near glassforge when dag and i first met and once in raintree i rode over after dag was hurt on his patrol which part he didnt tell you i notice she glowered at him in reproof hed still be on sick leave if we were back at hickory lake you got to go to raintree said whit sounding indignantly envious fawn tossed her head i saw all that country the malice had torn through i saw where it got started she glanced back to dag to check if he was ready to go on he nodded at her and picked up his tangled thread again heres the thing for the past twenty or thirty years farmers have been breaking land in raintree north of the old cleared linethat is north of where the local lakewalkers had deemed it safe or less unsafe leastways lakewalker patrol records show malice emergences get thickermore frequentnorth toward the dead lake see and thinner south and away south of the grace river theyre very rare although unfortunately not all gone so we cant stop patrolling those regions it was at a north raintree squatter town named greenspring that this latest malice emerged practically under it fawn nodded it hatched out down in a ravine in the town woodlot by the signs dag went on see there was a lot of bad blood between the local lakewalkers and the greenspring settlers on account of the arguments about the old cleared line so when the malice started none of the squatters knew how to recognize the early signs or to pick up and run or how or where to ride for help or theyd been told but didnt believe not that they wouldnt have needed to be lucky as well because by the time a farmer can see the blight near a lair theres a good chance hes just about to be groundripped or mindslaved anyway like stumbling into a spider web but with that many folks if theyd all known someone might have got out to spread the warning instead the malice pretty much ate them and grew strong way too fast i think that a whole lot more people died in north raintree than needed to this summer just because lakewalkers and farmers werent talking to each other i hadnt ever seen a mass grave before said fawn quietly i dont ever want to again papa gave her a sharp glance from under his gray brows i did once long time ago he said unexpectedly it was after a flood fawn looked at him in surprise i never knew that i never talked about it hm said aunt nattie papa sat back and looked at dag your people arent exactly forthcomin about these things you know in raintree or oleana i know dag ducked his head back when there were few farmers north of the grace it scarcely mattered to the lakewalkers in the hinterlands north of the dead lakeive walked up that way twicetheres still no need to do anything differently because there are no farmers there where it matters is in the border country where things are changing out from under uslike greenspring and like west blue he glanced around the table the food on his plate had all gone cold fawn noticed fletch said i never got the sense lakewalkers wanted farmer help they dont mostly dag admitted no farmer can fight a malice directly you cant close your grounds in defense for one you cant makecertain tools he blinked frowned seemed to take aim like a rider trying to clear a fence on a balky horse and blurted out sharing knives you cant make sharing knives to kill malices swallowing he went on but even if you cant be fighters you might find better ways to avoid being fodder everyone alive should be taught how to recognize blightsign for oneas routinely as how to identify poison ivy or rattlesnakes or or how not to stand on the wrong side of the tree youre felling how would you go about teaching everyone alive patroller asked aunt nattie in a curious voice i dont know sighed dag laid out like that it sounds pretty crazy we came upon the glassforge malice early this past spring only because of the chance of chatos patrol stopping there and gossiping with the local folks about their bandit problem enough for chato to realize there was something strange going on if i could only show folks somehowi wouldnt have to talk dag smiled wanly i never was much of a talkin man eat dag fawn put in and pointed to his plate everyone elses was empty he took an obedient bite folks could show off that patch of blight you say is by glassforge whit suggested then theyd all know what it looks like clover eyed him why would anybody want to go look at a thing like that it just sounds ugly whit sat back and rubbed his nose then brightened then you should charge em money dag stopped chewing and stared what sure whit sat up if they had to pay theyd think it was something special you could get up wagon excursions from glassforge charge five copper crays for the ride and ten for the box lunch and the lecture for free it would get folks talking when they got home toowhat did you see in glassforge dear it could be a nice little business driving the wagon making the lunchesit would sure beat pulling stumps anyways if i had the cash id buy that blight i would itd be better n a fortyacre field fawn didnt think shed ever seen dag look so flummoxed it was all she could do not to giggle though she mainly wanted to hit whit well you dont have any cash fletch pointed out dauntingly thank the stars added clover fanning herself with her hand youd likely throw it down a well quit your fooling whit said papa impatiently nobody thinks its amusin whit shrugged kicked back his chair and rose to carry off his plate to the sink dag slowly started chewing again his eyes following whit had an odd look in themnot angry though which surprised fawn knowing how seriously dag took all this with afternoon chores looming lunch broke up later putting their things away in the twins old bedroom upstairs dag folded fawn to him and sighed well i sure made a hash of that absent gods if i cant talk to my own tentfamily and make them understand how am i ever going to talk to strangers i didnt think you did so badly it was a lot for them to get around all at once like that it was all out of order i never explained sharing knives they didnt half believe meor else half of em didnt believe me i wasnt sure whichit was alloh spark i dont know what im doing on this road im just an old patroller im surely not the man for this it was your first try who gets everything right the first try anyone who wants to live for a second try thats for things thatll kill you if you miss likelike slaying malices i suppose people dont die of stumbling over a few words i thought i was going to strangle on my tongue about to hug him around the waist she pushed off and looked up instead she said shrewdly this isnt just hard because its complicated or new is it lakewalkers arent supposed to talk about these secrets to farmersare they indeed we are not how much trouble would you be in with your own folks if they knew he shrugged hard to say that wasnt too helpful fawn narrowed her eyes in worry but then just gave up and hugged him tight because hed never looked like he needed it more the breath of his laugh stirred her curls as he dropped a kiss atop her head in the pressure of a shorthanded harvest and a run of dry weather fawn and dag lost their sittingguest status almost immediately dag didnt seem to mind showing both willing and a keen and practical interest in the farm and all its doings it was all as strange and new to him fawn realized as the very different rhythms of a lakewalker camp had been to her she wondered if he was homesick yet as usual the bluefields combined forces for the ingathering with the ropers aunt roper being papas sister the ropers place lay just northwest of their own two of their sons and fawns closest cousin ginger were still at home to help out and amongst them all they cleared uncle ropers big cornfield in three days next was the bluefield late wheat dag proved unexpectedly adept with the long scythe his arm harness held a wooden wristcap over his stump and besides the hook he possessed an array of clever tools on bolts that he swapped in and out of it including his specially adapted bow the tool he usually used for clasping the paddle of a narrow boat on the lake also served to aid his grip on the scythe and after a little experimentation he seemed to find his way into the swing of the task quite contentedly so papa left him to it gleaning had been one of the first chores little hands had been put to back when fawn and ginger and whit had been only hiphigh they were all bigger now but the gleaning still had to be done fawn crouched and shuffled her way across the bright gold stubble and thought clover and fletch could well stand to be prompt in producing the next generation of shorter harvesters along the splitrail fence of the pasture the farms horses lined up in mildeyed curiosity to watch the strange behavior of their people at the end of her row fawn stood up to stretch her back and check on dag working at the far end of the field with papa uncle roper and his boys and fletch to scythe and bundle sheaves and load them into a waiting cart dag looked very tall beside the others though the sleeves of his homespun shirt were rolled up over a coppery suntan not that much deeper than the mens and the hat shading his head woven of lake reeds was fringed around the rim just like their straw ones whit rose beside her adjusted the strap of the cloth bag across his shoulder and followed her gaze i must warn papa to watch and not let dag overdo said fawn in worry he wont stop on his own just exactly how was he hurt again said whit cause when we went down to wash up in the river last night all i saw new was that little bitty cut on his left thigh its not long but its deep said fawn the knife blade that did it went straight to the bone and shattered the lakewalker medicine maker had an awful time getting all the pieces fished back out but thats not whats dragging him down so taking her lead from dag fawn decided to stick with a muchsimplified version of the truth the raintree malice halfway groundripped him in the fight tore up his ground all down his left arm and side it nearly killed him its like hes walking around recovering from his own personal blight well how long does that take im not sure im not sure hes sure most folks who get groundripped just die on the spot but dag says when the glassforge malice put these marks on my neckshe rubbed at the ugly red dimples one on the right side four on the leftit injured both flesh and ground if the bruises had been just from a mans hand theyd have cleared up two or three months back with nothing to show ground damage is nasty stuff her hand crept to rub her belly as well but she halted it burying it in her skirt instead dag wasnt the only one to carry the worst damage hidden inside huh said whit squinting at her neck i guess so the weakness and pain in his body dont bother him near as much as the harm the ripping did to his groundsense though that seeingdouble thing he talks about yes usually he can sense things out for near a mile away which i gather is pretty amazing even for a lakewalker he says its down to less n a hundred paces right now the medicine maker said thats how hell know when his ground is better when he can sense out far again whit blinked socan he still do his groundwork like that bowl whit had been impressed by the bowl rightfully fawn thought not yet not real well she thought of some of dags other marvelous groundtricks still not regained and sighed when lakewalkers made love they did it body and ground with an ingenuity farmers never dreamed of but she wasnt about to explain that part to whit whit shook his head frowning again at the reapers he looks so wrong fawn shaded her eyes with the edge of her hand why i think hes doing pretty good with that scythe theres that hat for one i wove him that hat same as yours ah that explains why he wont be parted from it what that man does for you but whit gestured inarticulately dag looks all right up on his evil horse he looks right with that bow of his anyone can seeyoud think it grew there on his arm even without how his arrows fly just where he wants ive never seen him draw that big knife of his but i sure wouldnt want to be on the other side when he does no you wouldnt fawn agreed but stick him with a scythe or a pitchfork or a bucket he looks as out of place asas if youd hitched that leggy silver mare to a plow he jerked his head toward the pasture fence swallow the dappled gray mare dag had sent to west blue as his lakewalkerstyle bridegift pricked her curving ears alertly she looked as elegant as moonlight on water and as swift as a rippling stream even when she was standing still beyond her black colt darkling as if proudly aware of collecting his dueshare of admiration kicked up his heels and danced past tail flicking grace was standing hipshot and bored along the fence line dark bay coat looking warm and shiny in the sun copperhead of the uncertain temper had been left in exile in the small paddock below the old barn but the two young plow horses whit was bringing along and known therefore as whits team cropped grass placidly a few paces off warp and weft were nice sturdy usefullooking beasts butyou would never imagine them with wings swallow was supposed to be a gift to mama fawn sighed i dont suppose mama rides her whit snorted not hardly shes too terrified me ive only taken that mare a few turns around the pasture but the way she moves sure does make it look a long way to the ground dag didnt mean her to be idle i thought you might train her to the cart well maybe papa means to breed her again for sure if we can find a stud around here worthy of her he was talkin about uncle hawks trustful or maybe that flashy stallion of sunny sawmans fawn said neutrally trustful would be good she added papa and mama arent planning to cut darkling are they dags tentsister omba was worried about that geld that colt youd have to be mad said whit just think of the stud fees in a couple of years hell support his mama in her old age sure enoughand our mama too fawn nodded in satisfaction on ombas behalf thats all right then she added grace was bred to a real fine lakewalker stallion named shadow before we left somewhat by accident but that was another tale dag expects her to throw a right lovely foal next spring with his lines and her temper whit grinned as long as its not the other way around hey grace is a very pretty horse too in her own way if you like em short and plump which i admit is a popular style around here fawn gave him a suspicious scowl but deciding he was referring to clover and not herself let the dig pass whit lifted his brows and sniggered well have to tell clover your mare is going to beat her to the finish line in the baby race i want to see the look on her face im not in any baby race fawn was about to snap but a loud sharp whistle from the other end of the wheat field interrupted her papa took his hand from his mouth and jerked his thumb firmly toward the ground his children interpreting this without difficulty shrugged in reply and crouched to their gleaning again when mama clover and aunt roper lugged lunch up to the wheat field everyone took a break under the nearby apple trees fawn collected a skirtload of the wormier groundfalls and carried them across to the pasture fence as a treat for the horses they all clustered up making the fence creak as they leaned over it and nuzzled the aromatic fruit out of her hands their thick mobile lips tickling her palms she liked watching the happy way their jaws moved beneath their sliding skins as they munched and crunched and sighed in appreciation and how they rounded their big nostrils and blinked their deep brown eyes she wiped the mess of apple bits and horse slobber from her hands onto her skirt and started back toward the orchard dag was sitting with uncle and aunt roper and fawns cousins talking and gesturing trying to explain ground and groundsense to them she guessed partly from the way his hand touched the cord circling his left arm and waved and closed and opened but mostly by the way his desperately smiling listeners leaned back as if wishful to edge away even while sitting crosslegged aunt roper spotted fawn waved and patted the ground beside her invitinglycome protect us from your wild patroller fawn sighed and trudged toward them the planned few days of rest in west blue had slid instead into a few weeks of hard work but dag found himself oddly at ease despite the delay the long days outdoors with the harvestpatrol had been laboriousthat bean field for one had turned out to be much bigger than it looked and before it was cleared dag had started seeing cascades of beans in his sleepbut he was sleeping and well too indoors every night in a real bed wrapped around fawn the food was not all driedout to carry light painstakingly rationed to the length of a patternwalk but gloriously weightily abundant there was no worse source of tension than an occasional clash of tempers no deeper fear than of a splash of untimely rain this break in their journey had been good for him the dark sick pain in his bones from the blight was giving way to mere clean fatigue from wellused muscles his left leg was not as weakhe hadnt needed his stick for days he felt lessunbalanced he had not admittedly attempted to stray off the bluefield acres to the village where he might risk encountering certain young men who had reason to remember his last visit with disfavor but however dag was now discussed in village gossip the bad boys dared not stray up here either and dag was content to be surrounded wholly by farmers who wished him well for fawns sake so patroller sorrels voice broke into dags drift of thought and he tilted his head forward closed his mouth and opened his eyes hoping he hadnt started to snore in his chair as was their custom the bluefield clan had gathered in the parlor after dinner to share the working lights clover and fletch had gone off to her folks this evening but tril sat in her usual place sewing nattie though not needing the oil lamp kept company plying her drop spindle and fawn and whit had set up a table to make arrows a skill fawn had mastered this past summer whits awful marksmanship had turned out not to be merely from his complete lack of training his little hoard of arrows picked up for free somewhere was illmade and illbalanced when whit had asked plaintively if dag couldnt fix them the way a lakewalker would dag had thought about it nodded and to whits temporary horror broken them over his knee hed then donated fawn and a dozen old flint points to their replacement being wishful to conserve his best steeltipped shafts for more urgent uses than target practice besides it was good for whit to suffer some instruction from his younger sister he was still in dags view too inclined to discount fawn now dag raised his brows tried to look awake and answered fawns papamy tentfather sir sorrel was studying him i dont believe ive said thank you for staying on through the harvest you do more work with one hand than most men do with two fawn squinting to wrap a carefully cut trio of feathers to a shaft with fine thread dimpled in an itoldyouso sort of way sorrel continued i never thought much before about what lakewalker patrollers do but i suppose it is hard work in its way harder than i rightly imagined maybe and not much comfort in it dag tilted his head in acknowledgment sorrel seemed clumsy but sincere sorting through these new notions but the thing isi cant help but wonderhave you ever worked for a living fawn sat up indignantly but dag waved her back down its not an insult love i know what he means because in a sense the answers no out on patrol we might hunt cure skins collect medicines trade a little keep the trails clear but thats all second place to hunting malice patrollers dont make and save like farmers do my camp kin did that part at home my bed was always made for me not that i ever spent long in it sorrel nodded but you dont have your camp anymore no sohow are you and fawn planning to go on then do you think to farm or something else im not sure said dag slowlyhonestly i figured i was too old to learn a whole new way of life but i will say these past weeks have given me more to chew on than trils good cooking i guess i never pictured having friendly folks to show me the trail a farmer lakewalker murmured tril raising her brows whit made a face though dag was not sure why by myself no but fawn knows her part maybe together it wouldnt be so unlikely as it once seemed his other potential skill medicine maker was far too dangerous to attempt in farmer country hed been told repeatedly in any case his weakened ground made the notion futile for now sorrel said cautiously would you be thinking to take up land here in west blue dag glanced at fawn who gave him a slight urgent headshake no she had no desire to settle a mere three miles up the road from her disastrous first love and first hate dag wasnt the only one of them who had been avoiding the village its too early to say tril looked up from her sewing and said so what do you plan to do when a child comes along they dont keep to schedule in my experience her penetrating maternal look plainly wondered if he was simply being a male idiot or if there was something he wasnt saying he wasnt about to go into the variety of methods available to lakewalkers for not having children till wanted some of which he was fairly suremake that entirely certainfawns parents would not approve of the secret of the malicedamage to fawns womb as slowly healing as his own inner blight she had elected to keep to herself a choice he respected andwhat was that farmer phrase for letting go of a regretted past water over the dam he offered instead weakly lakewalker women have children on the move tril gave that the fishy stare it deserved but it seems fawn is not to be a lakewalker woman after all and from what you say lakewalker mamas have kin and clan and camp to back em in their need even if their men are off chasing bogles he wanted to declaim indignantly i will take care of her but even he wasnt that much of a fool his eyelids lowered opened he said instead merely thats so maam we plan to travel before we decide where to settle fawn put in firmly dag promised to show me the sea and i mean to hold him to his word the sea said tril sounding shocked you didnt say you were fixing to go all that way i thought you were just going to the grace valley lovie its dangerous the sea said whit in an equally shocked but very different tone fawn gets to go to the sea and raintree ive never been past lumpton market dag regarded him trying to imagine a whole life confined to a space scarcely larger than a single days patrolpattern by your age id quartered two hinterlands killed my first malice and been down the grace and the gray both he added after a moment didnt see the sea for the first time till a couple years later though whit said eagerly can i go with you certainly not fawn cried whit looked taken aback dag muffled a heartless smile in a lifetime of relentlessly heckling his sister whit had clearly never once imagined needing her goodwill for any aim of his own so do our sins bite us boy were not done harvest said sorrel sternly you have work here whit yes but theyre not leaving tomorrow are you he looked wildly at dag dag did some rapid mental calculating fawns monthly would be coming on shortly bloodily debilitating since her injuries though slowly improving as she healed inside they must certainly wait that out in the most comfortable refuge possible well linger and help out for another week maybe but we cant stay much longer itll be near a weeks ride down to the grace if we want any choice of boats we have to get there in time to catch the fall rise and not so late as to be caught by the winter freezeup or just by the cold and wet and misery a daunted silence fell for a while natties spindle whirred whit went back to sanding a shaft smooth and dag considered the attractions of his bed upstairs compared to dozing off and falling out of his chair onto his chin whit said suddenly what are you planning to do with your horses take em along said dag on a keelboat theres hardly room no on a flatboat oh more busy silence whit set down the shaft with a click and dag opened one wary eye whit said but fawns mares in foal you wouldnt want her to drop her foal along the trail somewheres i meanwolves catamounts delay wouldnt it be better to leave her here all comfy at west blue and pick her up when you got back and what am i supposed to do walk said fawn in scorn no but seesuppose you left her here for mama to ride since she cant ride swallow and suppose we each rode one of my team instead id been meaning to sell them in lumpton next spring but i bet down by those rivertowns id get a better price also papa and fletch wouldnt be put to the trouble of feedin them all winter and youd save the cost of taking your pregnant horse on a boat ride she wouldnt hardly appreciate anyhow how would i get back copper cant carry us double and my bags you could pick up another horse when you get down there to graymouth oh so dags supposed to pay for this is he you could sell it again when you got back that plus the savings for not shipping your mare youd likely come out pretty near even or even ahead fawn huffed in exasperation whit you cant come with us only as far as the river his voice went wheedling and see mama i wouldnt be going off by myselfid be with dag and all going out anyhow and coming back id know how to find my way home again with money burning a hole in your pocket till it dropped through onto the road i suppose said sorrel unless you met up with bandits like fawn did said tril then youd lose your money and your life fawns going no worsefawns going again sorrel looked as if he wanted to say something like fawns her husbands business now but in light of his prior prying couldnt quite work up to it his drowsy brain forced into motion dag found himself considering not money matters but safety a lakewalker husband and his farmer wife alone in farmer country made an odd couple indeed and theyd already met more than one offended observer who might had there been time have taken stronger exception to the pairing but suppose it were a lakewalker husband a farmer wife and her farmer brother might whit be a buffer for dag as well as another pair of eyes to watch out for fawn because absent gods knew dag couldnt stay awake all the time or even another halfhour he swallowed a yawn you could fall into bad company down on that big river tril worried worse n dag whit inquired brightly tactless but telling sorrel and tril gave dag an appraising look dag shifted uncomfortably he had been brooding about the problems of lakewalkerfarmer divisions for months without results that he could see and here was whit practically volunteering to be a patrol partner and tentbrother if dag turned the boy down would he ever get another such offer whit hasnt the first idea what it would entail of course neither do i dag said fawn uneasily fawn and i will talk about it as you say were not leaving tomorrow dag could show me his blight patch on the way past glassforge whit offered eagerly i could be dag raised and firmed his voice fawn and i will talk it over well talk to you after whit subsided with difficulty fawn eyed dag in deepening curiosity when he rose to go upstairs she set aside her arrowmaking and followed she closed the door of their room behind her and he took her hand and swung her to a seat on the edge of the twins beds now pushed together there was still a sort of padded ridge down the middle but on the soft clean linens it wasnt at all hard to slide over in the night rather like a miniature snowbank but warmer much warmer dag fawn began in dismay what in the world were you thinking you give whit the least encouragement and hell be badgering us to death to be let tail along he put his arm around her and hugged her up close to his right side im thinkingi took this road to learn how to talk to farmers to try some other way of being than lords and servantsor malices and slavesor kept apart tentbrother is sure another way her fair brow furrowed youre doing that lakewalker thing again trying to join your brides tent be a new brother to her kin he tilted his head i suppose i am you know i mean to style myself dag bluefield she nodded your family at hickory lakewhats left of emi didnt get the sense they exactly nourished your heart even before you sprung me on em your brother acted like giving you one good word would cost him cash money and you acted like it was normal hm he halflidded his eyes and lowered his head to nibble at her hair he pressed a stray strand between his lips rubbing its fine grain are you that familyhungry dag cause i admit im close to fullup just now he pulled her down so that they lay facetoface smiling seriously then you shouldnt mind sharing oh manys the time i wished i could give halfwhit away his lips twitched he brushed the dark curls from her forehead and kissed along her eyebrows and theres another thing she added severely although her hand strayed to map his jaw camping in the evening have you thought how fast it would blight the mood to have him sitting there on the other side of the fire leering and cracking jokes dag shrugged camp privacys not a new problem for patrollers collecting firewood bathing in the river scouting for squirrels so you told me theres a whole code but whit doesnt know it then ill just have to teach him lakewalker yeah best bring your hickory stick for rapping on his skull ive trained denser young patrollers there are denser young patrollers she leaned back so her eyes would bring his face into focus likely how do they walk upright he sniggered but answered their partners help em along feels sort of like a threelegged race some days i admit the idea is to keep em alive long enough to learn better it works his smile faded a little mostly her slim fingers combed back his hair side and side and pressed his head between them in a little shake youre still thinking lakewalker not farmer this walk were on is for changing that though i figure if i can practice on whiti might have more margin for mistakes we say twos company threes a crowd i swear with you its twos partners threes a patrol the fingers moved down to his shirt buttons he aimed kisses at them in passing and said ive been watching and listening these past weeks and not just all about how to herd beans theres no more headspace for whit in this house than there was for you its all for fletch and clover and their children maybe if he was let out under a higher ceiling he could straighten up a bit with help even growless wrenchingly than you had to she shivered i wouldnt wish that even on whit her smile crept back so are you picturing yourself as a tentbrotheror a tentfather old patroller behave child he returned mocksternly he tried to pay back the favor with the buttons onehanded and benefiting from much recent practice succeeded with your hand there his only hand was gifting him the most lovely sensations as his fingers slid and stretched silk was a poor weak comparison for skin so breathingsoft i didnt say what he groped for some wordplay on behave but he was losing language as their bodies warmed each other the scent of her hair filled his mouth as she shook her head and he breathed her in she murmured muzzily trust me he will be the most awful pain he drew his head back a little to be sure of her expression will be not would be was that a decision slipped past there she sighed i suppose so well hell not pain you or hell be answering to me her eyebrows drew in he sneaks it in as jokes makes it hard to fight especially infuriating when he makes you laugh if i can run a company of pigheaded patrollers i can run your brother trust me too id pay money to watch that for you the show is free her lips curved her great brown eyes were dark and wide the little hands descended to the next set of buttons all farmers but one faded from his concern at this range opening his ground to her ground was no effort at all it was like nocking star fire in the bow of his body she whispered show meeverything igniting he rolled her over him and did while sorrel and tril might have been dubious about letting their youngest son out on the roads of oleana even under the escort of their alarming lakewalker soninlaw fletch and clover once the idea was broached were very amenable sorrel and fletch did unite in extracting the most possible labor from whit during the next week with his precious permission hanging in the balance whit worked if not willingly then without audible protest in any remaining spare moments his bow lessons with dag were set aside in favor of chopping cordwood for winter a chore normally not due for another month though not discussed the permission became tacit in the face of the mounting woodpile as dag thought not even fletch would be capable of such a cruel betrayal fawns parents were unexpectedly favorable to the idea of housing grace dag eventually realized it wasnt just because the mare was a sweettempered mount that not only tril but even nattie might ridethough nattie when this was pointed out snorted and muttered something about the cart will do for me thanksbut because she was a sort of equine hostage that fawn would need to return to collect her horseor by that time possibly horsesseemed to give tril some comfort though over the next several evening meals tril did recall and recount every drowning accident that had occurred within a hundred miles of west blue within living memory recognizing maternal nerves dag nonetheless quietly resolved to take whit aside at some less ruffled moment and find out if he could swim any less like a rock than fawn had before dag had done his best to drownproof her even if it was growing a bit chilly for swimming lessons a light rain the night before their departure turned the dawn air gray and cool muting the blush of autumn colors as the three rode down the farm lane a few damp yellow leaves eddied past along with farewells blessings and a deal of unsolicited advice ignored by both bluefield siblings with much the same shoulder hunchings dag found it pleasant enough to be back aboard copperhead and moving once more along the river road south dag tested his groundsense range and fancied it improved a hundred and fifty paces now maybe whit was temporarily too exhausted to squabble with his sister so the days ride was largely peaceful and dag would have his wife to himself tonight in a cozy inn chamber in lumpton market a touch an exchange of smiles a promissory gleam that furtive dimple left him riding in a warm glow of expectation as the afternoon drew to a close at the shabby little inn off the old straight road north of town these comfortable plans received an unexpected check a chance crowd of drivers drovers and traveling farm families had nearly filled the place and dags party was lucky to secure a single small chamber up under the eaves looking it over with disfavor dag was inclined to think a bedroll in the stable loft would be better except that the loft had been let out already but the falling dark the threat of renewed rain the fatigue of a twentymile ride and the smells of good cooking from the inns kitchen cured them all of ambition to seek farther tonight and the debate devolved merely as to who was going to get the bed and who was going to put their bedrolls on the floor it ended with fawn in the bed which was too short for dag as well as too narrow for a couple dag down beside it and whit crosswise beyond the foot even a chaste cuddle was denied though fawn did hang her arm over the side and interlace her fingers with dags for a while after shed turned down the bedside lamp peace did not descend before theyd gone down to supper whit had forced open the window to combat the rooms mustiness unfortunately he had thus admitted a patrol of late mosquitoes roused by the afternoons unseasonably warm damp every time anyone began to doze off the thin threatening whines induced more armwaving blanketducking and irate mutters from one of the others thwarting sleep for all dag instinctively bounced the pests away from himself and fawn through their tiny grounds unfortunately that concentrated the attack on whit some more rustling scratching and swearing and whit rose in the dark to try to hunt the bloodthirsty marauders by sound after he bumped into the bed frame twice and stepped on dag fawn sat up turned up the oil lamp and snapped whit will you settle youre worse n they are the buggers have bit me three times already wait there whits eyes narrowed to a gray gleam and his hands rose in an attempt to cup a flying speck two quick claps missed and he lurched over dag again in pursuit peering and trying to corner the insect against the whitewashed walls his hands rose again wavering with the targets erratic flight muzzy with annoyance and the first confusion of dream sleep dag sat up reached out his left arm extended his ghost hand like a strand of smoke and ripped the ground from the mosquito the whine abruptly stopped a puff of gray powder sifted down into whits outstretched palm his eyes widened as he stared down at dag he gulped did you just do that dag supposed he should say something useful like yes and if you dont go lie down and hush youre next but he had shocked himself rather worse than hed shocked whit its coming back like my groundsense range andgone again he folded his left arm freed of the hook harness for the night protectively against his chest and twitched the blanket over his stump for all that whit had seen it several times before and tried to breathe normally dags ghost hand had first appeared to him back when hed mended that glass bowl so spectacularly last summer and had been intermittently useful thereafter it was just a ground projection the medicine maker had assured him if an unusually strong and erratic one not some uncanny blessing or curse a ground projection such as powerful makers sometimes used but haunting his wrist in that unsettling form like a memory of pain and loss hence the name hed given it back when he hadnt yet understood what it was invisible to ordinary eyes dense and palpable to groundsense and then it had been destroyed hed thoughtsacrificed in the complex aftermath of the fight with the malice in raintree where in an utter extremity of panic and need hed groundripped the malice and nearly killed himself doing so whit just go lie down fawns voice had an edge distinct enough from her earlier grumbling that even whit heard it um yeah sure he picked his way much more carefully back over dag and grunted down to his bedroll once more dag looked up to find fawn propped on her elbow frowning over the side of the bed at him she lowered her voice are you all right dag he opened his mouth paused and settled on yeah her eyes narrowed in suspicion you have a funny look on your face he didnt doubt it he tried to substitute a smile which didnt seem to reassure her much he felt a peculiar sharp throbbing in the ground of his left arm as if a campfire spark had landed on his skin or under ita spark he could not brush away though his fleshly fingers made a futile effort to rubbing under his blanket she started to settle back but added what did you do to that poor mosquito groundripped it i guess except it was no guess he could feel the creatures lost ground stuck in his own as those deadly malicespatters had once been tinier less toxic not blighted not a spreading deathbut also not anything like a medicine makers gift of ground reinforcement warm and welcome and healing this felt uncomfortable and sticky like a spot of hot tar painful wrong fawn rolled up on her elbow again she knew if whit clearly did not just how far outside the usual range of dagdoings this was really i probably shouldnt have he muttered her eyes pinched in doubt butit was only a mosquito you must have killed hundreds by hand in your time thousands likely he agreed butit itches in my ground he rubbed again her brows flew up her face relaxed in amused relief oh dear he made no attempt to correct that relief he captured her trailing hand kissed it and nodded to the oil lamp she stretched up and doused it once again as the bed creaked he murmured good night spark gnight dag she returned already muffled by her pillow tryn sleep a slight snicker dont scratch he listened to her breathing till it slowed and eased then his arms crossed on his chest turned his groundsense in upon himself the tiny coal of alien ground still throbbed within his own he tried to divest it to lay it as a ground reinforcement in the floor or his sheet or even his own hair it remained stubbornly stuck neither did it seem to be starting to melt into his own ground converted from mosquitoground to dagground as a man might digest foodor at least not yet he wondered if he had in that moment of sleepy irritation planted a permanent infliction upon himself careless irritation not mortal panic not an overstretched onceinalifetime heroic reach out of a heart body and ground pushed for an instant beyond human limits groundripping a mosquito was hardly a great act nor of grave moral weight except that groundripping anything wasnt a human act at all it was malice magic the very heart of malice magic wasnt it lakewalker makers used two kinds of groundwork in a thousand variations they might persuade push or reorder ground within an object to subtly alter or augment its nature and so produce cloth that scarcely frayed or steel that did not rust or rope that was nearly impossible to break or leather that repelled rainor turned arrows or they might gift ground out of their own bodies most commonly into their wedding cords but also as shaped or unshaped reinforcements laid in the matching region of another persons ground to speed healing slow blood loss fight shock or infection but always the limits of the groundwork were in the limits of the maker doing it a malice stole ground from the world around itlimited dag swore by nothing but its attention and its attention ranged somewhere well beyond human too but while a person altered gifted ground into their own as slowly as a healing wound malices seemed to do so almost instantaneously not by persuasion but by simple brute and overwhelming force powered by yet more groundripping in a widening spiral perhaps such transformative power was not a human capacity even from the malice dag had only snatched deadly fragments anyone trying to groundrip something whole the way a malice did might simply burst like a man trying to drink a lake but a man might drink a cup of lake water was a mosquito like a cup of water dag considered the question and then considered more dubiously the sanity of the mind that could even frame it or maybe he was coming down with brainworms like whits fabulous rumor maybe he simply needed to sleep it off surely the splotch would go down overnight like any other mosquito bite absorbed by dags ground just as his body healed more purely physical welts he snorted and rolled over firmly shutting his eyes it still itched though by the next morning dags whole left arm was so swollen he couldnt get his arm harness on fawn was inclined to declare a day of rest in lumpton market but dag insisted he could ride onehanded and whit anxious to pass at last beyond the places he knew was not much help on the side of reason by midafternoon fawn was not happy to have her judgment confirmed when dag fell into a fever as if she needed any more evidence he settled on a blanket and watched without protest as she and whit set up their camp just off the old straight road south a chill mist rose from the damp ground in the gathering dusk but at least no more rain threatened all this from a mosquito bite she murmured sliding in beside him as he drew up his knees and hunched around the swollen arm he shrugged i dont think its going to kill me that spot in my ground is already starting to feel less hot she felt his forehead in doubt but his skin was merely overwarm not burningdry and he ate and drank if with an indifferent appetite when they rolled up to sleep she filched her brothers spare blanket away from him to drape on dag ruthlessly ignoring whits yelp of protest but by the following day the swelling had gone down and dag claimed the groundwelt was being absorbed much like a normal ground reinforcement if more slowly he nevertheless grew flushed and silent in the afternoon by his pinched brows and glazed eyes fawn suspected a thumping headache as unshakable as fawn felt in the leeside of dags full strength she hated her sense of helplessness when he was laid up he had a store of uncanny lakewalker healing knowledge in his head and a host of patroller tricks at his fingertips impressive enough that hickory lakes chief medicine maker had tried to recruit him into her craft but who cured the medicine maker a farmer midwife or bonesetter would not be much help in some strange groundillness and fawn realized that despite all this summers experiences she didnt actually know how to find a lakewalker at need it was too far back to hickory lake and still several days ride to the lakewalker ferry camp on the grace river patrols or couriers did stop now and then at the inn at lumpton market or that hotel in glassforge but it could be days or even weeks till any chanced along the camp that chatos patrol had hailed from was closer she was fairly sure but she didnt even know how to find that that at least had a cure she asked dag that night where it was to be found and he described it to her for the first time she began to see the point of their little patrol of three not only because it would take two bluefields to even lift dag but because one of them could stay with him while the other rode for help if strange lakewalkers would even give help to dag halfexiled as he was which was a new and ugly thought but by the next day dag seemed much recovered at noon they stopped at the roadside farm with the public well where they had first encountered each other and reminisced happily over small details of shared memory while stocking up on the farmwifes good provender that evening found them quite near to glassforge dag opined they could detour off the straight road tomorrow to show whit the blight and still make town before dark they could not have chanced on a prettier day for a ride up into the unpeopled hills east of the old straight road the sky was the dry deep blue that only the northwest winds brought to oleana the air as cool and tangy as apple cider the trees here were mostly holding their leaves and the brilliant sun turned their colors blinding bright crimson edged with blood maroon yellow gold a startling flash of nightshadepurple here and there in the drying weeds dags eyes grew coingold in this light like autumn distilled fawn was glad it was dag leading them up into these gametracked humps and hollows because shed have lost her way as soon as their turnoff was out of sight if not really been lost shed only to strike west to find the road again but the blight was a smaller targetthankfullysome ten or twelve miles in the sun was climbing toward noon when dag halted copperhead on the beaten trail theyd been following a frown tensed his mouth fawn kicked her mount weft alongside though copperhead laid his ears back for show are we close yes her own recall of the place was too dizzied to permit recognition shed been carried in headdown and ears ringing a prisoner retching from blows and terror and carried outher memory shied from that dag pointed up the trail this path goes to the ravine on the same side i came down the visible blight should start about two hundred paces along and the blight you cant see he shrugged though his face stayed strained ive been feeling the outer shadow for the past halfmile healing as you still are should you go any closer he grimaced likely not suppose you wait here then or better back down the trail a ways and ill just take whit in for a quick peek he couldnt argue with the logic of that a hesitation a short nod dont linger spark she nodded and waved whit on in her wake he looked a trifle confused as he pressed his sturdy horse up next to hers as warp and weft fell into a wellmatched pace he asked what was that all about being on blight makes lakewalkers sick well it makes anybody sick but i was afraid it would send dag into an awful relapse like after greenspring glory be that he saw the sense of waiting for us whit glanced around but everything is drying up and dying back right now how do you spot blight in winter how is it that youre supposed to tell this here blight fromoh they reined in at the lip of the ravine they must be very near to what had been dags vantage that day the cave was a deep hollow halfway up the ravines far side with a long outcrop of rock shielding the opening almost like a wall the ravine itself was a dusty gray devoid of vegetation but for a few skeletal tree trunks the glimmering creek flowing through in an scurve was the only movement the only source of sound no birds no insects no small rustles in the dead weeds even the breeze seemed stilled the peculiar dry cellarodor of malice habitation wafted faintly up to fawn and she swallowed feeling sickened despite the sun on her back that is the weirdest color i ever did see whit allowed slowly its not hardly a color at all dag was right it doesnt look likeanything fawn nodded glad whit seemed to have his wits with him today because she didnt think she could have borne stupid jokes right now dag thinks that malice came up from the ground and hatched out right here malices all seem to start out pretty much the same but then they change depending on what they eat groundsnatch that is if they catch a lot of people they get to looking more human but there was one up in luthlia that mostly ate wolves that they say grew pretty strange dag thinks the first human this one caught must have been a road bandit hiding out up here because after it grew its mudmen and caught more folks it made them all be its bandit gang at first though some of the men might not have been as mindslaved as all that which was in its way an even more disturbing notion the bandits who kidnapped me off the road brought me here dag was tracking them and saw from here dag would certainly have had a clear view of the mudmen carting her in like a sack of stolen grain he went in after themafter meall by himself no time to wait for his patrol it wasnt good odds but he tossed me his sharing knife and i managed to get it in the malice and the malice she swallowed again melted i guess you could say malices are immortal the lakewalkers claim but the sharing knives kill them kill them in their ground what are sharing knives anyhow dag keeps mentioning them and then stopping yes well there are reasons lakewalkers make them out of lakewalker bones so its true they rob graves no theyre not stolen dagany lakewalker would get mighty offended to hear you say that people will their thighbones to their kin to be be like harvested after they die its part of the funeral then a lakewalker knife makerdags brother dar is onecleans and carves and shapes the bone into a knife they dont use sharing knives for any other purpose than killing malices so thats what you stuck in the malice whose thighbone was it dyou know does dag fawn supposed gruesome interest was better than none yes but its more complicated than that carving the bone itself is only the first step then the knife has to be primed withwith a hearts death she took a breath not looking at whit thats the hardest part each knife when its made is bonded to its lakewalker owner someone who has volunteered to shareto donate his or her own death to the knife when such lakewalkers think theyre dying either old and sick or hurt mortal bad they they put the knife through their own hearts and capture their deaths which are trapped in the knives so every primed knife costs two lakewalker lives one for the bone and the other for the hearts priming ownership isyou cant buy such a knife it can only be given to you she glanced up to see whit squinting and frowning he said slowly so its sort of likea human sacrifice stuck in a canning jar and preserved to take out and use later fawn thought of the long rows of waxsealed glass jars she and mama had filled and sealed and set in the pantry only last week the domestic comparison was apt but oh dear pretty much but im not sure you should say that to dag lakewalkers keep their knives private and treat em as sacred its their kin you see and their grief but thats what sharing knives share deaths whit blinked some more then frowned across the ravine and said how far back does that cave go its not deep can we go in fawn wrinkled her nose i guess so if we dont stay long whit glanced down the steep drop nodded and slid off and tied his horse to a tree fawn did the same and followed him in a scramble down the slope black shale cracked and slid under her feet even the clay dirt in the gullywashes which should have been dull brown had that same drained gray tinge whit picked his way across the stream on stones not looking back till he reached the cave mouth when he turned around to watch her puffing and lagging after him keep up runt she was shivering inside too much to growl at the old taunt she labored up beside him and the dry sour malicesmell of the cave hit her fullface how long till the rains and snows wash this clean horridly blithe he strolled into the shadow of the overhang what a great place to camp this would be it really looks like it should be a bandit hideout he kicked at a broken old keg part of a scattering of trash no one had bothered to cart away so where were you two exactly where was this malice how far did dag have to throw his knife he must not have known you then it was a wonder you caught it here simplify the malice picked me up by my neck she fingered the dented scars here here right here the malice ripped the ground from my unborn child poor halfwanted waif here she died here dag was nearly torn apart by howling manbeasts here i struck right here the malice screamed and stank and shattered here sacrifice tangled with sacrifice here i miscarried here i hurt here i started bleeding i have to get out of here fawn said aloud she could not see clearly she was shaking so badly she could scarcely breathe there is no simple to be had here hey are you all right whit called as she stumbled out into the air again there wasnt enough light in the wide green world to make that cave anything but a pit of darkness to make her anything but stupid stupid stupid she became aware she was weeping not sobs but weird dry gulps whit trotting after her said is the blight making you sick here maybe ii better take you back to dag all right she nodded trying and failing to steady her breathing which seemed to stagger and stick she tried to swallow between gulps of air but her throat was too tight whit put a tentative anxious arm around her waist and halfsupported halfhustled her back down and across the creek she slipped and put one foot ankledeep in the stream gasping at the chill wet which at least got some more air into her by the time they reached the ravines top and whit boosted her back up into her saddle she was only wheezing her cheeks were wet her nose beslimed she dragged an arm fiercely across her face and coughed when they reached the place where theyd sent dag back she looked up through the silver blur to see copperhead cantering up the trail toward them dag pulled up with a jerk that made the gelding shake his head and snort a black scowl a brutal voice the like of which shed never heard before from dags mouth demanded of whit what did you do to her nothing said whit alarmed i didnt do nothing she was nattering on about about this and that and then all of a sudden she took a fit o the vapors i thought it might be the blight though i didnt feel anything like here you take her dag discarded his menace as he turned a keen look on fawn searching her body and her ground both she thought he dropped his reins on copperheads neck and leaned over to pull her from her saddle into his lap she clutched him hard around the chest burying her face in his shirt inhaling the scents of linen and warm dagsweat to drive the deathly cellarsmell away arm and strong spread hand his beautiful hand clutched her in return im sorry she mumbled into his shirt i didnt think it would all pile back into my head like that it was the smell of the cave all of a sudden i couldnt breathe stupid shh no he said into her hair his understanding seemed to wrap her more warmly than his arms he raised his chin jerked it at whit bring her horse we need to get away from this bad ground maybe get everyone something to eat copperhead turned obediently at the pressure of dags leg or perhaps ground in any case the gelding seemed to grasp that this was no time for tricks they all rode a good two miles back down the trail before dag turned off he led down over a bank and up to a little clearing with a spring seeping out of a rock overhang a pretty picnic spot patroller groundsense at work in any case dag said merely thisll do he murmured in her ear can you get down all right yes im better now not all better no but at least shed stopped sniveling he let her slide off copperheads shoulder and he and whit bustled about pulling food packets from the saddlebags finding the tin cups loosening girths and permitting the horses to browse dag kept a close eye on fawn till shed settled on a rock drunk spring water and taken a few bites of the rather dry cheese wrapped in bread left from yesterdays supply he finally sat down crosslegged beside her whit perched on a nearby fallen log that was not too damp with moss and rot sorry fawn repeated swallowing and straightening up stupid shh dag repeated gripping her calf in a reproving heartening little shake none o that whit cleared his throat i guess that malice was pretty scary yeah said fawn the spring water was welcomingly cool why did her throat feel so hot she scrubbed at her scars whit added magnanimously well youre just a girl after all fawn merely grimaced in his own way she supposed whit was trying very trying dags brows drew in as if he were struggling to parse what whit meant he clearly didnt see the connection between the two statements and then he did and got a pretty odd look he said ive seen the first encounter with a malice devastate fully trained patrollers i was on sick leave for weeks after my first though the thing never touched me whit cleared his throat made a wise decision not to try to retrieve his remark and asked instead how many have you seen altogether ive lost count said dag that ive slain by my hand with a knife of my own twentysix twentyseven fawn corrected he smiled at her twentysix and a half then my knife your hand fawn watched whits lips move counting up kills noknives lakewalker lives and deaths his brow wrinkled fawn put in hastily i told whit about sharing knives tried to anyhow im not sure if he has it all straight her anxious eyes quizzed dag is that all right he ducked his head answering her look as well as her words oh good thank you whit scraped his boot toe across the moss is that a lot of those knives to have had yes actually did youerhave a big family fawn resisted the urge to knock her heador maybe whitsinto a tree he was trying dag was trying too he replied straightforwardly no folksfriends kin of friends other patrollersgave them to me because i seemed to have a knack for getting them used a patroller can carry a primed knife for a long time and never encounter a malice which makes the sacrifice seemwell not vain but folks like knowing when it all comes to something that makes sense i guess whit allowed he remembered to take a bite of bread and cheese you dont havedo you haveone of those um suicide knives unprimed knife bonded to me dag hazarded whit said well it would have to be unprimed wouldnt it stands to reason because if it was primed youd be um i did have carried it with me for twenty years in case a lot of patrollers do can i seeno um did right what happened to it dag glanced at fawn she gave a small headshake no we didnt get to that part it met with an accident oh whit blinkeddaunted fawn prayed but not quite enough for he added curiously whose bone was it kauneos she willed one bone to me and the other to one of her surviving brothers my tentbrother up in luthlia whit gave dag a look partway between earnestly inquiring and leery um he was already starting to learn caution about these sorts of questions fawn thought and their answers dag took a drink of spring water and managed to reply with tolerable composure my first wife fawn gave him a worried look are you all right with this he returned her a fractional nod yes he could talk about kauneo now they had come so far dag cleared his throat and added kindly for even whits feckless curiosity was faltering in the face of all this she was a patroller too she died in a malice war in luthlia she left me her own hearts knife as well as a bone to make one for me we think she rolled over on her knife in the field after she fell her brother saidhe drew air in through his nostrilsshe must have moved quick because she could not have been conscious for very long afterafter she received her wounds is that where you whits gaze moved to dags left arm another short nod same fight i went down before she did so i only have guesses she wasjust a girl then five years younger than me just a girl thought fawn and dag didnt repeat those words by accident oh said whit and tentatively im um sorry dag gave him another reassuring nod and repeated his stock phrase it was a long time ago in your head it sometimes turns into just yesterday doesnt it thought fawn curiously like me and the malice back in the cave just now yes now i see how you knew she bent over and took another bite of bread to quell the renewed flutter in her belly whits brows knit were you really going to stick that bone knife in your own heart yes if it chanced so it took whit a little while to remember to chew and swallow after that one he finally scratched his ear and said cant you get another whit said fawn indignantly dag made a little gesture with his fingers its all right its not quite up to me id need someone to give me a bone or an unprimed knife that didnt get used that could be rededicated i want one id be bitterly ashamed to waste my death just for lack of a knife fawn realized she hadnt quite known that for all she knew of dag whit was reduced to blinking silently praise be whit inhaled folks dont know this they say lakewalkers are cannibals that you rob graves eat your dead to make magic dag said gently but now you know better um yeah whit brightened so thats one farmer boy whos learned something huh one down dag sighed thousands to go its a start sure enough said whit valiantly actually he looked as if he were afraid dag was about to put his head down and cry fawn was a little afraid of that as well but dag just smiled crookedly and creaked to his feet lets go see glassforge ducklings even in the late afternoon the straight road approaching glassforge was busy with traffic fawn watched whits head turn as he took in the sight of strings of pack mules goodswagons gaily painted with the names of their businesses and their owners and a big brick dray returning empty from somewhere the team of eight huge dun horses thundered past at a lumbering trot hopeful for home the bells on their harness shaking out bright sounds like salt along their path the teamster and his brakeman too were impressive in fringed leather jackets decorated with tiny mirrors that flashed in the westering sun red scarves knotted around their necks fawn thought the couple of burly loaders who rode with their legs dangling over the wagons tail might have been inclined to whoop at her had she been a girl riding alone but the presence of her escort turned their lewd stares into selfconscious nods cheerily returned by whit copperhead pretended to shy at this noisy vision checked by a growl from his tired rider and even gentle warp and weft swiveled their ears and looked faintly astonished whit patted his mounts neck there there warp dont let those big bruisers discourage you nobodys going to make you pull a ton of bricks his face rose to stare after the receding wagon thatd be a life though wouldnt it fawn i bet some of those wagons go as far as tripoint or silver shoals or or who knows where think of it youd get to see everywhere talk to the whole world and get paid for it sleep in a different place every night i bet the novelty of that wears off dag advised sounding amused scorning this with a look that said oldpeople talk whit went on i never thought of it but i bet a town like glassforge needs lots of horses too and drivers i know how to drive a team i wonder if i could get me one of those fancy jackets in town i wonder if he trailed off but fawn had a clear sense of the mill wheels continuing to turn in his head even if hed temporarily disconnected them from his mouth i bet youre never going back to west blue fawn thought any more n i am she grinned in anticipation of showing off glassforge to whit as pleased as if shed invented the place herself and wondered if this was anything like the pleasure dag took in her dag never seemed to tire of showing her new thingsno it was a little more complicated than that in her open delight she made the world new to him again and so drove his weariness away it seemed a fair trade whit was gratifyingly amazed by the hotel in glassforge three stories high built of local brick softened by trails of ivy bigger as he cried than uncle hawks new barn the corners of dags mouth tucked up as fawn earnestly explained to whit how it was that patrols and couriers were always allowed to stay there for free on account of some old malice the lakewalkers had put down in these parts in the time of the present owners papa which whit thought a very good deal fawn was secretly uncertain if the deal would extend to an expatroller of dodgy status traveling privately with a tail of farmer relatives but when they dismounted in the hotels stable yard she found she was still remembered from the past summer as the farmer heroine whod slain the malice she was welcomed by name by the excited horse boys and made much of by the owners wife when they went inside even more agreeable than having the best available rooms instantly offered up to them was the way whits eyes grew wide as he took in her local fame he didnt even crack a joke about it they hauled their bags upstairs to their chambers by request fawn and dags room was the same they had slept in before full of happy memories better it had a nice thick plank door between it and whits room with an oak bar that promised a night free of brothers mosquitoes or any other interruptions fawn was left with an hour before supper to run around and say hello to all the friends shed made here in the summer seamstresses chambermaids the cook and scullions whit trailed amiably fawn wasnt quite sure who she was showing off to which as several of the younger girls perked up no end at whit alarming him enough to make him very polite the charm he unleashed upon sal the cook was pure stomachinterest though as she was both married and motherly sal let me do sittingdown chores while i was getting better and waiting for dag to finish some patroller duties fawn explained inhaling deeply of the mouthwatering aromas of the hotels kitchen pots bubbled a roast turned on a spit pies cooled a scullion ran a hopeful horse boy back outside to wait for scraps till after the patrons were fed i must have shelled ten thousand peas but it kept me from going stircrazy you were so pale at first agreed sal i think my cookin helped put those roses back in your cheeks she patted one leaving a smudge of flour i think it did too said fawn brushing at the flour and smiling that n dag sals smile thinned a bit and she glanced appraisingly at whit so that patroller fellow with the missin hand must have got you home all right after all fawn nodded we werent too sure on him sal admitted some of us was afraid hed gone and beguiled you like they say lakewalkers can though its true the ones we get here are usually pretty wellbehaved how they carry on with each other being not our business fawn raised her chin if there was any beguiling going on id say it was mutual we married each other he never said sal in astonishment fawn gestured at her brother whit stood witness yep said whit they said their promises in the parlor in west blue in front of the whole family and signed the family book and everything oh honey sal hesitated looking troubled he was a right disturbin fellow the way all patrollers are though it was plain hed took a shine to you buti thought better o him than that dont you two know that lakewalkers dont recognize marriages to us folks im afraid he was pulling the wool over your eyes and your familys too no he didnt said fawn we were married lakewalkerstyle at the same timewe wove and swapped our binding strings as sound as any lakewalker couple ever did see she held out her left wrist wrapped in the dark braid and wriggled it to let the gold beads on the cordends bounce and glimmer showing it off for the third or fourth time in this evenings rounds is that what those are said sal doubtfully ive seen them hair bracelets on some of the patrollers here time and time wedding cords yes whit said its like they got married twice over i dont think dag was taking any chances by that time i will say when he ties a knot it stays tied sals eyes grew as round as her mouth and his people accepted it fawn tossed her head i wont claim his kin were all happy but they didnt say we werent married well i never the serving boys bounced in the scullions called and sal had to set aside her fascinated pursuit of this gossip in favor of getting supper ready she shooed her guests out of her kitchen with visible regret in the corridor to the dining room whit paused in puzzlement fawn hm dags kin did accept those cords of yours right they didnt claim you were just umrunning around together right fawn lowered her voice in truth there were four or five opinions on that some took em for true some accused us of trickery and some didnt care nohow about the cords they wanted to deny us anyroad they werent just arguing with dag mind they were arguing with each other as well we kind of set the cat amongst the pigeons with those cords when we left i expect it took the urgency out of the debate truly dag hadnt wanted to force a decision lest it become a quick and simplifying no these rules of theirsdo they make them camp by camp or everywhere at once camp by camp but the camps stay in touch with one another couriers carry patrol reports plus letters between the camp councils and folks personal letters and lots of gossip dag says young patrollers exchange between camps to train up and parties travel with trade goods and folks go on visits to kin sometimes so news has ways of getting around lakewalkers dont let themselves get cut off from each other she frowned i do wonder how dag will go on away from his people thats not natural for a lakewalker they made us both plenty mad buti do wonder huh said whit whit must have made a good impression on sal because the portions soon set before the three of them at the dinner table were generous after they had all pretty much foundered on the glut whit went off to the kitchen to compliment her he came back full of a scheme to go reconnoiter glassforge after dark which dagfawn was grateful to seehad the sense to discourage its been a long day fawn seconded dags still recovering you know dag smiled at her from lidded eyes that looked anything but sleepy dark and a bit glittery and she dimpled back at him oh yeah said whit vaguely and you werent doing too well yourself earlier tomorrow then he contented himself with going off to visit the horses and maybe chat with the hotel stables horse boys fawn and dag went straight to bed but not to sleep where fawn made the astonishing and delightful discovery that dags ghost hand was starting to come back at least enough to do a few blissful blushful things with fawns opinion of the medicine maker who had predicted such a recovery went up several notches they did hear whit come in mainly because he knocked on the wall and bade them good night fawn smothered a giggle as dag raised his head and drawled back similar good wishesvery blandly considering his position just then the next morning after breakfast the three of them strolled to the town center where a street off the market square led down to the little river that flowed past glassforge toward the grace tributary creeks behind dams fed several mill wheels though at the moment the dry weather a boon to harvesters and road travelers all over oleana had left the water so low in the main stream that only lightly loaded skiffs and narrow boats could take away the handiwork of the towns artisans the autumn air was acrid from the wood smoke and coal smoke rising from a forge a couple of iron furnaces a wagonwrights a big smithy a pottery yard and of course the towns celebrated glassmakers at one of these as fawn had hoped they found sassa clay one of her best friends from the summers misadventures with the malice redhaired sassa seemed equally delighted to see them and pleased to meet whit he had a refreshing masculine disinterest in marriage customs of any kind but was very keen on glass and local trade proudly leading a tour of his glassworks for the new audience sassa was not much older than whit and the two young men hit it off so well fawn had no guilt about leaving them to each others company after lunch and retiring with dag back to the hotel forhe saida nap it wasnt a lie she was sure a nap would ensue eventually she became concerned when whit did not show up at the hotel for dinner but dag sensibly pointed out that sassa knew perfectly well how to find them here if there were any emergencies to report and fawn relaxed she wondered if she might parlay their two planned nights of rest here into three but dag was of the opinion that the dry spell couldnt last much longer and truly the nights chill breathed of the coming change whit returned so late they were actually sleeping fawn woke muzzily in the dark to hear him clumping around on attempted tiptoe and the creak of his bed as he climbed into it she cuddled back into the warmth of dags grip reassured she was less reassured when she went out to the stable in the frosty dawn to tell the horse boys to have warp and weft ready after breakfastdag would saddle copperhead himselfonly to find the team gone and so she discovered when she checked his room was whit she muffled her panic when she spotted his saddlebags still in a heap by his bed descending the staircase wondering whether to drag out dag and his groundsense for a search she met whit breezing back in through the hotels stableyard door where have you been demanded fawn in some exasperation where are the horses sold em said whit smugly what we still have two days of riding ahead of us i know that ive made arrangements at her look of disbelief he added in a stung tone i sold warp and weft to sassas boss he gave me a fair price i thought you said you were going to try that coal hauler on your way back she added pointedly yeah welli liked the glassworks stable better smelled cleaner yknow plus you have to figurea glass wagon isnt going to race their horses or overload them theyre pretty much bound to travel slow and careful he nodded in satisfaction apparently picturing his team in this gentle labor this appeal could not fail to reach fawn but she raked her fingers through her hair nonetheless yes buthow are we supposed to get to the river load all the bags on copperhead and lead him no dont be stupid i made a deal sassas boss is sending two wagonloads of glass goods down to the river crossing for the silver shoals trade i get to help drive and load and unload and you get to ride for free dag can tag alongside on copperhead fawn hesitated in new confusion soare you going to come back and work as a teamster for the glassworks or what whit shrugged they have fellows for that i dont know but anyway you and dag have to hurry up the wagons are all loaded and about ready to leave they want to catch the light with the days shortening and so fawn found herself hustled through what shed planned as a leisurely breakfast and forced to make hasty farewells to all the folks at the hotel dag old patroller that he was adjusted to the surprise departure without effort though he did refuse to be hurried shaving the extra bags were only piled across copperheads saddle long enough to lead him down into town the wellsprung freight wagon with fawn clinging atop a pile of strawstuffed slat boxes headed south out of glassforge before the morning sun had melted last nights frost from the weeds lining the ditches they passed the sandpit where men were digging the fine white sand that was the basis of the towns famous industry from the loads being hauled away fawn guessed warp and weft might have some heavier work to do than delivering finished glass though for the moment they were hitched on as wheelers to this very wagonon trial she suspected was whit on trial for future employment too the lead wagon of their little train was being driven by a grizzled fellow named mape setting as decorous a pace as whit had envisioned but which made her wonder just how long it was going to take them to reach the ferry he had a skinny youth up beside him hod who seemed to be there to help with the horses and load and unload like whit their own team of four was handled by a comfortably middleaged man named tanner who fawn soon learned was a somethingcousin of the owners of the glassworks and who had a wife and children back in glassforge whits questions about the glass business got them over any mutual shyness pretty quick fawn edged forward to listen dag rode nearby so quiet and selfcontained you might not notice he was listening too when whit paused tanner with a glance over his shoulder at her took a little breath and asked her about the malice she and dag had slain this summer fawn blinked first at the realization that his question had been hovering on his tongue for a while and had taken him some effort to spit out and then at the oddity of anyone having to work up courage to talk to her but she answered him steadily giving him the simplified version including after a brief look to dag an equally simplified version of how sharing knives worked this parted tanners lips and sent his brows halfway to his hairline he glanced aside at dag but shied from speaking to him directly whit chimed in with a vivid description of the blight and a recommendation amounting to a sales pitch to visit it i guess i should said tanner shaking his head in wonder i didnt have family directly involved with that mess the way poor sassa was caught up but id heard a lot about itexcept the very center it all makes more sense now hope you dont mind i didnt like to ask you about it in front of mape up therehe nodded toward the back of the grizzled teamster safely out of earshot through both distance and the wagons rumblingon account of he lost his wifes nephew in the ruckus and has feelins im sorry said fawn was he groundripped like inquired whit morbidly curious tanner looked grim i think that would have been easier all told he was one of the ones took up by the bandits and pressed into their gang it was a bad time after sorting out who was really a bandit and who was tranced by the blight bogle in the end it was locals got pardoned and strangers got hanged mostly which i dont think was always right but mapes nephew was killed outright by the lakewalker patrollers in the fight when they caught up with the bandits which maybe saved the family a hangin but im not sure mapes wife sees it that way oh said whit fawn swallowed was he a sort of dunblond boy no darkhaired fawn let out her breath in secret relief not the one dag had shot in front of her then saving him from a hanging for sure dag riding alongside had gone quietquieterand expressionless and it occurred to her that maybe her assailant wasnt the only one whose evil career dag had personally ended on that patrol he had been in on the attack on the bandit camp the night before she knew which was how hed happened to be trailing her kidnappers in the first place hed run low on arrows some must have found targets thanks for the warning she said to tanner i shouldnt like to step on anyones feelings he nodded cordially enough glancing at the skinny youth beside mape riding along with his back rounded and his hands dangling between his knees she added so what about hod was he caught up in it all no he was way too much of a homebody after a long pause tanner added hods a bit of a sad sack if you want my opinion he was an orphan living with his older sister till her husband threw him out not long back for laziness andhe saidthievin sassa clay took a pity on him and let him put up in the glassworks stable to look after the hosses which he does do middlinwell i admit despite us finding him sleeping in the straw half the time will he work up to driver asked fawn wondering if this was whits competition for the coveted job hard to say hes not real bright mape wouldnt let him touch the reins of his team for sure tanner lowered his voice im not sayin the boys vicious mind but its true about the thievin ive seen him sneaking only food so far missus clay slips him extra scraps now and then but it doesnt seem to have stopped him im afraid hes gonna work up to something bigger someday soon and get into real trouble so umwatch your bags did tanner mean for their sakes or for hods it was hard to tell truly when they all stopped for lunch and to water and bait the horses it seemed to fawn that the lanky youth had little going for him hods dishwater hair was dull and limp and in need of a cut his skin was bad his teeth doubtful and he moved in a habitual slouch he was inarticulate to the point of muteness her couple of attempts to say a friendly word to him threw him into complete confusion he seemed outright afraid of dag and went wide around him fawn wasnt even sure if hod was his real name whit was taken aback when he made the discovery that grub was not provided for the drivers and loaders but that they were expected to bring their own a little detail of planning that had evidently escaped his noticeand fawns too in the mornings hustle dag let them both flounder and recriminate for a bit before blandly fetching the provisions from his saddlebags that hed had sal pack up while he was shaving he wasnt too dry about it but he did wait and make whit ask humbly for a share before portioning it out just enough of a dig fawn thought to make certain that neither of them were like to make a similar mistake again dag enjoyed watching fawn and whit take in the scenes south of glassforge on a road new to them both if old to dag he hadnt ridden this particular stretch for several years though whit kept asking if the craggy little hills cloaked in color that now rose on both sides of them were mountains yet and dag had to keep disillusioning him although dags personal definition of a mountain was anything high enough to kill you if you fell off it and thus covered any precipice from ten to a thousand feet high so he supposed these ruckedup slopes aspired to the name the land grew less settled as it pinched more sharply and the hamlets clinging to the straight road fell farther apart darkness overtook them several miles short of the village that was the teamsters usual stopping point on this route a mishap that the one called mape blamed grumblingly on their late start but which the more tolerant tanner chalked up to the shortening of the daylight everyone pulled out their dinner packets and drank from the roadside spring that had prompted the halt while the two men debated whether to rest the horses and continue on slowlymore slowlyby lantern light or stop here and sleep under the wagons no rain threatened but the chill creeping from the hollows pushed consensus toward the lantern scheme whit blithely volunteered dag to ride ahead with a lantern suspended from his hook a suggestion that made fawn grimace the prospect of combining a burning and maybe drippy oil lantern with a cranky copperhead tired and bored from the days plod made dag say merely ill think about it dag walked around the spring stretched his back and sat down against a buckeye tree extending both his legs and his groundsense hed kept closed all day in the presence of strangers and their chaotic farmer grounds his reach was out to two hundred paces tonight maybe he still felt halfblinded after pulling off coppers bridle and loosening the girth dag had turned him loose to browse under light ground contact in the deepening shadows dag could better hear the ripping and munching than see with his eyes but in his groundsense the gelding was an old familiar brightness almost brighter than the boy hod hod had gone to relieve himself up in the bushes and was now circling back keeping to the shadows easing up toward copperhead dag came alert though he did not open his eyes was the dimwitted boy contemplating a little attempted filching dag considered his responsibilities hod was no young patroller of dags still if the boy was to learn a sharp lesson not to go riffling in a lakewalkers saddlebags it might be better all around to be sooner than later with dag and not with another it would doubtless be an embarrassing scene but it might save hod much worse later on dag withdrew his ground contact from copperhead and settled back to let nature take its course dag was expecting copperheads angry squeal headsnake and cowkick he wasnt expecting the ugly thunk or a scream of pain so loud sharp and prolonged blight it what he yanked his groundsense wide then recoiled as the hot flush of injury swamped back in on him drawing breath he wallowed to his feet the two teamsters pelted past him with whit on their heels crying warning for them to swing wide around the horse who was snorting and backing fawn followed having had the sense to pause and grab a lantern trying not to limp on his right leg dag stumbled after hod was lying on the ground on his back writhing from side to side clutching and clawing at his leg and openly bawling his face was screwed up in pain mottled red and pale and popping out cold sweat and no wonder by whatever evil chance copperheads shod hoof had scored a direct hit on the boys right kneecap shattering the bone and pulping the flesh behind it blight it blight it blight it tanner gasped what happened dag said horse kicked him when he went to poke in my bags for grub which won him a sharp look upwards from fawnyou knew they would deal with that aspect later dag surged forward to find himself blocked by the grayhaired and very solid mape dont you touch him lakewalker whit and tanner knelt by hod trying unsuccessfully to soothe and still him as he beat his fists on the ground and howled dag unclenched his jaw and said to mape i have some skills in field aid let him through cried fawn at the same moment as whit called dag help reluctantly mape gave way fawn get a fire going for heat and light dag instructed tersely well need both she skittered off wordlessly dag knelt by hods right knee and let both hands real and sputteringghostly hover over it absent gods i shouldnt be attempting this a quick ground match to slow the internal bleedingthe joint was already swollen tight against the fabric of hods trousersto dull the blazing nervesdags right knee screamed in sympathy he gritted his teeth and ignored the groundecho hod stopped howling and just gasped staring up wildeyed at dag in a few minutes that seemed much longer the men had hod laid out on a blanket and his trousers off an operation he tried to resist and that made him cry some more though whether from pain or shame dag was not sure he apparently owned no underdrawers tanner dropped a blanket over his nether parts all four wagonlanterns and the new fire bless fawn laid golden light on the unpleasant sight of the ruined joint bulging mottled and already dark with blood beneath the shiny skin shards of bone pressed against the skin from the inside and each of hods shudders threatened to push one through can you do anything lakewalker asked tanner course he can asserted whit valiantly ive seen him mend broken glass this is bad said dag the kneecaps floating in about six pieces and one tendon is nearly torn through this needs a lot more than splinting and rest i shouldnt even be thinking about this without another medicine maker to guard me from groundlock or worse theres good reasons they work in pairs forty miles to the closest other lakewalkers tonight down the road to the ferry camp at pearl riffle eighty miles roundtrip not even copperhead could do it even if a real medicine maker would come out for an injured farmer an event so unlikely that it would make some kind of history is he gonna cut off my leg sobbed hod don let him go cuttin on me cant work nobodyll give me money cant go back hopperll beat me again if i go back hopper oh hods tentbrotherbrotherinlaw dag corrected himself some tentbrother hurts wept hod no one doubted him dag said fawn in a small uncertain voice can youdo anything she made a little gesture toward his left arm any groundwork a simple ground reinforcement was not going to be enough here and dag had absent gods knew no prior affinity with this boy the way he did with fawn to give him subtle routes into his body and ground he looked into fawns huge dark scared trusting eyes swallowed and said i can try he settled down crosslegged by hods right knee stretched his back which popped and bent again tanner and mape kneeling on either side of the boy looked at him fearfully how hard should we hold him down asked tanner and should he have a leather strap to bite asked mape this isnt some farmer bonesetters bloody amputation blight it dag shook his head it doesnt work like that if it was going to work at all that is he brought his right hand and leftthe sight of his useless hook suddenly irritated him immensely and he undid the straps of its harness and cast it aside try again right hand hovering over leftstump come on come on you blighted ghost thing come out get in there hod was whimpering staring up at him in overwhelming horror his terror beat on dag in hot waves i have to open to this ungodly mess of a child one breath two threehods breath slowed and dags sped until their chests rose and fell in synchrony right hand over left stroking coaxingand then it was there invisible ground projection sinking down slowly past hods skin into the broken flesh and its swirling agitated ground dag grasped the ground of the shattered bone fragments his fleshly hand darted to the uninjured knee to test and trace the song of its wholeness like that just like that sing it so dag began a low humming under his breath far from musical but he could feel the power in it fragments shifted moved beneath the tight skin this was nothing like so simple as welding a glass bowl back together amorphous and uniform these structures hid more structures inside them going down and down and in and in but this little edge might hook again to that that to the other this torn blood vessel find its mated end and gently so delicately kiss and make up minute after minute fragment after fragment his groundsense was wholly concentrated on the puzzle before him the world outside both their skins could have cracked open wide with the roar of a thousand thunders and dag would not have noticed this vessel and that splinter and that one and that onethis was why medicine makers worked with partners for deep healing somebody anchored outside had to be able to break into the fascination lest you keep spiraling down and in and down and in and not ever come up and out again i cant do it all i have to stop before i spend myself broke patch and tie and let it heal the rest of the way itselfeven real medicine makers do it that way get out old patroller while you still can hed thought nothing could be harder than matching his ground with hods until he came to unmatch it again he sensed hods chest rise and deliberately broke the rhythm of his breath with the boys let go old patroller get out of here before you hurt your fool self let go he blinked his eyes open on firelight and lantern light and knew himself sinfully lucky not to be groundlocked i overdid it oh i sure did dag drew a long long breath and awareness of his own body returned to him at last unfortunately except that fawn had three blankets wrapped around his shoulders before the second shuddering shiver shook him and a basin thrust in his lap before his stomach heaved and a cup of hot water held steadily to lips like cold clay he took several grateful gulps only spilling a little in his aguelike shakes the hot liquid met his ascending dinner and forced it back down and his stomach didnt try again guh said dag dont try to talk said fawn and explained over her shoulder to someone this happened the last time he goes all cold and sick for a while but then he comes out of it her worried eyes added to him i hope dag found his voice at last and mumbled fawn whit find two strong slats and some ties of some kind cloth strips or whatever make hod splints down each side of his leg like a bonesetters tie above and below the knee firm but not tight keep it straight and still its still going to be swollen up and it has a lot of mending yet to do on its own blankets something get him warm keep him warm he cant walk on it yet hes going to walk said someone in a voice caught between awe and disbelief not tonight hes not and hed better be carried to the wagon in the morning he can use my stick later on i guess but not tomorrow because dag was going to need it himselfhe leaned toward the blurred flickering orange light and added plaintively more heat logs dropped onto the flames which spewed sparks and danced higher so some delinquent god had heard his prayer apparently it was about ten minutes before he stopped shivering should you lie down asked fawn anxiously kneeling beside him eat a bite more dag shook his head not yet not done theres something else wrong i felt it when i was in there her brows drew in but she said nothing as dag leaned forward and pulled the blanket a little down from hods belly the boys eyes widened and he made a slight whimpering noise but kept his hands clenched to his sides dag let his stump circle above the taut skin justthere did copper kick him in the belly too asked fawn i dont see any mark dag gave another brief headshake no older trouble the boys carrying a nasty monster of a tapeworm inside him there fawn recoiled making an appalled face eew dag had dealt with mosquitoes bedbugs and lice but the closest thing to an internal parasite hed routed routinely was chiggers all could be repelled with mere persuasion or an even simpler bounce they were nothing like this its got quite a grip in there he eyed hod you boy have you been having crampy bellyaches hod nodded fearfully then looked around as if afraid to have admitted anything tanner and mape had wandered near and stood watching and listening yeah said dag and bleeding you bleed when you crap sometimes another reluctant nod ever tell anyone hod shook his head more vigorously why not a long silence dunno scared dag asked more gently reluctant pause nod and a whisper whod i tell anyways dags brows twitched up hungry all the time even with plenty of food to eat weak and tired bleedingyknow it doesnt take a lakewalker medicine maker to diagnose a tapeworm it just takes someone noticin not shiftless said fawn starving tanner looked a bit sick and mape curiously looked even sicker dags arm circled again from the signs id guess hes been feeding this pet for a year or more how long have you been feeling poorly hod hod shrugged i always feel poorly but usually its my nose bellys been aching off and on since this time last year i guess uhhuh said dag can you get rid of it asked fawn oh please its so horrid maybe give me a minute to think groundripping the vile thing was right out it was much larger than any mosquito and besides just the idea of taking in tapewormground was revolting even if his own ground would convert it eventually dag essayed a trifle of persuasion to no effect the worm was not normally mobile besides you wouldnt just want it out youd want it safely dead to keep it from spreading so if smoothing and reinforcing disrupted ground caused flesh to heal disrupting ground might the blighted thing was large compared to its constricted intestinal world but in absolute terms small just a tiny ground disruption squeeze it roll it twist itturn it inside outthere he felt the head of the creature pop and a spurt of blood from its anchorage as it tore away he pinched off the little vessels in hods gut aiding the wound to clot then recaptured the thin wormbody and went right down the line to destroy each segment in a weird way it felt a bit like spinning thread with his groundhand inside someone elses bodyi dont think i want to think about what im doing here but the worm was dying and he managed to keep its roiling writhing ground from sticking to his own hod made a wary noise and his hands twitched fawn caught one to keep it at his side and gave him a big happy reassuring smile whit bit his lip possibly on a bark of laughter but hod offered a confused halfsmile to fawn in return as who could help doing so and made no further move to fight off dag done dag whispered at last and sat up folding his left arm inside his right his exhausted ground projection petered out as if his ghost hand were evaporating into mist into nothing absent gods i feel sick his groundsense range seemed down to ten paces or maybe ten inches but at least he hadnt groundlocked himself to the blighted worm count your blessings one next time he would hold out for a medicine shop and some simple dose of vermifuge a course of treatment he suspected even a lakewalker medicine maker would prefer dag had a vague notion that senior makers saved their costly groundsetting skills for serious dangers like tumors more than ever he regretted turning down hoharies offer of real makers training then hed know what to do instead of having to blunder around by guess but hoharied had no use for his farmer bride blood over the dam tanner and whit settled hod for the night dag dragged his bedroll around to the other side of the fire away from the sight of his unappetizing patient victim whatever he wouldve liked to retreat farther than that but hated to give up the heat hod exhausted by the shock and limp from the passing of his pain dropped to sleep fairly soon dag equally exhausted did not while fawn tanner and whit went off to see to the horses mape came and squatted on his haunches beside dags bedroll after a while he said i never guessed he was sick just thought he was lazy i didnt catch on either at first dag had been led down a false trail by tanners talk yes but hed only to open his groundsense to learn better i beat him couple o times when i caught him sleeping on the job mape added his voice was low flat expressionless suited for things confided in the dark where no one could see im just sayin thankee lakewalker the knee should be good with a couple of weeks of rest the other youll start to see a difference in a couple of days im guessing dag could leave it at that it was tempting oh blight it i was cleaning up my own mess i saw him sneak out to my bags thought id just let copperhead teach him a lesson instead i got taught cant say as i enjoyed it no agreed mape me neither he nodded rose not friendly exactly butacknowledging that at least he trod away into the dark when fawn finally came to lie down dag tucked her into the curl of his body like one of the clothwrapped hot stones she sometimes used for pain he held her hard it helped in the morning hod was laid in his bedroll in the back of mapes wagon and whit took hods place as brakeman fawn sat up beside tanner dag too moved his bedroll saddle and bags to the back of the second wagon and continued his liedown copperhead unnaturally subdued clopped loose behind but fawn supposed dag had the gelding back under his mysterious groundsensetie dag appeared to doze in the sun but he was not asleep it reminded fawn uncomfortably of that deep drained fatigue that had overcome him after greenspring the glassforge teamsters seemed to think little of it but whit familiar with dags usual restless energy cast more than a few concerned looks over his shoulder as they rumbled down the road whit took over helping with hod during their stops at least hod still didnt say much but his gaze followed dag around in something between worry and fascination tanner and mape were kinder to him which served only to confuse him as though kindness were a baited trap into which he feared to fall dag was quiet all day they put up for the night in a barn let by a roadside farm to travelers and their beastsno hotel but warmer and more sheltered than last nights uncomfortable sleep on the ground the next morning fawn was relieved when dag seemed enough himself to climb back up on copperhead for the last leg of the journey noon found the teams plodding up a long slope along a wooded ridge dag edged copperhead alongside the wagon and said to fawn climb on he had that elusive smile he wore when he looked forward to surprising her so she stood up balanced herself and swung her leg over behind dag when shed adjusted to a secure perch he let copperhead roll out in his long patrol walk and they pulled ahead as though the wagons had parked at the top of the ridge he let her slide down and swung after her walking backward he took her by the hand and brought her to the lip of the road the valley of the grace spread out below them in the goldblue autumn light the river seemed to have put on her party dress her banks and bending hillsides a swirl of color scarlet and purplered glowing yellow bright brown the water reflected the azure of the sky save where it broke into a sparkling shoal necklace to the dress brooches of boats slid upon the watera distant keel a broad blunt ferrywith a girdle of flatboats pulled up along the farther shore fawn was dimly aware of whit trotting up panting to see whatever there was to see she was more aware of dag watching her face she wasnt sure if he was seeing just the river valley reflected there or something more but his mouth softened in an ease that handed her joy back to her to be passed back to him again redoubled oh said whit in a voice the like of which shed never heard come out of him before she glanced up startled to watch his lips part his mouth grow round wonder she thought though you could well mistake it for a man punched in the stomach lookit those boats lookit he went on though she was fairly sure hed forgotten there was anyone listening thats one big river even half dry its bigger than any river i ever seen its like a road a great grand road running from mystery abovehe turned with the rivers curve like a man dancing twirling with his ladyinto mystery below its like its likeits like the best road ever he blinked rapidly his eyes were shining no not shining wet back aboard copperhead dag rode close to the second wagon as they made the turn at the top of the ridge and started down the road into the valley fawn beside tanner sat bolt upright and earnestly alert ready to work the wheelbrake at the teamsters word in the front wagon whit had his head cranked sideways goggling at the river dags eye followed his gaze half a mile upstream on this side pearl riffle camp was just visible amongst the thinning leaves a scattering of tentroofsfawn would have called them cabins dag supposedalong the wooded hillside opposite the lakewalker camp below the mouth of a creek lay possum landing the level stretch of shore where the ferry put in and where cargoes were traditionally transferred from the old straight road to the river or vice versa there were more farmer houses clustered upslope from the landing than the last time dag had ridden through here and more sheds for storing goods eight flatboats and a keel were presently tied to the trees along the muddy bank on that side waiting for a rise in the water level to dare the shoals below a good selection though if the water rose suddenly from some big storm upriver they could all be underway in an hour but the water was still falling judging from both the width of the mud margin and the fact that a couple of the flatboats tied imprudently too close to the bank now had their bows stuck in the drying mire even the wharf boat was halfgrounded dag turned in his saddle to look over his shoulder half a mile below the glittering shoals on this side where the river again curved out of sight was the farmer hamlet of pearl bend which also boasted a wharf boat serving the crossing as it made sense to offload heavy cargo before hauling a boat up over the riffle or wait to load on till after successfully negotiating the hazard coming down the glassforge men would take the bulk of their goods there pearl bend too boasted more roofs than dag remembered practically a village now dag turned back to find the cautious glassmen pulling their wagons to a halt at a wide space in the road huddling toward the hillside a troop of riders was coming up the slope double filea lakewalker patrol outbound from pearl riffle camp likely a dozen and some men maybe half that many women a normal complement dag drew copperhead in behind tanners wagon and squinted down the track he fought an impulse to open his crippled groundsense wide closing it down instead he could look with his eyes well enough outbound for certain dag decided as first patrollers drew level with the wagons and fell into single file to pass they appeared far too rested and tidy to be anything else he suppressed a company captains inventory of the condition of every horse rider and weapon approaching not his job anymore the patrol leader who had barely glanced at the wagons looked up as he spotted dag and urged his mount forward dag opened his groundsense just enough to keep copperhead polite as the strange horse loomed near courier demanded the patrol leader a spare middleaged fellow with a shrewd eye because why else would a lakewalker be riding alone and if the news dag bore was bad perhaps this patrol was about to acquire a more urgent task than their routine search patterns his mind would not connect dag in lakewalker gear on what was obviously a patrol horse with the party of farmers that his patrol was rounding dag touched his hand to his temple in a courteous salute but said no sir just travelin through the patrol leaders shoulders eased in relief any news from the north he meant patrol news lakewalker news all was quiet when i passed through glassforge three days back the leader nodded he looked as if hed like to pause for fuller gossip but the last rider cleared the obstructing wagons and kicked her horse into a trot to take up her place in the reforming double file he contented himself with a return salute and a travel safely then you too good hunting an acknowledging grimace and he trotted after the others dag took back his place as fawns outrider as the two wagons creaked into motion again fawn twisted around in her seat to watch the departing patrol turned back and glanced across at dag concern shone in her big brown eyes though for what cause dag was uncertain tanner too cast a curious look over his shoulder so all those lakewalkers are going off to hunt for blight bogles are they with their their groundsenses yes said dag pearl riffle camp doesnt cover as big a territory as hickory lakethats my was my home camp hickory has eight nine thousand folks the biggest camp in oleana doubt pearl riffle has eight or nine hundred they can field maybe two or three patrols barely a company but their more important task is right here keeping the ferry crossing open in case of need if the glassforge malice had gotten out of handmore out of handwe might have called on lakewalker camps from south of the grace to help out or the other way around if they ran into trouble down there the way hickory lake sent dags company west to fight the malice that came up in raintree couple of months back put in fawn for tanners sake and at tanners next question went on to give him an accurate summary of the summers campaign if sketched in broad strokes and all in terms a farmer might readily grasp because after all fawn was one which drew braver questions from the teamster in turn dag listened in grateful silence backing her with an occasional nod this fruitful exchange lasted till the wagons reached the bottom of the long slope and turned across the narrow floodplain toward the river when they reached the crossroads dag said fawn do you think youd be all right staying with whit for a little id like to pay a visit he jerked his head upstream sure this is the camp where saun and reela stayed right the two were fellow patrollers injured in the glassforge fight sent down here as the closest place to convalesce saun had been dags own partner fawn had made friends of a sort with reela laid up in the hotel afterwards with a broken leg yes dag answered do you have friends here or k she cut short the last word kin well im not sure he said passing over her little stammer its been a while since i was down this way thought id go check which was not exactly the reason for his detour but he was reluctant to discuss the real one in front of tanner especially as dag himself was doubtful of the result ill find you two after my errand might be a while stay by whit right dag i dont need my brother to guard me every minute who said it was you i thought needs a keeper she dimpled taking this in he cast her a return wink possibly more cheerfullooking than he felt the wagons turned right onto the downstream road toward pearl bend dag wheeled copperhead around and trotted in the opposite direction across a shallow run and over a rise he came to the camps perimeter and let his groundsense ease open just a hair to present himself to the gate guard if any he felt an inquiring doubleflick in return and raised his eyes to spot not one but a pair of lakewalkers lingering on a couple of stumps flanking the road an older man was whittling pegs a mornings worth lay piled haphazardly at his feet and dags nostrils flared with the pleasant tang of new shavings a young woman worked on weaving willowwithy baskets but a bow and quiver leaned against a rock within easy reach patrollers both on light camp duty dag drew up copperhead and nodded how de the man stood good day to youa slight hesitation as he looked dag up and downpatroller an anxious look crossed his face courier are you no sir just stopping by i was hoping you could tell me where to find your camp captain and whos holding that post these days the young woman frowned at his hook wrapped with copperheads reins and he lowered it a trifle the man directed dag to look for amma osprey in the third tent to the left past the split oak tree and dag not lingering to get tangled in talk pressed copperhead on a last curious groundflick touched him pass friend both ease and anxiety knotted in him as he rode by the familiar domestic sights of a lakewalker camp tents peeked through trees the traditional log structures with hide awnings rolled up on their fourth open sides mostly looking southwest to the river stands of fruit trees beehives homely washing on lines smoke rising from chimneys the smells of cooking and preserving from a distance a less pleasant whiff of tanning hides half a dozen blackandwhite speckled chickens squawked and fluttered across copperheads path and the horse tossed his head and snorted downslope near the shore a couple of men were building a goodsized narrow boat on a rack hammering in pegs twentyfive feet long doubleprowed broad in the middle clearly meant for the river tradeits boards looked millsawn a few of the newer tentcabins too were built of such planks the farmers at pearl bend or possum landing must have put in a sawmill on one of the feeder creeks dag spotted patrol headquarters by the array of hitching posts in front and the lack of washing and cooksmoke the foursided cabin had glassforge glass windows presently hooked open on what had to be one of the last warm days of the season dag dismounted tied copperhead and let his groundsense dart out once more two folks inside right now both groundclosed a womans voice sharp drifted out the open windows if we upped and moved the camp and the ferry a mile upriverbetter five mileswe wouldnt have these blighted clashes and lose the rest of the business from the straight road to the bends new ferry were hurting already returned another woman with a rougher warmer voice not young let it go we dont need a wagon road for our patrols and pack trains amma threefourths of the camps coin comes from farmers using our ferry and flows right back to them everything from flour to horseshoe nails comes from the bend goodssheds these days as it should not proves my point id say a glum silence fell when it remained unbroken dag stepped up onto the wooden porch and knocked furling his groundsense more tightly around him is that you verel the first voice called come on in when are you going to let those twoah a tough tall strongly built older woman one haunch halfup on a plank table wheeled as dag ducked through the door and touched his hand to his temple in polite greeting he had no trouble identifying her as the camps patrol captain given her riding trousers worn leather vest long steel knife at her belt and harassed look the cabin held the usual headquarters clutter of strewn gear with maps and record books stuffed on overflowing shelves the other woman of like age but rather plumper and wearing skirts might be some clan head she seemed to bear herself with scarcely less authority now what said the camp captain in a voice of accumulated exasperation her lips began to shape the next query not a courier maam dag hastened to reassure her and she let the word fall unvoiced with a relieved nod im just passing through m names dag bluefield this won blank looks from both women bluefield was not a lakewalker name nor had dag claimed a camp of origin before they could pry into this oddity he hurried on i came about a sharing knife but i could come back later a look of inexplicable enlightenment crossed the camp captains face oh no if you witnessed anything i definitely want it now take a seat well be starting soon she waved to a bench along the back wall sorry i thought you were our medicine maker out there they were at some crosspurpose it seemed but before dag could open his mouth to uncross them the other woman peered out the window and said ah here they come absent gods what a sick and sorry pair they look theyre going to be a lot sicker and sorrier when im done with em amma osprey ran a stray strand of gray hair escaped from the braid at her nape back over her ear then folded her arms and her lips equally tightly as the door opened two young men limped through one was shorter tawnyhaired and sturdy with muscle but his right hand was bandaged and his arm rested in a sling his fair square face was bruised his shirt was clean and didnt quite fit himborrowed but his trousers were spattered with dried blood he walked decidedly bent over the one who followed was taller brownhaired maybe a bit older than his companion though still very young to dags eyes his face was even more bruised one eye swollen shut lower lip twice its proper size beneath his torn shirt his ribs were wrapped in cloth strips chicken tracks of black stitches marched up two long cuts on his left arm his knuckles were swollen and scabbed though he gingerly helped himself along with a stick in his right hand two patrollers whod lost a fight last night obviously to each other they collected equally cold and silent glowers from the two women as they shuffled into line the tawny youth made one attempt at a winning smile wilting swiftly as the scowls deepened dag squinted in curiosity he really ought to excuse himself and go instead he sank back on his bench like a hunter lying up in tall grass silent and unnoticeable amma osprey began curtly not the least of your offenses is that i had to pull two of your comrades off their camp leaves this morning to take your places in patrol you can remember to apologize to them too when they get back dag had done that in his time cut his camp rest short in order to fill in for a sick or injured or bereaved patroller the dark one looked if possible more hangdog but the tawny one raised his bruised face and began but we didnt start it we were just the camp captain held up a quelling hand youll have your say in a moment barr i promise you it sounded more threat than promise in any case the tawny youth subsided steps sounded on the wooden porch and the door swung open once more a broadshouldered woman stepped through nodded to the other two and scowled at the youths by the yellow leather gloves stuck in her belt and the thicksoled boots on her feet dag identified her as a ferrywoman by her age and stride likely the boat boss she pulled a lumpy cloth from her belt and said i found this piece up in the woods back of possum landing this morning oh good said the camp captain remo do you have the rest the dark youth hitched around and pulled another lumpy cloth from his shirt reluctantly handing it over to his captain she slid off the table and laid open both scraps dag was disturbed to see the pieces of a broken sharing knife carved from pale bone such a knife was supposed to break when it released its burden of mortality into the ground of a malice but dag already had an uncomfortable suspicion that there had been no malice involved or these two patrollers would be in much better odor this afternoon amma osprey swiftly aligned the shards thats got it all issi she reported the ferrywoman nodded satisfaction the dark youth remo let out a faint breath now we have a council quorum said the skirted woman the three exchanged nods and settled two in chairs amma hitched up on the edge of the table again the two young patrollers were not invited to sit all right said the camp captain grimly to the pair start explaining how did this get started the two exchanged unhappy looks remo of the swollen mouth waved a purpling hand at his companion and said oo ell m arr barr gulped and began it was a good deed blight it it really got started when that last coal flat tried to take the riffle when the waterd got too low ten days back and tore out its bottom and dumped its load for half a mile down the shoals remo and i took out a narrow boat to pick off some of the crew that had got themselves hung up in the white water and the cottonwood wrack probably saved three flatties from drowning anyway they seemed to think so we hauled em into the tavern at pearl bend looking sorry as wet rats got them all dried out on the outside anyway at least they bought us drinks seeing as everyone was saved they were all in a mood to celebrate except maybe the boat boss whod lost his cargo so some of the keelers whod helped out and the flatties started some games you know you are not to play games of chance with farmers said amma osprey in a dangerous voice because lakewalkers were inevitably accused of sorcerous cheating in such situations although only if they had the ill luck or poor judgment to actually win ee idnt protested remo it was arm wrestling said barr with a couple of the keelers and despite what they claimed we didnt cheatthough i could have blight it the peculiar indignation of the accused notquiteguilty livened his voice and dag still quiet on his bench by the wall suppressed an upward mouth twitch it made me so mad barr went on so i told them it was true but they could protect themselves from evil lakewalker influences with metal helmets like what you see the soldiers of the old lake league wearing in the broken statues which was what those helmets had been for see and they bought it by the next afternoon we had half the flatties up at possum landing walking around with their cook pots and wash bowls stuck on their heads it was it washe struggled for a moment eyes brightening in defiant memoryit was glorious his jaw set then slacked instantly as he winced and rubbed its bruises so thats where that fool nonsense came from cried the ferry boss issi in a voice that shook in a good imitation of anger she turned away from the truants and rubbed her face till the betraying laugh lines were smoothed back out dag who could just picture a herd of naive lakewalkerfearing flatboat crews wandering about the landing in their clanking makeshift helmets laid his palm hard over his jaw and kept listening oh to have been here last week i was just balancing the scales a bit barr continued you know what we do for those stupid farmers and how little thanks we get in return and it wasnt hurting anyone till your crew told them it was all a fiddle the ferry boss sighed it took my girls near three days to talk them out of it even then some of them refused to give up their headgear she added reflectively the rest were plenty mad though the possum folks and the older flatties gave em a ripe ribbing for it all captain osprey pinched the bridge of her nose despite all that i suppose it would have all passed downstream harmlessly at the next rise if you two unaccountable fools hadnt gone over there last night and stirred them up again why i was baited barr admitted in a surly voice tol yuh his partner muttered rolling his good eye how demanded the patrol captain an even more surly silence the ferry boss put in ive already heard one version of it over at the landing this morning barr wed better have yours barr hunched remo mumbled tell t truth blighdit cant be worse fr you thn fr me barr hunched lower with a voice that seemed to come from somewhere around his knees he said a flatboat girl invited me to meet her in the woods back of the landing amma osprey broke the chill silence that followed this with when and where did this invitation take place down at the bend wharf boat yesterday afternoon he looked up indignantly into the thick disapproval that now blanketed the room she seemed all excited i didnt think she was lying well you know how those farmer girls throw themselves at patrollers sometimes youre supposed to throw them back said the skirted woman in a grim voice tol yuh it was a setup said remo with a black stare at his partner he said no it was too obvius barr turned redder around his livid bruises i didnt ask you to come yr muh partner im supposed t watch yr back barr took a long breath then let half of it out with his protest unvoiced six of the flatties jumped me in the dark i wasnt carrying any weapon neither was remo the flatties just had fists and sticks at first then when remo piled in to help me and things started to turn back our way one of the flatties pulled a knife on us remo had to use his knife to defend himself it was the only thing we had except for our bare arms you drew a primed sharing knife in a common brawl amma ospreys voice was flatter than winter ice and colder and harder wisht d just used muh arms mumbled remo and lower more despairing or muh neck it was all becoming clear to dag and he almost wished it werent he eyed the pale bone shards laid accusingly on the plank table his heart ached for these two young fools he curled his right arm around himself and waited for the rest and now we come to it said amma why were you wearing your sharing knife at all last night when you knew you werent to go out on patrol till today remos face set in an agony that had nothing to do with its bruises iit was new id jus been given it i was trying t get used to it the picture was plain dag knew exactly how excited and proud a young patroller entrusted with a first primed knife would be a pride sobered frequently with personal grief and the heartdeep determination to be worthy of such mortal trust ow ow behind their stern facades he thought the three women shared his pang and then those blighted flatties those blighted farmers broke it to pieces barr went on remembered rage flaring in his voice and then we both well we both went after them fullout i dont even remember getting this he touched his smashed hand and they broke and ran off some of them are still running for all i know dag could picture that too rage and outrage and appalling guilt boiling up to a loss of control as terrifying perhaps for its sufferers as their victims a patroller should never lose control especially not around farmers it was ingrained if sometimes not deeply enough because when such control failed everyone was subject to the frightened farmer backlash your greatgrandmother grayjay didnt share early for this fate said the skirted woman she might have had months yet except that she feared passing in her sleep remos face went from red to white beneath his bruises i know his groundveiling was held so tight his body was shaking as if with physical effort i was going to take the pieces to your parents but i think you should remos eyes closed yes maam he whispered deadvoiced barr was very quiet amma osprey gestured at dag you sir i gather you were at possum landing you have any information to add to all this issi stared at the newcomer she must know he hadnt crossed north over the river by the ferry since last night squinting at his arm harness she asked do i know you patroller dag cleared his throat uncomfortably and rose my apologies captain osprey i actually just rode down from glassforge i came to ask you about another matter i think this isnt a good time for it though an irate look from the camp captain confirmed this belief but issi snapped her fingers and pointed i have seen you you used to ride with mari redwing of hickory lake youre her nephew arent you yes issi and dags aunt mari could well be nearcontemporaries acquaintances maybe even passing friends who knew yes maam the skirted woman said but he said his name was dag bluefield im lately married maam what kind of name is the skirted woman began the two young patrollers looked wildly at each other barr burst out sir are you dag redwing hickory sauns partner who slew the glassforge malice singleall by himself dag sighed not by myself no oh yesthese two were just the age and sort to have become sauns boon companions in his convalescence here last spring dag winced at the thought of what kind of dagstories saun might have been inspired to tell to alleviate his boredom and entertain his new friends dag could see his hope of anonymity evaporate like morning dew in the heat of those suddenly interested eyes captain osprey blinked rocking back then are you also the same dag redwing who led the hickory lake company to raintree a couple of months ago and took down that horrendous malice they had running wild over there dag set his teeth briefly i was dag bluefield by then maam fairbolt crows report on raintree in the latest patrol circular named a captain dag redwing oh so that was how the word had got around yes there had been time for such official patrol news to have slipped ahead of dag while he was lingering in west blue fairbolt kept up then fairbolt named me wrong at ammas rising brows he offered habit maybe i patrolled under him for eighteen years as dag redwing i was in his company even before he became hickory lakes camp captain eh so what is this other matter dag hesitated amma made an impatient gesture spit it out and get it over with it cant be worse than the rest of my morning dag nodded trying to get over the jolt of having his recent reputation run before him even if some of it was no doubt due to sauns exaggerations but perhaps it would do him some good i left hickory lake on business of my own afteras a result ofthe raintree campaign i expect to travel a lot of territory in the next few months i used my last primed knife on the glassforge malice and havent yet found another you dont have to be on patrol to run across a malicewhen i was riding courier alone up in seagate i once took out a new sessile that might have grown a lot more dangerous before anyone had got back to it with a patrol i made it a rule after that never to walk bare i know sometimes folks leave their primed knives to the patrol generally to outfit patrollers who have none i was wondering if you happened to have any suchhis eye fell uncomfortably on the broken bone knife on the table and avoided remos facespares just now the camp captain crossed her arms why didnt you get one before you left hickory lake then the skirted womans expression seconded the question because hed still been reeling sick and heartsick exhausted not thinking i hadnt yet settled my plans what plans asked amma i figure to take the rivers down to graymouth ride back in the spring after that im not sure i might be able to return the loan then if i dont cross a malice and if he did and used the knife no one would ask for a better fate for it his voice softened i promised my wife id show her the sea the skirted woman touched her lips wait up are you also that same dag redwing who was just banished from hickory lake camp for consorting with some farmer girl dags head shot up i was not banished where did you hear such a lie wellshe waved a handnot banished precisely but the camp council circular didnt make it sound like a happy outcome buying a moment to gather his wits and his temper dag touched his temple and said stiffly you have the advantage of me maam the skirted woman gestured at herself nicie sandwillow pearl riffle camp council leader this season therefore a senior tent head that being the pool from which council members were selected by various sorts of rotations depending on the camp with the patrols camp captain always a permanent member dag wondered if the ferry boss was also a permanent member here it seemed likely making this mornings inquiry doubly efficient serving the patrol and the council at once but it meant that one of nicie sandwillows tasks was to receive and pass along critical council news from around the hinterland of oleana just as captain osprey received patrol news dag said carefully the hickory lake council was deeply divided on my case so there was a charge dag overrode this pakona pike ourhickory lakes council leader this past summerwas not on the side favorable to my arguments but i cant believe shed twist the facts that much no not if the facts are that you came in alone late from a leave dragging some farmer girl with the pair of you wearing lakewalker wedding braids that youd somehow cooked up together claiming she was your wife and not just your whore the letter warns all camp councils to watch out for similar trickery grimly dag rolled up his left sleeve i say theyre valid cords and so did a lot of others including fairbolt crow see for yourself fawn made this one a flicker of grounds touched him felt the spark of fawns live ground in her cord drew back the women looked nonplussed the two sagging young patrollers confused it was like the hearing at hickory lake all over again and dag was bitterly reminded of why hed left and fawn isnt just some farmer girl dag went on growing more heated it was her hand slew the glassforge malice with my knife or i wouldnt be alive now to tell it it was a scramble i admit but i cant believe the tale you had was this distorted because saun knew the truth of it and so did reela hm amma osprey rubbed her chin i believe the scramble part dag bit out this is beside the point do you have a spare knife to lend or not good question dag redwingbluefieldwhoever said amma are you still a patroller or not dag hesitated he could claim to be on the sick list or pretend to be on long leave or disciplinary leave theyd believe that but in the midst of all these aggravating halftruths he refused to lie no i resigned although fairbolt made it clear that if i ever wanted to unresign hed find a place for me and your farmer ah woman asked nicie sandwillow that was the sticking point one of them amma eyed the gaping hurting young patrollers now leaning on each other and looking ready to cave on their feet dag was sorrier than ever for their witness of this because amma would certainly trim her judgment with an eye to making an impression on them at least dag would never have missed such an opportunity when hed been a patrol leader she said such knives are bequeathed in trust for the patrol specifically the pearl riffle patrol i cant very well ask the dead if they want to make an exception as their guardian its my duty to conserve themespecially as they seem to be needed here remo flinched them implying she was not down to her last primed knife she might lend one and still not strip her patrols reserve bare but not to me not today dag had the frustrating sense watching her face set that if hed arrived with the same request yesterday before this trouble with the boatmen had broken out over at possum landing the balance of her decision might well have tipped the other way he let his gaze cross the two miserable miscreants with new disfavor there were other sources other lakewalker camps downriver he would simply have to try again elsewhere i see then ill not take more of your time captain dag touched his hand to his temple and withdrew fifty paces up the slope from the pearl bend wharf boat fawn craned her neck as the wagons halted in front of a plank shed it seemed to be trying to grow into a warehouse by budding addons extending in all directions whit jumped down from the lead wagon to help hod hobble over to a bench against the front wall displacing a couple of idlers that mape after a prudent sobriety check promptly hired to help unload his fragile cargo to fawns surprise they only shifted the top layer of slat boxes from her wagon after that whit climbed up with them and tanner took the reins to turn the rig toward the river where are we going she asked tanner nodded toward the ferryboat tied next to the wharf boat it looked like a barn floor laid out on a barge except for a pole sticking up on one side like a short stubby mast across the river and up past the riffle this load goes upstream from possum landing well dag could doubtless find her even over there fawn went to wefts head to coax her up the broad gangplank which rather resembled a barn door tossed on its side while whit did the same for warp the horses were dubious but at last seemed convinced that it was only some sort of strange bridge and did not disgrace themselves or their former owner by trying to bolt the boredom of the lead pair also helped the stubby mast turned out to be a capstan a thick hemp rope was wound about it a few times high up one end leading to a stout tree up the bank the other supported by a few floats to a similar tree on the other side fawn was a little disappointed not to ride on the famous lakewalker ferry but watched with interest as the two bend ferrymen stuck oak bars into holes on the capstan and started turning it whit equally fascinated volunteered to help and went to work pushing the squeaking post around winding and unwinding the rope and slowly pulling the ferry across the river the water seemed clear and calm to fawns eye but she jumped when a log floating just under the surface thumped into the side and she was reminded that this was no quiet lake working the ferry might not seem so pleasant when the water was high or rough or in rain or cold from out here in the middle the river looked bigger how do the other boats get past the rope she asked tanner watching the big log catch roll under the obstruction right itself and sluggishly proceed the ferrymen have to take it down he said they haul it back and forth across the river with a skiff usually but with the river this low nothings going over the riffle anyways so they just leave it up when the ferry nosed up to the far bank the ferrymen ran out the gangplank on that end she and whit repeated their reassurances to the horses and the rig rumbled safely if noisily onto dry land once more they both clambered up next to tanner as he turned the team onto a rutted track leading upstream fawn sat up in anticipation as they topped a rise and the line of flatboats tied to the trees beyond possum landing came into view they were as unlike the lakewalkers graceful sharpprowed narrow boats as they could be looking like shacks stuck on box crates really ungainly some even had small fireplaces with stone chimneys out of which smoke trickled it was as if someones village had suddenly decided to run off to sea and fawn grinned at the vision of an escaped house waddling away from its astonished owners people ran away from home all the time why shouldnt the reverse be true on one of these she and dag would float all the way to graymouth all running away together maybe her grin faded but even such odd thoughts could not quench her excitement and when tanner brought the wagon to a halt in front of another rambling shedwarehouse she hopped down and told her brother im going to go look at the boats he frowned after her in frustration but stuck with his task as tanner directed him to unlatch the tailboard and start lugging you be careful now whit called more in envy than concern she suspected i wont even be out of sight she just barely kept herself from skipping down to the bank she was a sober married woman now after all and besides it would be a tad cruel to whit deciding which she let herself skip just a little reaching the bank she caught her breath and stared around eagerly there were fewer folks in view than shed expected shed seen some fellows hanging around up at the storage shed others down on the wharf boat which tanner had said doubled as a general store for the riverfolk one or more of the houses in the hamlet still obscured by the halfdenuded trees probably served as taverns maybe some boatmen had gone hunting in the hills to replenish their larders during this enforced delay but a few men were quietly fishing off the backs of their flatboatsone strangely wore an iron kettle over his head like a helmet although fawn could not imagine why perhaps hed lost a bet a group of several men atop one level boat roof had their heads down over some game of chance dice fawn thought although she couldnt see for sure at this angle one looked around to watch her pass and drew breath for what was likely going to be a rude catcall but some turn of the game sent up hoots and a murmur of comment and he turned back a woman came out of the shack on one boat and emptied a pan over the side a reassuring domestic sight fawn strolled along the row looking for likely candidates for their boat some had long topsheds that clearly left no room for a horse others were carrying livestock alreadyone had four oxen stalled on the bow end quietly chewing their cud so the boats could carry big animals but that one was plainly fullup several had chicken coops on top or tucked into a corner and some had dogs though none roused enough from their naps in the sun to bark at her she stopped and studied a likely prospect a fellow sitting on a barrel in the open bow tipped back his floppy hat and grinned in return with what teeth he had do you take passengers she called to him id take you little lady he replied enthusiastically fawn frowned it would be me my husband and his horse he swept off the hat with a flourish revealing greasy hair oh leave the husband and his horse i bet i can give you a better ride if youow he clapped his hand to the side of his head as a small wooden block from seeming nowhere bounced off it with an audible clonk looking up to his left he complained now whatd you go and do that for i was just bein friendly atop the flat roof of the next boat over a figure in homespun skirts sat in a rocking chair whittling as fawn squinted she saw it was a surprisingly young woman almost lanky in build with straight blond hair escaping from a horsetail tied at her nape she had light blue eyes and a wide mouth both pinched with annoyance to remind you to behave your fool self jos she replied tartly now apologize sorry boss berry this won another wooden missile which jos did not dodge quite fast enough ow he repeated to her you nitwit snapped the blond woman jos put his hat back on for the purpose of tugging its brim evidently sorry missmissus he mumbled to fawn he shuffled into his boats shack out of range dolt observed the woman dispassionately fawn strolled on a few paces noting with interest that while joss boat had its hull stuck in the mire berrys moored farther out still floated and it had an empty animal pen in one corner of the bow some chickens were penned on the opposite side pecking up a scattering of corn and their coop didnt stink in the sun unlike a few shed passed someone here cleaned it regularly she put her hands on her hips and stared up at the woman who didnt look to be much older than fawn herself what are you carvin on fawn called up the woman held out a rounded block floats cottonwood makes good floats for ropes and whatnot a lot of softwoods do fawn nodded encouraged by the sociable explanation and an almostsmile that erased the earlier tightness from the womans face she might have just said floats or none of your business sodoes this boat take passengers the blond womangirlrocked forward to eye fawn more closely i hadnt thought to im doing a bit of trading down the river plan a lot of stops itd be a slow ride thats all right were not in a hurry how far down the river are you going im not sure yet can i see inside your boat ive never been on a flatboat fawn smiled up hopefully not a request shed have dared make of the lewdwell wouldbelewdjos she was in luck to find this woman the woman tilted her head then nodded she stuck her whittling knife in a sheath at her belt and dismounted from the roof of the cabin by simply jumping down the five feet ignoring the crude ladder of nailed slats landing with a thump and a spring of her knees she grabbed a long board and ran it out to the bank fawn eyed the narrowness and flex of it dubiously but held her breath and picked her way aboard without falling into the mud she hopped down onto the deck and straightened in exhilaration hi im fawn bluefield the woman bobbed her head she had wide cheekbones but a pointed chin lending an effect like a friendly ferret she was taller than fawnas who was not and even a bit taller than whit likely her fine fair skin was sunburned berry clearcreek im boss of this boat a boat boss was captain or owner or sometimes both fawn guessed both and was impressed and heartened berry stuck out a welcoming hand slim but even more workroughened than fawns fawn clasped and released it smiling what lives in the pen she asked nodding toward it then spotted the droppings in the straw oh a goat our nanny daisy my little brother took her ashore to graze so you have fresh milk and eggs already this boat seemed homey berry nodded some i grew up on a farm up by west blue and at berrys puzzled look added north of lumpton market berry still looked geographically uncertain so fawn added lumptons way up the same river that comes out to the grace near silver shoals berrys face cleared oh the stony fork big sand bar there you know how to milk a goat do you sure hm berry hesitated you can cook too i guess good cook my husband says so the boat boss regarded fawns shortness which fawn knew made her look even younger than she was how longve you two been married fawn blushed about four months it seemed longer with all that had happened berry smiled a little not sure whether to trust his judgment or not then well come see my boat a small doorway or hatch in the front of the shack led down by a few crude plank steps into a dark interior even fawn had to duck through dag would likely have to bend double and be very careful when he straightened up the front of the shelter was full of cargo coils of hemp rope rolls of woolen and linen cloth stacks of hides barrels and kegs fawn could smell apples butter lard and what might be bear grease one barrel was set up on sawhorses and had a spigot in the end it hissed a little ominously as the apple cider within hardened fermenting in the unseasonable warmth there were sacks of nuts and smoked meats hanging from the rafters tucked everywhere were bundles of barrel staves all the local produce from up some tributary river or creek of the grace at one side was an array of what were obviously tripoint steel and iron tools and metalwork from shovel and axe heads coulters and kegs of nails to needles and pins did you come all the way from tripoint asked fawn in awe fingering a shiny new plow blade no only from about halfway we pick up things in one place sell them downstream in another as chance offers the back end of the shack was living quarters lit by two little glazed windows and another door up to the back deck two narrow bunk beds with pallets stacked threehigh along the walls had more cargo jammed underneath one bunk had a curtain this was one of the boats with a real stone hearth a few coals glowed under a black iron waterkettle a cleverly hinged tabletop could be raised up and hooked flat to a wall its legs folded in tight to cover and contain a shelf full of metal dishes and cups and cooking supplies how did you come to own this nice boat berrys smile faded to a grimace my papa buildsbuiltbuilds one every year to float down to graymouth he and my big brother do the timberwork and i do the caulking and fitting hes been taking us kids along ever since my mama died when i was ten her expression softened hed come back upriver working as a hand on a keelboat he and my big brother with me and my little brother as cargo till i learned me how to play the fiddle for the keelers then i got paid more than him he used to complain mightily about that in a proud sort of way fawn nodded understanding papas she offered berry sighed agreement fawn considered the worrisome hesitation in berrys description of her papa and how to tactfully phrase her next question does he umnot build boats anymore berry crossed her arms under her breasts and regarded fawn with a hardtofigure stare she drew breath and seemed to come to some decision i dont know he and my big brother took a boat down last fall and never came back in the spring never heard anything about them though i asked all the keelers i knew to watch out for signs and pass the word back this here boat hed left halffinished i finished it up and loaded it and im taking it down myself sos his work wont be wasted her voice fell if its his last work its about all he left to me i mean to stop a lot along the way and ask after them see if i can find out anything i see said fawn i think thats right clever of you there were numerous reasons a man might not come back from a downriver trip and most of them were dire a family man anyway a young fellow you might picture running off on some new adventure found along the way selfishly sending no word back to his anxious kin but not a papa how was it you didnt go along his last trip a brief silence berry said abruptly come see the rest of my boat and led the way out the back twin to the hatch in front fawn stepped blinking in the light glimmering off the water onto what she decided was the boats back porch a long heavy oar mounted on sturdy wooden hinges extended at an angle from the roof above to the water below and fawn realized it must be the rudder berry or someone had dropped a few fishing lines out over the stern tied to a cord with a little bell dangling off it catch much said fawn nodding to it now and then not much right heretheres too much competition she glanced down the long row of flatboats most of which also had similar lines sagging out into the water dagmy husbandis pretty clever at catching fish is he berry hesitated does he know boats a lot more than i do but thats not saying much im not sure if hes ever been on a flatboat but he can paddle a narrow boat and sail and swim and do most anything he sets his mind to really huh said berry and rubbed her nose fawn gathered her resolve how much would it cost to go on your boat for two people and a horse well theres this said berry and fell silent fawn waited anxiously berry looked out over the bright river absently rolling a fishing line between her fingertips and went on we might find some extra room buttwo of my crew the strongarm boys who man my sweepsthose are the big oars on the sidesgot themselves in some stupid fight up behind the landing last night and havent come back she glanced over to the shore its beginning to look like theyve run off permanent leaving just me my brother and old bo to run this boat me i can manwomanthe rudder but i cant do that all day and be lookout and cook the meals as well which is what i had been doing you say you can cook now if this husband of yours is a good strapping farm lad with two strong arms who isnt afraid of the water uncle bo n i could likely teach him to man a sweep pretty quick and we could make a deal for you to work your passage if youve a mind for it she added a shade uncertainly i could cook sure said fawn valiantly stirred by the thought of the savings on their purse which to her mind was none too fat for a trip of this length though shed shied from confiding her money doubts to dag i used to help cook for eight every night back home dag well dag did not exactly fit berrys description of the sort of crewman she was looking for though fawn had no doubt he could man any sweep made dagll have to speak for himself when he comes berry ducked her head fair enough an awkward silence followed this which berry broke by saying lightly fancy a mug of cider weve got lots its all going hard in the warm ive been selling some to the boatmen here who like it better fizzy so ive not lost my whole trouble but even they wont drink it after it goes vinegar sure said fawn happy for the chance to maybe sit and talk more with this intriguing riverwoman fawn had been stuck on one farm her whole life till this past spring she tried to imagine instead traveling the length of the grace and the gray not once but eight or tenno sixteen or twentytimes berry seemed very tall and enviably competent as she led fawn back inside picked up a couple of battered tankards in passing and turned the barrels spigot the cider was indeed fizzy and fuzzy but it hadnt lost quite all its sweetness yet and fawn who had been growing hungry smiled gratefully over the rim of her mug berry led her back to the folding table and they both pulled up stools i wish it would hurry up and rain said berry i was done asking around here the first day but ive been stuck for ten days more i need at least eighteen inches of rise to get the fetch over the riffle and thatd be scraping bottom she took a pull and wiped her mouth on her sleeve and said more diffidently you havent been long on the river i take it fawn shook her head and answered the real question no we wouldnt have heard anything of your people she added conscientiously well whit and i wouldnt cant speak for dag whit my brother hes just along for the ride as far as the grace hell go home with the glassmen tomorrow fawn explained about warp and weft and whits financial schemes with half her cider gone fawn felt bold enough to ask so how come you stayed home this past fall fawn knew exactly how agonizing it was not to know what disaster had befallen ones beloved but she couldnt help thinking berry might have been lucky not to have shared it whatever it had been you really got married this summer said berry in a wistful tone fawn nodded beneath the table she touched dags wedding cord wrapping her left wrist the sense of his direction that he had laid in it or in her before raintree had almost faded away maybe with his ghost hand coming back he could renew the spell groundwork she diligently corrected her thought i thought i would be wed by then too sighed berry i stayed behind to fix up what was going to be myournew house see and so papa left my little brother with me because i was going to be a grownup woman alder my betrothed he went with papa too because hed never been down the river and papa thought he ought to learn the boatmans trade we were to be married in the spring when they all came back with the profits papa said this was going to be his best run ever course he says that every fall whether its true or not she drank more cider spring came back to clear creek but they never did not any of the three or their hired hands i had everything ready everything she broke off fawn nodded not needing a list to picture it linens and cooking gear all assembled bride bed built and feather ticks stuffed and maybe all of it garnished with embroidered coverlets curtains hung food laid in the house cleaned and repaired and all sprigged out wedding dress sewn and then the waiting first with impatience then with anger then with helpless fear then with fading hope fawn shivered strawberry season came and went and i left off fussing with the house and started fussing with this boat instead the only kinsman whod give me a hand was my uncle bo whos my mamas older halfbrother that never married the rest of my cousins have got no time for him cause they say he drinks too much and is unreliable which is true enough but halfhelps better than none i say and none was what i got from the rest of em they said id got no business going on the river by myself as if i didnt know ten times as much about it as any of them think youll find em all your lost menfolk asked fawn shyly theyd have to be stuck somewhere pretty tight youd figure she didnt name the more likely possibilities a boat broken on rocks or snags and all drowned or eaten by bears or those appalling southern swamp lizards dag had described or bitten by rattlesnakes or even more likely and grimly all dying of some sudden gutwrenching illness on a cold riverbank with no one left to bury the last in even an unmarked grave thats why i named my boat the fetch and not just the finder which was the first name id thought of im no fool said berry in a lower tone i know what all might have been but i scorned to go on living with the notknowingforsure for one more week when i had a boat to hand to go look for myself well partly to hand she tilted up her tankard to drain the cider swallowing she continued which is why i want a crew to hand as well if the rise comes up sudden i dont want to be stuck waiting for those two scaredoff fools to show themselves if they turned up anyhow would there still be room for us oh yeah berry grinned suddenly making her wide mouth wider not pretty but well fetching was just the word fawn thought i dont like cookin if you fawn began but was interrupted by a plaintive voice from outside fawn hey fawn whered you go fawn grimaced and drained her own tankard theres whit he must be done unloading id better go reassure him dag told me to watch after him she rose to make her way through the gloom out to the bow of the boat calling over here whit there you are he strode down the bank a trifle red in the face you gave me a turn disappearing like that dagd have my hide if i let anything happen to you im fine whit i was just having some cider with berry you shouldnt be going on boats with strangers he scolded if you hadnt his mouth stopped moving and hung halfopen fawn glanced around berry smiling came up by her shoulder leaned on the rail and gave whit a friendlyferret wave that your husband no brother oh yeah he looks it whit was still standing there at the end of the board gangplank why should he be so shocked that his sister was chatting with a boatwoman but he wasnt looking at fawn at all the gutpunched look on his face seemed strangely familiar and fawn realized shed seen it there before recently ah ha ive never seen a fellow fall in love at first sight twice in one day before the afternoon was waning when dag at last caught up with tanners wagon at the possum landing goodsshed his roundabout chase had taken him first to pearl bend where mape had redirected him across the river a long wait for the lakewalker ferry a short ride up the bank a turn left to the landingdag tensed as his sputtering groundsense reaching out found no spark of fawn but whit was out front waving eagerly at him dag he cried as dag drew copperhead to a halt and leaned on his saddlebow i was wondering when you was going to show up i was just trying to figure how to find you weve got the boat ride all fixed tanner climbed up onto his drivers box gathered up his reins and regarded whit with some bemusement no messages then after all no not now hes here thanks oh nowait whit went to the wheelers and gave weft a pat and a hug around the neck then ran around the wagon and repeated the gestures with warp goodbye you two you be good for tanner now you hear the horses flicked their ears at him warp gave him a soulful return nudgeunless he was just trying to use the boy as a scratching postwhich made whit blink rather rapidly theyre real good for such young uns tanner assured him you take care too he donned his hat and tugged the brim at dag lakewalker and a little to dags surprise slapped his reins on the teams rumps and drove off minus whit a quick look around located both fawns and whits saddlebags leaning against the porch steps of the goodsshed a couple of idlers on the shaded bench one whittling the other just sitting with his hands slack between his knees frowned curiously at dag arent you going along to help him dag asked whit nodding toward the wagon rumbling away i just helped him load on about a ton of goods from tripoint and upriver that hes taking back to glassforge mape was going to get up a load from downriver at the bendcotton and tea he said and indigo if they had any if the price was right he did i just saw him oh good mape told me they mean to start home tomorrow morning after they rest the horses said dag you ah mean to catch up not exactly so what exactly gods he was sounding just like sorrel but whit didnt seem to notice oh you have to come see you have to come see come on get our bags up on copper and ill show you dag had no heart to dampen such enthusiasm despite his own lingering foul mood dutifully he dismounted and helped sling the bags across his saddle wrapped the reins around his hook and strolled after whit who strained ahead like a puppy on a leash the idlers eyes followed them narrowing in suspicion at dag edgy far from friendly but not quite the hostility that might have been expected had any of barrs and remos victims died during the night absent gods be thanked walking first forward then backward whit waved and called goodbye to them as well by which dag reckoned theyd been briefly hired by tanner as fellowloaders a typical way for such rivertown wharf rats to pick up a little extra coin so if youre not going back to glassforge with tanner and mape and hod what are you going to do dag probed im gonna try me some rivertrading i spent some of my horse money on window glass to sell off the fetch thats berrys boat boss berry whit corrected himself with a lopsided grin what about that promise to your parents about going straight home that wasnt a promise exactly more like a plan plans change anyhow if i get all my glass sold by the time we reach silver shoals i could take the river road home and not get lost and get back hardly late at all there seemed a certain disquieting vagueness to this new plan well dag would find out what fawn thought of it shortly he returned his attention warily to his surroundings they passed along the scattered row of flatboats tied to the trees along the bank a man sitting on a crate in one bow hunched and scowled as dag went by a woman frowned clutched up a wideeyed toddler its thumb stuck in its mouth and skittered inside her boats topshed a collection of flatties idling and laughing on a boat roof fell abruptly silent stood and stared across at dag why are they starin whit asked craning his head in return they starin at you dag i been by here twice and they never stared at me just keep walking whit said dag wearily dont turn your head turn around blight it whit was walking backward again but he obediently wheeled huh im a lakewalker seemingly alone in farmer country corpseeater graverobber sorcerer remember they wonder what im up to they wonder if im an easy target they wonder if they could take me he supposed they might also be wondering if he was some sort of consequence of last night looking for retribution but you arent up to anything whit squinted over his shoulder you sure it isnt just the hook dag set his teeth quite sure dont you remember what you thought first time fawn brought me into your kitchen at west blue whit blinked in an effort of recollection well i suppose i thought you were a pretty strange fellow for my sister to drag in and tall i do remember that were you afraid no not particularly whit hesitated reed and rush were i think indeed whits eyes shifted the mob of flatties on the boat roof was gradually settling back down this feels creepy yknow yes huh whits dark brows drew in thinking dag could hope what did you hear up at the goodsshed about the fight last night dag asked oh yeah that was lucky for us what said dag astonished his steps slowed whit waved a hand it seems two fellows from the fetch got roped into it by some of their friends jumping some local lakewalker they were mad at when the ferrywomen and a bunch of other lakewalkers came to break it up they run off scared along with some girl and her beau the other three was in no shape for runnin and are back on their boats now but it means boss berry needs two stout fellows to pull the broadoars whit pointed to dag and himself grinned and held up two fingers and fawn to cook he added cheerily let me get this straight said dag youve volunteered meand fawnas flatboat crew yeah isnt it great said whit dag was just about to blister him with an explanation of how notgreat it was when he added it was fawns idea really and dag let his breath huff out unformed on his next breath dag managed do you have any idea how to man a flatboat sweep no but i reckoned you would and berry and bo said theyd teach me it wasnt exactly dags vision of the marriage trip hed promised fawnor himself for that matter it wasnt just the work which whit plainly underestimated dag was still dragging from his encounter with hod though it wasnt his bodily strength that had suffered but he remembered the recuperative effects of the harvest and was given pause he said more cautiously did you tell this boat boss im a lakewalker uhi dont remember as it came up whit admitted uneasily dag sighed was he wearing a pot on his head her head and no what kind of pot why dags terse summary of barr and remos jape surprised a shout of laughter from whit oh thats ripe no the loaders at the goodsshed didnt tell me that part i wonder if they was some of the potpated ones not so ripe in the result said dag one of the patrollers was wearing his sharing knife last night which he should not have been and it was broken in the fight the pearl riffle lakewalkers are pretty upset about it today whit squinted is that bad dag groped for a comparison supposesuppose you and sunny sawman and his friends got into a drunken brawl in the village square of west blue and in the tumble one of you knocked over your aunt nattie and killed her gone in a moment thats just about how bad oh said whit daunted i expect those patrollers feel as bad as you would the morning after dag frowned i wouldnt imagine the friends of those flatties who are laid up feel too kindly toward stray lakewalkers just now either he sighed well one way or another they needed a boat out of pearl riffle come the rise which couldnt come too soon and here evidently was the boat in question fawnat last stood in the bow talking with a tall blond girl in a practical homespun shirt skirt and leather vest her sleeves rolled up on slim but strappymuscled arms she had a nice wide smile tinged as she looked down at fawn with a touch of that same excitedtobemakingnewfriends air as whit fawn looked equally pleased dag tried not to feel old in a pen to one side of the bow a boy knelt milking a goat he had the same strawstraight hair as the tall girl cut raggedly around his ears and the same wide cheekbones flushed with sunburn too big to be her child so likely a younger brother a much older man unshaven and a trifle seedy leaned against the cabin wall looking on blearily but benignly dag nodded to the blond girl that your boss berry yep said whit proudly dag eyed him so thats the way his wind blows does it she ought to be boss clearcreek but she says thats her papa so she goes by boss berry wouldnt it be good for fawn to have another woman aboard you can see berry likes that idea too they hit it off straightaway dag was getting a certain sense of inevitability about this boat he let his groundsense flick out at least the water all seemed to be on the outside of the hull there was a coherence about its ground that said boat not boards its a good making this boat he conceded fawn saw him and came dancing over the plank above the mud to hug him as if hed been gone for days and not hours he let copperhead loose to nibble the grass clumps reins trailing and folded her in permitting himself a brief heartening groundtouch of her after pearl riffle camp it felt like bathing a wound in some sweet medicine he released her again as the boat boss began picking her way across to shore her wide smile flattening out dag i found the best boat fawn unhugged him just enough to lift her face to his like a morningglory blossom berry says we can have passage in exchange for being her crew if you think thatd work out i already told him that part said whit dont get ahead of yourself began dag the blond girl arrived and folded her arms tightly across her chest frowning she said to fawn this your dag fawn turned out of dags onearmed embrace but didnt relinquish his hand yes she said proudly the frown became tinged with dismay but hes a lakewalker though it seems theres some question about that today dag nodded politely at the boat boss maam the frown deepened to a scowl fawn i know lakewalkers a lakewalker wouldnt no more marry a farmer girl thanthan hed marry my daisygoat over there i dont know if youre trickin me or if hes trickin you but i do know i dont want no tricksterman on my boat fawn and whit in chorus went into the usual explanation about the wedding braids and west blue that was beginning to exhaust dag it wasnt just boss berry or the suspicious stares from the stirredup flatties it was all that atop the scene in the pearl riffle patrol headquarters dag felt suddenly like a swimmer caught in an eddy between two shores unable to land on either he braced himself nobody said this was going to be easy but he hoped he wasnt about to lose fawn their boatpassage or her new friend berry touched fawns wedding cord held out in demonstration her face grew if not wholly convinced less tense her gaze flicked over the hook they say you know boats she said to dag at last the first words shed spoken to him directly he repeated the polite nod ive never worked a flatboat or a keel ive taken narrow boats big and small down both the grace and the gray though never the whole length in one trip ive never had no lakewalker as boat crew before never even seen one doing that on any farmer boat but her voice was growing more doubtful than hostile i started out this trip to do a lot of things no one had done before dag glanced at fawns anxious upturned face and bestirred himself ive been on high water and low and i know a snag from a sawyer and i could spot you the channel through the sand bars and shoals in water thick enough to plow day or dark oh your groundsense can do that said fawn in delight yes of course it would its true said berry you dont hardly ever see a narrow boat hung up you lakewalkers use your magic to pilot do you in a way if berry decided to let dag and his party aboard he would have days ahead to explain the subtleties of groundsense dag tilted his head at the grazing copperhead do you have room for my horse your wifeberrys mouth hesitated over the phrase then went onfawn mentioned the horse can he share the pen with daisy he could be persuaded yes well then the boat bosss pale eyes were still flat with caution dag thought they would gleam more blue if she smiled i guess youll do whit whooped in triumph fawn grinned dag was infected by their enthusiasm to the extent of a crooked smile even berrys lips twisted a bit as she made her way back across the narrow board and down onto her deck the bleary man had been listening unmoved to the debate his head canted the boy had stopped milking the goat and hung over the bow wideeyed so bo said berry to the bleary man with a jerk of her head toward the three on the shore looks like we got us a lakewalker oarsman one bushy gray eyebrow cocked up he spat over the side but only drawled well thats different he followed her as she ducked indoors how do we get copper onto the boat asked fawn suddenly as if shed only just noticed the problem hes a lot bigger than daisygoat more planks said dag succinctly oh fawn i got my glass goods whit began excitedly staring after berry dag could only think pull in your tongue boy before you step on it fawns brow wrinkled in worry dag guessed she was thinking much the same thing she took whit by the wrist and lowered her voice come over here like were getting copper dag strolled after till they were all out of earshot of the boat fawn pretended to be fussing with her saddlebags whit you went chasing off before i had a chance to tell you something berry isnt just taking the fetch downstream for a trading boat her papa took a boat down last fall and never came back no word she means to go look for him oh we can help whit began fawn overrode this her papa her big brother and her betrothed all gone missing whits face was suddenly wiped clean of expression after a moment he said shes betrothed yes or maybe bereaved even she dont know which right now so try for a little a littlei dont know just try not to be a blighted fool all right whit blinked um yeah well he gulped valiantly well we still need a boat and she still needs a crew right right said fawn watching him carefully girl like that in a fix like that she deserves all the help she can get a good pair of hands three pairs well two and a half his grin was awkward unfelt and if you make one more of your stupid hookjokes fawn added levelly i swear ill clout you on the ear um right dag started unloading saddlebags thinking we need some rain soon they all settled in quicker than fawn would have guessed berrys uncle bo accepted dags presence without comment though her little brother hawthorn who was rising twelve but not yet come to his growth spurt gaped roundeyed and mute and tended to skitter away when dag loomed too close but fawn and berry joined forces on cooking dinner berry mainly showing fawn where and how things aboard were cleverly kept and after eating it bo and hawthorn both smiled at fawn a lot thinking she had better start as she meant to go on fawn made sure the washingup fell mainly to whit and hawthorn as the night chilled and the river mist rose everyone gathered around the remains of the cook fire in the little hearth augmented by the light of a rockoil lantern and were encouraged to drink up as much of the foaming cider as they could hold whit wandered to peer out the back hatch then came and settled himself again on his stool with a sigh think itll rain soon he asked of the air generally as near as fawn could tell and with no expectation of a reply bo held out one battered boot and wriggled it my weather toe says no rain tonight whit looked skeptical you have a toe that can tell the weather yep ever since it got busted that time berry grinned over the rim of her tankard hey dont you go questioning uncle bos bad toe its as good as a coin toss any day the weather in the grace valley can change sudden this time o year bo advised whit amiably rain snow windfog why one time when i was workin a keel up from silver shoals the fog came down so solid you couldnt hardly see your hand in front of your face it was so thick it held the boat back it did and finally the boss said to put down our poles cause he was anchoring for the night next morning we woke up to all this mooing and found wed run right up over that fog for a good halfmile onto shore and the keel was stuck in some farmers cowpasture whit sat up snorting cider out his nose he rubbed it on his sleeve and said go on you did not hawthorn looking equally skeptical said so howd they get the keelboat back in the river rollers said bo blandly hawthorns lips twisted in doubt at this logicalsounding reply bos head went back in mockoffense those hairy gray eyebrows seeming to jig no its as true as i speak twisters now those are good for a tale or two as well twisters said fawn uneasily you get twisters on the river now and then said berry you ever been in one asked whit berry shook her head but then dags deep voice sounded for nearly the first time that evening i was once on the upper gray everyone looked around as surprised as if one of the chairs had suddenly spoken in the gloom almost beyond the fire circle legs stretched out dag raised his tankard in return and drank only fawn saw his indrawn breath sensed that he was about to make an effort that did not come easily to him there were six of us paddling a big narrow boat full of furs down from luthlia for the river trade the storm came up sudden and the sky turned dark green we pulled in hard to the western bank and tied everything to the trees which was not so reassuring when the trees started to rip out of the ground and tumble away like weeds strangest sight i ever saw thenthe wind had picked up a horse this white horse out of a pasture somewhere to the west and it passed us by straight overhead its legs churning away like it was galloping galloping across the sky a little silence followed this bos gray eyebrows climbed then hawthorn said so what happened to the horse did you see it come down we were all too busy gripping the ground and being terrified right about then said dag the poor thing was killed likely hawthorns face scrunched up in dismay dag glanced from it to fawn and swiftly offered or it might have spun down and landed in a pond swum out shook its dizzy head and started eating grass hawthorn brightened slightly so did whit fawn noticed and bit her lip that was a tall tale right said whit in a tone of some misgiving dag let his eyes widen innocently was it supposed to be yes thats how the contest goes in farmer whit explained earnestly youre supposed to top the tall tale with another tall tale oh sorry said dag ducking his head youre not allowed to tell true tales then i can see im going to be at a disadvantage i whit paused and looked confused uh berry scrubbed her lips bos face was unreadable but he did raise his tankard at dag in a delicately conceding gesture berry after a glance comparing the length of dag to the length of her bunks offered a place for fawn and dags dual bedroll amongst the forward cargo it was dank and dark and smelled of the stack of hides that cushioned their blankets but berry also donated a length of coarse cloth which she and fawn tacked up to the low beams and around for privacy during this wordless concession to fawns recently married state berry looked a trifle pensive but she bade the pair goodnight without comment so it seemed the dagdeprivation that fawn had feared on this crowded leg of the journey was not to be a stack of hides had no betraying rope nets to creak in time with any movement in the bodies so supported dag had only to muffle her giggles with a lot of kisses which he seemed quite willing to do as they undertook the pleasant task of finding each other in the pitchy shadows she was reminded that his groundsense worked just the same in the dark as in the day she missed the sight of him bliss to her eyes but a careless candle was like to set the curtains on fire anyhow defeating the aim of all this smothered discretion after lying up under his arm in her favorite position with her ear to his heart she whispered was that story about the flying horse really true yep he added ill amend it next time i can see i need to add in that pond his chest rumbled in an unvoiced laugh depends on your audience i expect some boysd likely want to hear all about how the critter burst when it hit the ground it probably did he said ruefully i like hawthorn fawn decided upon reflection he seems kindhearted for a boy but not shy or scared with it which said good things about berry whod had the raising of him children and animals you can usually tell how theyve been treated i meanthink of poor hod id rather not sighed dag they curled tightly into each other and even the unrhythmic blend of snores from the bunks aft so few paces away could not keep her awake in this cozy harbor dag woke in a vastly better mood he occupied the morning letting hawthorn and daisy show him and copperhead to the patch of meadow just up possum run where the boatmen grazed their animals they had the place nearly to themselves dag spent a peaceful couple of hours stretched out under a tree dozing while copperhead munched grass which also allowed him to avoid whit and his energetic scheme for the day of transferring his cargo crate by crate from the goodsshed to the fetch after failing to recruit dag whit had tried to rope in fawn but she cannily claimed to be too busy with stocking the flatboats larder in support of her more lavish style of cooking a task no one would let him impede after a lunch that testified to the truth of fawns excuses dag retired to the rear deck he settled down on a crate with his back to the cabin wall out of sight of the neighbors as hed passed over the plank to and from shore earlier hed collected the usual quota of curious stares from the boat folks on the two flats moored to either side of them cushioned he thought by his grudging acceptance by the boss and little crew of the fetch berry it seemed was held in some respect by this floating community he eyed her empty trot lines hanging limply over the stern and wondered if he ought to undertake to catch some fish by his own methods for everyones dinner to show the value of an expatroller boatman cleaning fish was clearly a twohanded chore however it would have to fall to whit dag grinned now if only this hazy blue autumn day would turn cloudy and rain voices from the bow indicated whit was back with his borrowed barrow and another crate but then his swift footsteps pounded through the cabin whit stuck his head through the rear hatch and said uneasily dag i think youd better come out here now what reluctantly dag sat up where why up to the bow itssort of hard to explain whit ducked back in dag stretched himself up and strode across the roof instead the better to spare his head from the low beams inside he came to the edge to find boss berry sitting with her legs dangling bemusedly regarding the scene below clutching dags stick hod perched on a barrel in the bow next to the goats pen his long face worried and white around the mouth fawn fussed around him whit popped out the front hatch and gestured anxiously up at dag i ran into him up at the goodsshed whit explained he said he was hunting for you looking at hod in some bewilderment dag eased over the roof edge and thumped to the deck he was not best pleased to realize theyd acquired an audience two flatties from the boat moored closest to them leaned on their own siderail and gawked with all the interest of men being entertained by a storyteller lakewalker said hod glancing up at him with a fleeting smile that faded to uncertainty hello hod dag gave him a nod what brings you here surely tanner and mape had planned to leave at dawn on their twoday rattle back to glassforge is anything the matter hod his throat bobbing said abruptly i brought your stick back he held out dags hickory staff as if in evidence well dag scratched his head in confusion thats right thoughtful of you hod but it wasnt necessary i can cut another in the woods its certainly not something you should have walked all this way on your bad leg to bring me hod ducked his head and gulped some more no well yes my knee it still hurts im not surprised what is it a mile down to the bend dag sucked his lip to say that wasnt too bright to hod seemed a pretty pointless remark i wanti wonderedif youd do that thing you do again what you called it the lakewalker magic a ground reinforcement dag hazarded hod nodded vigorously yeah that thing the thing that makes me not hurt what would make your knee not hurt would be to stay off it the way you were told said dag sternly please said hod rocking on the barrel his hand went out toward dag dropped back to his knee his face scrunched up his eyes dag was startled to note were damp with heldback tears please no one didnt ever make it stop hurting like that before please fawn patted him somewhat helplessly on the shoulder and looked at dag in consternation dag sighed and knelt down before the feckless boy laying his right hand over the knee well lets see whats happening in there gingerly he extended his groundsense his groundglue was holding certainly the flesh healing well but the joint was indeed newly inflamed from the imprudent exercise he frowned now hod said fawn watching dag in worry you know dag cant just do those medicine maker tricks anytime theyre very tiring for him he has to have time to recover between hod swallowed ill wait gazing earnestly at dag he sat up straight on his barrel as if prepared to take a post there for the rest of the day or maybe the week dag rocked back on his heels and eyed the boy you cant wait that long didnt mape and tanner want to leave early if theyd been delayed by this foolish side trip of hods they were going to be irate dag thought they did what said whit startled they didnt just ditch you here did they no they paid me off but thats not fair just because youre off your feet for a week or two they shouldnt ought to sack you whit scowled in outrage at this injustice didnt i asked to be let off why i wanted to stay here no not here a vague wave around took in pearl riffle with him hod pointed to dag he could hire me to do what asked fawn in bafflement i dunno hod shrugged justthings anything he glanced up warily at dag well sittingdown things at first i guess he added after a minute he wouldnt have to pay me or anything do you know much about boats fawn asked thoughtfully she glanced up at berry still sitting on the roof edge and watching it all with some perplexity hod gave an uncertain headshake whits lips screwed up he strolled over to berrys dangling feet and whispered up to her hods not too quick in the wits im afraid neither was my last two oarsmen took me days to get my cookpots back whit muffled a grin and went on but hes willing i mean he could be once he gets over having his knee kicked in by dags evil nag thats what happened see how he got hurt in the first place dag fixed him up again lakewalkerstyle mm the fetch is still a bit shorthanded its true hes sort of an orphan i gather berrys brows rose huh funny so am i sort of her stare down at hod grew more appraising dag wondered if hed get anywhere offering to throw hod up behind him on copperhead and gallop after mape and tanner delivering their henchman back to them to be firmly returned to glassforge hod plainly wouldnt want to go and dag was beginning to have a very ugly misgiving about why and it wasnt just on account of hods unhappy former life could he test his suspicion hod was bent over with both hands on his right knee again helplessly patting at it it was clear his pain was very real dag swallowed and cleared his throat all right hod i can give you just a little more ground reinforcement but then you have to behave and follow orders about letting that knee heal all right hods face lit with joy he nodded vigorously his lips parted as he watched dag bend down and lay his hand on the joint again the wrench of the reinforcement came readily dag felt it like a wave of heat passing from his palm into the throbbing joint below for a moment all the tension seemed to go out of hods body he gave vent to an aah of blissful relief thats good he whispered to dag thats so good fawn patted hods shoulder again in encouragement there see youll be all right soon berry watching scrubbed the back of her hand across her mouth thats real interesting lakewalker you some kind of bonesetter too are you sometimes dag admitted climbing to his feet his heart was pounding and it wasnt from the exertion just in emergencies im not trained as a real medicine maker fawn started to explain proudly to berry how dag had once mended a glass bowl by groundwork but broke off as dag grasped her by the arm and dragged her into the cabin he didnt stop till they were out of earshot back by the kitchen hearth is something wrong she asked alarmed isnt hod healing all right oh his knees healing fine sos his gut well thats a relief you know im thinking maybe a trip on the river would be good for hod too now hes not going to be so sick all the time i bet we all could watch after him better n those glassmen did fawn stop its not that its something else she blinked at his tone then looked at him more carefully hoddag took a deep breathis beguiled to the eyebrows and i dont know how to get him unbeguiled dag had the most unsettled look on his face downright dismayed fawn felt pretty dismayed herself how did it happen she asked not sure well it must have happened when i healed his knee yes buti didnt mean to i always thought beguilement was something you had to do on purpose its something real then she had thought it rumor tall tale slander id never seen a case only heard about it gossip stories ive never known a farmer whowell till i met you i hadnt really known any farmers at all passed through passed by dealt with farmers yes never got so close for so long whats this beguilement like you saw near as much as i did hod wants more more healing more ground reinforcement more pieces ofme i guess her face screwed up in new confusion but lakewalkers have healed me you mari old cattagus once a little when i scorched my hand and im not beguiled am i the thought went well beyond dismay she remembered her own rage when dags brother dar had implied just such a thing mocking her marriage i dag shook his head it would have reassured fawn more to think it was in denial and not just dag trying to clear his brain those were minor healings what i did on hod was as deep as any medicine making i know of i nearly groundlocked myself her hand went to her lips dag you never said he waved away her alarm and youim not sure how to put this your ground isnt hungry like hods youre abundant i dont think you know how much you give to me every day his brows drew down as if he pursued some insight that eluded him id halftalked myself into thinking the risk of beguiling farmers during healing was exaggerated that others might have problems but that id be an exception looks like i need to think again both their heads swiveled at the sound of footsteps boss berry frowning ambled into the cramped living quarters at the back of the cabin what do you want to do about that boy lakewalker you takin responsibility for him or not hes only about halfuseful as he stands or sits fawn said her voice tinged with doubt he could be a scullion i suppose how long till he could man a sweep dag if he could be taught you mean couple of weeks if he doesnt do anything to reinjure the knee he looked at fawn his brows pinching harder in two weeks well be far down the river if it ever rains again sighed berry if hes to be left behind better here than in some strange place said dag i cantsee my way of how to unbeguile hod did he mean and if hod were left at possum landing would he still try to follow dag how far wellif we take him along you may or may not figure it out if you leave him here you never will he scratched his chin ruefully theres a point spark fawn glanced at berry who was waiting with her brows up no the boat bosss own situation was far too unsettled to ask her for undertakings or promises on behalf of hod it was up to them fawn said im willing to try with him if you are dag dag took a breath then well haul him along boss berry gave a short nod the fetch has itself a scullion then she added in mild regret i wont charge nothing for his passage in the warmest part of the afternoon bo led an expedition downstream to the riffle where the locals had gathered to salvage coal from a recently wrecked flatboat before the water rose again hod stayed on the fetch with his leg up supposedly keeping watch but probably fawn thought napping whits interest was aroused when he learned that the wrecked boats boss was buying back coal retrieved from the river bottom by the bushel albeit at a meager price some gatherers preferred to carry off the coal itself and then after some jawing the meager price was paid the other way berry explained to fawn that the going rate had been worked out a few days earlier when the gatherers had dumped their baskets back in the worst part of the rapids before the boat boss saw reason whit stripped to his drawers and sloshed in after bo and hawthorn to duck and dive for the scattered cargoor contorting grub it up with his toes fawn found herself drawn in along with berry skirts tucked up and feet bare as they waded out to receive dripping sacks and pile up the coal on the bank to dry the water was growing chilly as the autumn waned dag claimed blandly that his onehanded state barred him from the task which made fawn raise her brows and snort he withdrew to sit with his back comfortably propped against a stump and watch fawn wondered if giving the ground reinforcement to hod had set him back again he ignored the stares he drew from the handful of families working farther on down the riverside there were no youths from the lakewalker camp cashing in on the windfall fawn noticed though clusters of village boys had turned out for the chance about an hour into this task a gang of half a dozen brawny keelers from the boat trapped above the riffle traipsed past some wore striped trousers others had colored scarves around their waists or sometimes their heads or feathers in their hatbands if they owned hats they started to call something rude to fawn and berry but then some recognized the boat boss and hushed the others berry waved back amiably enough dag opened one eye to observe but when nothing untoward developed closed it again where are they going fawn asked berry down to pearl bend to drink mostly i expect isnt there a tavern at possum landing it was the first place berry went to look for bo whenever he vanished off the fetch fawn understood berry grinned lowered her voice and said yeah but theres a bed boat tied up down at the lower end of the bend just now three sisters and a couple o cousins keep it there isnt one at the landing the ferrywomen wont have it fawn hesitated reluctant to reveal her ignorance she had her suspicions she was the married woman here after all bed boat she finally asked some of the girls who sleep with the boatmen for money follow the trade up and down the river in their own boats they can slip away easier if the town mothers object see and they dont have to split their pay with the tavernkeepers fawn wondered if mama had known about this exotic riverhazard you ever meet one time to time playing fiddle for the keelers pulling upriver i met most every sort sooner or later well not the worst papa didnt work on those boats most of the girls are all right some take it up because theyre way down on their luck but others seem to like it some are thieves who give the rest a bad name same as some boatmen she grimaced by unspoken agreement the topic was tabled as whit waved and they waded out within earshot of the males again fawn wondered if whit had heard yet about the bed boat she couldnt help thinking hed be even more curious than she was and he had money in his pocket just now she resolved not to mention it in front of him then she wondered if lakewalker men from the camp ever snuck down there dag might know and if she asked him straight out he would likely tell her straight out though she bet he wouldnt bring up the subject she emptied whits sack onto their coal pile as berry emptied bos and hawthorns berry waded back out in the water to toss them again to the fellows whit grinned thanks through purpleblue lips the shade was already creeping over this patch of bank as the sun sank and fawn rubbed her chilly legs together wondering how long berry and bo meant to go on dag straightened up and turned his head he bent one knee and lurched up to a seat on the stump fawn followed his gaze coming down the track along the bank were three older lakewalkers two women and a man one woman was dressed like a patroller the other wore a woolen skirt and buckskin slippers decorated with dyed porcupine quills and the man was tidy in a simple shirt and trousers with hair in a very neat queue tied down his back undecorated his braid wasnt shot with gray like the others but his face was not young his left hand was bandaged they all wore matching frowns they came to a halt in front of dag the patrollerlooking woman said dag redblue whatever you are we need a word with you dag opened his hand to indicate welcome to his patch of grass and tree roots as berry came to fawns side to stare the patroller woman glanced at them both and jerked her head over her shoulder in private dags eyelids lowered opened very well he heaved to his feet ill be back in a bit spark or ill find you at the fetch all the lakewalker looks dismissed berry and focused on fawn especially her left wrist she wrapped her right hand around her wedding cord and lifted her chin she expected dag to introduce her but he didnt merely giving her a touch to his temple in farewell and a nod something between grave and grim did he know what this was all about if he did he sure hadnt told her hed said nothing about his visit to the camp when hed caught up with her yesterday and in the flurry of news about the boat fawn hadnt asked shed assumed he simply hadnt found the friends hed been looking for plainly there was more to it fawn watched in concern as dag trod up the river path after the frowning lakewalkers with his groundsense locked down dag could not read the moods of the three pearl riffle lakewalkers directly but he hardly needed to amma osprey and nicie sandwillow were plainly not happy even more nothappy than when hed left them yesterday the man seemed shaken his right hand protecting the bandaged left held to his chest he bore no tool bag but his cleanliness and bearing bespoke his craft captain osprey turned aside and climbed the bank through the trees till they were out of sight and earshot of anyone happening along the path the three took seats on a fallen cottonwood trunk and amma waved dag to a place on a recently cut oak stump opposite as he sank down her wave continued to the new man whom she introduced laconically verel owlet pearl riffles medicine maker tension leaked from the trio infecting dag he couldnt decide between a belligerent whats this all about or a cool so what can i do for you he tilted his head instead dag bluefield their return stares remained dubious amma osprey drew breath first off i want to get down to the bottom of those rumors flying around pearl bend is it true you healed some glassforge wagonmans broken leg couple of days back dag hesitated then said yes i was obliged it was my horse kicked him the medicine maker put in anxiously was it really groundwork or just a bonesetting for answer dag held up his hook but not his ghost hand tightly furled with the rest of his ground i dont do many twohanded chores ah i suppose not said the medicine maker sorry did the wagonmen realize what you were doing yes i didnt make a secret of it hed just about made it a show in fact amma hissed through her teeth and muttered blight it various premature defenses sprang to dags mind fighting with a desire to demand of the medicine maker everything he knew about beguilement he settled more cautiously on why do you ask verel owlet straightened laying his injured hand on his left knee the first i heard about your stunt was when some farmer fellow from pearl bendi think hes a carpenter by tradeturned up at my tent this morning insisting i come see his sick wife when i told him lakewalkers could only heal other lakewalkers he started babbling about the wagonmens story which was evidently being passed around the tavern down there last night first he begged then he offered money then he drew a knife on me and tried to force me to walk to the bend some of the offduty patrollers were able to jump us and take the knife away from him and escort him to the crossroads he went back down the road crying and swearing verel wasnt just shaken by the knife attack dag guessed but also by his distraught attacker medicine makers tended to be sensitive given their need to be open to their patients how sick had that carpenters wife been a picture of a deathly ill fawn rose unbidden in dags head and he thought id have done a lot worse than pull a knife on you but its not true whats not true said nicie its not true that lakewalkers cant do groundwork on farmers its what we tell em around here said amma impatiently absent gods man use your head all we have is one good medicine maker and two apprentices barely enough for our own not even enough muttered verel well sell the farmers what remedies we make and can spare yes amma continued but they would drain poor verel dry if they knew and then they would keep coming and scenes like this morning would be the least of our troubles theyd never understand groundwork said verel what it costs us what it lays us open to not if theyre never taught no said dag dryly funny that amma eyed him sharply its all fine for you youll be moving on at the next rise we have to stay here and deal every day with these people verel was frowning at dag with fresh speculation your partner saun said you were unusually strong in groundwork for a patroller i mean ye gods yes the medicine maker here would certainly have treated and talked with the convalescent saun last spring and reela as well i did what i could with what i had patrol healing can get pretty roughandready granted since dags ghost hand had emerged hed seemed to havemore whether it was newgrown strength or just new access to strength long crippled even hickory lakes medicine maker the remarkable hoharie had been unable to say verel hadnt mentioned inadvertent beguilement as a reason not to do groundwork on farmers did he even know about it if hed never healed anyone but lakewalkers was dags effect on hod something unique dag suddenly wondered if amma knew that hod hadnt gone home with the other wagonmen it seemed not since she didnt ask after him nicie sandwillow rubbed her lined face in a weary gesture just what all have you been telling these farmers and flatties dag nothing or the truth but mostly nothing he added darkly leastways i havent been telling them convenient lies absent gods said amma are you just banished or are you aiming to go renegade neither dag stiffened indignant renegade was an even uglier word than refugee seldom did a lakewalker of any skill go rogue not in dags life experience but there were lurid tales from the past patrols who were good at hunting evil things would surely hunt down such a madman just like a malice fairbolt crow as much as sent me off with his blessing if i find the answer he wants to hear it he sees the question plain as i do and what question would that be asked amma skeptically i saw it this past summer in raintree dag began trying to marshal his wits this was no good leadin for his pitch but it was the one hed been handed the raintree malice almost got away from us because it came up nearly under a farmer town and had already stolen power from half a thousand people before it even started to sweep south because no one had taught them enough about malices i asked fairbolt what if it hadnt been just a little squatter village what if it had been a big town like tripoint or silver shoals instant capital for a maliceking and the more farmers filter north the more territory they settle the bigger their towns will growpearl bend is twice the size it was last time i was through hereand the more such an ill chance becomes a certainty and then what will we do push the farmers back south said amma instantly they dont belong here you know they wont go theyve been settled north of the grace for generations already on land theyve made their own by their labor and if were this stretched just patrolling for malices we for sure cant stop and fight a war with the farmers which wouldnt be won by either side but only by the next malice to come along farmers are here so its here that we have to find another way a place for farmers and lakewalkers both would be a place his and fawns children could live dag couldnt help thinking this new and personal urgency to the problem was no more suspect than were the years hed ignored it when it hadnt seemed so personal this crisis has been building all my life it shouldnt come as a surprise dags voice slowed in new thought hickory lake camp doesnt deal with farmers only our patrols do because hickorys off in the woods still north of farmer expansion here at pearl riffle ferry youve been dealing with the problems for decades you must have learned something about how to rub along not really growled amma think about those stupid pots and what it says about how afraid and suspicious these folks are of us and you think we should hand them proof of what we could really do to them if the farmers cant be shifted we should move five miles upstream at least thats my answer she glowered at nicie who glowered back dag shook his head farmers will fill this valley in time if its hard to keep separate now it will be impossible later when theres nowhere left to move to we may as well figure it out now who is we dag bluefield nocamp said amma your happy idea of dealing with farmers nearly got our medicine maker murdered this morning verel raised a hand in faint protest though apparently only of the notion that hed come so close to being slain amma went on belligerently id have told them at the bend that only lakewakers with gold eyes could heal farmers which they might have bought except i worried for the next fellow to come down the road with your eye color i should have told em it was only folks from hickory lake and let your people cope with the knifewavers nicie said slowly really healing farmers is the same problem as fighting farmers the burden would put us behind drag us down at least shed been listening well she was a councilor maybe she was used to hearing folks argue dag tried but we could keep the balance if the farmers in turn took over some of our tasks not a gift but a trade he glanced at nicie and dared to add or even a cash business dags own secret notion for making a living in farmer country before this beguilement problem had taken him so aback nicie raised her brows so only rich farmers would get healed dags mouth opened and closed maybe he hadnt quite thought it throughwell he knew he hadnt yet verel was giving dag an indecipherable look not many can do deep groundsetting not everyone would need to lots of folks can do minor groundwork we do it for each other on patrol all the time just what did you do for that wagonman verel asked patroller dag shrugged gulped described in as few words as he could manage the trancedeep groundwork that had pulled hods bone fragments vessels and nerves back into alignment and held them there so that they might begin healing he was careful to call his ghost hand a ground projection since that was the term hoharie had so plainly preferred he hoped the medicine maker would approve his techniques if not his patient he didnt continue into the unexpected later consequences although he did allow a plaintive note to leak into his voice when he described his wish for an anchoring partner the hickory lake medicine maker knew you could do this sort of thing and let you get away asked verel hoharie had seen dag do much stranger magery than that in raintree hoharie tried to recruit me if shed been willing to accept fawn as my wife and maybe as my spare hands she might have succeeded but she wasnt so we left verel was regarding him covetously as well as charily dag realized at last would he take the hint between them dag and fawn might add up to a medicine maker and a half a valuable addition to a straitened camp maybe for verels ground flicked out to touch dags wedding cord concealed from ordinary eyes by his rolleddown sleeve it seems just like a real cord he said doubtfully it is verel was plainly itching to get dag alone and ask how theyd woven it dag longed even more to take the medicine maker aside and squeeze out everything he knew about healing groundlock beguilement and a hundred other complexities but that wasnt the reason the irate camp captain had tracked him here amma osprey said grimly the old ways have worked for better n a thousand years nothing lasts that long without good reason let farmers keep to farmers and lakewalkers to lakewalkers and well all survive mixing things up is dangerous which is fine if it falls on your own fool head but not so fine when it falls on someone elses she gestured inarguably toward verels bandaged hand is that all you want dag challenged for the problem to go somewhere else she snorted if i tried to shoulder the troubles of the whole world id go mad and pearl riffle would be lost i run pearl riffle patrol my neighbor camps run their territories and their neighbors do the same all the way to the edge of the hinterland and on to the hinterlands beyond and so we all get through one by one and all together i have to trust them they have to trust me trust me not to go haring off after swamp gas for one thing so ill thank you dag nocamp to keep yourself to yourself and not stir up these people worse in my territory ill be gone on the rise said dag he pointed to the windless sky chilling goldandblue as the sun slanted though i cant control the rain that works for me said amma osprey she stood abruptly signaling an end to the talk the other two rose as well though their brows seemed wrinkled as much in troubled thought as in irritation clearly this was not a good moment to bring up the matter of a spare sharing knife again dag sighed and lifted his hand to his throbbing temple in polite farewell fawn kept an eye out but dag did not return to the scavenging site before the coal boat boss came by with a barrow and bought back their pile berry scrupulously divided the scanty handful of coins five ways on the walk back upstream to the fetch bo silently split off and disappeared up the hill in the lengthening shadows toward possum landing village berry just shook her head at fawns noise of inquiry she explained bo and i have a pact he dont drink the boats money hes kept to it pretty good so far she sighed dont suppose well see him again till morning still huffing with the chill despite dry clothes whit and hawthorn built up the fire in the fetchs hearth while fawn and berry dodged around each other whipping together a hot meal dag looking troubled strolled in as fawn was dishing out beans and bacon he met her questioning look with a headshake maybe a walk after supper she murmured to him as he sat at the table thatd be good he agreed a walk and a talk there was something pressing on dags mind sure enough fawn was distracted keeping her good food coming happy just to have a real if cramped kitchen to cook in after a summer of smoking herself as well as her meals over an open fire she encouraged the hesitant hod to eat up and then he lurched to the opposite extreme and gobbled as if someone were going to snatch his food away whit chided him and fawn bent her head and grinned to watch hod earnestly taking whit for an authorityon table manners of all things hawthorn chattered on about all the different ways he might spend his coalsalvaging coins berry encouraged him to save them whit advised him to invest them in something he might resell for a higher price downstream something nonbreakable would be smart fawn suggested winning an irate look from whit dag smiled a little in his silence and fawns heart was eased a nippy night was falling beyond the cabins square glass windowsfrost might lace them by morningbut inside it seemed cozy and bright in the light of the oil lantern comfortable it felt like friends in here and fawn decided she liked the feeling very well dags head turned toward the bow he laid down his fork in a moment heavy feet sounded crossing the gangplank and then a thump as someone jumped to the deck the boat rocked a trifle a fist pounded on the front doorhatch fawn corrected her thoughtand a male voice bellowed boss berry send out that long lakewalker you got hiding in there what said whit as dag grimaced someone for you dag quite a few someones seems like sighed dag bother bo for not being here muttered berry and stood up from her bench whit and fawn followed her through the cabin she motioned hawthorn back hod hunched fearfully and dag did not rise though he ran his hand through his hair and then leaned his chin on it berry shouted the voice again out with him we say hush wain youll wake all the catfishes children with your bawling berry shouted back irritably i can hear you fine i aint deaf she pushed open the hatch and strode through whats this ruckus then whit followed at her elbow and fawn at whits one of the big keelers loomed on the front deck between the goat pen and the chicken coop dag had left copperhead tethered for the night to a tree up on shore well away from the path with an armload of hay to keep him occupied but daisygoat bleated nervously at the noisy visitor the manwain held a torch aloft the orange light flickered over his broad face flushed not with exertion or cold but beer judging by the rich smell wafting from him on the shore a mob of perhaps twenty people had gathered fawn stared in alarm she recognized some of the keelers who had passed them going down to pearl bend earlieryou couldnt forget those redandblue striped trousers mores the pity the others might be townsmen with one or two women some held oil lanterns and a couple more had torches against the shadowy bank the crowd seemed to glow like a bonfire the keelers routinely wore knives at their belts some of a size to rival dags war knife but not a few were also gripping stout sticks six of the keelers were holding up a door on their shoulders hinges and all and on it lay a shape bundled in blankets whimpering their frowns ranged from tense to grim their grins from wolfish to foolish fawn thought they seemed more excited than angry but their numbers were disturbing stirred up by the noise several men came out from the neighboring boats to lean on their siderails and watch mark the boat carpenter says those highandmighty lakewalker sorcerers refused to heal his wife shes in a fearsome bad way boss wain jerked a thick thumb over his shoulder at the huddled shape on the door so we uns from the snapping turtle took a show of hands and offered to make this one do it a murmur of agreement and a surge forward rippled through the crowd followed by a sharp cry as the door was jostled the broadshouldered keelers holding it up looked awkwardly at each other and steadied it with more care fawn wondered if she should claim dag wasnt here and if a violent search of the fetch would follow but before she could open her mouth dag ducked through the front hatch and straightened up to his full heighta good hand taller than the keeler boss fawn was happy to see how de he said in his deep calm carrying voice what seems to be your trouble the keelers head sunk between his shoulders like a bull about to charge we got us a real sick woman here dags glance flicked toward the shore i see that with his groundsense he doubtless saw a lot more than that and had done so even before hed stepped out into the torchlight fawn clutched that thought to herself did dag know what he was doing maybe not but hed know a lot more about what everyone else was doing than they could guess you healed that wagonboys busted knee wain went on he showed it around at the bend tavern last night a lot of us saw we know you can help dag drew a long breath you know im not a real medicine maker im just a patroller dont you try and lie your way out of this dags head came up the keeler stepped back half a pace at his glinting glare i dont lie and added under his breath i wont he rubbed the back of his neck looked up and sighed softly to fawn who had crept close under his left shoulder you see any horsetails up there in the moonlight the long wispy clouds that heralded a change of weather she followed his glance a few faint bands like skim milk veiled the autumn stars to the west yeswell maybe he smiled down at her in wouldbe reassurance guess well take our chances he turned his head raised his voice and called to the shore bring her here onto the bow and set her down no theres not room for the all of you just her husband and um she got any female relatives sister oh good you come up maam the crowd rearranged itself as the keelers threw down a couple more boards to make a better gangplank carried the door across and grunted onto the deck whit stay by me dag whispered under the cover of this noise fawn you stick real tight she nodded that the husband dag muttered on as a pale young man with dark circles under his eyes came forward crap hes hardly older than whit despite the risk of dropping the woman into the mud the move onto the boat served to thin the crowd considerably it also shifted the visitors onto berrys territory for whatever authority she might have in what was shaping up to be a dicey situation once theyd set the door down berry was able to shoo most of the keelers back to the bank for the plain reason that there was no room for them aboard boss wain remained his jaw jutting in resolve fawn supposed this expedition had been organized in the pearl bend tavern a good deed combined with a chance to beat someone up seemed an ideal combination to appeal to a bunch of halfdrunk keelers twenty to onedid they think they could take dag he was staring down expressionlessly at the woman maybe not the boat carpenters wife reminded fawn a bit of cloverbefore this dire sickness had fallen on her she might have been plump and cheerful now her round face was pallid and sheened with cold sweat the brown hair at her temples curled damply from the tears of pain that leaked from the corners of her eyes breathing shallowly she clawed at her belly skirts bunching in her sweaty hands fawn was aware of hod creeping out of the cabin door to stare and hawthorn as well her husband knelt down and caught up one of her frantic hands they clutched each other he looked up at dag in heartbreaking appeal whats wrong with her lakewalker she didnt cry like this even when our baby was born dag rubbed his lips then knelt down by the womans other side pulling fawn with him happens ive seen this trouble before in a medicine tent up in luthlia a long time ago fawn glanced up at him knowing just when hed spent a season in such a tent they brought this fellow in taken sudden with gut pain did this come on her sudden the carpenter nodded anxiously two days back uhhuh dag rubbed his hand on his knee i dont know if youve ever seen a persons insidesnot the best choice of words fawn thought with maybe half the people here suspecting lakewalkers of cannibalismbut down at the corner of most folks entrails theres this slippy blind pocket bout the size of a childs little finger the medicine makers never could tell me what it does but this fellow his had got twisted around or swollen up or something and took a roaring hot infection that blew it up like a bladder by the time he came to the medicine maker it had busted clean open no not clean dirty it spilled his guts into his belly just like a knife wound would the keeler boss at least looked as though he knew what this entailed and his lips went round in an unvoiced whistle the infection spread too fast for even the makers best ground reinforcements to stop it and he died about three days on funny thing was when his gut busted his pain actually eased for a while since the pressure went down i guess it fooled him into thinking he was getting better till it was too late the carpenters voice went hushed is cresss belly going to bust inside like that then it hasnt yet said dag this is a right dangerous sickness but the groundwork to fix it isnt really that deep theres a host of bellyills no medicine maker born can cure especially in women but this he let out his breath i can try leastways he nudged fawn spark would you take off my arm harness please dag could manage that himself but having fawn do it directed their spectators eyes to her the patrollers farmer bride purposely she unbuckled the straps and drew off the wooden cuff and the fine cotton sock beneath that shed lately knitted for dag to stop the cuff rubbing up blisters and set them aside the presence or absence of the arm harness made no difference to dags ghost hand as far as she knew but she supposed dag thought it would alarm the carpenter less not to have that wicked hook waving over his wifes belly what i can dowhat i can try to do dag looked up and around and fawn suspected only she realized how much uncertainty and fear his stern face was masking first i want to wrap a ground reinforcement around the swelling most of you dont know what ground is but anyway you wont see anything then i want to try and pry that swollen end open sos the pocket will drain back into the gut the way its supposed to that part i think may hurt but then it ought to ease theres a danger two dangers look at me you husband sister his voice softened cress he smiled down at her her painpinched eyes widened a trifle when he was sure he had their attention he continued that little pockets stretched really tight right now theres a chance itll bust while im trying to drain it but i think its like to bust anyway pretty soon do you still want me to try this they looked at each other the sick woman squeezed her husbands hand and he wet his lips and nodded theres another hitch for later subtler dag swallowed hard sometimes when lakewalkers do deep groundwork on farmers the farmers end up beguiled its not on purpose but its part of why the lakewalkers here wont treat you now ill be gone on the rise theres a good chance that a touch of beguilement would do no worse to cress than leave her sad for something she can never have which can happen to a person whether theyre beguiled or not so i dont know if youre a stupidjealous sort of fellow markcarpenter or more sensible but if that mood should come on her later itd be your husbandjob to help her ease it not to harry her about it do you understand the carpenter shook his head no then yes then puffed out his breath in confusion are you saying my cress would run off leave me leave her baby he stared wildly across at fawn is that what you did fawn shook her head vigorously making her black curls bounce dag and i killed a blight bogle together thats how we met she thought of adding im not beguiled just in love then wondered how you could demonstrate the difference cresss breath was coming in shallow pants fawn caught up her other hand and squeezed it she wouldnt run off lessn you drove her the carpenter gulped do it lakewalker whatever youre going to do help her make the hurting stop dag nodded leaned forward and placed his spread right hand over the apparent gap of his left atop the womans lower belly his face got that nolookatall fawn had witnessed while hed been healing hod as if he had no attention to spare for animating it absent in a very real sense he paused his merely expressionless expression returned oh breathed cress that eases me fawn wondered if anyone else was thinking of the man whod been fooled uncertain if this was the ground reinforcement working or a sudden disaster could dag hope to be gone on the rise before a soaring fever made the difference apparent that was the ground reinforcement said dag his brief grimace was meant to be a reassuring smile fawn guessed it needs a few minutes to set in magic whispered the carpenter hopefully its not magic its groundwork its dag looked up for the first time at the ring of faces looking down at him the two boat bosses another curious keeler who might be wains righthand man a worried pearl bend couple who could be relatives or relativesinlaw behind them whit and hod and hawthorn huh he set his hand on the deck and levered himself to his feet fawn scrambled up with him he turned slowly looking at the restive crowd still milling on the shore craning their necks and muttering bending he murmured to fawn you know spark its just dawned on me that i got a captive audience here she whispered back i figured they were just fixing to beat you to a pulp and then set the pulp on fire his grin flitted past then ill have their full attention while theyre waiting their chance wont i better n six cats at one mouse hole he stepped to the bow in front of the chicken coop a wide wave of his left arm invited the folks on the foredeck to attend to him and ended catching fawn around the waist and hoisting her up to stand on a steprail beside him a head higher than usual he left his stump hidden behind her back but raised his hand in a templetouch halfgreeting halfsalute and began loudly did you all out there hear what i just told markcarpenter and cress no i explained that i just set a ground reinforcement around the infection in cresss gut now i reckon most of you dont know what a ground reinforcement is nor ground neither so im going to tell you and then to fawns astonishment he went off into much the same explanation of ground and groundwork that he had practiced so haltingly around the dinner table in west blue only this time it wasnt nearly so halting smoother more logically connected with all the details and comparisons that had seemed to work best for his dubious bluefield inlaws his talk was in what fawn thought of as his patrollercaptain voice pitched to carry whit came up behind her shoulder wideeyed and whispered in her ear are they following all this she whispered back im guessing one in three are smart or sober enough that makes a good halfdozen by my reckoning but the crowd of keelers and townsmen had all stopped muttering and rustling amongst themselves and the folks leaning on the nearby boat rails looked as entertained as if dag were a stump speaker to fawns greater astonishment when dag finished with groundwork and malice blight he glanced over his shoulder and went right on with sharing knives and then the silence grew as rapt as if folks were listening to a ghost story which was why dag finished when that fool patroller boy broke his bone knife in the fight up behind the landing the other night all those pearl riffle lakewalkers acted like someone had murdered his grandmother because thats pretty near just what happened thats why theyve all been so blighted touchy with you lately see and fawn thought at least some of the men listening did seem to see or at least they nodded wisely and murmured canny comments or parted their lips in wonder roundmouthed and silent some of you may be wondering why no lakewalker has told you these things before the answer is standing beside you or maybe its in your own hand you say youre afraid of us our sorcery and our secrets well were mortal afraid of you too of your numbers and of your misunderstandings ask poor verel the camp medicine maker if hed dare to go near a farmer again soon the reasons lakewalkers dont explain things to you as we should arent our fault alone a number of the men clutching cudgels looked at one another and lowered them discreetly to their sides or even behind their backs one shamefaced townsman dropped his altogether glanced to either side and folded his arms somewhat defiantly dag drew a long breath letting his gaze pass over the crowd each fellow whose eyes he met rose a bit on his toes so that a ripple passed along them in response as though dag had run his hand through the still water of a horse trough now markcarpenter here asked if groundwork was magic and i told him no ground is part of the world and groundwork works best running with the grain of the world and not against it like the difference between splitting a log or cutting it crossways and it isnt miracle either at least no more than planting corn is a miracle which it kind of is really farmer puts four kernels in the ground and hopes one will sprout or two will let him break even or three will let him get ahead and if it ever came up all four hed likely call it a miracle groundwork doesnt make miracles any oftener than planting but some days we do break even dag glanced again over his shoulder now if you folks will excuse me i have some groundwork to try and if you all are the hoping sort you can hope with me that tonight i can break even he finished with his old selfdeprecating headduck and salute and turned back to his waitingpatient fawn decided hes sure not fooling now absent gods he breathed to fawns ear alone if theres any rules left to bust i cant think of em flyin patroller she breathed back that had been aunt natties shrewd description of dag the night hed mended that glass bowl so gloriously surprising himself even more than hed surprised the bluefields his lips tweaked up in shared memory but then his gaze grew grave again he went back to cresss side and lowered himself folding his long legs awkwardly hitching his shoulders he leaned forward and went absent again just as quick as that here then gonethere wherever there was fawn made mental inventory as she settled again in her place beside him there was a pot of hot water still on the hearth blankets just inside the cabin a whimper from cress became a stuttering groan fawn grabbed her hand and held it hard as it tried to jerk defensively toward her belly fawn was afraid to touch dag lest she spoil his concentration but the color draining from his skin made her think he was chilling down awfully fast the night air was growing raw despite the torches and lanterns held up by their spellbound audience the minutes crept by but in not nearly so many as it had taken for hods knee dag sat up and blew out his breath he stretched his shoulders rubbed his face cress had stopped crying and was staring up at him with her lips parted in awe ive done what i can for now the pocket drained well and the swellings eased dags brow wrinkled i thinkmaybe cress and her sister and mark had best stay the night here on the boat that infections still pretty warm could do with another ground reinforcement in the morning a lakewalker whod had gut work theyd give him boiled water with a little sugar and salt in it to drink and then maybe tea but nothing else for a couple of days rests up your sore innards while they heal see wrap her up warm by the fire tonight too but i didnt see you do nothing said boss wain in a tentative voice that contrasted remarkably to his earlier bellowing you can take my word or leave it for all of me dag told him he glanced down at cress and the ghost of a smile tugged his lips if youd been a lakewalker youd have seen plenty he was shivering fawn said firmly its time to get you inside and warmed up too maker mine i think you might do with some of that hot tea inside you he bent his head to smile at her then held her tight with his left arm and swooped in for a long hard kiss his lips were cold as clay but his eyes were bright as fire clay and fire makes a kiln fawn thought woozily what new thing are we shaping here despite all the excitement their exhaustion assured that the boats visitors were asleep on hides and furs in front of the hearth almost as soon as theyd been tucked in dag fell into the bedroll in their curtained retreat as if bludgeoned and was soon snoring into fawns fluttering curls in the morning after tea dag laid one more ground reinforcement in cress then sent the couple and their supporters on their way bleary hungover keelers in the gray mist of dawn were much less threatening than drunken woundup keelers by torchlight though to their credit they repeated their good deed with the door in the opposite direction without audible complaint as soon as the muchreduced parade was out of sight dag told fawn pack up a picnic lunch spark were going for a ride but it looks to be a nasty chilly day fawn pointed out bewildered at this sudden scheme then bring lots of blankets dag lowered his voice the pearl riffle lakewalkers made it real clear yesterday that they didnt favor me rocking their boat i think i just turned it turtle i expect captain osprey will hear all about it by breakfast at the latest i dont know if you ever saw massape crow in a real bad mood but amma puts me horribly in mind of her by the time she makes it across on the ferry i aim to be elsewhere and at fawns protest added only ill explain as we ride he went off to saddle copperhead with fawn perched on the saddlebags and her arms tight around his waist dag sent copperhead cantering south for a good two miles down the straight road which was exhilarating but blocked conversation despite the double burden the horse seemed more than willing to stretch his legs after his days of idleness it wasnt till dag turned left and began a winding climb up into the wooded hills designed to thwart trackers that he explained about his fruitless first visit to the lakewalker camp and how the tavern gossip and its dangerous aftermath with the medicine maker had drawn yesterdays hardeyed delegations down on him fawn grew hotly indignant on his behalf but he only shook his head the gray fog did not burn off as the sun climbed but rather thickened fawns stomach was growling when dag spotted a huge old tulip tree fallen with its roots in the air sheltering a scoopedout depression blown full of dry leaves with their blankets atop and below they soon arranged a hideyhole as cozy as a foxs den and settled down to share a late cold breakfastdag declined to light a fire lest the smoke betray their refuge his burst of energy departed him as abruptly as it had seemed to come on and he fell into a drained doze happily he woke sufficiently refreshed after a few hours to while away the leaden afternoon in the best slow lovemaking theyd had for weeks the mist outside turned to drizzle but did not penetrate their nest after they curled up around each other fawn thought like hibernating squirrels dag woke from another doze with a laugh on his lips it was the most joyful sound shed heard from him in a long time she rolled up on one elbow and poked him what he pulled her to him and kissed her smile i really saved that womans life what hadnt you noticed she kissed his smile back like this medicine making do you i think it suits you she added after a moment im right proud of you you know his smile faded into seriousness my people are full of warnings about this sort of thing its not that they think it cant be done and its not the beguilement problemthey hardly mentioned that its that farmers think its magic and that magic should always work perfectly i won hod and i won cress but only because i was lucky that she had something i was pretty sure i could get around i can think of half a dozen illnesses i couldnt have touched she curled his chest hair around one finger and set her lips to the hollow at the base of his throat what would you have done then not started i suppose been a good boy just as captain osprey wanted watched that poor woman die his brows knotted in thought some young medicine makers get very troubled when they first lose patients but im surely past that absent gods help me i used to kill people on purpose but the greatest danger lakewalkers fear is that if they try to help and fail the farmers will turn on them because they have you know im not the first to be tempted down this road and i dont know how to handle it heal and run ammas complaint wasnt madeup or maybe fawn said slowly if you stayed in one place for a long time folks would get to know and trust you and then it would be safe to fail sometimes safe to fail he tasted the phrase theres a strange idea to a patroller he added after a long moment its never safe to fail hunting malices someone has to succeed every time and not even at any cost because you have to have enough left afterward to succeed tomorrow too its a good system agreed fawn for malices not so sure about it as a system for people hm he rolled over and stared at the tiny pricks of light coming through the holes in their blankettent held up by the ragged roots you do have a way of stirring up the silt in my brain spark you saying i cloud your thinking or that you get to the bottom of things that havent been disturbed in far too long fawn grinned now whos going to be the first one to say something rude and silly about the bottom of things i was always a volunteerin sort of fellow dag murmured and kissed his way down her bare body and then there was some very nice rudeness indeed and giggling and tickling and another hour went away they arrived back at the fetch well after dark in a cold drizzle that the boat folk plainly thought a great disappointment inadequate to the purpose of putting anything bigger than a barrel over the riffle whit reported four visits from tightlipped lakewalkers looking for dag two from the camp captain one from the ferry boss and one from the furtive medicine maker which dag said he regretted missing dag plainly was keeping his groundsense pricked fawn thought from his jumpy mood but as no one else came by and the night drew on he relaxed again after their long picnic day neither of them wanted to do anything in their bedroll but cuddle down and sleep which fawn thought dag still needed she had slept she thought about an hour when she was wakened by dag sitting up on one elbow what she murmured drowsily i think we have a visitor fawn heard no footsteps on the front deck nor bleats from daisygoat or complaints from the chickens berry pulled the gangplank in didnt she not coming down the path coming from the river side absent gods i think hes swimming in that cold water who if im not mistaken its young remo why dag groped for his trousers pulled them on and swung off their pile of hides fighting his way out past their makeshift curtain what should i do fawn whispered stay here till i find out what this is all about he padded softly back past the piles of cargo and the bunks careful to wake no snoring sleepers fawn barely heard the creak of the back hatch open and close the oil lantern burning low on the kitchen table was clever tripoint handiwork a glass vase protected by a wire cage mounted on a metal reservoir with a metal hat and wire handle above as he slipped past dag plucked it up he eased out the back hatch and closed the door before hanging the lantern on the bent nail and turning the valve key to brighten the flame he peered out over the water any moon or stars were veiled by the overcast sky and the lamplight reflected off the inky surface of the river in snaky orange ripples in a few moments the ripples fluttered and the lines of light broke up as a dark shape emerged from the darker shadows dag made out remos wet hair then his paler face as he turned again and stroked toward the rear of the fetch his left arm still scored with stitches was up out of the water towing a makeshift raft some driftwood hastily lashed together with vines and willow withies atop the raft sat folded saddlebags and atop them a cloth bundle remo swam up under the fetchs rudder oar and gasped pleaseplease will you take these if the boy had swum from the opposite shore in this weather he had to be chilled to the bone and close to exhaustion youth or no youth dag raised his brows but bent over the back rail grasped the cloth bundle and heaved it onto the deck ah remos clothes and boots of course then the saddlebags containing from the weight of them the rest of his lifes treasures dag grunted but set them by the first bundle he turned to watch remo trying to lift himself up along the rudder pole on shaking arms only to slide back dag sighed leaned out extended his hand and helped pull the shivering young patroller up over the back rail as well the abandoned raft ticked against the rudder and drifted away remo nodded gratefully and bent to pick with numb fingers at the knot tying his bundle he rubbed his naked body down with the wrapping towel and shuddered into his clothes ththanks folks are sleeping inside dag warned in a low tone he wondered whether he ought to haul the boy indoors and plunk him in front of the hearth or throw him back over the rail well hed doubtless find out shortly yes right whispered remo his lip was back to normal size but the bruises around his eye had darkened to a spectacular deep purple just starting to go green at the edges he finished pulling on his shirt and stood with hands clenching and unclenching at his sides as if his next words were clotting in his throat hed gone to a great deal of trouble for this private talk dag thought only to choke off now caution reined in dags curiosity just enough to convert his what can i do for you into a more noncommittal general eyebrow lift it was enough to break the logjam anyway remo blurted take me with you and ahwhy should i do that the return stare was uncomfortably hodlike do you even know where im going dag prodded downriver away anywhere away from here this was the one dag reminded himself whod had to take his greatgrandmothers broken and wasted bone back and present it to his waiting family it wasnt hard to guess that the scene hadnt gone well though that still left a wide range of badly to choose from remo had been the more conscientious of the feckless partners the one whod tried to do the right thing and had it come out all wrong well you know how that goes old patroller dag rubbed his head and sat down on the bench against the cabin wall his arm harness being off for the night he rested his stump unobtrusively down by his left side and laid his hand on his right knee remo dropped hastily to the deck and sat crosslegged perhaps feeling dimly that supplication went ill with looming there are ten other boats heading the same way dag pointed out why the fetch remo shot him a look of tightlipped exasperation because theyre all full of farmers dag wasnt quite sure how to take that emphasis he was tempted to haul remo by the nose in a few more circles till he recanted his tone but it was late and dag was tired one circle maybe so is this one remos second shaft wobbled closer to the real target you left i was not if you werent banished they as much as drove you out made it impossible for you to stay i thought youd understand his bitter laugh betrayed both his youth and how close to the end of his rope he dangled oh i do you threw off their old rules you rebelled you took your own path alone and no one is going to say to you its just because youre a stupid fool kid we see the world not as it is but as we are thats not exactly what im about here now i can say whatevers going on over there between you and your family it will pass great griefs must if only because no one has the stamina to keep them up that long not more than twenty years leastways remo just shook his head too sunk in his own misery to listen to hear dag thought ruefully of his own family and revised his sage advice and while youre waiting theres always the patrol remo shook his head harder the pearl riffle patrol is lousy with my family most of my brothers and sisters and half my cousins uncles and aunts and every one of them thinks they should have been left greatgrandmamas knife instead and theyre right he gulped and added i went to the camp knife maker yesterday to ask for my own bonded knife and he wouldnt even agree to make it for me in your mood dag mentally commended the cautious knife maker he said patiently whatever your troubles are you wont defeat them by running away from them my roads not for you what im saying is the best thing you can do for yourself and pearl riffle camp is go back over there and pretend this swim didnt happen remos jaw worked i could swim halfway back that would solve all my troubles dag sighed but before he could marshal his next argument the door swung quietly open and fawn slipped through she had a blanket wrapped around her nightdress shawlfashion and a lumpy cloth in her hand she glanced at dag and tossed her head maybe i can put a word in here being the resident expert at running away from home she opened her cloth here have a chunk of cornbread i make it sweet remo accepted it mechanically but stared at it in some bewilderment fawn handed a piece to dag and took the last one herself dag took a grave bite of his own and motioned remo to proceed fawn leaned against the cabin wall and nibbled then nudged dags knee with her bare foot this is your remo right or is it barr dag swallowed crumbs and made the demanded introduction remo yes remo this is my wife fawn bluefield remo food in hand made a confused halfeffort to stand then settled back as fawn waved him down he returned her nod instead youre the farmer bride i thought youd betaller dag quelled his curiosity as to what several adjectives remo had just swallowed along with his cornbread there older was undoubtedly one now said fawn cheerily the first thing i know for sure about running away from home is plans made in the middle of the night are not always the best in the morningafter breakfastyou can generally think of much better ones she exchanged a meaningful look with dag and went on its the middle of the night now and youre keeping dag from my bed but i just laid a big pile o those furs and blankets we used for last nights visitors in front of the hearth theyre real warm now toasty even remo was shivering his damp skin clammy in the misty chill strands of hair escaping his soaked braid draggled across his furrowed forehead if you got yourself warm i bet youd drop off right quick despite your troubles tired as you look all that swimming after all i expect youre still hurting too in all ways not just his bruises thought dag he suppressed a smile at the way remo stared up openmouthed blatantly susceptible to what were likely the first kindly words hed had from anyone for days a pretty young woman offering him food a soft bed and sympathy was not someone he was going to argue too hard with even if she was a farmer wise spark dag commended this take her up remo you wont get a better offer tonight he had the bare wisdom himself not to add aloud it beats swimming halfway across the river all hollow no good sprinkling salt on wounds even selfinflicted ones remo glanced as if surprised at his hand now empty of leftover cornbread and around at the flatboat and the darkness of the rippling river only a few orange lights from pearl riffle camp shone through the halfnaked trees on the far hillside this boats not going anywhere tonight anyhow fawn pointed out remo shook his damp head no but a rise is coming on you can feel it out in the middle thats why i swam across now by morning itll be too dangerous and by tomorrow night these boats will all be gone remo had lived in this ferry camp all his life dag expected he knew the rivers moods well further swimming the river left no evidence behind of what direction hed taken a missing horse would have said north crossing on the ferry would have left witnesses who could say south once he was gone beyond groundsense range none could guess if hed gone north south east or west or halfway across the river a faint breeze raised goose bumps on remos lavendertinged skin and he yielded abruptly all right be real quiet whispered fawn her hand on the door latch theyre mostly asleep in there berry dag murmured i told her youll explain in the morning she rolled back over ah with remo tucked into the bedding before the hearth like an oversized overtired child dag and fawn at last made it back to their own curtained bed their bedroll unfairly had chilled down they rubbed each other halfwarm and laced limbs together for the rest wondered why you chose just then to come popping out dag murmured into fawns curls you thought he meant it about that halfriver did you this time o night you do besides as ragged as remo looks and as big as this river is the decision might be pulled out of his hands before he made it back to the other shore she added reflectively its a lot bigger than the river by west blue that way drowning yourself in that one would have called for a lot more determination here you could do it just by inattention he hugged her tight no halfrivers anyhow i took exception to your advice about not running away from your troubles you picnicking fraud an unvoiced laugh shook his chest but im not running away im running toward he sighed and just in case i miss any they follow after and join me its going to be a crowded boat spark in the morning fawn found to her excitement that the cracked mud at the bow had disappeared under new water but berry said the rise was not yet high enough to get the fetch over the riffle since fawn suspected the moving boat would not be safe for complicated cooking she indulged herself instead in what might be the last chance for a while to fix a real west bluestyle farm breakfast this resulted in a lot of munching around the crowded foldout kitchen table and not much talk at first that wasnt requests to pass things although most everyone shot curious peeks at remo berry was bland about the uninvited guest bo was either hungover or indifferent hod seemed intimidated with lots of looks dags way as if for reassurance whit was waryremo was both older and bigger than he was as well as being a fullfledged patroller hawthorn had a baby raccoon a prize from one of his coalsalvaging coins and had no interest in anything else fawn had to admit the brighteyed creature was wildly cute hawthorn was trying to keep it in his shirt with limited success whit observed that he should have bought a baby possum for that bo said raccoons were destructive and if hawthorn didnt keep his pet under control bo would make it into a hat now bo said berry cutting across hawthorns hot protests could be worse remember buckthorns bear cub bo wheezed a laugh and gave over harassing hawthorn hawthorn whit and hod then fell into a debate about what to name the kit dag said little but fawn spotted him slipping the curious animal a fragment of bread remo didnt attempt to join the talk he was mediumtall broadshouldered dag called him a boy but he looked like a fullgrown man to fawn he was not goodlooking so much as goodenoughlooking but was probably attractively healthy when he wasnt recovering from a beating his hair dry and rebraided hung halfway down his back he finished cleaning his plate and looked up at last so he said to dag did you decide can i come with you dag left off helping to spoil the raccoon kit and returned the look i dont know can you remo frowned uncertainly dag went on im not your patrol leader more to the point this isnt my boat i just work on it if you want to arrange passage you have to talk to the boat boss like anyone else he nodded across at berry remos head turned to meet her rather ironic gaze and he blinked dags response seemed a bit unfeeling to fawn but maybe he had a reason she waited for it to emerge remo finally addressed berry how do i arrange passage then well you have to either buy it or work it everyone else heres decided to work it how much to buy it how far are you going idont know he glanced at dag graymouth i guess berry named a sum of coins that made remos face set no deep purse here it seemed fawn was unsurprised and working said remo i dont know what can you do i know you know narrow boatsi heard about the coalboat boys you fellows pulled out of the riffle can you man a flatboat sweep i once did it for a day barr took me venturing he broke off hm berry glanced at dag who shrugged i didnt expect to have one lakewalker crewman let alone two sohows this ill take you on trial as far as silver shoals thats my next stop papa and alder were seen there last fall by some keeler friends so i know they made it at least that far remo made an inquiring noise whit explained rather sternly about berrys quest remo looked a bit taken aback to be reminded that people besides himself could have serious troubles and he squinted as if seeing berry for the first time fawn imagined the view through the haze of his own misery was still a bit blurry be aware said dag with a hint of challenge in his voice that if you choose to work from the time you set foot on the fetch till the time you step off boss berry will be your patrol leader remo shrugged its just a flatboat how hard can it be whit frowned on berrys behalf but before he could wade in a clunk from the back of the boat brought everyones head around log said bo currents moving better said berry the fetch shifted and the ropes from the stern to the shore flexed and groaned a trifle hawthorn ran out to the back deck and returned reporting the rivers going browner not long now the cleaning up was left to whit hawthorn and hod at home whit had slacked off abominably on this chore making game of fawn but with hawthorn and hod to ride herd on not to mention berry watching he became wonderfully scrupulous all of a sudden fawn was considering breaking out her spindle for a little handwork when someone on the shore path trotted past the bow and shouted incomprehensibly hey berry the upstream keelers are on the tow berry rose grinning come on fawn youve got to see this she picked up an oddly shaped leather bag from under her curtained bunk fawn grabbed her jacket and followed whit trailed after the late morning was overcast and chilly but not foggy more of the leaves were down from the trees drifted into sodden yellow piles from yesterdays rain leaving the bare boles the same gray as the air receding ghostly up the hill berry led down the path past the wharf boat and the ferry landing the lakewalkers ferryboat fawn saw in passing was moored on the other side of the river and its capstan rope had been taken down no one would be crossing after remo just yet a little above where theyd gathered coal berry hopped up onto some tallish rocks that gave a fine view down over the riffle at the bottom of the rapids which were slowly disappearing under the rising water two keelboats were moving along opposite shores on the far shore the keel was being towed against the current by a team of eight oxen handled by what looked to be a couple of local farmers on the near shore the keel was being heaved along by about twenty straining men pulling a long thick rope fawn at last saw why all the trees on the riverside of the shore path had been cut to stumps both boats had men running back and forth on their bows with long poles fending off rocks and clumps of wrack the two crews were shouting back and forth across the water rude insults and challenges and a lot of chaff about well be at tripoint before you is it a race asked whit staring in delight yep said berry and bent to draw a polished hickorywood fiddle from the case she tested the tuning by plucking at the strings and turning the pegs stood up on the highest rock facing downstream and drew a long note starting low and winding high until it seemed to leap off the fiddle altogether she added ive fiddled my keeler boys up over every shoal and riffle on the gray and the grace it makes the work go easier if you have a rhythm when the boat boss wanted them to go faster hed bribe me to play quicker the boys would bribe me to play slower it could get pretty lucrative fawn spotted a lot of fellows out on the pearl bend wharf boat in the distance shouting the contestants onward i dont suppose you have a bet down on this race do you berry the riverwoman grinned yep and set her bow to her strings sending an astonishingly loud ripple of notes echoing down the river valley the grunting keelers on the near shore looked up and cheered and bent again to their rope in time to the boatmanmusic fawn guessed it was a familiar tune likely with familiar words and likely with a rude version but the men had no breath to spare to sing along the oxen on the other side seemed indifferent to the noise when the repeats on the first song began to get dull berry switched to a second tune then a third some of the other boat bosses from possum landing had come out to watch the show including wain from the snapping turtle berry moved back from the rocks to the other side of the path as the keelboat drew near and began yet another tune even livelier her elbow pumping her audience shuffled after her strands of her lank blond hair loose from the horsetail at her nape stuck to her face and she alternated between either blowing them out of her mouth or chewing on them in her concentration her fingers stretched arched flew so fast they blurred everyone else was watching the race whit was watching berry his eyes alight and his mouth agape the sweating keelers passing hooted at her then bent and stamped and strained she made her fiddle echo their cries almost like a human voice they were pulling well ahead of the oxen berry kept her music chasing them up the shore until they reached the wharf boat reeled in their keelboat threw down their rope and sent up a victory whoop she made her fiddle whoop back and finally dropped it from under her chin panting the flatties and locals who had collected along the bank to watch tromped back up the riverside to settle their bets and hoist a drink at the wharf boat but neither berry nor the other boat bosses on the lookout point joined them instead they peered upriver where one of the flatboats had loosed from its mooring and was being slowly sculled out to midriver there goes the oleana lily someone muttered they were all watching fawn realized to see if this scout could clear the shoals without hanging up or tearing out its hull if he makes it will we go fawn asked berry not just yet said berry shading her eyes and squinting at the drifting flatboat which was picking up speed the lily drew a shallower draft than me even before i undertook to load on extra people a ton o window glass and a surly horse you see that long pole sticking up out of the water below the landing wharf boat fawn gazed where she pointed at what looked like a slim bare tree stripped of side branches with a limp red flag nailed to its top some thirty feet in the air every half foot along its length it had a groove circling it daubed with red paint until a few feet up from the water where it changed to black paint that tells you how high the water is right is it safe to take the shoals when it changes from red to black there seemed to be several feet left for the water to rise depends on how low in the water your hull and cargo ride when it changes to black any fool can get his boat over the marks go all the way to the top said fawn uneasily the water doesnt ever go that high does it no said berry and fawn relaxed until she added by the time its about halfway the pole usually rips out and washes away fawn finally saw why the river people relied on wharf boats instead of a fixed dock like those shed seen around hickory lake the wharf boats would rise and fall with the shifting water could be pulled ashore for winter and wouldnt be torn away by floods drifting trees or grinding ice were less likely to be she amended that thought a few of the boat bosses lined up on the rocks yelled comments or advice to the steersman of the oleana lily which were proudly ignored but most watched in silence when the steersman leaped to one side and pulled hard not a few leaned with him fists clenching as if to add their strength to his when the boat sideswiped a rock scraping along the whole length of its oak hull the boat bosses groaned in synchrony they bent like trees in the wind then all straightened together and sighed at what sign fawn could not see but the lily was past the last rock and clump of wrack and still moving serenely the group broke up and began to trudge back up the path a couple of men trotted ahead berry detoured only briefly at the crowded wharf boat collecting a couple of bonecracking hugs from some keelers and money from several more sheepish boatmen she refused pressing offers of cider beer or the drink of her choice i got me a boat to launch boys weve been here too longyouve drunk this place dry she paused on the bank to squint again at the ringed pole well not quite yet but i think we might load on that horse back at the fetch they did so laying extra timber for the gangplank dag soothed his dubious mount across the bending boards copperhead snorted in dismay but followed the boat dipped as he clomped down onto the deck and was penned with daisygoat whatever groundwork dag was doing to assure the geldings cooperation was as invisible to fawn as ever but she noticed remo raising his brows as if secretly impressed berry climbed onto the roof to watch two neighboring boats launch at the same time and tangle their long side oars with a lot of swearing berry scrubbed at the grin on her lips i think well go next she said to fawn at her shoulder its a dice roll at this point with a crowd like this you want to go late enough to get the highest water but not so late that some hasty fool before you wrecks his boat and blocks the channel again still the launch seemed leisurely hawthorn dodged back and forth untying ropes from the trees and casting off and hod limped around to roll them up in neat coils two at the front corners and two at the back corners the oarsmen did not sit to their long sweeps but stood walking or leaning back pushing or pulling as needed berry took the rear steering oar with bo and whit on one side sweep and dag and remo on the other it made berrys shouted directions simple farmer side pull patroller side pull now the other way patrollers turn her a thump shook the boat as the hull glanced off a hidden stump a crash from the kitchen sent fawn racing inside to make sure everything was locked down and to check for the third time that her cook fire was wellbanked and penned behind its iron barrier when she came out again the boat was in the middle of the river which still looked bigger than from shore they swung into alignment with the channel in contrast to its earlier placid clarity the water was an opaque bright brown and visibly rolling carrying along storm wrack from far upstream in an impressive current she couldnt imagine the bruised remo swimming it now fawn debated whether to cling to the bench by the front door or climb to the more precarious roof then decided she was tired of being too short to see things she climbed up and found herself a spot in the exact middle just beyond the radius of any of the three oars she sat down firmly wishing there were side railings or a handle to grip maybe she could talk bo into adding one but for now the view was very fine they entered the riffle proper and the fetch picked up speed dag suddenly yelled bear right boss theres a big snag about two feet under down there berry stared where his finger pointed you sure i dont see a boil try me all right said berry dubiously and leaned on her oar to twist the boat past alarmingly close to some highly visible rocks on the far side bo had to lift his sweep to clear them and shot his boss a questioning look which she answered with a shrug before leaning on her oar to bring the boat around again whit lending his strength to bo looked utterly exhilarated your boat steers like a drunk pig remo said hauling briefly backward against the current at her next order yeah it aint no narrow boat is it berry returned cheerfully unoffended live and learn patroller a flatboat crowding close behind them chose to veer wider around the rocks with a loud clunk it shuddered almost to a stop then began to swing around its bow cries of dismay and a lot more swearing followed as its crew fought to keep it from turning broadside to the current berry looked at dag and raised her brows high he touched his temple back at her well live and learn berry repeated in quite another tone fawn stared back at the receding lakewalker ferry landing wondering if they were being watched by irate council eyes they passed rocks clogs of dead trees and debris including a bloated sheep and less visible hazards then the river widened and the odd swirls like soup boiling disappeared the surface smoothed ease up boys were over the riffle and away at last said berry its a straight reach for the next three miles dag and bo stood down from their sweeps on the easy stretches fawn understood the oarsmen would take turnabout and the boat would float along all day without stopping dag came over sat down beside her stretched out one leg and gave her a hug around the shoulders all right spark its wonderful she stared at pearl bend already falling behind on the far shore and back to the boat boss now leaning happily on her oar were going so fast berrys agreeing grin stretched as wide as the river fast as a horse can trot the fetch made thirty river miles before the dank autumn dusk when they tied to the bank for the night in the middle of as nearly as fawn could tell nowhere berry explained regretfully that she didnt want to try running downriver in the darkwhits appalling suggestion in addition to the hazards of rocks stumps sand bars ledges and wrack the river divided frequently around shifting islands a boat choosing the wrong side might find itself stuck in a channel that petered out into impassible thatch and its crew plagued with the arduous task of towing it up around the head of the island again difficult enough for a keelboat designed for such work worse for a balky flatboat boats had been abandoned in such situations berry said fawn poked whit to silence when he began to volunteer dag for a night pilot even were dags groundsense recovered to its full onemile range some of these islands were as much as five miles long and the river was quite scary enough in daylight after that fawn was too busy fixing dinner to worry further with the excitement of the day wearing off everyone seemed glad to turn in early in addition fawn suspected dag was still boneweary from healing the pearl bend woman at some level underneath the mere physical he seemed to wrap himself around fawn in their bedroll more for comfort than anything else from the intensity of his clutch he was feeling low on comfort tonight she wondered if having remo aboard bothered him a curtain gave no privacy from groundsense although since farmers couldnt veil their grounds at all she supposed remo must have shut himself off as dag often did to spare himself the abrasion weary herself her musings trickled into sleep they made a dawn start and by midday the clouds had thinned and the sun came through if still a bit pale and watery which fawn thought lifted everyones moods at berrys suggestion she experimented with the clever iron oven that fitted in the fetchs hearth and was able to produce pies for lunch without stopping the boat or setting it on fire a fact of which she was more proud than of the pies which truly everyone ate with flattering appetites in the afternoon she found dag taking a break from his oar lounging on the bench on the front deck keeping pleasantly idle company with copperhead daisygoat and the chickens she leaned over the rail and eyed the smooth brown water the fetch seemed to be outracing a sodden log but that floating leaf was definitely pulling ahead dag she said do you think you could catch us enough fish for dinner he opened his eyes and sat up what kind i dont even know what kinds there are in this river bo was going on about how much he liked a good channel catfish fried up in a cornmeal crust do you think you could get enough of them to feed eight his slow smile tucked up the edges of his mouth i could try spark he rose and stretched only to drape himself over the side of the boat just behind the pen his left arm trailing down his hook barely grazed the water fawn watched in sudden doubt when hed persuaded that big bass to leap so startlingly into their laps at hickory lake theyd been in a much smaller boat with lower sides the fetchs rail seemed awfully high to expect any fish to jump over were catfish even the jumping sort fawn had a dim idea that they lurked about on the river bottom when nothing happened in about ten minutes fawn considered wandering back to her domain by the hearth to think about what she could do with bacon for dinner again except she was afraid dag was falling asleep granted he would doubtless wake up when he hit the water and he could swim better than she could and if she grabbed for his legs he might simply pull her over with him but still but then he stiffened muttering ha she craned her neck and then he was jerked half over the thwart with a startled scream of blight fawn lunged managing to get her hands around his belt she snatched one look over the side before she leaned frantically backward feet skidding on the deck a huge gray splashing shape seemed to have halfswallowed dags hook and was trying to yank him into the river in order to eat him near as fawn could tell she supposed turnabout was fair play but she wasnt willing to give up her best husband to some awful river monster dag let go of it it doesnt matter i dont want a fish dinner that much i cant crap the blighted things stuck on my hook dag clawed futilely at the buckles on his arm harness then managed to get his knees down far enough to clap them to the inboard side of the hull and give a mighty heave fawn added what weight she had several feet of flailing gray wetness rose from the brown water and arced through the air to land on the middeck with a thud that shook the whole boat dag still attached to its mouthend perforce fell with it and fawn with them both she scrambled back on her hands and knees the startled copperhead tromped his hooves in the straw of his pen jerked his head and whinnied and daisygoat bleated in fright whether of the plunging horse or of the river monster fawn was unsure whit dag yelled bring a mallet quick the uproar brought the entire crew of the fetch rushing to the bow whit hod and hawthorn jammed up in the front hatch berry remo and bo peered down over the edge of the cabin roof whit vanished hawthorn fell through and hod eyeing copperheads antics hung back fawn bounced to her feet for her first clear view of the most enormous fishif it was a fishshe had ever seen or imagined it was nearly as long as she was tall its head was huge eyes glaring yellow mouth wide and ugly and dags left arm was still stuck partway into its gaping gullet red gills flexed and its long barbels snapped like whips as it heaved and flopped dag was jerked around with it whit reappeared with a shiny new shovel grabbed from berrys stock of tripoint goods and proceeded to try to beat the fish to death or at least into submission urged on by dag hit it again whit harder ow aim for its head blight you the catfish finally stopped moving mostly and dag drew a long breath sat up and carefully worked his hook free from inside the things mouth if the monster had succeeded in pulling him overboard would it have taken him to the bottom and drowned him before he could get loose fawn felt faint dag shook out his arm looked around at his riveted audience and cleared his throat there spark fish dinner for eight thank you dag fawn choked which won a flash of a smile back the strain in his face easing he almost succeeded in looking as if hed meant to do all this but she thought he might be picturing that trip to the river bottom too fish dinner for fortyeight more like said whit measuring out the gleaming corpse how much does this thing weigh looks like about a hundred hundredtwenty pounds to me drawled bo an expert opinion fawn presumed whit whistled well said berry looking down at fawn and shaking her head you did tell me your husband could catch fish ill give you that never seen anyone use live lakewalker for bait before how do you fit it in a pan fawn nearly wailed she pictured it draped across her skillet with an arms length hanging over each side she wouldnt be able to lift it could it be cooked on a turnspit like a roasting pig whit and hod will clean it and cut it up for you said dag genially he stretched his back and climbed somewhat gingerly to his feet wiping his hook on his trousers im sure bo will be happy to tell them how whits look of bigeyed enthusiasm faded a trifle but he didnt protest he and hod hauled the catch to the back deck to butcher under bos amused supervision briefly alone with dag in the kitchenandlivingquarters while he tidied himself fawn reached up and gripped him by the shoulders you do know you dont have to go and do any stupid fool thing just because i ask dont you i rely on you to be the sensible grownup around here he slipped his arm around her back and protested i didnt think a fish dinner was an unreasonable request not on a river leastways if we were in the middle of a desert now that would have been a right cruel demand he blinked innocently at her demonstrating cruelty she poked him in his bruised stomach and scowled he glinted his eyes at her in a very unfair way but said i admit it did get a little out of hand if youre saying that thing nearly swallowed your arm i saw she gripped him again and shook him or tried to you could have picked out a smaller one you dont have to prove anything to me his answer was a silent laugh as he dropped a kiss on her curls she gave up and relaxed into his offered cuddle even though she wasnt sure whether it was intended as apology for scaring her out of her wits or just as distraction she added more pensively i dont mind the idea of eating a fish though on the farm it wasnt a dish we fixed too often but im not sure i like the idea of a fish big enough to eat me oh there are channel cats bigger than that one and there are sea sturgeon that come up the lower gray that are easily ten times that size dont tell me said fawn first swamp lizards with giant teeth now fish big enough to swallow the fetch what parts are you taking us to anyhow im making a new rule you dont bring any more fish onto this boat that are bigger n me you hear me dag bluefield all she got back was a smirk and a hug which had its own satisfactions but wasnt precisely an answer for dinner fawn fried up catfish fillets till everyone aboard was stuffed to the gills and groaning the white flesh was sweet and succulent but it went on forever breakfast was the same midriver lunch was cold catfish sandwiches and dinner and another breakfast after which whit led a rebellion and sneaked the remains over the side where they would feed its cannibal catfish cousins fawn supposed torn between indignation at the waste and profound relief she said only huh to which whit replied yeah well be more careful what you ask dag for eh that fellow scares me some days in the late afternoon dag asked berry if they might pull in briefly at another lakewalker ferry camp this one on the south side of the grace berry fawn knew was anxious to ride this rise past silver shoals lest the fetch be grounded above that hazard and have to wait again for the next upstream storm but she eyed dag and nodded saying only make it quick lakewalker the deserted landing was nothing but a bare patch on the bank the camp up over the bluffs invisible from shore this ferry served not a wagon road but merely a patrol trail and so had few farmer customers dag hiked off alone inviting neither fawn nor remo not that remo would likely have accepted the pearl riffle patroller had obeyed berrys boatboss orders without comment or complaint but had kept equally silent between work shifts whits most hamfisted overtures of wouldbe friendship seemed to slide right over him fawn didnt think he even talked to dag though she did catch him watching the older man as if he were trying to figure something out and couldnt hod was skittish around remo but then hod was skittish around everyone hawthorn took the goat ashore to graze for an hour remo volunteered to do the same for copperhead which surprised fawn till she noticed it gave him an excuse to settle down well away from the rest of the crew whit followed berry around fawn between chores at last announced i think ill walk up to meet dag the path up from the shore along the hillside was slick with damp yellow leaves in need of pruning and unpeopled a halfmile up it she met dag coming back through the graybrown woods from his set face she guessed his errand had not prospered no luck she asked quietly he shook his head i tried not to repeat my mistakes i told em my name was dag otter hope and made them think i was a private courier i might as well have spared my pride they didnt have any extra knives well it wasnt a big camp no surprise thats a pity fawn turned to stroll beside him they were not only out of earshot of the fetch right now they were out of groundsense range it seemed a good chance to ask your remo doesnt look too happy i wondered what you were thinking of doing about him hes not my remo hes following you it seems just because were on the same boat doesnt mean ive adopted him is he going to be in a whole lot of trouble back at pearl riffle for deserting dag sighed maybe im not sure he grasps the difference between banished and resigned he doesnt say much fawn considered this or anything hes listening though dag cocked his head think back to when i came to west blue before we were wed it was the first time in a longer life than remos that id ever slept in a farmer house ate at the family table listened to farmers talk to each other remos never even been an exchange patroller never been away from his home camp before any more than whit i think it wont hurt to just let his new impressions accumulate for a while mm said fawn yesterday afternoon while he was on break from his oar he went and stole hawthorns raccoon kit he huddled up in a little dark hideyhole in amongst the stores and coaxed it to curl up on his lap and just sat hunched up around the one little live thing that wasnt mad at him till hawthorn finally missed it and found him and made him give it back nobody on this boat is mad at remo nobody on this boat seems real to remo cept you and you arent best pleased with him dag made a noncommittal noise fawn lifted her chin and went on i dont think its good for lakewalkers to be cut off sudden from everything they know they get to pining i cant argue with that dag sighed she cast him a sharp glance yeah hods looking better fawn observed after a few more paces trying for a lighter note his skins a nicer color and he moves brisker now hes getting the good of his food he hardly uses your stick he watches you he watches remo watching you too she bit her lip maybe not as light as all that jealous isnt quite the right word neither is envious buthod does make me think of a dog with one bone somehow dag nodded its the beguilement cant say as ive had any fresh ideas about that yet you trying becauseow fawn grimaced and stopped the branch shed carelessly shoved out of her face had whipped back proving to be from a thorny honey locust after scratching her scalp it had snagged in her hair hold up dag reached over and gently detangled her snapped the branch and bent it down away from the trail i do purely hate these evil trees find em on patrol all over oleana they dont bear fruit their woods not good for much and theres just no excuse for those thorns i suppose a hedge of them would be good for stopping unwanted visitors better for a bonfire dag hadnt released the branch he had an absent look on his face that made fawn suddenly uneasy nobody would miss this tree if a malice was to groundrip a tree like this it would be a positive good he paused remember that mosquito i groundripped back in lumpton market yes it made you very sick ive been wondering ever since what would happen if i tried something else dag im not sure thats such a great idea just what kind of mood was he in right now after whatever frustrations hed encountered up at that camp yes but seemedicine makers ive been wondering about medicine makers the senior ones do have craft secrets they have such dense groundsits pretty much a marker of the gift not necessarily long groundsense ranges mind hoharie would never make a patroller but she can give ground reinforcements day after day i always thought that was a natural ability but what if its something else i never saw no more mosquitoes said fawn firmly no more bugs of any kind mind what happened to your arm yes but what about this here tree it never would be missed its about a hundred million times bigger than a mosquito i grant you that mosquito did make me itch maybe this would make me all thorny and sessile what are you saying that no one would be able to tell and at his bland look added insincerely sorry his lips twitched fawn couldnt imagine what taking in the ground of a whole tree would do to a person neither could dag she suspected but he was getting an alarmingly intent look on his face eyeing the thornstudded branches and bole the spines were threepronged and stuck out in jagged packs from every possible part of the repulsive thing use some sense she begged at least dont start with a whole tree start with something smaller she scrabbled in the pocket of her skirt found a few tiny lumps still stuck in the seams and freed one here dag held out his hand to receive the gift an oat i was feeding daisy and copperhead earlier one oat he stared down at his palm if you ate an oat it wouldnt make you sick even if you ate a whole bowl of oats not like a big bowl of mosquitoes or of nasty thorns even copperhead wouldnt eat off that tree thatsan interesting parallel huh we do take in the ground of our food and convert iteveryone does lakewalkers farmers animals every living thing natural ground reinforcement he glanced up and down the trail they were quite alone he closed his palm rubbed his hook across the back of his hand and opened it again the oat was gone he wiped a faint gray powder off against the seam of his trouser leg huh he said again his face was suddenly very sober what did it do fawn asked anxiously he rubbed his left arm well i can feel that bit of ground stuck in me not near as unpleasant as the mosquitos got any more oats in your pocket remember your fever and swelling didnt come on right away give that one a day then try another maybe berrys got a whole barrel of oats on the fetch dag said thoughtfully theres a notion to test if you can eat it safely can you groundrip it safely i think id rather just eat my food but i can see where this might be faster in some emergency i dont know dag i think maybe you need a lakewalker partner for this sort of experiment someone who could tell if he was doing dreadful things to his groundand warn her so she could put her foot down because remember that catfish do you think remo would be any help dag let his breath trickle out through pursed lips im not sure i would want to try this in front of young remo this is a pretty disturbing sort of groundwork for any lakewalker whos seen a malice operate has remo dags brows twitched up maybe not spark theres been no reports of malice finds in the pearl riffle patrol area for quite a few years if hes never exchanged then no hes not had that chance yet so he wouldnt know malice magic if he saw it maybe not leaving the thorny honey locust unmolested to her intense relief dag started back down the trail he hugged fawn close to his side as they dodged hindering branches so said fawn if dense ground marks a medicine maker and long groundsense range marks a patroller what do you call someone who has everything knife maker sir or maam there are women knife makers she had only met dar dags hostile knife maker brother hostile to farmer brides anyhow oh yes so what do you call someone who hasnt got either density or range a farmer dag replied with a twitch of his lips then looked down sorry except that he actually was a little fawn tossed her head only it isnt so he went on more thoughtfully we meet a sprinkling of farmers near the threshold of ground functionat least we do if we get out of the camps to patrol and are paying attention aunt nattie you in a way me said fawn surprised ive got no groundsense range ive got no groundsense to have a range none at all he agreed cheerfully she almost poked him but you have unusual groundnot density though theres that too but brightness your ground is very beautiful you know why do you think i call you spark spark i thought it was a pet name for a pet she added provokingly he gave her a pained look but said no its pure description as natural as it would be to call redhaired sassa carrot top carrot tops are green im a farmer girl trust me still she had to smile a little was beauty in the groundsense of the beholder evidently other lakewalkers had not seemed as entranced by her ground as dag maybe it was a matter of taste as the old lady said as she kissed the cowfawn smiled outright in memory at aunt natties old saw yetelusive thoughtwhat if it was so what if it was neither flattery nor infatuation but true report dag was a truthful sort of fellow by preference what if dag really did see her as brighter the way sensitive or sore eyes squinted at the sun the way thirst saw water she asked abruptly what do i give you breath no seriously she stopped he turned to face her i was serious he wore his serious smile anyhow back when hod first came on the fetch you said i didnt know what i gave you every day do you in that moment she discovered the difference between stopped and stopped cold what he said what do i give you in your ground a slow blink he wrapped her in a hug bent his head and explored her mouth in a long kiss not evading the questiontesting it he released her at last his brows drawn in and she came down off her toes balance he said youuntangle me i dont understand neither do i dag she protested if you cant figure this out and tell me who else can he ducked his head in wry accord you make my ground disappear no thats not right he continued as she began to protest again imagineimagine your muscles all full of knots pulled and sore and stiff fighting you with every move you try to make now imagine your muscles when theyre working smooth and warm effortlessly without thought to will is to have is to be all one like a perfect shot hm he wasnt there yet but he had hold of the tail of something she could tell something elusive when i make a perfect shot with my bow which happens from time to time though never often enough i dont just mean get the arrow into the target which i can do pretty consistently in a perfect shot everythings there the same as any ordinary shot yet not for that fleeting moment its likemy worries my body my bow the target even the arrow disappear only the flight is left his hand closed opened my lefthand groundwork is like the flight of the arrow without the arrow he stared down as if his words had fallen into his palm as unexpectedly as a jeweled tooth he just said something important hang on to that farmer girl even if you dont quite get it yet so why am i not beguiled yet hod is youve done groundwork on us both the why and how has to lie somewhere in the space between us three his mouth slowly closed the gold of his eyes turned flat and unreflective but he said only were keeping berry and walked on fawn matched his pace satisfied that her question had not been dismissed his sudden abstraction only marked the wheels in his head turning creakily in unaccustomed directions so maybe i should keep that axle grease coming huh despite the delay from dags fruitless errand the fetch made another eight downriver miles before darkness drove them to shore at supper berry opined that they would reach silver shoals by tomorrow if the river didnt fall overnight dag smiled into his mug of fizzy cider as he watched fawns and whits eyes light up at the news they both quizzed berry and bo about the famous rivertown which filled the time until hawthorn and hod carried the dirty dishes to the back deck to wash up this looked to take a while as hawthorn was attempting to teach his raccoon kit to ride on his shoulder at the same time there was still a long stretch of evening left and it wasnt raining windy or excessively cold bow lessons suggested dag to whit its been a few days since before the distractions of glassforge and pearl riffle whit looked up eagerly but said isnt it too dark the moon wont be up for a while and even then its none too full the fetch has plenty of lanterns if berryll lend us a couple berry nodded looking interested set up one by the target the other by us dag continued easy sounds like a waste of good rock oil and lanterns said bo whit will aim by it not at it or so we hope said dag whit grinned sheepishly you need to learn to shoot in all kinds of light if you were a lakewalker i could teach you to shoot in complete darkness by groundsense those slowmoving trees in broad daylight are getting too easy for you well have to shift you on to peppier targets soon but tonight we can borrow copperheads and daisygoats spare straw bale and set it up above the bank a ways fawn said wait who has to go grope for the misses in the dark well be losing my good arrows arrow retrieval had been her job in whits prior campside lessons mostly due to an understandable protectiveness of her craftwork not a one dag promised you collect the hits and ill undertake to find the misses he cast a mockstern eye on whit that means youd better tighten your aim boy with fawn carrying the lanterns whit thumped off to lug the straw bale onto shore berry followed after bo got up to poke the fire then settled back with his feet to the hearth dag finished his tankard of cider in a more leisurely way remo had listened to all this with a frown now he said youre really teaching that mouthy farmer boy lakewalker bowwork why that would be my tentbrother yes and because he asked remo hesitated i suppose its been a long time since you had a chance to handle a bow yourself he said more quietly were you good once remo hadnt heard all the dag stories from saun it seemed maybe it was the livelier barr that saun had struck up his acquaintance with from his tone dag guessed remo was attempting to apologize pity he isnt better at it dag let a couple of tart replies go including i was a fairly dab hand last week in favor of come on along and make yourself useful if you like there are some things i just cant show whit about his lefthand grip for one remo looked taken aback at the notion dag added evenly you know if youre going to be living with farmers its time you started learning how to talk to em im not going to be living with farmers well it doesnt appear you mean to be living with lakewalkers either what do you figure to perch up a tree with the squirrels and eat acorns all winter its got to be one or the other remos lips compressed dag just shook his head and rose to stroll after fawn and whit he called over his shoulder if you change your mind come on out whit had set up his bale on some deadfall a reasonable distance upstream that being the direction with fewer trees and more level footing and was arguing with fawn over where to place the lantern they compromised on a nearby broken cottonwood stump fawn pinned the increasingly tattered cloth target with the two concentric circles painted on it to the bale the white fabric showed up well in the modest yellow glow they returned to the boat and whit ran inside to get his bow and arrows when he came back out remo followed slowly though only as far as the boats front rail on which he leaned the night was quietthe songs of frogs and insects stilled by the recent frosts the current barely lapping the dark shore dag settled comfortably on a fallen log by the second lantern offering corrections to whits stance and grip as he sped his dozen arrows after that dag had to grunt up and go with fawn to find six of them but the next round he only had to collect two pleased he made whit back up ten paces for the following round then hawthorn arrived agog to be let try at least his hands were clean from the dishwashing and wouldnt leave grubby prints on the bow dag promptly set up whit as hawthorns instructor a good oldpatroller trick to force a novice to focus on his problems from the outside for a change dag grinned to hear some of his own phrases falling glibly from whits lips remo dag was bemused to note kept creeping closer first to the end of the gangplank then to the end of dags log every once in a while his hands twitched if remo owned a bow he had not brought it with him on his crossriver swim well if he wanted to play with this one he would have to ask whit just like hawthorn when dag returned from seeking the next set of misses and had suggested whit move hawthorn rather closer to the target remo said suddenly collecting spent arrows was always work for the beginners not for a captain not for a captain with twentyseven malice kills to his name did he mean on whose behalf was remo offended you fetch back your share when you were a tad did you yes good for you fawn wandered back to watch over dags head finding a task for her restless hands by kneading dags shoulders which disinclined him to get up and run down the shore again she said what about you dag you havent practiced in a while either now spark ive been pulling a sweep half the day im tired if i cant hit that target itll make me look nohow in front of all these youngsters ha she said unsympathetically abandoned her lovely taskhe tried not to whimper out loudand dodged back up the gangplank in a couple of minutes she came back toting dags adapted bow and his wellstocked quiver remo sat upright eyes widening whats that thats my bow dag unscrewed his hook from his wooden wrist cuff dropping it into the leather pouch on his belt he stood put his weight into bending the short heavy bow and strung it setting into his cuff slot the carved bolt that stuck out where the grip would be he rotated the bow once to seat it making sure the string ended up to the inside and snapped the lock down a farmer artificer that fairbolt crow knew up in tripoint made it for me some years ago dag went on and my arm harness and all my gear that goes with it it took us four tries to get a design that would work interesting fellow he started out making wooden arms and legs for miners and foundry men see as the folks in those hills do a deal of that dangerous work hed been a friend of fairbolts back when fairbolt was a young patroller up that way seems you never know when youll need an old friend remos ground was as shuttered as his expression hard to tell how he took this pointed moral he said only it looks like it has a heavy draw aye its a right bear it was all compromises by that point we needed a short length to keep it out of my way if i had to move in a hurry because putting it down takes a minute and dropping it isnt an option at the same time i needed penetrating power when i had two hands i used a much longer bow matching my height and arm length took me months of practice to finally change all my longbow habits his remaining fingers had bled youre pretty matteroffact about it all dag had no idea what remo was going to hear out of this but he chose the truth anyway i wasnt at first i took a long time getting over it a little jerk of his left arm made his meaning clear i wont say no one can be a blighted fool forever because ive seen some try for it but i finally decided i didnt care to be in that company remo grew rather quiet the appearance of this fascinating new device brought hawthorn back bouncing in curiosity whit trailing amiably said oh yeah give us a show dag this rigs no good for teaching you mind it takes a different stance and style than your bow and besides im full of old bad habits you likely shouldnt be allowed to watch whit grinned do as i say not as i do there is that dag agreed hawthorn pulled one of dags heavy steeltipped arrows from the quiver hey these are lots fancier than the ones we were using i bet thesed work better nothing wrong with the ones you were using they all had the same maker dag winked at fawn here give yours to meput that one back now hawthorn said ow and fawn pried the arrow out of his bloodstained grip saying give that over before you poke your eye out those are dags good arrows he doesnt waste them on target practice well what does he use em for dag prudently let that one go by unanswered and swapped for whits quiver he strolled up to a distance from the target about equal to whits longest range hitched his shoulders and spent a leisurely few minutes putting the dozen flinttipped arrows into the general vicinity of the two circles it felt good enough nope hawthorn they all work just fine see you can go collect those hawthorn scampered off my style isnt pretty enough for contest bowwork dag remarked to whit i argue with the purists about that i claim a patroller is going to have to shoot from all sorts of strange positions and that it doesnt pay to get too fussy they claimwell maybe i wont repeat what they claim his muscles felt reasonably warm and loose now fawn was watching him humming unmusically under his breath dag took up his quiver clamped it awkwardly under his left arm and removed about half its contents to give to her for safekeeping leaving twelve of the heavy arrows more loosely packed he shrugged the quiver up over his shoulder and walked back to the shooting spot made an estimate of the range to the straw bale turned and added another dozen paces to it stretched emptied his mind turned back the first arrow went its way with a notably louder twang whits head snapped around from the gangplank where hed been talking to berry the second followed before the first hit the target then the third one after another dag reached set pulled released the extra range hadnt been just swagger he needed all that distance to get that lovely streaming effect of two and three arrows in the air at a time twelve shots in less than a minute its been a while since you did that old patroller he lowered his stubby bow and studied the results well they had all ended up somewhere within the outer circle not a tidy heartshot but that straw bale sure wasnt getting away he rather regretted not being able to spell out d f in quivering feather shafts he could imagine them spelling a trailing sort of argh maybe if he squinted a lot which was almost as good fawn came up beside him peering in fascination was that the pure flight my stars it did look like something almost dag said in satisfaction right workmanlike leastways you can go fetch those whit whit trotted off dag sensibly decided to quit while he was ahead he did off his equipment and turned the makeshift range back over to whit hawthorn was ruthlessly set aside when berry watching from a seat on the gangplank barely hinted that she might like to try her hand dag gave himself over to an indolent seat on the log and a cozy cuddle with his wife it was getting chilly hed favor going in soon fawn nudged him and pointed grinning remo was now standing up talking to whit earnestly demonstrating some fine point of gripping a bow dag replied with a finger laid to the side of his nose and a lift of his eyebrows his lips twitched up when next it came time to collect berrys misses remo waved dag back and went with whit a loud thump from the boat turned both berrys and dags heads around what was that said berry but as no more noises followed she turned back to watch whit and remo dag stayed twisted brows knotted hod whats the fool boy gone and done now in another few moments bo stuck his head through the front hatch and called lakewalker you want to come in here for a minute no i dont dag could not answer he rose waving the concerned berry back to the game with whit and remo fawn gave him a sharp look and tagged along in the kitchen and bunk space he found hod sitting on the floor in front of the hearth with his right trouser leg rolled up rocking and whimpering what happened dag asked i fell down out on the back deck sniveled hod hurt my knee fix cant you fix it again please fawn drew breath in ready sympathy dag sighed knelt and let his palm hover above the joint opening himself briefly the damage was not deep but hod had definitely recracked one of the healing fissures in his kneecap blight it fawn said sternly hod were you trying to carry too much at a time again remember what i told you about a lazy mans load no i just fell down hod protested he seemed to think a moment i was trying not to step on the raccoon a quick groundsense check found the kit snoozing peacefully in dag and fawns bedroll dag looked up and frowned bo caught his gaze and lifted his hairy brows after a long considering pause he said slowly actually that kit was nowhere around didnt sound like hod tripped on the deck either i think he slammed into the back wall hod blurted in a flustered voice you didnt see me then added belatedly yeah thats right i tripped and fell against the wall dag sat back on his heels taking in the ugly implications hod tell me the truth did you just go and knock your own knee into the wall on purpose hod would not meet his gaze fell he muttered belligerently dag drew a long breath hods was a real injury but not a real emergency there was no need for hasty stopgaps dag could take time slow down think that didnt feel like his best skill right now but maybe like bowwork it took practice i wonder if my brain will bleed hod seemed stupid and surly but maybe those were just other words for inarticulate and terrified dag had won this trouble by making assumptions about hod when his own habits of concealment met hods mute bewilderment it wasnt any wonder that enlightenment didnt generally follow hod you were standing right there on the front deck when i did the groundwork on cresss bellyhurt did you hear what i said to her and mark about beguilement did you understand it hod managed somehow to shake his head yes and no at the same time dag couldnt tell if that meant he hadnt heard hadnt understood or was just uncertain if it was safe to admit to either do you even know what beguilement is did dag it seemed he was finding out hod shook his head again but then offered lakewalker magic they make people give them bargains or make the girlshe shot a glance at fawn and turned redwant to go out to the woodpile with em the latter dag guessed being a hodism or perhaps glassforge slang for seduction its not either of those things he asserted possibly untruthfully at least it wasnt either of those in this case and he didnt want those slanderousor cautionary pick onenotions cluttering up hods thinking or his own you and i are both finding out just what beguilement really is because i beguiled you by accident when i healed your smashed knee it seems to happen when a farmerthats youexperiences lakewalker groundwork and wants it to happen again wants it so bad he or she will do crazy things to get it he let his finger tap the swollen skin over the knee hod whimpered hurts said hod complaint or placation no doubt what i want to know is why you want a ground reinforcement again so bad youd go and hurt yourself to coax one out of me hod looked as panicked as a possum in a leghold trap he gulped but kept his lips clamped its not a trick question blight it hod jumped dag gentled his tone lakewalkers give each other ground reinforcements all the timewell oftenand they dont work like that on us i have to know because ive a notion a dream leastways that id really like to settle down with fawn someplace and be a medicine maker who heals farmers but i sure cant do that if ill make all my patients crazy im really hoping you can help me figure it out oh said hod in a voice absent gods of hoddish enlightenment me help you me he looked up at dag and blinked why didnt you say why hadnt he said maybe he should go out to that back deck and hit say his head against the wallhe glanced up to find fawn looking at him with her arms crossed and her brows up as if she quite seconded hods question evading answering dag went on first off this has to stop you cant go on hurting yourself just to get a ground reinforcement hod looked up in hope would you give me one without me hurting i dont think id better give you any more at all im not sure if beguilement wears off over time or not but im pretty sure repeating makes it worse oh hod gingerly petted his knee and blinked tears you gonna make mewait if only i had two hurt hods i could make one wait and one not and compare and then id know which one would i get to be dag couldnt quite figure out an answer to this he ran his hand through his hair fawn put in in a way you do have another hod to do the waiting cress if we ever get back to pearl bend say next spring you could check up on her good point spark hod too brightened he looked at fawn almost favorably i guess that frees me up to try something else dag squinted into the fire he hated to interrupt the first voluntary interchange remo had enjoyed with his boatmates since the start of this trip but needs must fawn would you go ask remo to come inside for a moment please her brows twitched up but she nodded and went off in a few minutes remo shouldered through the shadowed supplies into the firelight and lantern glow of the kitchen area fawn trailing he frowned at hod and looked his question at dag whats this ah remo said dag glad youre here have you been taught how to give minor ground reinforcements out on patrol verel taught all of us who had the knack said remo cautiously ive never had a chance to try it out for real good then its time you had some practice i would like you to put a reinforcement into hods hurt knee here remo stared shocked but hes a farmer i thought you wanted to break the rules not that one youre choosy all of a sudden dag rubbed his lips reminded that remo hadnt been there to witness cress or hods original injury either dag steeled himself and gave a brisk description of both incidents finishing with hod beguiled by me already the last thing i want to do is make it worse what i dont know is what would happen if a beguilement was divided amongst two lakewalkers im hopingwondering leastwaysif the division might halve the problem remos lip jutted in suspicion are you trying to foist this off on me no said dag patiently im trying to solve a groundwork problem for myself yes but if i can solve it for myself there might be a chance id solve it for a lot of other medicine makers as well it seems worth a shot i thought you were a patroller old habits die hard did you think i quit only because i ran mad over a pretty little farmer girl a third my age fawn raised her brows ironically at him he tipped her a wink im also becomingtrying to becomea maker im just not sure of what take a good look at hods knee down to the ground and tell me if im wrong about that ambition reluctantly remo knelt down next to dag beside hod who gave him a worried smile he glanced aside at dag and opened his ground for the first time in days dag saw remos wince as the unveiled farmer grounds pressed upon him the dark old knots of the watching bo the mess of hod fawns brightness it took him a moment to draw his focus in upon the injury when he did his brows climbed you did all that verel doesnt pull breaks together that tight i could have wished for verel or someone to guide and guard me i almost groundlocked myself remos ground open to dag at last was in about the uproar he expected upset patrollerhe knew the flavor well sometimes he regretted that reading grounds did not give access to thoughts although most of the time he had better sense we already know too much about each other who knew what remo would perceive of him whats on your mind he asked gently remo licked his lip still a little sore i dont know what you want from me he blurted you didnt have any use for me before dag almost said i just told you what i wanted but hesitated how do you figure remo hung his head and muttered never mind its stupid he made to lumber up but dag held out his spread hand stop remo drew breath when you got in trouble the other day with that fish you called for whit the farmer not for me remo the botchup well he added fiercely why would you remo who hadnt been able to save his partner from trouble before leaving aside the flash of jealousy about whit remo was wounded it seemed in his oversensitive conscientiousness dag couldnt hand him back his selfesteem giftwrapped he wondered if it was time for the full tale of wolf ridge again he was reminded of maris trick of hauling him and his maiming along when she wanted to shame local farmers into pitching in with pay or supplies after a malice kill in their area and grimaced in distaste no parading his old griefs to shame remo was not the right road remo had shame enough for two already youre making this too hard old patroller keep it simple you were on your oar whit was off duty thats all not everything is about you youngster though i know you cant see that right now he was also reminded of fawns farmer joke about the parents curse may you have six children all just like you was there an equivalent patrol captains curse that would explain a lot remo swallowed oh a flush bloomed and faded in his face but some of the tension went out of him dag refrained from pointing out that hed have yelled for remo before hawthorn or hod lest the touchy pearl riffle boy just think himself called the secondbest of a bad lot tact old patroller they were getting somewhere here remos hand went out toward hods knee then drew back is he going to end up following me around like he does you dag rejected both if i knew i wouldnt have to test it and he cant follow both of us leastways as answers he glanced down at hod who was staring up anxiously why dont you ask otherwise youre about to do intimate groundwork upon a person you havent spoken to directly since you came into the room remo reluctantly looked hod in the face are you going to get stuck on me he demanded hod did that yesno headshake again as confusing to remo as to everyone else dunno he offered after a moment dont want to but my knee hurts all throbby and i want to help dag dont you want to help dag remo scratched his head glanced sideways i guess i do dag had talked young patrollers through their first fuzzy groundgiftings before remo gave him no surprises on that score the actual transfer was the work of an instant hod gasped as the palpable warmth eased his joint dag gave hod some stern warnings about taking better care of himself hereafter and no more tricks hod shook his head hard and unambiguously at that one whit berry and hawthorn came in then cheeks pink from the night chill to put away their assorted equipment dag feeling as drained as if it had been him rather than remo to give the ground reinforcement sagged wearily into a chair by the hearth and let fawn explain to the boat boss just what all had been going on in here which she did with an accuracy almost as embarrassing to remo as to hod since she managed to do this while simultaneously feeding everyone warm apple pie however they all got over it pretty smoothly dag was then treated to an entirely unexpected halfhour of listening to a lot of farmers sitting around over plates of crumbs seriously discussing problems of lakewalkerfarmer beguilement not as dark magical threat but as something more like navigating a channel that had just had all its snags and sand bars shifted by a flood save for fawn and whit their ideas were confused and their suggestions mostly useless it was their tones of voice that subtly heartened him remo hearing mainly the confusion at first folded his arms and looked plagued but then was drawn despite himself into what dag suspected were his first halting efforts to explain lakewalker disciplines to outsiders the party broke up for bed with the woes of the world unsolved but dag felt strangely satisfied nonetheless fawn passing hod caught him on the shoulder and said you know you could have come out and asked for a turn on whits bow too same as hawthorn try it next time hod looked startled his lips peeled back in a grin over his crooked teeth and he bobbed his head in a gratified nod had he just needed an invitation what brooding over a purely imagined exile had led him to the wall what distress was so painful that such a brutal selfharm seemed a better choice dag wondering managed to add a good night hod sleep hard to fawns shrewd words which won another gratified headbob and a flush of pleasure following fawn forward dag blew out his breath in contemplation after calling hawthorn to come collect his raccoon who after its nap now wanted to romp they curled around each other in their warming nest fawn murmured hows your oat doing surprised dag rubbed his left arm id almost forgotten it huh it seems to be converted already hardly anything left there but a little warm spot maybe tomorrow ill try ten oats i was thinking two five he hesitated i think im glad you talked me out of that tree uhhuh she said dryly he could feel her sleepy smile against his shoulder she added after a moment you really got remo going tonight if only we could get him to quit confusing farmers with their livestock i think hed be a decent sort is he that bad he doesnt mean ill i didnt think he did hes justfull of lakewalkerish habits or he was before he got tipped out of his cradle i spect our river trip isnt quite the rebellion he thought he was signing up for she snickered her breath warm in the hollow of his skin dag said more slowly he was just an ordinary patroller before his knife got broken but if ordinary folks cant fix the world its not going to get fixed there are no lords here the gods are absent you know it sounds real attractive at first but im not sure id want lords and gods fixing the world because i think theyd fix it for them not necessarily for me theres a point spark he whispered she nodded and her eyes drifted shut his stayed open for rather a long while to the excitement of everyone aboardalthough fawn thought that dag and bo concealed it bestthe fetch approached silver shoals around noon it was another gray chilly day promising but not delivering rain climbing to her midroof perch again fawn was glad for her jacket on the north bank of the river lay a village and ferry landing which remo at his sweep eyed uncertainly is that silver shoals its four times the size of pearl bend oh thats not the town said berry leaning on her steering oar to keep the flatboat midchannel thats just a road crossing waitll we get around this bluff and the next curve she did shade her eyes and frown at the watergauge pole sticking up near the landing rivers falling again i think well take the shoals while we still can and tie up below i dont want to get caught above for another week remo grew very quiet as the shore shifted and the town covering the southern hillsides eased at last into view dag joining him at his oar seemed to study his stare many of the houses were painted white or even colors spots of brightness amongst the now nearly leafless trees some newer taller buildings were brick and fawn wondered if one might be the famous mint wood and coal smoke smudged the damp air and the shoreline was crowded with smelly but lively businesses needing access to watertanners dyers a soapmaker a reeking mussel fishery a boatyard mills fawn supposed lined the feeder creeksshe could see at least one from here partway up the hill a sawmill at a guess wagons drawn by straining teams rattled up and down the muddy streets and pedestrians strode on boardwalks the town was bigger than lumpton market and glassforge put together and easily forty times the size of pearl bend at berrys sharp reminder all the gawkers turned their attention to navigating the growling shoals which were much like pearl riffle only more so a few skeletal boats hung up in the wrack gave warning of the fate of the unwary or unlucky dag passed back laconic remarks about hidden hazards to berry which by now she took in with no more comment than nods and they cleared the shelves boulders and bars without once scraping the hull which made her grin there followed some heavy pulling by all the oarsmen to bring the fetch in to shore a couple dozen boats both flatboats and keels were tied along a more level stretch amongst not one but several wharf boats each with its own collection of goodssheds upslope from it the road between was dotted with wagons drawn up either by the sheds or the boats and toiling teams of wharf rats loading or unloading goods you could get lost up in that town remo muttered in dismay which made a smile flit over dags mouth whit frankly gaped hod a glassforge boy was less impressed instead earnestly intent on carrying out with hawthorn his task of throwing and tying ropes as they nudged into the bank once the fetch was safely wedged between another flat and a keel berry made inquiries of the neighboring loiterers for downriver news but both boats were from upstream like themselves bo ran out the gangplank and berry led the way on a climb up to the nearest goodsshed fawn following her by invitation whit just following in the front rooms of the goodssheds they found counters with clerks or clerkowners with the latter berry bartered for her cargohides and barrel staves bear grease and the dying cider with all she asked after news of her papas boat which might have passed through here last fall this mostly drew headshakes but also remarks about some tripoint feller whod been by lately asking similar questions about missing boats and hed likely want to talk to you which would have been more useful if theyd remembered his name or direction but in the third goodsshed the merchant not only pulled out his record book from eleven months ago and found an entry of a purchase of hides from the clearcreek briar rose the fourth recognizably initialed by boss clearcreek but identified the curious tripoint man he told berry to look for a trader by the name of capstone cutter likely to be found this time of day at a mussel tavern up the street behind the goodssheds from this clerkowner berry made her only purchase some boxes of pearl and motherofpearl buttons that were one of the rivertowns more famous products berry told whit to hang on to his window glass just as she was hanging on to her tripoint tool stocks because hed get a much better price downstream which made plain what fawn had suspected for some time whit wasnt heading back home from silver shoals after all fawn supposed she ought to at least make him write a letter to mama and papa or write one herself she wondered how to get her missive to west blue without a lakewalker courier to tap likely that last merchant the smart one had ways of getting news to and from lumpton market at least she would ask him later meanwhile she hurried up the boardwalk after berry whit following cumbered with the button boxes then across the mucky street to a building with a swinging sign announcing it as the silver mussel painted with a picture of a shell with little feet buggy eyes and unlikely smiling teeth if those creatures at all resembled their portrait fawn didnt think she wanted one anywhere near her mouth cooked or not but the smell as they entered the door was nothing at all like the stench from the mussel fishery down on the riverbank being mainly a heady steam of garlic and onion intertwined with the sweet tang of fresh beer whit inhaled and smiled inside was a big room with sawdust on the floor and a long counter along one side scullions and serving boys were clearing tables in a leisurely fashion that suggested the lunch rush was over fawns eye followed berrys as it swept the room and caught up on a man who could well be their quarry sitting alone at a table at the far end a big fellow about my age the fortyish merchant had said running to fat curly brown hair very nicetrimmed beard dresses like a riverman right enough but all his gear was the best berry nodded as if in confirmation and wove amongst the tables toward him he looked up from the mussel shell he was exploring and smiled vaguely at the two young women but swallowed what he was chewing in quick surprise when berry stopped by his side and said mister cutter from tripoint cap cutter and aye he replied what can i do for you missand miss an afterthought of a nod also acknowledged whit berry stuck out her workroughened hand im boss berry clearcreek of the fetch this heres my sweepman whit bluefield and my friend and cook missus fawn bluefield cutters eyebrows rose a little at her claim but lowered again as he shook her hand and she returned his boatmans grip he nodded to fawn and whit married and corrected himself even before the bluefield grimaces with oh brother and sister aye i hear you been asking about missing boats said berry his general friendliness gave way to something more urgent did you all come from downriver nothe fetch is a flatbut were heading that way see last fall my papa and brother took a flat down from clearcreek and never came back no word it was like they just vanished so im on the lookout for them or news of them the boats were missing disappeared in this springs rise much later but here sit he halfrose gesturing at the other three chairs around the square plank table an uncleared plate opposite him piled high with empty shells indicated that a companion had leftperhaps another informant cutter sank back frowning a little as they settled themselves boats asked fawn curiously more than one he nodded i started out as a keeler out of tripoint till i married and the tads started coming along and my missus wanted me more settled so i took up a goodsshed there and started sending cargoes instead of hauling them first cargoes then a boat then two boats then four my luck was fair in general and ive mostly found steady men for my bosses they were good boats too solid work out of beaver creek not like those homemade tubs the hills boys cobble together with green or rotten timbers and bad caulkingi lost a cargo on one of those flats once learned my lesson it went down on a sunny day in nineteen feet of clear water stove in i swear when it struck nothing harder than the head of a yellowbellied catfish having seen a channel cat fawn was not so sure this represented defects in the boat but she held her peace sound boats sound crews cutter went on but two out of four didnt come back this summer and when i got to asking around turned out they werent the only ones theres nine boats or flattie crews out of the tripoint area didnt come back when they should of you might expect to lose one or two a season but nine and even sunk boats come up again or are seen or salvaged bodies come up too and folks who have the snagging and burying of em generally pass the word along when we all got together and figured it it was right plain someone needed to go take a closer look and i was it losing those two boats was a blow to me i dont mind telling you a scullion interrupted then clearing the odd plate and asking if theyd like anything fawn shook her head warily and berry intent on cutter waved the offer away but whit ordered a plate of mussels and a beer to go with my papa was twenty years and more on the river berry said after the scullion departed a good boatbuilder and his crew was all local fellows whod gone down and back with him before i usually went along myself cept this last time cutters eyes opened say do you play the fiddle berry nodded i got good pay playing the keeler boys upstream his smile turned a shade more respectful not that hed been at all rude before some kind of river fellowship at work fawn guessed ive heard tell of you yellowheaded gal who travels with her daddy and scrapes real lively has to be he sucked out the contents of another mussel shell and went on my keel tied up down the bank is the tripoint steel and i picked my crew special big fellows all and weve come pretty wellarmed this time some of them were missing friends or kin too and volunteered when they heard what i was up to whatever this trouble is were hoping to find it berry rubbed her nose steel wont help if it was sickness or shipwreck but i admit it sounds right heartening are you thinking it was some kind o boat bandits boatmens been robbed before its true but usually word gets out pretty quick cutter scratched his short beard in doubt there would be the hitch in it so many gone so quietlikesome of us think theres something uncanny about it his mouth tightened like maybe sorcery or worse thing is not only are the boats and bodies not showing up between the outlet of the grace and graymouth neither are the goods seemingly which makes a fellow wonderwhat if they were diverted north to luthlia instead up the gray into that wild lakewalker country fawn sat up in indignation lakewalkers wouldnt rob farmer boats cutter shook his head they were valuable cargoes fine tripoint steel and iron goods plus id sent a deal of silver coin along with my keel bosses to buy tea and spices with down south anyone could be tempted but for some it might beeasier it makes no sense fawn insisted leaving aside that lakewalkers just dont do things like that luthlias one of the few lakewalker hinterlands that makes iron and steel on its own and its good work too ive seen some dag says luthlian mines and forges supply blades to the camps north of the dead lake nearly to seagate they can make steel that doesnt even rust why would they rob yours cutters voice lowered yeah but theres also the missing bodies to be accounted for i can think of another reason they might not turn up downstream and it aint a pretty one he ran a thumbnail between his teeth in a significant gesture then glanced guiltily at the paling berry sorry miss but a man cant help thinking fawn wanted to jump up and stalk out in a huff but whits mussels and beer arrived just then and by the time the scullion took himself off again she had remastered her wits i can think of a reason a lot more likely than lakewalkerswho do not either eat peoplefor folks to go missing and thats malices blight bogles i was mixed up in that malice kill near glassforge last springas close a witness as i could be bogles take farmer slaves if they can if ones set up on the river itd be just as happy to take boatmen slaves id imagine and it wouldnt necessarily know about selling stolen goods downstream although its new minions might could a malice dispatch them to such a distance without risking losing control of them maybe not and yetthe whole grace valley was wellpatrolled not only by lakewalkers from the several ferry camps strung along the river but also by any lakewalkers passing up or down in their narrow boats it wasnt a neglected backwoods region by any means could a malice as strong as the glassforge one pass undetected for a year or more the glassforge one did she reminded herself i need to tell dag about this cutter looked as if the idea of a river bogle didnt sit well with him but he didnt reject it out of hand if it was a malice snatching boats all cutters big men with big knives would be no use to him but a lot of use to the malice fawn shivered whit watching her mulish expression anxiously said hey fawn try one of these and pushed his plate of gaping mussel shells toward her she picked one up and eyed it berry leaned over and showed her how to detach the morsel from its housing fawn chewed dubiously without as much effect as she would have thought gulped and stole some of whits beer for a chaser berry absently helped herself to a few more if you find a pearl cutter put in watching fawn with some amusement you get to keep it they take back the shells though all those buttons after all still the notion of a pearl was enough to make her try one more till whit pulled back his plate in defense cutter turned more seriously to berry your missing folks arent necessarily connected to ours or else the problem goes back farther than i thought but my keel will be downriver before your flat i expect and i can ask after your folks too while im asking what are the names again cutter listened carefully to berrys descriptions of her papa brother buckthorn alder and their crewmen she didnt mention her betrothal and from the pause in his chewing fawn thought whit noticed this remarking that two sets of ears were better than one cutter returned the names and some descriptions of the tripoint boats and bossesbewildering to fawn especially as some boats were named after men but berry seemed to follow it all berry even remarked of one boat or boss oh i know that keel papa and us worked it upriver from graymouth bout three years back which made cutter nod cutter leaned back looking over the two young women and whit and asked so what do you have for muscle on your fetch sides this sawedoff boy here which made whit sit up and put his shoulders back frowning two tall fellers and my uncle bo whos canny when hes sober couple of boat boys not mentioning fawn noticed that the two tall fellows were shifty lakewalkers was berry actually growing protective of her unusual sweepmen cutters mouth tightened in concern if i were you girls id find another flat or two to float with sos you can watch out for each other going down if its river bandits theyre more like to cut out a stray than tackle a crowd theres safety in numbers berry nodded acknowledgment of the point without precisely agreeing to the plan and they took their leave of the tripoint man fawn still fuming over cutters slander of lakewalkers hadnt been going to repeat that part to dag when they all got back to the fetch but alas the excited whit promptly did dag responded only with his peculiar expressionless expression lowering and raising his eyelids which fawn recognized as his i am not arguing look that could conceal anything from bored weariness to silent rage dismissing the slur however dag was a lot more interested in the news about the other lost boats he agreed with fawns hopeful suggestion that a river malice seemed unlikely due to the heavy patrolling in the region but his hand she noticed absently rubbed his neck where a cord for a sharing knife sheath no longer hung just before supper finding herself briefly alone on the back deck with whit fawn said you know berrys still betrothed to her alder as far as she knows what are you going to do if we find him downstream somewhere whit scratched his head well theres this i figure if we find out hes died shell need a shoulder to cry on and if we find out that hes run off with some other girl and dont love her anymoreshell still need a shoulder to cry on i got two shoulders so i guess im ready for anything what if we find him and rescue him from from i dont know what and they still want each other whit twitched his brows rescue from what its been too long if he loved her proper hed have come back to her if he had to crawl up that riverbank on his hands and knees all the way from graymouth which hes had plenty of time to do id say no i aint afraid of alder even if alders out of the picture one way or another doesnt mean youre in whit eyed her appraisingly berry likes you well enough it wouldnt hurt you to put in a good word for me now and then he added after a moment or at least stop ragging me fawn reddened but replied the way you always stopped ragging me when i begged or burst out cryin whit reddened too we was younger huh they stared moodily at each other after another moment whit blurted im sorry years of tormentin to be fixed with one im sorrywhen you finally want something from me fawns lips tightened she hated to be so weakly forgiving but under the circumstancesill think about it i like berry too but couldnt help adding which puts me in a puzzle whether to promote your cause or not mind you wellwhit sighedmaybe well find her alder and you and mell both look nohow turning away he muttered dolefully under his breath i wonder if hes tall dag sat on the edge of the fetchs roof in the dark legs dangling over gingerly testing his groundsense the familiar warmth of copperhead daisygoat and the chickens the known shapes of the people near him whit and hawthorn out back cleaning up after supper and amiably arguing sparks bright flame collaborating with berry on rebuilding a bednest after their stack of supporting hides had been sold out from under them today remo sitting in a corner with his ground wrapped up tight a nearly transparent smudge bo had gone off he said to ask around the taverns after further news of the clearcreek briar rose a plan that had made berry grimace hod had gone along dag widened his reach to the other boats nearby holding dozens of people more up to the line of goodssheds more comfortably deserted except for a night watchman or two and a loiterer who might or might not be looking for an unlocked door the river behind lively with moving water plants a certain amount of floating scum suspiciously rich in lifeground a few fish with their bright fishy auras crayfish creeping and mussels clinging in the rocks and mud still wider across the street to the buildings thumping with lives boiling in his perceptionsawake asleep arguing scheming making love making hate the warm groundglow of a mama nursing a child thats three hundred paces try for more on the far shore of the river ducks slept concealed in the scrub heads tucked under their wings in a barn up the bank tired oxen dozed after a day of hauling boats up over the shoals along the wellbeaten towpath a dozen houses were clustered around the towing station and ferry landing and more goodssheds dag could have counted their inhabitants thats over half a mile yes he studied the ground in his own left arm the five oats that hed surreptitiously groundripped this morning stolen from a handful fed to copperhead were all turned to daggish warm spots the ten hed snitched at lunch were well on their way to conversion his ground seemed healthy and dense the old blighted patches fading away like paling bruises he quietly extended his ghost hand drew it back in and again once so erratic and frightening the ground projection was coming under his control even fine control why did i fear this perhaps hed try groundripping something even bigger tomorrow not a treeimpressed with sparks shrewd guess hed stick to food for now the shadow of remos closed ground like a ripple in clear water moved beneath him the young patroller ducked out the front hatch and straightened by dags knee looking up at him a brief flicker as he opened a little and found dag open wide remo turned his head and stared back up the hill toward the many lights of silver shoals scattered up the slope and over the slopes beyond even at this hour there were a few wagons and people wandering the streets beyond the line of goodssheds light and laughter burst from the door of the mussel tavern as it swung open and closed loud enough to carry down to the waterside how can you stand the noise remo asked pressing his hands to his head in a gesture of pained dismay he didnt of course mean the sounds of the actually quite peaceful autumn night that came to their ears silver shoals had to be the largest collection of unveiled humanity hed encountered in all his short life dag considered him then gestured friendlylike to the space on the roof edge beside him remo clambered up easily hed pretty much fully healed from his beating due to a combination of verels earlier ground treatments plenty of good food and simple outdoor exercise although mostly dag suspected glumly due to youth farmer grounds a bit noisy dag said but you can get used to it its good ground just a lot of it its blighted ground that hurts malice ground now that hurts like nothing else in the wide green world remo looked appropriately daunted by this reminiscence dag went on still its a lot to take in even for townsfolk if you study them youll notice that they pass by each other in the street with a lot less looking or talking than village or hamlet farmers do they have to learn not to look because theres no way they can stop and deal with everyone when theres thousands its not groundveiling but its something like in their heads i think in a way it makes big towns safmore comfortable for lakewalkers alone than tiny ones townsmen are more used to ignoring odd folks but theres more of them to gang up on you if theres trouble said remo doubtfully also true dag conceded try opening up to the limit of your groundsense range just once to see what happens i promise it wont kill you not instantly maybe muttered remo but he obeyed brows rather clenched he opened himself wider and wider the watershadow of his ground gradually thickened and became perceptible to dag in all its dense complexity the boys got a groundsense range of a good halfmile dag thought in satisfaction remo was clearly wellplaced as a patroller maybe a future patrol leader if he could be lured away from wrecking himself on the rocks of his own mistakes with a muttered oof remo let his groundsense recoil but not dag noted all the way it was still open to perhaps the dimensions of the fetch and its residents and to dag remo rubbed his forehead thatssomething town like this has a tremendous groundroil dag agreed its life thoughthe opposite of blight as much as any woods or swamp more if our long war is meant to hold back the blight and sustain the worlds ground if you look at it rightways a place like thishe nodded at the slopes the lamplights spread across them like fireflies out of seasonis our greatest success remo blinked as this odd thought nudged into his brain dag hoped it would stir things up a bit in there dag drew breath leaned forward the fact that this town is also a vast groundbanquet for any malice that chances to emerge too close troubles me hugely what all had you heard down at pearl riffle camp about the losses in our summers campaign over in raintree remo replied seriously it was bad i heard a place called bonemarsh camp was wholly blighted and they lost seventy or a hundred folks in the retreat did the name of greenspring even come up wasnt that some farmer village the malice first came up near praise fairbolt at least that much got in yes had you heard their losses i didnt read the circular myself just heard talk about it lots id guess youd guess right they lost nearly half their people about five hundred folk in all including almost all their children because you know a malice goes for youngsters first absent gods you should have seen that malice when we slew it after that fair feast i never knew one could grow so ghastly beautiful sessiles early molts theyre crude and ugly creatures and you get to thinking ugliness is what malices are all about but its not its not dag fell silent but then shook off the haunting memory and forged on while he still had remos ground and mind open i took my patrol through greenspring on the way home and we came upon some townsmen whod come back to bury their dead it was high summer but most of the victims had been groundripped so they were slow to rot i counted down the row so pale they were like ice children in that gray heathow long a trench do you think youd have to dig remo to bury all the youngsters in silver shoals remos lips parted he shook his head itd be about a mile long i figure said dag evenly at the least estimate id have dragged every lakewalker i know down that row if i could have but i couldnt so now i have to do it with words and maybe his clumsy words were working better here with silver shoals spread in front of remos eyes than they would have in the comfortable isolation of pearl riffle camp i can see the problem said remo slowly absent gods be praised but i dont see what more we can do about it i mean were already patrolling as hard as we can its not our patrolling that needs to change itssee the thing is if the greenspring folks had known more about malices about lakewalkers about all we do someone might have got out with word earlier more livesnot all i know but moremight have been saved at greenspring and bonemarsh need not have been blighted any if we could have been warned and taken the malice quick before it started to move south and the only way i know to get farmers to know more is to start teaching em remos eyes widened as he gauged the lights of the town how could we possibly teach them all already remo was past the usual response how could we teach any of em farmers cant followed by whatever lakerwalkerish conceit first occurred dag nearly smiled well now if we had to lift and carry each and every farmer all at once wed break our backs sure but if we could start by teaching some farmers someplacemaybe after that they could teach each other save each other if they can only grab the right tools these folks are good at tools i find he raised his left arm his hook and the buckles of his harness gleamed briefly in the faint yellow lantern lights remo fell silent staring up the shore after a while dag said fawn and whit are mad to see the town mint tomorrow morning before we go on down the river want to come along remos ground closed altogether is it safe for lakewalkers alone up there remo had barely ventured off the fetch if he hadnt been pressed into helping with the unloading earlier dag wasnt sure he would have set foot on land at all yes said dag recklessly he suspected that remo would follow him from sheer habit if he displayed a patrol leaders confidence and no need to enlighten the youth as to how hollow a confidence that so often was besides we wont be alone ill think about it said remo cautiously he added after a little silence whit sure likes his money yet its nothing in its ground just metal chips if money has a ground it exists inside folks heads dag agreed but its mighty convenient for trade its like a memory of trade you can hold in your hand and take anywhere anywhere it was recognized four great farmer townsall along this river system curiously enoughcoined their own money these days in addition to odd lots of coin left from the ancient days that turned up from time to time the clerks in the goodssheds were gaining a lot of practice in figuring dag guessed making the coins all dance fairly with one anotheror sometimes hed heard not so fairly in which case people got a lot of practice at arguing even lakewalkers used farmer coin and not only while out patrolling lakewalker camp credit is better said remo bandits cant knock you on the head and take it away from you its not a temptation to the weakwilled or cruel it cant be stolen with a cudgel dag agreed his mood darkening in memory but it can be stolen with words trust me on that remo looked over at him in some wonder but before he could inquire further bo and hod turned up at the foot of the gangplank hod had one of bos arms drawn over his shoulder and was getting him aimed down the middle of the boards dag was surprised to see them one of the reasons berry had been amenable to the proposed trip to the mint in the morning despite the delay to their departure was that she hadnt expected her uncle back tonight shed figured she and hawthorn who had been taken to the mint once by their papa on a previous trip would use the time looking for bo while fawn and whit went off touring bo was saying querulously to hod i still dont see the point of making me drink all that water it just took up space for better bevrages and i have to piss just as bad your headll feel better in the morning hod assured him its a good trick i know about really yeah well well see muttered bo but let hod steer him over the gangplank his knees buckled on the jump down but hod kept him upright despite several hours of following bo around silver shoals riverside taverns hod was pretty sober dag noted hod looked up at dag and remo watching from the roof and cast them a shy smile he maneuvered the old man inside to be greeted with even greater surprise by berry well thats interestin murmured dag how so said remo seems hods got a talent for managing difficult drunks i wasnt expecting anything like that you wonder where and how he learned it so young remos brows drew down he was quiet for a long time kind of disturbing in a way in light of how he flinches at most everything uhhuh said dag pleased at remo for following through that far the boy might make a patrol leader someday after all if he survived remo was open enough again to sense the ripple of approval in dags ground and his spine straightened a bit unwittingly dag smiled and slid down off the roof to go find out what fawn had arranged for their bedding to fawns bemusement remo tagged along on the trip to the mint which made her wonder what dag had been saying to him last night shed thought remo had been too terrified of the town to set foot in it he started the tour with a set look on his face that could more easily be mistaken for disapproval which made her wonder in turn what emotions some of dags grimmer looks maskeda lakewalker bride would not have to guess she reflected with a sigh at the last moment dag thought to ask hod if he wanted to come along which made the boy turn red with pleasure and nod mutely and vigorously disappointingly the mint was not in operation that day but in return for a few copper crays a man took visitors around answered their questions and fawn suspected kept an eye on them he certainly eyed the pair of lakewalkers askance even idle the coinstamping presses were fascinating almost as complex as aunt natties loom and much heavier sessile dag muttered staring at them over her shoulder with profound lakewalker suspicion of sitting targets remo nodded agreement on the walk back through town she and whit were diverted by a shop selling tools and hardwarenot a blacksmithery as nothing but small repairs were done on the premises but more like a goodsshed most of the items for sale seemed to come from upriver including a fascinating tripoint stove cast entirely of black iron with an iron pipe acting as a chimney to take the smoke away it was like an iron hearthoven box turned inside out made to stand out into a room with the fire on the inside look fawn told dag in excitement it has to be so much better for heating because a fireplace only shows one face to a room and this thing shows what six six times better and you wouldnt have to bend and crouch to cook on it and it wouldnt blow smoke in your face either and youre less like to catch your clothes or hair on fire too oh i want one he stared at it and her in mild alarm youd need a wagon and team to shift it spark naturally you wouldnt cart it around with you any more than you would a fireplace fire pit she revised thinking of lakewalkers camps it would have to be planted someplace permanent hm he said looking at her with one of his odder smiles farmer tool well of course she tossed her head imagining someplace permanent where you could plant such a stove and a garden and children not a lakewalker camp theyd proved that not a farmer village or at least not west blue a town like this one maybe not as such a big concentration of folks plainly made lakewalkers deeply uncomfortable where then regretfully she allowed dag and remo to drag them away from the fascinating emporium back on the fetch they found a crisis brewing as berry and bo were ready to cast off but hawthorns raccoon kit had disappeared bo was all for leaving without the pesky creature assuring the distraught hawthorn that his pet would swim down the river and find a new home in the woods just fine hawthorn envisioned more dire fates loudly then the listening remo made himself hero of the houror at least of hawthornby walking along the bank and retrieving the kit from a boat down the row where caught raiding the pantry it was about to meet its end at either the hands of the boats irate cook or the jaws of the excited boatdog remo had a dangerously attractive facelightening smile like dags fawn discovered as he handed the little masked miscreant back to its ecstatic owner berry noticed it too and smiled in pure contagion whit first smiled at her smile then frowned at remo as the boat made midstream and peace fell fawn pulled out her wool and drop spindle and took a seat on the bow to spin watch the riverbank pass by and think remo had to have opened and used his groundsense for that swift rescue despite his aversion to farmer grounds for lakewalkers hunting must be a very different activity than for farmers if they could just stroll into a woods and find prey as easily as a woman picking jars off her pantry shelf although she supposed convincing say a bear to submit to having its skin peeled was just as dangerous to a lakewalker hunter as to any farmer or was it were there other practical uses for persuasion than just on farmer merchants and maidens and horses and mosquitoes and fireflies she would have to ask dag twisting her yarn plump for warmthit would knit up faster that way tooshe made quite a bit of progress before it was time to break off and go start lunch an iron stove she thought longingly could be installed on a boat like this one and not be so sessile after all but it would be a short love affairyoud have to sell it downstream just as the boats were sold off at journeys end sometimes as houseboats for the poorer riverfolk but more usually broken up for their lumber most of graymouth was built of former flatboats shed heard she hated to think of the fetch so dismembered and hoped someone would buy it for a cozy floating home as she made her way into the kitchen she found dag sitting at the droptable his head bent strangely he was staring down at a distressing lumpy gray blob on a pie plate his face drained and almost greenish what in the world is that thing fawn asked nodding at the plate youre not going to eat it are you the man certainly needed to get more food inboard but preferably something wholesome this looked like something dead too long that had been fished from the bottom of the river last piece of apple pie from last night he said thats not my she looked more closely dag what did you do groundripped it tried to i think i just found my upper limit dag two oats i said i tried two oats they were good so were five and ten time to try something else this was food too was yeah as she stared in a mix of exasperation and horror dag abruptly clawed off his arm harness and dropped it bending over with his left arm held tight to his body he swallowed ominously fawn darted for a washbasin and shoved it under his nose barely in time he grabbed it and turned away from her trying to retch quietly but he didnt bring up much wordlessly she handed him a cup of water with which to rinse and spit thanks he whispered done not sure he set the basin on the bench beside him ready to hand this feels bizarre its like my ground is trying to get rid of it but it cant so my body tries instead but there wasnt anything in your stomach im right grateful about that just now is this the same way you get sick after your healing groundwork no he said slowly thats more lightheaded like blood loss except it passes quickly thisis heavy like indigestion it just sits there except in both cases the disruption of my ground is affecting my body so is your ground like a horse or like a dog he blinked at her in dizzy confusion say what we had some farm dogs that would wolf down any garbage you left around and then heave it back up if it disagreed with em which it generally did usually someplace where you were going to step seemed like she scowled in memory then there was that dog of reeds whose joy was to roll in smelly thingsmanure dead possumsand then rush up to share his bliss with you but thats dogs for you dag pressed the back of his hand to his lips indeedare you ragging me spark she shook her head though her fierce glance said you deserve to be ragged then theres horses now horses cant vomit like dogs do once theyve eaten something wrong theyre in big trouble and no mistake papa lost a good pony to colic once that had got into the corn which is why fletcher is so careful about fixing fencerows and keeping the feed bins latched tight itd been his pony see so if you groundrip something bad can you get rid of it or not evidently not dags brow wrinkled i couldnt get rid of those toxic spatters after i groundripped the malice back in raintree either come to think they were blighting me poisoning my ground they were drawn out and destroyed with the rest of the residue when we broke the malices groundlock but that trick wouldnt work for this will this kill you she asked in sudden terror just a piece of piemy pie he shook his head dont think so its not poison and i didntcouldntrip it all the way but i sure wish i hadnt done that he hunched tighter grimacing then will you get better slow like after the mosquito i guess well find out he sighed groundcolic said fawn eew she took away the plate and basin and emptied them over the back rail then returned to put dag firmly to bed it was a measure of his malaise that he went without argument she made his excuses to the others come lunchhe thinks its something he atewhich were accepted without question but with lots of speculation as to what it might have been since everyone else had eaten fawns boatfood as well in desperationand in defense of her reputation as a cookshe finally suggested it might have been something hed got hold of up in town that morning which was allowed with wise nods remo seemed the most disturbed by the development stopping by their bednook to ask dag if he was all right and if there was anything he could do dags response was muffled and repelling fawn thought that dag should take the only other lakewalker available into his confidence about these alarming groundripping experiments but wasnt certain enough to force it she was out of her depth here the notion that dag might be too was not reassuring dags loss was hods gain as he was suddenly promoted to sweepman that afternoon in dags place hod was clumsy and timid and mixed up his right and his left but responded slowly both to berrys patience and bos familiar hungover bluntness his panicked mistakes became fewer as his confidence grew though he seemed so surprised to be told he was doing well that he almost dropped his broadoar overboard to fawns immense relief dag revived enough in the evening to eat real food although she noticed he left his arm harness off he was still very quiet answering most queries with a headshake and then pressing his forehead as if in regret of the sudden motion but the next day dag went back to taking turns on the oars although only after a promise to the eager hod that he would now be added to the regular rotation they pulled in that noon at a village that was seemingly a traditional stop for the clearcreeks where berry found a fellow who both knew her and remembered the briar rose stopping last fall so her papa had made it at least this far the goodsshed man couldnt recall boss clearcreek saying anything unusual about the trip was very sorry to learn of his disappearance and shook his head over the news about the lost tripoint boats whit sold his first batch of window glass and they took to the river once more the cool autumn sun that made the water sparkle and the riverbanks glow delighted fawn but was not welcomed by berry eyeing the falling water late that afternoon berrys glumness was unfortunately vindicated the boat boss was sitting with fawn dag and hod at the kitchen table nibbling leftovers and asking about life in west blue when a grinding noise from the hull made her look up and set her teeth she stared at the ceiling thumping with sudden bootsteps and muttered bo youre too close to the bank bring her over hard now but broke off with an aggravated snarl as the fetch quite perceptibly ground to a halt what is it asked fawn sharply hod looked equally alarmed sand bar berry called over her shoulder as she swung out the back hatch they all followed her out and clambered up onto the roof where she was peering over the side with her hands planted on her hips and saying to bo what did you want to go and do that for were scrunched in good now bo was apologetic in a guiltysurly sort of way blaming the island they were stuck beside for growing that bar out in an uncalledfor way whit was rather redfaced and remo catching dags eye looked hangdog berry sighed in exasperation which reassured fawn that this was a normal sort of emergency and berry and bo took up a practiced routine for efforts to push them off again the first step was to swing the oars down and use them as stilts to walk the boat off the bar dag and remo actually broke their big oar with their grunting effort but the fetch did not budge and berry abandoned that method before they either broke anothershe was not oversupplied with sparesor ripped out the massive oak oarlock as well the next step was to send all the men ashore lightening the load to try tugging with ropes copperhead whom berry kept calling dags landskiff was sent too with a rope tied to his saddle the men stripped to their drawers and boots and waded into the chill water grimly or with yelps which was pretty rivetingfawn caught berry staring too and her wide grin flashed backbut still didnt shift the boat the third method was to settle back and wait for a rise to float the fetch off the bar a choice the shivering crew had scorned a couple of hours back but now applauded as they were yelling this debate across the little stretch of water between the boat and the churnedup bank a long low hoot rising to three sharp toots sounded from upriver thats the snapping turtles horn berry said her head swiveling the keelboat appeared around the bend riding easily down the center of the channel a man indryredandblue striped trousers cheerfully waved a tin horn as long as his arm at the mudsplashed crew of the fetch strung along the shore that theres a boat not a plow boss berry he called you tryin to dredge a new channel over there berry snorted indignation but her lips twitched as boss wain strode to the bow and stood with his thumbs in his green leather braces grinning at them berry cupped her hands and shouted hey wain youve got muscle over there hows about a tow he cupped his hands and yelled back i dunno berryhows about a kiss over on the bank whit despite being mostly blue flushed red daisygoatll pucker up for you berry shouted back youll think youre back with the home girls wain shook his head not good enough whats your cargo mainly salt butter tripoint tools and window glass wains grin stretched as the snapping turtle slid past then i guess well sell our tools and glass downstream before you he patted his lips in a broad gesture unless you want to change your mind about that kiss muscleheaded turkeywit berry muttered under her breath he never changes she raised her voice and shouted after him what are all your fellers too weak and worn out with flipping those dice to pull a bitty flatboat anymore all little girlyarms on the turtle so sad she flapped hers limply in mockery wain raised his arm and slapped his massive biceps nice try berry fawn considered volunteering a kiss in berrys place in support of the fetch but looking over the rowdy keelboat men decided better of the impulse ill play you over the bar berry raised her arms back and mimicked fiddling this actually started a hot debate amongst the dozen or so men of the snapping turtles crew before it could quite turn to mutiny wain shouted a concert and a kiss berry gritted her teeth ill wait for the rain moans of disappointment drifted back from the keelboat but the river bore it inexorably on and in a few more minutes it had floated out of hearing and then sight berry heaved a frustrated sigh it had all been fairly goodhumored fawn thought butthey were still stuck on the sand bar copperhead was turned loose to graze on the island since although he had jumped into the water readily enough under dags practiced persuasion getting him back aboard would be nigh impossible until they could again tie the fetch to the bank bowfirst and run out the gangplank the men washed in the river and came back aboard crowding the hearth where fawn was trying to start an early supper there seeming to be little else to do for the long evening they stamped and shivered and rubbed their hands all but dag who tucked his under his left arm but eventually settled down enough out of her way that she could make pies and stew dag asked if fawn wanted him to catch her some fish but for some reason this amiable suggestion was voted down in the night fawn awoke to find their bedroll empty of dag at first she thought hed gone to piss but when he didnt reappear after a reasonable time she wrapped a blanket around herself and crept out to look for him a light was seeping in from around the bow hatch too amber to be the moon she slipped out the door and closed it behind her the night air was cold damp and smelled of fallen leaves and the river with a whiff of warm goat and sleepy chicken but overhead the stars burned bright the bench was pulled out from the wall and dag was sitting astride it with a lantern glowing at the other end he seemed dressed by guess hair sticking up and was without his arm harness he was frowning down at two little piles of mixed oats and corn kernels on the board between his knees although when she came to his shoulder he looked up and cast her a quick smile what are you doing she whispered he ran his hand through his hair to no good effect ive gone back to oats figured youd approve she nodded provisionally are you planning to groundrip some she didnt see any little piles of gray dust so perhaps shed caught him in time which begged the question in time for what although it was possible her mere presence would inhibit him from dodgier trials he made an odd face i got to thinking even a malice doesnt normally groundrip its victims down to deep physical structurethat gray slumpings more an effect of prolonged draining blight it only snatches the lifeground the cream off the top if you will she frowned in concentration i remember when dar told me about how sharing knives are primed the knife just draws in a persons dying ground the whole person doesnt dissolve so its not just malices his lips parted closed thatsa better thought though i dont think of sharing knives as groundripping so much as accepting the greatest possible groundgift ihm his brows drew in after a moment he shook off the distracting notion whatever it was and went on live ground is more complex than the ground of inert or dead thingslighter brighter more fleetingand it seemshe reached out with a fingertip beneath his hovering stump and shifted one more oat from the pile on his right to the pile on his leftmore digestible speaking of groundcolic she estimated the number of grains in each pile it was a lot more than ten dag she said uneasily how many of those are you planning to try he chewed on his lip well you remember back in raintree when every patroller in camp who knew how gave me a ground reinforcement trying to get me better quick sos we could all ride home yes after a while i started seeing these wavering purple halos around things and hoharie made them stop she said i needed more absorption time you didnt tell me about any purple halos he shrugged they went away in a day anyway the experience gave me a notion to try i figure ill have hit my daily limit in liveground theft when things start looking sort of lavender around the edges she pursed her lips in doubt but how could she demand he not explore his abilities when she was so full of questions herself there was no expert here for him to beg explanations of he could only question his own body and ground with these trials and listen carefully to the answers truly somebody had once had to try everything for the first time or there would be no experts are you still thinking that if you could get more groundfood to restore yourself you could do more healing faster he nodded maybe of lakewalkers leastways but i want to heal farmers and if i cant figure out this beguilement problem he moved another oat then a corn kernel then he sat up blinked twisted around and stared at her face do i have a purple halo now she asked a little grimly he reached back moved another oat and blinked again now you do he said in a voice of tentative satisfaction then stop yes he sighed he rubbed his nightstubbled chin and stared down at the two little heaps huh hm this pilehe pointed to the one on his rightis live seeds if you put them in the ground and watered em youd get new plants maybe said fawn from a lifetimes experience on a farm anyhow if you planted enough of them youd likely get something plus the weeds this pile he said ignoring the commentary is dead seeds plant them and they would just sit there and rot eventually a bleak look crossed his face and fawn wondered if his minds eye was seeing a long row of uncorrupted little corpses blight it oats werent children well she supposed they were the oat plants children in a way but down that line of thought lay madness for anyone who meant to go on living in the world she put in quickly seeds wont sprout once you cook them either how is this different from cooking our food really his squint after a moment grew grateful theres a point spark she peered more closely the heap on the left did seem a bit duller to her eye than the bright yellow grains on the right she pointed to the dull heap could you still eat those like cooked food he looked a bit taken aback i dont know youd think theyd have lost something would they poison you i have no idea he stared down at the little pile for a long time id try feeding that handful to copperhead but hes over on the island and well a horse weve no dog his eye fell speculatively on daisygoat we drink milk from that goat fawn said hastily and as his face swiveled toward the chicken pen and we eat the eggs he frowned then got a faraway look for a moment a scratching sound made fawn glance down to find that hawthorns raccoon kit had appeared at dags ankle and was pawing at his trouser leg dag reached down and gathered up the creature tucking it in the crook of his left arm its little leathery paws gripped his sleeve and its bright black eyes twinkled from its furry mask dag fawn gasped you cant the horse goats chickens and you are out he said patiently whats left on this boat thatll eat grain well hod but no i dont think it will poison the little critter really its just not right i mean at the very least you should ask hawthorns permission and i cant see you explaining all this to hawthorn i cant even explain it all to myself dag sighed very well he scooped up the pile of grain and raised his palm to his own lips no fawn clapped her hand to her mouth to muffle her shriek dag raised his brows at her you cant say i dont have the right fawn bounced up and down in dismay lips pressed tight and finally blurted try it on the raccoon then he tilted his head ironically at her and offered the grain to the kit the kit seemed only mildly interestedspoiled fawn thought by the tastier fodder that everyone aboard slipped to itbut at dags urging and she suspected sorcerous persuasion it did nibble down a spoonful or so of the grains whiskers twitching when dag let it go it toddled off apparently unaffected or at least it didnt drop over dead on the spot dag tossed the remaining handful of dead seeds over the side wiped his palm on his shirt and picked off a few raccoon hairs his eye fell on the chicken coop food huh he said in a distant tone i wonder what would happen if i tried to groundrip a chicken next time you mean to serve up a chicken dinner spark let me know fawn mentally took chicken off her menu plans for the indefinite future i dont know dag the idea of you ripping seed grains doesnt bother me a bit but if you could rip a chicken could you she broke off he eyed her not failing to follow groundrip a person in full malice mode i dont know a persons bigger i begin to suspect i could rip up a persons ground at least and yes the idea does trouble me thank you very much fawn scrubbed her mouth with the back of her hand you can rip up a persons body and ground with your war knife and you have would this truly be different i dont know yet sighed dag spark i really do not know he folded her in to him then leaning his forehead against hers ive been wondering for some time if ive stumbled across some craft secrets of senior medicine makers now you have me wondering if its secrets of the senior knife makers instead theyre even more closemouthed about their work and it may be with good reason because because she prompted when he didnt go on because i cant be the only person with these abilities unless i truly have been malicecorrupted somehow i wish i had someone to someone to ask alas not remo a nice young patroller but no maker dag shook his head someone safe to ask urgh she didnt fail to follow either hoharie might be but shes back at hickory lake she saw mei dont think i told you about this fawn rolled her eyes more purple halos yes sorry at the time i didnt know what to make of it so i didnt talk about it but when her apprentice othan was trying to give a ground reinforcement to my broken arm he couldnt get in i ended up sort ofripping it from him as he was trying to give it hoharie was right there watching and and her only reaction was to try to recruit me for a medicine maker on the spot till i pointed out my little problem with fine handwork he waved his stump later she came up with the idea of partnering me with othans brother for my spare hands if shed offered to partner me with you i might have taken her up on it and wed still be there instead of here but she shied off from that suggestion fawn couldnt decide if that would have been good or not so only tilted her head i hear you but she pounced quickly on the important point that was well before you groundripped the malice in raintree right yes so these new abilitiesshe leaned back and gripped his left armcant be some sort of malicecontagion you picked up then because you developed them before i dont think youre turning into a malice or you would be more scary instead of just more aggravating if thats whats worrying you from the play of expression on his facefirst dismay then reliefshe realized shed just spoken his most secret fear and that once dragged out into open air it shrank hearteningly itwas a passing thought i admit he ducked his head then smiled crookedly and held her closer so if i turned into a malice would you still love me if you really turned into a malice youd just eat me and the question wouldnt arise she said a bit tartly thats how wed know i suppose he allowed youd know anyhow she thought about it or maybe you wouldnt youd be too stuck inside your own torment to even see mine ah yes you did look one straight in the eye that time his fingers brushed the scars on her neck not to say i forgot so much as i should have realized his eyes darkened with his own memories from what ive seen of the inside of a malice youre right you have an uncomfortably acute way of looking at things sometimes spark fawn just shook her head this conversation was spiraling into the dark or at least into the creepy in a way that suggested it was time for bed because no further good could come of it tonight she picked up the lantern and led the way dag was reassured early the next morning of the health of the raccoon kit as it woke him by nosing curiously in his ear it also conveniently left a scat on the end of their blankets not for the first time as the creature seemed to have a partiality for their bednook dag took the pellet outside to the goat pen in the gray light to squash open with a stick he would not have been surprised to find that the ripped grains had passed through whole or even some odder effect but they appeared to have been digested normally with no sign of blood or blight to the kits gut so it seemed he could leave a trail of sterile seeds in his wake and do the world no harm though he was still deeply suspicious of their reuse as feed perhaps he would buy his own chicken at the next stop to test them upon in a more methodical way and put fawn in charge of it as he was by no means sure of his ability to keep a chicken alive in the first place and he wouldnt want to make a mistake here he leaned on the boat rail and watched the sky lighten from steel to silver to gold in a pure autumn sunrise color seeping into the low hills lining the mistshrouded river it looked to be another brisk blue day like yesterday which did not bode well for getting the fetch off the sand bar but a day of rest would be welcome perhaps he and fawn could take a twoperson picnic to the other end of the island he extended his groundsense to check the chances of privacy assuming they could successfully lose whit hod remo hawthorn and the raccoon the island was a good two miles long rich in natural ground free of blightsign and he found unpeopled his breath drew in sharply and he tested that range again turning slowly to both ends of the island yes he could clearly sense the head and tail where the stolidity of land met the melting motion of water he cast his inner senses up along the farther hills taking in the trees settling down rootdeep for their winter sleep drying dying plants with bright seedsparks armored in burrs a multitude of small creatures burrowing nesting nosing through the brush flitting from branch to branch the slower lumbering of a family of black bears in the shadow of a ravine its back its all back my full range if only he were still at hickory lake he could go out on patrol again he could hear the rattle of fawn starting breakfast and her voice scolding the kit out from underfoot and hawthorn out of his bunk to take charge of it his mouth quirked in the sure realization that if he were given right this minute the unfettered choice of whether to go back or go onhed go on smiling he ducked inside and made his way to the back deck to wash up the morning meal was leisurely abundant and prolonged the sun was high over the hills before fawn stopped thinking of amusing new treats to try cooking up out of the fetchs stores the younger male eaters originally ravenous showed signs of going sessile losing interest in the idea of hunting on the island in favor of lazing on the boat at least till berry starting reeling off a long list of maintenance chores that a fellow with time on his hands could turn to on impulse dag interrupted this actually id like to borrow remo and hod this morning and fawn i want to try some things berry looked up shrewdly is this about hods beguilement thing yep said dag and marveled at how far theyd come that he could say such a thing openlyand be understood at least well enough to go on with boss berry nodded fine by me she added wistfully say i dont suppose you two lakewalkers can magic up some rain for us while youre at it i dont know of any groundwork that manages weather sorry said dag seriously though who knows what the old lake lords could do back before the world broke berry eyed him that was a joke dag oh fawn patted his hand thats all right i dont always get patroller humor either though if somethings appalling patrollers likely think its hilarious remo looked as though he wanted to object to this but his mouth was too full dag originally thought to retreat to the boat roof for the trials he had in mind but then decided it would be best to get more out of groundsense range from the others they rowed to shore dryshod in the fetchs little skiff though they might almost have waded and hiked up the bank waving goodbye to berry and whit who were setting up a makeshift watergauge in hopes of spotting some slight rise that might be just enough to lift the flatboat out of its sandy trap at a highish spot near the towhead with a view up the river valley framed by sand bar willows fawn laid out a blanket and they all settled crosslegged in a circle and looked to dag hod gulped nervously remo frowned in misgiving fawn just waited watching him dag cleared his throat wishing he were more sure of well anything fawn said the answer to this puzzle ought to lie between us all if only we could see it i mean to try harder to see it why is hod beguiled but fawn not why dont lakewalkers beguile each other what are our grounds really doing when we feel what we feel my notion is that remo and i will each open our grounds as wide as we can try trading little ground reinforcements all around and watch each other what would we be looking for asked remo a trifle plaintively i meanits not like we havent done this before dag shook his head watch for the things we dont usually notice especially watch for the things we think we know that might not really be so watch for the differences between hod and fawn is it the receiver that makes the difference or is it the way the ground is gifted i hope its not all in the receiver because that would mean i couldnt fix iti could only heal some sick or hurt farmers but not others and how would i tell which was which in advance how could i say to someone in mortal trouble no you go away i cant dag broke off swallowed said you start remo give a small reinforcement to hod remos lips twisted in doubt in his knee again how about his nose fawn suggested i think hes getting the sniffles from being in that cold water yesterday and it wouldnt be mixed up with the old groundwork there hod who had in fact been making some ominously juicy snorting noises all morning turned red but nodded acutely aware that he would be laying himself entirely open to remos perceptions dag dropped his every guard and closed his eyes he felt the whorl of ground coming away from remos face and floating between the two the quick blink like water droplets joining as it settled into hods ground in turn a palpable touch of warmth remo sneezed and dags eyes shot open again hod rubbed his nose and looked bewildered feels nice he offered dag squinted but no with neither sight nor groundsense could he detect anything out of the ordinary he ran his hand through his hair well all right do the same for fawn then are you sure dag asked remo i meani wouldnt want to risk accidentally beguiling your wife his glance at dag was sidelong and wary fawns already received some pretty complex ground reinforcements from me and minor ones from mari and cattagusis that all fawn she nodded old cattagus fixed that little burn on my hand that time and mariyou were there when she helped me out she made a vague gesture to her belly and the slowly healing malice scars hidden there that still rendered her monthlies so painful shes not been beguiled yet and this is lighter than even a minor healing reinforcement said dag go ahead where said remo i mean barr claims if you put a ground reinforcement in a farmer girls he broke off abruptly his face flushing his ground shuttered out with it said dag patiently who knows what overlooked thing could be important remos ground only eased back by half he looked up the river valley meeting no ones eye he said distantly barr says if you put a ground reinforcement in a farmer girls tcpprivate partsthis last choice barely got past his teethit makes her eager to um be with you huh said hod go out to the woodpile with him dag translated into hoddish oh hod nodded wisely sure from the look on fawns face she did not require a translation but she sat up straighter her brow wrinkling dagis that why when we first met you said you couldnt heal my womb after the malice ripped me there remos head swiveled at this and his inspection of her malice scars dropped below her neck for the first time his eyes widened dag answered no it was what i was always taught about field healings for folks who arent trained up as medicine makers ground reinforcements flow best from body part to the same body partthe way remo did hods nose just now without a womb to pull ground from id no such ground to give you he hesitated the healings he was trying nowadays through his ghost handhis ground projectioncertainly didnt work that way i wouldnt put much faith in barrs hearsay but it wasnt hearsay remo blurted he said he did it dag after an unmoving moment pursed his lips you know this for sure remo nodded in discomfiture wed put up out on patrol in this farmers barn he went after one of the sisters the prettiest naturally he dared me to try with another one but i said id tell our patrol leader if he ever pulled a stunt like that again and he shut up about it after a moment he added im pretty sure hes done it more than once though he could hardly have pulled ground from his womb said dag slowly still not convinced he believed barrs brag no he said it was from hisremo gestured crotchwardparallel parts because he had plenty to spare he claimed fawn said in a coolly thoughtful tone that wouldnt have been a healing reinforcement then exactly maybe it was juststimulatin you know dag what you were taught may just be what they tell the young patroller boysand girlsso as to save trouble and in the next generation if no one tested it theyd pass it along for fact so you could both be right in a way dag rubbed the back of his neck as he considered this proposition maybe there ought to be another experiment later in privatehe wrenched his mind back to the present trial elbow try a tiny reinforcement in her elbow yes sir said remo in a tone that added and if anything goes wrong later sir remember you told me to do this he leaned forward again this ground reinforcement as nearly as dag could tell worked identically to hods fawn rubbed her elbow and squinted at remo then sat back with an unperturbed smile well that had gone nowhere in particular all right dag sighed now me i guess if youre up to it or do you need a rest remo shook his head not for those little bits dag sat up and opened his ground as wide as he ever had trying for a listening quietude elbows fine for me too better stay away from my left side its still pretty roiled over there remos head tilted and his lips parted he said uneasily dag yours is the strangest ground ive ever seen scarred up one side and knotted down the other but denseyoure as dense as any medicine maker ive met its hard to know where to put a reinforcement dag nodded that calling has been growing in me for some time i suspect longer than ive known try a foot theyre always happy for some help he cast a glint at fawn recalling her very alluring foot rubs she glinted back remo gathered himself touched his own right foot then dags dag felt the whorl of ground flow past there an echo of groundlike the fainter second rainbow that sometimes mirrored a firstpassed back between them even as the bit of remos ground joined to dags the ground in remos foot closed again like some thick liquid settling around the warm return gift did you see that dag said in excitement what said remo cautiously it seemed like a usual reinforcement to me that little backsplash from me to you like an undertow of ground cant say as i noticed dags teeth gritted in frustration he bit back a sharp rejoinder of then open wider blight you remo was only a young patroller it was more than probable that an improved sensitivity to ground was growing in dag along with his other makers talents had his younger self ever experienced such simple field reinforcements as anything other than diffuse blobs although if remo truly couldnt sense this he wasnt going to be much help as a check on dags perceptions dag sighed and straightened all right my turn i need you to watch really closely remo ill start with hods right elbow as theres no other groundwork there that had been a good notion of fawns to keep the trials separated for clearer comparisons he unfurled his ghost hand reached out and spun off a tiny reinforcement into the target no groundecho returned hah the reinforcement was swallowed up greedily as though gulped hod sighed contentedly but remo almost fell over in his scramble backward up on one knee and looking ready to bolt he pointed toward dags hook and cried blight what was that dag had forgotten hed not introduced remo to his new talent settle down its just my ghground projection instead of mirroring body parts it pulls ground generally from all through me hoharieshes hickory lake camps senior medicine makersays its a makers skill it doesnt usually take quite this form in other makers but you can kind of see why it would for me uh said remo yeah dag wished he wouldnt look quite so bugeyed but he did settle back crosslegged and tried to be attentive i will wait said dag patiently till you can get your ground open again remo swallowed it took him a few minutes but he eventually achieved the relaxed openness dag needed dag rubbed his jaw and said think ill try you next i need you to watch not my reinforcement but for a little echo of it coming back from you to me id say underneath but its more like the return ground passes right through the other lagging a bit ready remo nodded dag leaned forward and extended his ghost hand again he paused while remos ground flickered in alarm then steadied he nodded and spun off the reinforcement toward remos right forearm this time watching for it the ground return was distinctly discernible the faint remogroundecho was converted so rapidly it seemed to disperse through dags arm like a blown dandelion puff dags brows rose i saw remo began excitedly then slowed im not just sure what i saw you saw your groundecho i felt it slide into me it converted a lot faster thanuma primary ground reinforcement the one remo had placed in dags foot was still there comfortable but distinct dags return echo in remos foot was almost fully absorbed already dag blew out his breath and turned to fawn she was watching him closely clearly struggling to follow all this he gave her a reassuring nod but it only made her lift her brows wryly dag centered himself opened all his heart to her reached out and spun a reinforcement into her opposite elbow the return echo came back to him like a kiss and his lips softened in a smile i saw that thing again said remo i think dag sat back and rubbed his forehead i saw felt yes the reason fawn is not beguiled is that her ground is acting like a lakewalkersat leastit did when i gave her the reinforcement but it didnt when you did thatsodd is it because youre married said remo im not sure marriagelakewalker marriagewas certainly a groundtransforming act as their binding strings testified but dag could hardly marry all his potential patients a stumper this theyd gone all the way around with each of them the answer had to be here hidden in the crisscross of ground flowor its absence dag fell onto his back and glowered up at the nearly leafless willow branches at the cool blue sky brightening toward noon dag and remo had exchanged ground with each other dag only had exchanged with fawn neither had exchanged with poor hod or was that neither had accepted an exchange with poor hod oh ye gods can i do this i dont want bits of hod in me so do you really want to be the farmers own medicine makerold patroller because a real maker cant pick and choose his patients he has to take whoever and whatever comes equally its not true he said to the sky in sudden wonder it was never true whats not true dag fawn asked in that longsuffering voice that suggested she was about to snap his lips curled up which made her growl which made them curl up more its not true he said that lakewalkers dont beguile each other we beguile each other all the time what said remo sounding startled dag sat up his smile twisting he raised his left arm toward hod spun off a neat reinforcement into the nearly healed knee and held himself open not sternly not rigidly but warmly and without reservation the backsplash this time was so blatant that remo cried whoa there was after all a deal of accumulated groundload for hod to dump so suddenly hod bent blinked and touched his forehead then gripped his leg his smile flickered very uncertainly uh he said i feltit went away and added piteously after a moment butcan i still be your friend yes hod you surely can said dag you surely can dag said fawn dangerously do you want to explain that for the rest of us because if you havent just done something worse n that catfish ill eat my hat i just unbeguiled hod dag exulted choking back a thoroughly undignified chortle in a sense the first half of that sounds good allowed fawn and waited with understandable suspicion for him to explain the second i thinkim guessingthat the hunger a beguiled person has for repeated ground reinforcements isnt only because they feel real good its really an urgent attempt by their ground to rebalance itself to complete the thwarted exchange except that it just gets worse with each addition if the lakewalker doing the reinforcements still blocksrejectsthe return groundgift dag went on in growing elation that also explains why beguilements so blighted erratic it depends on how openor notthe lakewalker feels about farmersor about that particular farmer leastways ive been open to fawn since almost the beginning so no imbalance has ever built up in her hodnot till just now ha he supposed hed only frighten hod and remo if he jumped up and danced around them all whooping like a madman but he really wanted to remo looked less enthusiastic what do you mean we beguile each other all the time we dont beguile and unbeguile both ground exchange in balance not thwarted i swear it starts with our mothers milk and goes onnot a lakewalker child comes of age without having received dozens of little reinforcements from dozens of kinfolk or friends for this or that ailment or injury grown up and out on patrol or in camp with our tentkin were always swapping around we float in a lake of shared ground id not be surprised to find its part of why when a lakewalker is cut off from others we feel so odd and unhappy remo looked wholly interested but only halfconvinced dag are you sure of this nearly youd best believe ill be watching out for it from now on fawn asked does this mean you really could teach other makers to heal farmers spark if im right any medicine maker who knew this could treat a farmer without beguilingif only the maker was willing to take in farmer ground he hesitated that might be a bigger if only than it looked at first still medicine making had never been for the squeamish remo said slowly but what would happen to that lake of shared ground if a lot of lakewalkers started taking in farmer ground what would happen to the maker dag fell silent i dont know he said at last i came out here this morning determined to wring some answers to my questionsand we did but it seems ive just stirred up a pack of bigger questions im not getting ahead here after a longer pause fawn clambered to her feet and motioned them all off the blanket so she could roll it up the walk back to the fetch was very subdued although at least hod had stopped sniffling in the warmest part of the afternoon dag took fawn down the island to as they explained to hawthorn scout for squirrels hawthorn promptly begged to go along brandishing a slingshot remo bless him understood the patrol code and diverted the boy long enough for them to escape finding a warm nook took a little searching as the wind was freshening and showing signs of veering northwest with horsetail clouds spread in gauzy lines turning the light paler but a low spot in some deadfall once it was lined with the good supply of blankets theyd packed along lent both privacy and comfort over the next few delicious hours dag discovered that with his growing control of ground projection he could indeed lay reinforcements in select body parts that did not match his own but fawn reported it did nothing that his ghost hand didnt already do better they compared the techniques a couple of times to be certain during which fawns solemnly helpful expression kept dissolving into giggles dag chortled in he trusted a more dignified fashion well maybe not so dignified in that positionhe was unable to test barrs assertion about making farmer girls suffer desire because he couldnt force himself to stay closed to fawn and anyway it would have been like pouring milk into milk and looking for a color change but he hoped this new support around her hidden malice scars would help with the pain of her next monthly coming up soon a ground reinforcement doesnt actually heal a person he explained as they lay drowsily intertwined bodies and investigations temporarily exhausted it just strengthens a body to heal itself quicker or to fight infection better if the damage is too great or the sickness spreads too fast the makers work gets overwhelmed too fawns lips pursed she turned her head in the crook of his arm to dot kisses across his skin can the maker get overwhelmed give away too much ground to live dag shook his head youd pass out first its not like bleeding that can go on without your will or awareness although the exhaustion can lay the maker open to sickness too same as anyone else he hesitated a reinforcements not to be confused with a medicine makers groundlock mind you if a makers gone down and in too deep till matching grounds turns into mixing them and his patient dies on him the maker can die too the dying ground disrupting the other see she blinked huh i wonder if thats how your ancestors first got the idea for sharing knives dag rocked back huh could be spark could well be bright farmer girl she nodded brows drawing down one way or another seems like it would be a good idea to keep your strength up same as a patrol leader keeping his patrol in good shape i reckon he allowed thoughtfully and the other way around he bent his head and nuzzled her hair that too spark the next morning dag woke to gray skies and extra kisses fawn sat up on one elbow and asked do you know what day this is ive lost track he admitted better ask berry guess id better she grinned and went off to start breakfast the clouds thickened but did not deliver rain the fetch stayed stuck after lunch whit insisted on dragging dag off to explore the back side of the island a wedge of fallen trees and thatch across the channel made a temporary bridge to the mainland and they picked their way precariously across despite dags assurances that there was nothing over there of note for at least a mile in any direction when they at last returned to the fetch remo met them on shore with strict instructions from the cook to go catch some fish for dinner specifically not catfish this entailed another trip across to the back channel from which they returned with heavy strings of walleye and three kinds of bass bo and hod took the catch in charge to clean and gut then whit suggested an archery lesson remo and dag set up a target while whit took the skiff out to the boat for their bows and arrows in a while hod and hawthorn rowed to shore for a turn as well and by the time theyd worn out everyone especially the chief instructor the leaden skies were darkening with early nightfall the air of the fetchs cabin when dag stepped inside was warm and moist and smelled amazing he walked into the kitchen area to find it crammed with busy people and festooned with bunches of autumn wildflowers and dried milkweed pods tied with colored yarn berry and fawn were frying up a mountain of fish and potatoes and onions and whit and bo were tapping a new keg of beer set up on a trestle and where had that come from what are we celebrating dag inquired amiably fawn set aside her pan walked over stood on tiptoe snaked an arm around his neck to pull his face down to her level and said you happy birthday dag and kissed him soundly to the hoots and clapping of the whole crew congregated he pulled back once she released him with his mouth gaping in astonishment yes whit whooped we got him we got him good how did you know this was my birthday dag asked fawn it had been upwards of twenty years since hed paid the least attention to it himself and he certainly hadnt mentioned it recently dag said fawn in fond exasperation you gave it to the town clerk when we were married in west blue of course i remembered and fawns was in about six more weeks as he had learned at the same time and not forgottenhed thought they might be in graymouth by then and wondered what farmer birthday customs might please her and been glad that whit would be there to ask and maybe help keep her from feeling too alone in a strange place shell be nineteen gods dag wasnt sure whether to feel old or good but as remo pressed him into his seat and bo thrust a tankard of beer into his hand he decided on good then came tender fish and melting potatoes and a tide of beer and jokes and tales and laughter and yes friends and his own real tentkin he was glad too for remo at the tablewhatever the exact interplay of ground and body mind and heart it seemed a wider world to have both farmers and lakewalkers in it celebrating each other the beer dag learned had been secretly laid in by whit for precisely this purpose at that last stop where hed sold his window glass its status as a present had apparently kept it from any premature depredations by bo a fact bo himself pointed out with a certain pride the bluefield conspiracy had been going on for some days it seemed for when no one was able to force down another bite fawn brought out a package wrapped in cloth and tied with another jaunty yarn bow dag opened it to discover a newsewn oiled cloth cape and hood such as boatmen wore bo let me use his old one for a pattern fawn explained in satisfaction i traded making new ones for him and berry for the cloth to make some for you and whit but i havent got to the others yet her second packet was a sweater sleeve incomplete but promissory i expect to make some real good progress on it next week remo said lakewalkers give new clothes and weapons on birthdays and maybe when you start patrolling a horse you have a horse and a whole arsenal already but at least i made you a few more arrows berry gave me the tripoint steel heads and hawthorn had the eagle feathers she added a bundle of half a dozen new shafts to the stack and dag decided he would let his tongue be cut out before explaining that such gifting customs were mainly meant for youngsters outside in the dark the wind blew a spatter of rain against the walls and windows and berry looked up intently but as the wind and water didnt yet shift the boat she settled back and sipped at her tankard dag would have been quite content to just take a seat near the fire with a warm wife in his lap for the rest of the night but fawn extracted herself from his embrace and flitted off again more said dag remo said lakewalkers dont make birthday cakes exactly but if youre going to be a real bluefield you need to have one whit explained as fawn came tottering back with a huge cake on a platter with candles its the farmer thing to do or at least it always was at our house i love the candles best one for every year fawn expanded upon this thumping the platter down in front of dag which explained the size of the cake bristling with a small forest of thin beeswax sticks i made this cake with ginger and pear and honeybutter frosting because i was getting right tired of everything apple even if we still have barrels of them where did you find all the candles dag asked fascinated and a bit taken aback same goodsshed where whit got the beer fawn shook her head dark eyes and curls all sprightly nope the ones they had were all too big i made these myself this afternoon with some wax berry gave me from her stores and some string i plaited a while back dag plucked one up and rolled it between his fingers smelling the faint honey scent theyre a good making spark she smiled in pleasure at his praise the deal is whit advised youre supposed to light them then make a wish if you blow them all out in one breath you get your wish dag could not picture the groundwork that would effect such a thing so decided it must be a farmer superstition if a pleasant one it sounds right difficult its easier when youre six than when youre fiftysix whit conceded indeed well all right ill try certain lakewalker makers produced groundworked candles that made the task a snap this would call for a greater effort on his part dag suspected but these wax lights were sound work and of fawns own hands just like their marriage cords he set the candle back in its hole in the frosting centered himself aligned his ground called up his hottest persuasion and swept his ghost hand back and forth across the bristling top of the cake to his pure delight all fiftysix little golden flames sprang up in its wake with a faint foomp foomp sound he looked up in satisfaction to find fawn and berry both standing at his sides with lit spills in their hands and their mouths open a silence stretched around the crowded table hod was blinking hawthorns eyes were wide bo seemed to have bitten his tongue was thatnot right dag asked hesitantly whit said in a rather hollow voice and id have been impressed if hed blown them out all at once remo laughed out loud actually remo cackled dag decided dag might have been more annoyed particularly as remo didnt stop for quite a whilechoking himself off eventually into his sleeveexcept that it was the first time ever hed heard the boy laugh that was just fine dag fawn assured him valiantly you can light all our birthday cakes from now on she blew out her spill and handed him a knife dag waited a while for fawn to enjoy the glowor conflagrationwhile he enjoyed the play of the warm light on her face like a summer sunset here on the edge of winter he didnt cheat much blowing out the candles again fawn extracted the wax stumps for reuse sharing the task of licking off the frosting with hawthorn an eager volunteer the pocked cake was divided into generous slabs with half still left for breakfast after dag was made to sit by the fire with fawn just as hed pictured while whit and the crew took charge of the cleanup the rain drummed on the roof as hod and hawthorn pestered remo to show them how lakewalkers cheated in games of chance remo protesting that he didnt know how to either play or cheat and then with a faint groan and a definite jerk the fetch lifted from the sand bar berry whooped and everyone dropped all other tasks to turn out and get the boat away from the bar and down the island to a safe landing to be tied properly for the night both of the lakewalkers with their ability to move surely in the dark were pressed into this task but when they all came trooping wetly back inside fawn had hot tea waiting and prewarmed towels stacked by the hearth sodden clothes were stripped off and hung upexcept for dags adequately protected by his new boatmans rain geardry clothes were donned and those with room snagged more cake and beer the patter of rain gusted into a rattle of hail but the guide ropes held the boat in its new mooring as they all settled around the hearth once more then berry pulled out her fiddle and gave them three tunes two lively one slow and plaintive there wasnt enough room to dance but while berry shook out her fingers and rested up the clearcreeks debated teaching boatmens songs to the bluefields hawthorn claimed he knew all the rude words yeah but you dont understand em drawled bo i do too maybe its time for a lullaby berry suggested no not yet hawthorn protested hod looked torn whit looked wistful remo was sitting on the floor near the fire the overfed raccoon kit asleep in his lap his head came up turning what dag said quietly theres a lakewalker out on the river in a narrow boat in this weather bo snorted fool should be on shore with the boat turned upside down and him under it tied down at both ends too if hed a lick of sense dag silently agreed but stretched his groundsense outward a lakewalker indeed and just as miserable as youd expect their grounds bumped and the narrow boat changed course fighting through the wind waves remos eyes widened he set down the kit and scrambled to his feet its barr a clunk and a thump were followed by the muffled pounding of a fist on the side of the hull remo you fool barrs voice called hoarsely blight you i know youre in there come give me a hand before i freeze in this blighted rain fawn watched in alarm as remo took up the lantern and made his way with dag and whit out into the wind and rain of the back deck hod hovered uncertainly till bo staying planted in his chair beyond the hearth told him sharply to go in or out but stop blocking the doorway like a fool cat and hod drew back hawthorn bounced impatiently behind hod the raccoon kit skittered off and hid in the stores berry put her fiddle away in its leather bag and slid it back under her curtained bunk voices outside rose in debate dags deep tones overriding just tie it to the rail we can deal with it in the morning shipping more waters not going to make much differenceits already halfswamped more thumps grunts and muffled curses whit shoved the door open and handed in a bedroll a pack an unstrung bow and quiver coming unwrapped from a trailing blanket and a couple of lumpy cloth bags all equally sodden hod dropped them in a heap whit came back in followed by dag and a very wet lakewalker who fawn didnt know remo trailed with the lantern which he put back on the kitchen table then leaned his shoulders against the door and crossed his arms face set the fellow stood dripping before the hearth breathing heavily strained with exhaustion and cold his lank hair plastered to his forehead and hanging in a sorry rattail down his back might be tawny blond when dry he shrugged broad shoulders out of a soaked deerskin jacket then just stood holding it in his hands as if confused where to put it or just confused altogether he scowled faintly at the fetchs crew who were staring at him with expressions ranging from dumbfounded to dubious but he eyed the bright fire with understandable longing barr presumably fawn tried not to take an instant dislike to him simply on the basis of remos tale about the pretty farmer sister such a seduction if it had occurred as described or even at all could well have been a twoway enterprise and hed been brave to help rescue those coal flatties from drowning in the riffle or maybe he just liked excitement although at the moment he seemed more distraught apparently continuing an exchange started outside he looked to remo and said i was afraid i wasnt going to catch up with you for another hundred miles why are you trying to catch up with me at all said remo in a voice devoid of encouragement what do you mean why im your partner not anymore i left yes without a word to anyone amma and issi turned me on the grill for a blighted hour about that alonelike i should have known how by magic you owe me for that as well as for paddling three hundred miles in three days after you if you came from pearl riffle that would be bout two hundred miles unless you took a detour berry observed her hands on her hips hers was one of the more dubious looks barr waved this away it was too blighted many miles anyway but thats done now he stretched his shoulders which cracked a bit shook out the jacket and laid it on the hearthstones and edged his backside closer to the fire spreading his hands briefly on his knees big strong hands fawn noted although at the moment cramped from his paddle and chapped with cold i admit i was glad not to find you floating facedown anywhere between there and here we can start back in the morning back where said remo still dour pearl riffle snagbrain if you come back with me now amma says shell let us both back on patrol barr straightened up with a look of if not triumph at least accomplishment remos lips folded as tightly as his arms im not going back you have to come back amma and issi ripped me up one side and down the other like it was my fault you ran off so it was said remo uncompromisingly well its water over the riffle now the important thing is if i bring you back all is forgiven im not saying things wont be edgy for a while but sooner or later someone else will win ammas ire and itll blow over it always does he blinked and grinned in a way that might have seemed charming to some other audience at some other season not this time remo youre making no sense where else would you go but back on said remo he nodded at berry boss berry whose boat you are dripping in will likely let you sleep the night inside if you ask politely in the morning you go upriver i go down simple remo no not simple if i dont fetch you back alive and in one piece amma swears ill be discharged from patrol permanently im not joking fawn was beginning to get the picture here it wasnt simply worry for a partner barr was on a mission to save his own wellscorched tail remo looked furious neither am i barr stared at him with the genuine bewilderment of a fellow whod slid by on charm all his life whose charm had inexplicably stopped working dag had been watching from the sidelines without comment before the goround could start again his unmoved voice put in best dry your weapons patroller your bow is starting to warp from the wet barr made a discomfited gesture as if hed like to protest this interruption but didnt quite dare he eyed dag warily and you dag redblue whatever amma also wanted me to tell her if you talked remo into this like i knew remo snorted in disgust i said i didnt think youd seen each other since that first day in the patrol tent im not sure she believed me he added bitterly im not sure she believed anything i said with heavy sarcasm remo intoned why barrwhy ever would she not before barrs return growl could find words berry exchanged a glance with dag and shouldered forward its boatmens bedtime patroller and youre making a tedious ruckus in our bunkroom if you want you could have some mighty tasty leftovers and a dry bed in front of the hearth if you twod druther keep arguin instead take it outside to the riverbank where you can keep it up to your hearts content or dawn whichever comes first your choice but make it now a rattle of sleet against the windows lent a sinister weight to her cool remark after a long long moment barr swallowed down whatever hed been going to snap back at remo and nodded to the boat boss he said stiffly id be grateful for a bed yes maam and food he shot remo a surly look that made it clear he was giving up only temporarily the occupants of the fetchs kitchenbunkroom shuffled back into almostnormal preparations for sleep barr did look after his weapons with a sidelong glance at dag whit and hod helped lay out the rest of his things to dry hawthorn and berry settled the guestfurs in front of the fire and fawn reheated the fish potatoes and onions barr wolfed down the meal as though starved and gaped in wonder at the tankard of beer bo shoved in front of him he found the bottom of it quickly awkwardly everyone dodged around one another in the shared sleeping space that had suddenly become a little too shared but all found their beds at last as the lantern light dimmed to the faintest red glow through the curtains of their nook fawn interlaced herself with dag for warmth and whispered you didnt happen to wish for barr on those birthday candles did you dag choked down a laugh no spark he grew quiet for a moment not exactly leastways just sos you know that last surprise was not my doing it seems to have been amma ospreys wish i could have been listening at the window for that talk ill bet it was blistering sounds like it was past time she put the fire to that boys feet though do you think remo should go back with him its not my decision to make you wanted him to go back that first night its good for young patrollers to get out and see the world you said you werent adopting him he drew back his head to look down over his nose at her squinting in the shadows do you remember everything i say that clearly that could get downright burdensome on a husband she snickered he added seems they can both drag back home with their tails between their legs and ammall let them in im not too surprised nobody wants to waste patrollers stillill hate to see remo go if he goes i thought i might be starting to get somewhere with him and he was a huge help with hod fawn grew more pensive there is this you cant ever run away from one thing without running toward something else she slid a small hand up his shoulder you for example i ran away from home and right into you and the wide world with you id never be here if i hadnt first left there do you like it here this boat id like any boat with you in it she stretched up and kissed him was it a happy birthday the best in years he kissed her back and added slowly the best in all my years and thats a lot of years spark huh she considered poking him and demanding what that huh was all about but he yawned fit to crack his jaw her feet finally warmed up and she melted into sleep at breakfast fawn discovered that like most fine young animals barr was cuter when he was dry and fluffy shed been uncertain of his age in the strain of his last nights exhaustion but now she was sure he was the junior of the partners hed also regained his temper or at least his arguments shifted to being less about barr and more about remo your tentfolk are all really worried about you he offered not when i last saw them remo replied notably not remo you have to realize ammas only giving us a grace period here you cant expect forgiveness to be held out on a stick forever remo said nothing barr soldiered on if we dont get back timely shell have had a chance to get over being worried about you and revert to being riled we need to grab the moment fawn couldnt help asking wont she be worried about the both of you barr glanced at her as if uncertain whether to speak directly to the farmer bride or not unable to resist a chance to vent he said since she as much as told me to come back with him or not at all i dont think so barr the expendable murmured remo barrs jaw set but he made no rejoinder remo looked mildly surprised after a little silence broken only by munching and requests to pass the cornbread and butter remo said speaking of expendable what in the world were you doing out in that weather last night it wasnt my first plan said barr theres a ferry camp somewhere near here that i was trying to reach by dark and the worse the rain got the more it seemed worth holding out for i sure wasnt going to get any drier camping on shore in that blow but i came to you before i came to it if you mean fox creek camp dag put in you passed it about ten miles back i cant have missed it barr said ive had my groundsense wideopen almost the whole waylooking for you he added aside to remo or your floating body water this cold my body might not have come up so soon said remo distantly dags brows twitched but he said fox creek camp mostly lies behind the hills they dammed the creek to make a little lake back there likely there wasnt anyone out on the ferry landing after dark oh crap barr looked briefly put out then cheered up this is better anyway if id stopped there i wouldnt have caught up with you till tonight at the earliest and thatd be yet another fifty upriver miles to backtrack at least he turned again to remo which is another reason to come back with me now every mile you go down is going to be that much more work going up not my problem said remo well its mine said barr baited into personal outrage again with this current running a narrow boat with only one paddler couldnt even make headway going upriver it needs at least two and better four in a practical spirit and to divert whatever crushing thing remo was fixing to say next fawn suggested you could trade your narrow boat for a horse at the next town and ride back to pearl riffle overland thats a stupid idea objected barr failing to notice either her stiffening or dags he plunged on i couldnt get one good horse in trade for that old boat let alone two you wouldnt need two said remo whit falling back into his old bad habits of potstirring put in cheerfully and who says it has to be a good horse barr clenched his teeth and eyed him unfavorably boss berrys drawl cut across the debate theres this remo you hired on as my sweepman if you jump my boat now youll leave me shorthanded in the middle of nowhere and thats not right now this aint my argument but if you want to quit at least do it at a village or town where i can hire on your replacement thats only fair remo allowed looking at barr in a challenging way barr didnt have an immediate answer although by his grimace fawn thought she could see him mentally adding the upstream miles skys lightening said bo time to get out on the river berry nodded me remo and whit for the first watch which ended the squabble for the next two hours at least breakfast broke up and remo and barr went out to get the water emptied from barrs boat hoist it up and tie it down across the back deck where fawn thought it was going to be mightily in the way hod and hawthorn turned to their scullery duties dag went ashore to collect copperhead who had been standing amongst the dripping leafless trees and whinnying plaintively since predawn answered by bleats from daisygoat copperhead actually seemed glad to scramble back onto the boat and touched noses with daisy the two animals had become unlikely friends the lines were untied the topdeck crew took to their sweeps and the fetch pushed off from the muddy bank turning slowly downstream the river was dark and fast and scary this morning the wind funneling up the valley cold and raw whipping the mist to tatters fawn put her mind to sewing up more rain cloaks and retreated inside to find her work basket glad for an indoor task fawn had her oilcloth pieces laid out on the table near the window for the light stitching industriously when barr came into the kitchen shot her a guarded look and began puttering around setting his dried gear back in order patrollers were doubtless taught to travel tidy she reflected she returned him a nod in case he wanted to talk but wasnt sure he was allowed although maybe that was more for rigid remo barr apparently had found no trouble talking with farmer girls in the past except not farmer brides inexplicably married to other lakewalkers it seemed for when he finally opened his mouth what came out was hardly smooth youre pretty stuck on dag arent you hed sat down in front of the hearth with his knees up to oil some leather straps incidentally blocking the heat but perhaps he was still corecold from yesterday for answer fawn held up her left wrist and the marriage cord wrapped around it what does your groundsense tell you his nose wrinkled in wonder but not denial cant imagine how you two did that we wove them together as partners you might say i made my ground follow my blood into the cord that dag wears which dags brother dar said was a knifemaking technique it worked anyhow barr blinked saun said you two had jumped the cliff at glassforge which surprised him right off as he hadnt thought dag was the sortstiffer than remo evenbut nobody everlakewalkers dont usually marry farmers you know he was actually being sort of polite dont ever would have been more accurate dags an unusual man do you realize how old he likely is to farmer eyes i know he looks thirtyfive or forty but i can tell you he has to be a good deal more than that what are you on about his fiftysixth birthday was yesterday we had a real nice party that was the leftovers you bolted last night oh barr squinted at her in increasing puzzlement do you realize he has to have beguiled you do you realize you are amazingly offensive she returned in a level tone by his discomfited headduck that wasnt the response hed been expecting she bit off her short strand and tied it then drew out a new length to thread her needle dag hasnt beguiled me one bit he and remo have been doing some studying on that how beguilement really happens in groundwork and have found out some pretty terrific things you should get dag to teach you barr did not seem the most promising learner but there was certainly worse out there if dags schemes were to work they had to reach ordinary folks lakewalker and farmer alike and not just a tiny elite but barr had other matters on his mind he muttered cant be her has to be the blonde raising his voice he said remos after that berry girl isnt he thats why he wont turn aroundtaking after your dag maybe absent gods he doesnt mean to marry her does he fawn stared over her stitches in increasing exasperation berrys betrothed to a farmer boy named alder who went missing on a downriver trip last fall along with berrys papa and brother shes going to look for em all which is why she named her boat the fetch she carries on steady because shes that sort and its a long haul but inside shes anxious and grieving you want to make yourself real unpopular with everyone on this boat in a big hurry you try botherin berry in any way had she hammered in that hint hard enough to penetrate barrs selfabsorption well if not she knew someone with a bigger mallet dag had been a company captain twice she doubted a patroller boy like barr would present him an insurmountable challenge barr looked down finished treating the straps and returned to reorganizing his pack fawn stared at his sandy hair tied in that touchable fluffy queue down his back shoved her needle through the heavy cloth with her thimble and said abruptly ha i know who you remind me of sunny sawman barr looked over his shoulder who fawn smiled blackly farmer boy i once knew he was blond and broadshouldered like you straightening up barr cast her a probing smile gleaming enough but she wondered why it wasnt as facetransforming as dags or remos not as genuine maybe barr said goodlooking fellow was he oh yes as barr brightened further she went on also completely selfcentered a slanderer and a liar it wouldnt quite be fair to call him a coward because with those muscles he didnt need to be but he sure was eager to skim out of the consequences of his choices when things went sour she looked him over pursing her lips in consideration and added in a kindly voice its likely your hair color does it but boy howdy its not a recommendation ill try not to let it set me against you too much barr cleared his throat opened his mouth and prudently closed it again he made his wayor fledout of the kitchen to pretend to check on his boat on the back deck fawn stabbed her cloth once more satisfied at lunch remo stopped responding to barrs continued badgering altogether which left barr floundering fawn shrewdly followed remos example and whit followed the crowd hod and hawthorn didnt talk to barr in the first place hod because he was fearful hawthorn because he liked remo and didnt want him to go away and so took barr as an unwelcome interloper bo was bemused berry unamused and dag well it was hard to tell what he was thinking nothing simple anyhow it was late afternoon and forty river miles before they again came upon a village big enough to boast a wharfboat and goodsshed the fetch tied on and most everyone trooped up to the goodsshed if only to stretch their legs and enjoy a change of scene the goodsclerk when he saw the three tall lakewalkers shoulder into his shed leaned under his counter and came up wearing an iron helmet fashioned from an old cookpot with one side newly cut out before turning on his stool to do business with these fresh customers he adjusted the loop of handle comfortably under his chin remo choked barr nearly went crosseyed and dag pinched the bridge of his nose in a weary way berry bit her lip but not wishful to waste daylight rattled off her questions without any comment on the unusual headgear regrettably the goodsclerk knew of no local riverrat wanting to hire on for a downriver hitch as sweepman nor had he any memory of the clearcreek briar rose stopping here last fall although he did remember a couple of the tripoint boats from cutters list in the spring fawn made a few little purchases for the fetchs larder and whit sold one crate of window glass as they finished settling up and turned to go barr abruptly turned back mister he said to the clerk pointing at the iron hat where did you get the idea for that the clerk smiled at him triumphantly wouldnt you like to know eh lakewalker because it doesnt do a blighted thing it was a joke got up on some flatties stuck up above pearl riffle a few weeks back and they bought it we laughed at them some flatties obviously who had made it downriver this far ahead of the fetch fawn realized she stuffed her fist in her mouth and watched in fascination yep i just bet youd like to trick me into taking this off wouldnt you young fellow said the clerk in growing satisfaction laugh away well see who laughs last what i havent tried to buy anything off you or sell anything either yet the clerk nodded then reached up to adjust the slipping pot more firmly and nor will you barrs hands spread in a frustrated plea look i know it was a joke because i made it up myself the clerk sat back eyes narrowing shrewdly you would say that aye no really this is crazy groundsense sees right through a bitty thing like that an iron hat doesnt do anything it was just a joke i made it up berry gave dag a significant look dag reached out and gripped barrs shoulder come along now barr and stop arguing with this fellow boss berry wants to cast off but itsbut hes remo helped propel his partner through the door and down the muddy slope barr skidded to a halt and tried to turn back it was a joke i made it up dag sighed if you want to stay here and argue with that fellow im sure we can offload your boat and gear me i predict were going to be seeing pots on peoples heads up and down the grace and the gray for the next hundred years so we might as well get used to it or for as long as folks are afraid of lakewalkers and ignorant about our groundwork he hesitated looking down the sodden dreary valley in a considering way though i suppose if it made people feel safer it might could be a good thingno likely not he shook his head and trudged on its not my doing said barr plaintively head still cranked over his shoulder even as he stumbled in dags wake yes it is said remo irately blended in chorus with fawns whose else would it be and dags reasonable drawl sure it is might not be your intention but it was certainly your doing live and learn patroller barrs lips thinned but he finally shut up except fawn heard him mutter as he stepped aboard the fetch once more i made it up the next morning at breakfast barrs campaign upon remo was temporarily silenced when the entire crew of the fetch united in telling him to pipe down or prepare to go swimming it didnt quite cure the problem because barr took to staring instead imploringly or angrily or meaningfully remo gritted his teeth and attempted to ignore him fawn had no idea whatall the pair were doing with their grounds and groundsenses but would not have been the least surprised had remo burst out just like her brothers when theyd driven their beleaguered parents into threats of a whipping if silence did not ensue boss dag hes lookin at me make him stop lookin at me barr watched the shoreline slipping past and glowered harder fawn herself took to sewing spinning and unambitious cooking hugging the hearth her monthly had begun last night and she dared to hope that dags new treatments were helping her to heal because todays pain was merely uncomfortable not crippling other hopes rose in her mind as the dull tasks filled the hours dag had used a number of lakewalker tricks to avoid starting a child in her halfhealed womb but it sure would be nice someday not to need those tricks what was wanted fawn decided was not time but a place she pictured it in lavish detail while she jammed her needle through the tough oilcloth and occasionally her fingersshe preferred cooking to sewing generally the new bluefield place would need to be near a farmer town big enough to give dag steady medicine work but not so big or near as to overwhelm him there ought to be a little lake or at least a big pond to grow those lakewalker water lilies with the edible roots a kitchen garden of course and room for grace and her foal and surly copperhead she spent considerable time working out the garden plan and what other sorts of animals to have if they werent to follow the migrating seasons of a lakewalker camp she could have a house with four real walls and an iron cook stove like the one shed seen at silver shoals she mulled over all the names shed ever admired and not just for children because they did grow up and what was pretty for a baby might sound downright silly in a mother or grandmotherfawn for example whatever had mama and papa been thinking she and dag would have more than one daughter anyhow that was for suredag would like that should they be close to some lakewalker camp too would any lakewalkers want to be close to them what if any of those children with the dignified names turned out to have strong groundsenses she was just considering whether to pick out a name for graces foal too when a distant hail from the river broke up her daydreams bo who had been dozing in his bunk during his offwatch rolled over and slitted open one eye listened a moment and rolled back fawn set aside her sewing and rose to venture out on the cold front deck to see what was happening a keelboat was rapidly overhauling them on this long straight reach the wind was coming more or less from upriver for a change and the keel had its sail up to push it along even more briskly than the heavy current drew the fetch the name tripoint steel was painted on the prow in fancy letters with all the ts in the shape of drawn swords as the gap closed between the two boats boss cutter and boss berry bellowed the news back and forth across the moving waters berry reported the names of the boats that had been seen by the helmeted goodsclerk from their stop yesterday cutter mentioned a man who knew a man whod seen the briar rose at a town still forty miles downstream which made berry narrow her eyes and wave especial thanks it would save stopping before then berry wished cutter luck and cutter called back as the gap again widened and the tripoint steel splashed bravely on you girls be careful now were not all girls fawn heard whit mutter from the roof the fetch can look after its own blight it dag came out to cloak fawn in his arms and listen carefully while this was going on and barr leaned on the rail to watch in curiosity fawn explained to him about cutters quest for the missing boats like a river patrol sort of theyre looking for trouble and armed for it barr just shook his head that afternoon barr jittered around the fetch as restlessly as a bedbug at a family reunion swearing under his breath at each passing mile fawn would have bet that kidnapping schemes now revolved behind his silveryblue eyes but how to bring them off in a crowded flatboat in the viewand groundsensesof all those aboard defeated him at least till bedtime when she trod across the bunkroom after her last visit to the back deck for the night his open eyes still gleamed from his nest of blankets in the fading firelight the next morning when she came out to start tea she found him up and dressed before anyone else as fawn cut bacon and calculated how to stretch limited eggs over unlimited potatoes berrys bunk curtains stopped moving she yanked them back and rolled out dressed in her usual shirt vest and leather skirt shoving her sock feet into her waiting boots when she came in from the back deck after a brief morning wash barr was waiting by the door he lowered his voice boss berry can i speak with youin private he waved vaguely toward the bow she put a hand on one hip and regarded him without favor might it get you off my boat maybe she looked dubious but led him through the stores tying her hair in its horsetail with a scrap of cloth on the way whit sat up on one elbow in his bunk and blinked what was that all about barr wanted to talk to berry alone they went up to the front deck whit frowned rose and padded over to peer out the window no they went ashore theyre walking upstream hes kinda got his armhuh his frown deepened to a scowl and he went back to the bunk rack and shook remo awake remo sat up looking less than delighted but after a whispered consultation both drew on trousers boots and jackets and went out as well hawthorn and hod wakened by the rustling followed curiously dag wandered into the kitchen from their bednook amongst the stores and sat at the table smiling as fawn handed him a mug of strong tea whats the parade he asked nodding toward the bow he sipped gratefully and opened his second eye in the bunk rack bo rolled over and groaned then stumbled out to the back deck its a little hard to say said fawn standing on tiptoe at the window to look up the shore dripping trees gray mist muddy bank and no one in sight she went back to cracking eggs and cutting onions cheese and bread she almost sliced her hand when sudden shouts broke out in the distance dag sat up his head turning brows drawing down he tensed but did not rise the yelling diminished then rose again then stopped fawn certainly made out whits voice and probably barrs and remos both whats all that ruckus bo asked coming back in and helping himself to tea fawn stretched up again squinting out into the mist theyre all coming back uhoh barrs holding one hand to his face and remo has the other arm twisted up behind his back really hard whits got hold of a big stick and is waving it and talking berrys kind ofstomping wow she looks mad hods bringin up the rear as usual and hawthorns running ahead dag rubbed his forehead and took a long preparing breath fawn took heart that he did not himself jump up but then it seemed the emergency was coming to him hawthorns thumping feet across the gangplank announced his excitement even before he burst into the kitchen to cry dag barrs tried to magic berry and whit and remo says theyre gonna kill him more shuffling footsteps crossed from shore the boat dipped as many feet thudded onto the deck and the rest of the party arrived on a wave of raised voices too mingled to make out the words except for some you dids an i didnt and rather a lot of dag dag dag winced and took a long swallow of tea then turned in his chair as the whole mob piled into the little kitchenbunkroom the left side of barrs face was deeply reddened his eye was already swelling shut any other damage fawn could not see but both remo and whit were out of breath and hod of all people was rubbing his knuckles and looking ready to burst into tears barrs voice broke briefly above the babble i did not use some sense is this the time of day for that sort of thing ow stop that blight you he rose on his toes as remo hoisted him higher dag pitched his voice fawn noticed really deep the rumble somehow cut through the noise one at a time please boss berry the uproar died as whit and hod poked each other for attention to dag and even hawthorn swallowed his squeaks berry stepped forward grim and angry that patroller of yoursshe pointed a shaking finger at barrtried to do something to my head some sorcery yeah and we know what it was dont we said remo hoisting again ow no blight it dag said fawn uneasily from the place of safety shed sought behind his shoulder can you tell whos telling the truth dag looked around pursed his lips and dipped his chin he cleared his throat boss berry may i touch your head she hesitated a long moment then looked up to seek fawns eyes fawn nodded vigorously berry shrugged and stepped forward dag leaned back and collected fawn in the circle of his arm not for his own reassurance or hers but for berrys fawn realized very carefully dag touched the back of his hook to berrys pale forehead he had to have done something with his ghost hand because barrs mouth dropped open and even remos eyes widened i thought he was just a patroller barr whispered to his partner you thought wrong remo growled back well dag sighed without pleasure theres a new bit of ground reinforcement here its trying to be shaped as a persuasion but it isnt very well made so im not quite sure what it was intended to do if it had been finished can you get it back out o there said berry nervously i can release any beguilement and undo the shape so its no more directed than any healing reinforcement your own ground will convert it in a couple of days there shouldnt be any other effect than well you wont be getting any headaches for a bit shall i do this now his voice fawn realized had gone very gentle yes said berry i dont want no one puttin things in my head i cant see the little bit of absence in dags eyes passed faster than a blink there he said dropping his left arm all undone now berry rubbed her forehead i suppose i have to take your word for that im afraid so i didnt began barr what said dag just that word with a faint twist of astonishment but the look that went with it was like nothing fawn had ever encountered in dags eyes before shed never seen his waking face so absolutely wiped clean of any humor whatsoever barr flinched i wasnt trying to seduce her he got out in a much smaller voice what were you trying then said dag still in that deadlevel tone barrs teeth clamped i know where berry keeps the rope up in the stores said whit grimly we could hang him plenty of trees back in those woods i wouldnt stop you said remo barr winced berry pressed her temples uncertainly it seems i took no harm thanks to you boys she added a little gruffly with a nod all around at her crew the young men all stood a bit taller hanging might be too much too much or too good said whit hod offered helpfully my sister made me drown some extra barn kittens oncetied em in a sack with some rocks see we got some feed bags up front and theres plenty of rocks on the bank we could do that barrs eyes shifted toward hod in deep uncertainty dag said whit and dag echoed remo and hod wait howd i get elected judge here said dag its berrys boat shes boss any decisions hers youre the expert in lakewalkers berry said the only trusted one she did not add aloud but it sort of hung in the air implied fawn felt im not barrs patrol leader im not even a member of pearl riffle patrol dag nocamp indeed closest thing barr has to a senior officer here would be remo dag tilted his head invitingly at the darkhaired patroller what are you thinking dag fawn wondered besides ahead barr said desperately remo ammas holding me responsible for you and i cant make you do anything its not fair now you know how ive always felt about you remo took a breath nostrils flaring its berrys boat whatever she decides ill abide it wasnt what you think berry stalked up to barr sweeping her blistering gaze from his boots up to his blond hair you are about the most worthless sack of skin i ever met you aint payin you aint workin and you aint welcome on my boat so git no cried barr in illconsidered defiance not without my partner dags brows went up you heard the boat boss hod whit get his boat in the water fawn hawthorn fetch his things and bung them in remo dag stood to his full height as barr started to struggle ill lend you a hand the crew of the fetch scattered into action fawn brought the bedroll conveniently already rolled up and the bow and quiver and flung them any which way into the rocking narrow boat right after hawthorn tossed down the pack and the sacks dag and remo manhandled the struggling barr through the door although he stopped fighting and froze once dags hook eased around and pressed into the corner of one eye dont move sudden thats better now you got two choices dag advised you can climb down into your boat from the deck here or you can climb up into it from the water over there the water was black and utterly opaque this morning and even here by the shore the current raced making strange patterns on the surface and it looked so cold fawn would not have been surprised to see little skins of ice jostling but it was likely still too early in the season for that ill climb down barr choked the two released him and he scrambled over the rail bitter fury in every jerky motion the narrow boat rocked only a little as he sank balanced into his seat remo bent down and gave it a hard shove out into the swirling current barr looked around him hey he said indignantly wheres my paddle he held up both empty hands in protest as his boat drifted farther from the bank oh leave him go just like that cried whit in delight downriver bassackwards berry lips clamped stalked over to retrieve one of the narrow boats paddles from where they lay by the cabin wall she strode to the back rail and launched it endwise it landed a good thirty feet downstream of barrs narrow boat and was caught by the current if shed thrown it the same distance upstream it would have drifted right to barrs reaching hand theres your paddle patroller boy chase it she yelled after barr nice said whit leaning on the rail with eyes aglow barr with a lot of choked muttering in which blight was the most frequent word fawn could make out leaned from side to side and began clawing the water with his hands in an effort to overtake his paddles head start who gave barr the shiner fawn asked leaning beside whit remo and me and hod but he was too scared to hit him very hard ow said fawn he earned it i wont argue with that the clinging river mist closed around the narrow boat although the disembodied cries of blight it drifted back for a while longer berry squinted out in satisfaction right that should make the fetch a sight more peaceful she dusted her hands and led her crew back in to find breakfast fawn hesitated by dag who stood with his hand on the rail looking out into the layer of gray damp but seeing she suspected much more than she did there was scant satisfaction in him only close attention there he said at last straightening hes got his paddle back is that the end of him fawn asked hopefully dag smiled down at her well theres this hes a lakewalker boy away from home for the first time all alone hes not going upstream by himself thats for sure his only choice is to keep going down like us so well see she frowned at him in doubt do you want him to come back i dont like losing patrollers you kept remo thats one i dont like losing two patrollers bout twice as much as i dont like losing one well i hope you can find more value in barr with your groundsense than i can with my eyes and ears i hope i can too spark he sighed though the weather stayed cloudy and chilly the fetch made steady downriver progress all that day the enclosing hills flattened out sign berry explained to fawn that they were passing west out of the hinterland of oleana into level raintree the riverbanks were drained of color sodden brown with gray tree boles broken only by an occasional glumlooking river village or sometimes dun farm fields open down to the water no longer autumnnot yet winter berry kept remo on the sweeps with herpossibly fawn figured to avert another grounding since she encouraged remo in a way bo had not to offer warnings at least bo did not ignore dags laconic remarks clearly river pilot could be another job for lakewalkers amongst farmers in addition to medicine maker when fawn started sorting through the possibilities with an open mind it seemed to her that farmers and lakewalkers offered vast possibilities to each other for all that lakewalkers scorned any task that diverted them from hunting malices yet someday the last blight bogle ever had to emerge and be destroyed what would patrollers do when there was no more need for patrols not in my lifetime dag had said maybe lakewalkers were better off not dwelling on an end none of them would live to see she glimpsed barrs narrow boat ahead of them a couple of times that day and what might have been a campfire on the far shore that night till the rains came again and doused the distant glow the following day she saw his boat trailing far behind an inkstroke on the gray water before the fetch rounded another curve and the shifting shoreline hid it isnt a narrow boat faster than us she asked dag peering under the edge of her hand when they were both out on the back deck for a moment id think he should have pulled ahead or stopped somewhere and bought that brokedown horse he imagines hes trailing us just out of groundsense range which he isof his and remos though not of mine how long dyou think hell follow us not much longer with all his gear we threw into his boat no one included any food and i doubt hunting in the rain and dark on shore is likely to offer him much reward especially without a cook fire fawn hadnt noticed barrs lack of supplies in the rush dag did and had said nothing what was he up to dag went on rain again tonight i expect perfect perfect for what sober reflection spark fasting is supposed to be good for meditating on ones sins his dour smile faded a trifle barrs in trouble and he knows it hes getting his first taste of banishment there are reasons in our grounds that lakewalkers regard banishment as the next thing to a death sentence if hes let his bowstrings get as wet as i think i give him till tomorrow night tops to do what well thatll be somewhat up to him i dunno dag if i wanted some particular thing i dont think id leave it entirely up to barr he gave her a reassuring nod im not planning to spark the narrow boat trailed them disconsolately all the following morning around noon it spurted forward as if in sudden decision fawn wondered if this had anything to do with the smell of the baking apple pies wafting in their wake which dag had asked for especially for todays lunch she and dag stepped out onto the back deck to lean on the rail and watch as barr paddled close to the side of the fetch where remo held a sweep berry and whit were on roof crew with him this hour they all stared down coldly as barr hailed them he looked pinched and pale and nothing like as selfrighteous as upon his first arrival berry glowered over the side what are you doin back here barr jerked his chin its a free river berry shrugged her frown did not change remo barr called plaintively what is it youre planning to do once you get to the blighted sea anyway remo gave his sweep a long pull turn around or keep walking maybe depends on how i feel about things by then barr winced all right its plain you wont come back with me i um accept that remo said nothing barr took a fortifying breath can i come with you remos brows flew up what to the sea can i come with you barr stared up in something very like pleading remo stared down in unflattering astonishment why would i want you why would anyone i sure dont said berry maam barr ducked his head at her i could pay my passage partway at least i wouldnt have you on my boat for any money said berry i could work like remo you she snorted i aint seen you lift a hand yet you wouldnt have to pay melook im sorry all right dags lips twitched he gave fawns shoulder a squeeze and climbed up onto the fetchs roof bending his head he murmured to berry she shot him a startled frown then a slow respectful look that started at his boots and traveled to his serious face and said i dont know patroller i suppose you can try he nodded and dropped back down to the rear deck barr bring your boat alongside you and i need to have a private talk about some things he motioned barr closer when barr brought his boat clumping up to the hull dag climbed down and lowered himself into it facing barr and shoved them away barr stroked slowly backward till they were well out of earshot then set his paddle across his lap only then did dag lean grimly forward and start talking fawn scrambled up onto the roof to stand in the line with remo whit and berry watching whats dag doing asked whit craning his neck well said berry he said he wanted to talk to the boy patrollertopatroller like and then wed see what wed see barr waved his hands dags spine straightened in skepticism he leaned forward and spoke again and barr rocked backward i think that may be more like company captain to patroller fawn allowed was he aoh yes in raintree began remo i suppose the famous fairbolt crow wouldnt have given dag that command if he hadnt thought he could handle it fairbolt didnt just think said fawn he knew dagd been a company captain before when he patrolled up in luthlia luthlia said remo thats tough country i met a couple of patrollers from there once came across our ferry they scared me he eyed dag in new speculation barr perhaps inadvisably vented some protest dag gestured at his hook and spoke more fiercely uhoh said fawn if dags bringing up wolf ridge that boys in bigger trouble than he can guess wolf ridge said remo the wolf ridge dag was there thats where the hand went said whit waving his left torn off by one of them dire wolves that malice made he says he doesnt much talk about it but he sent the skin to papa as one of fawns bridegifts big as a horse hide the twins swore it had to be faked but papa and i didnt think so remos breath trickled out through pursed lips there were only a handful of survivorswait company captain at wolf ridge yeah which is why he dont care to talk about it said fawn so dont you let on i told you it gave him an aversion to captaining despite beating that malice absent gods said remo he watched the pair in the narrow boat dag was saying more barr was saying much less by the time dags hand clenched in a venomous fistfor some emphasis rather than threat fawn judgedbarr had shrunk to half his former size crouching in his seat really but the effect from this angle of view was pretty startling and if barr backed up any more he risked falling off the stern barrs lips had stopped moving altogether it was just head bobs now or sometimes head shakes at length dag sat back barr straightened his slumped shoulders picked up his paddle and aimed his narrow boat back toward the fetch as they pulled alongside again dag sat with his hand on his knee waiting barr looked up and cleared his throat miss clearcreekboss berry that is barr corrected himself as her frown deepened first off i apologize for what i tried with you the other morning what i was trying see i was trying to put a persuasion in your ground to get you mad at remo sos youd fire him and hed have to come back with me that was wrong i also didnt quite have a strong enough he caught dags rising brows and finished hastily i was just plain wrong is all he drew a long breath and continued and i apologize to you remo first for what i tried with boss berry which was as much out of line to you as to her and also for getting taken in by that flattie girl up in pearl bend even though you told me better and for flirting with her in the first place and for getting your greatgrandmamas knife broke when you came in after me in the fight and for that stupid joke with the pots that started it all which i guess im still going to be apologizing for when my hair turns gray which is going to be next week at this rate but anyway im really really sorry he looked up he looked fawn thought ready to cry gods dag you dont do things by halves do you but i knew that remos mouth was hanging open oh he said and i apologize to everyone on board the fetch barr concluded valiantly for being a walking talking blight on you for the past few days dags deep voice broke in heres the offer ill stand good for barr boss berry if youll let him back aboard your boat to work his passage in return barr will place himself under my discipline as his patrol leader barr if you agree you can come back on board if not youre on your own barr stared around the wide flat empty riverscape gulped and murmured i agree sir he looked up i agree maam berry leaned over skeptically sucking her lip you understand patroller boy youre here on dags word hes earned my respect which you have not and its his wallet youll be drawin on i dont know how you plan to pay that debt thats between you and him but i dont have to put up with you and if you give me one lick more trouble i wont clear yes maam she glanced at dag who nodded all right then you can come on my boat dag climbed back over the rail and barr once more handed up his gear he and remo manhandled the narrow boat across the rear deck and tied it down at lunch which came up shortly barr ate hesitantly though he left nothing to wash off his plate which was his gain because his first assignment was scullery duty with hod which he fulfilled almost wordlessly it was equally quiet up on the roof when he did his first stint on the oars with dag and bo at dinner he was slightly less ghostlike actually exchanging three or four unexceptionable remarks besides requests to pass the salt or cornbread cuddling down with dag that night fawn whispered what in the world did you say to barr out in that boat today ive seen frogs run over by a cart wheel that werent squashed that flat well i think thatd better be between me and him spark but dont fret too much barrs resilient you have to calibrate see a reprimand that would have poor remo trying to fall on his knife is just about enough to ruffle barrs hair did you um persuade him didnt need to he was ready reminds me of how you train a raintree mule first you whack him between the ears with a fence post hard as you can this gets his attention then you can start in that works on patrollers as well as mules or on patrollers who are like mules you have to give barr credit for that two hundredor three hundredmiles he hung on after his partner despite all that boys wrongheaded in a lot of ways but you cant accuse him of giving up easy howd you learn to handle muleheaded patrollers anyhow his lips twitched against her brow in the dark studied my own patrol leaders as a youngster up really close that would be like facetoface close uhhuh her dimpled grin brushed his collarbone muleman why am i not surprised though id have guessed you more for a young remo remo and barr each have their moments that throw me back in memory between the pair of em they put me in a real humble frame of mind toward my old patrol teachers i will say during the next day barr settled in to be a pretty good crewman as far as fawn could judge topside both his muscle and his groundsense proved useful and adding the extra man to the rotation gave everyone a bit more ease with the possible exception of the cook only hod resented the reductions of his turns on the sweeps but he was much consoled when barr was assigned to dishwashing duty in his place one meal out of three the good fellowship on the fetch slowly began to recover from the setbacks barr had brought berry put in at a largish rivertown too briefly for bo to wander away and find a tavern just long enough to learn of another sighting here of her papas boat last fall the news left her frowning thoughtfully and counting out the river miles still left till the junction of the grace and the gray the fetch was better than two thirds of the way from tripoint to the confluence not exactly running out of either river or possibilities but as the distance shortened fawn thought she could feel berrys tension grow dag begged one short stop at another lakewalker ferry camp though remo stayed aboard and barr with him dag came back soon shaking his head too small these camps strung along here id likely do better to wait for confluence camp which is the biggest in these parts better chance there fawn had thought the grace a big river at pearl riffle but she began to see shed been naive it was a lot wider now and not just because of the rains and the rise it was also starting to be more bendy turning in large loops that added river miles without getting them westward much and utterly confusing fawns sense of direction especially under the thickly overcast skies but toward the afternoon of the next day the scudding clouds broke up and genuine sunlight broke through once more when the chill wind also died fawn climbed up to the roof to sit at berrys feet and watch the passing scene the shores turned a sharper gray and a richer brown glowing soberly and the water shone a dark metallic blue as the suns light grew level and the shadows stretched they rounded a tight bend to find a familiar keelboat drawn up to a high place along the bank smoke rose from cook fires with the boats crew lazing around them when they saw the fetch some rose and waved and boss wain actually ran out to the back of the snapping turtle to cup his hands and hail them hey boss berry hows about a mutton dinner in exchange for a tune or three berry grinned and bent her head to fawn what do you say would the cook like a night off fawn looked dubiously at the rowdy keelers now adding whooping welcomes to that of their boss i dont know is it safe berry had always been with her papa and big brother before keeping an eye out for her oh aye wains a loud lout but hell keep the line if you do not that he wont push his luck mind doubt hell bother you thoughi mean you have dag dag indeed and whit remo hod bo and she supposed barr and hawthorn for the cheering on fawn decided to be brave like berry all right sure berry waved back you got yourselves a fiddler boys she leaned on her steering oar to bring the fetch to shore just above where the snapping turtle was moored keelers ran out to help tie their lines to the trees what more lakewalkers boss wain cried as they all trooped up to his fires what are you doing berry collecting em in a manner of speaking she replied swinging her fiddlebag this heres remo and barr dag you know wain tugged on the brim of his hat in uneasy respectful acknowledgment of dag and promptly begged his attention for a crewman with a hurt foot if hed a mind dag returned a nod eyelids lowering and lifting nobody brought up the sand bar maybe wain was trying to make amends in which case berry seemed willing to let him whats this wain stealing sheep again asked bo with a nod at the nearest cook fire where two crewmen were turning a browning carcass on a makeshift spit dripping fat made the fire lick up in smoky orange spurts and sent a rich aroma into the cool air fawns mouth watered and whit licked his lips wain stuck his thumbs in his braces and puffed out his considerable chest ill have you know that farmer gave us this here mutton his wave took in not only the roasting carcasses but three more worriedlooking live sheep tied to the trees beyond the camp his brawny lieutenant put in yeah he told us to take them as a present he begged so pitiful we finally gave in that i just plain dont believe said berry its true as i stand wain cried in indignation a sneaky grin stretched his mouth see we passed this sheep pasture up the river a ways and the boys allowed as how fresh mutton for dinner would go down good but the farmer likely wouldnt give us a fair price and i said no i wouldnt allow no sheepstealing a riverman should be above that but i bet saddler here a barrel of beer i could get us them there sheep for free and he said no you cant which was as good as a red rag to a bull you know me berry nodded though her blond brows had a skeptical lift to them which only seemed to encourage the other boat boss so we tied up the turtle and me and a couple of the boys snuck up on some of those sheepthat was a job let me tell you sliding around that muddy pastureand chucked a good slug of graymouth pepper sauce in the mouths of the six slowest or tamest fawn muttered suddenly not liking where this tale was going she edged closer under dags arm you shouldve seen those sheep run around then shaking their heads and drooling all orange at the mouth wains lieutenant saddler wheezed with laughter and took up the tale then boss wain see goes up to the farmers barn and calls him out and tells him theres something wrong with his sheepthat theyve taken the graymouth murrain horrible contagious the fellow was practically shakin in his boots by the time wain got done tellin him how he seen it wipe out a whole flock in a week down on the lower gray and the farmer asked whats to be done and wain says theres no cure and nothing for it but to cull the sick ones quick and maybe bury the carcasses in lime miles away from the others and this fellow was practically crying for his sheep so when wain suggested hed take away the sick ones and dispose of em for him the farmer was most pitifully grateful which we did do and here we are and you owe me the next barrel wain said slapping him on the back in high good humor that i do coughed saddler but it was worth it to see the thankful look on that farmer fellows face when we carted off his poor sick sheep and you have to admit wain spoke truethey didnt live the day the gathered boatmen laughed and even barr and remo smiled the tale finished the group broke up to tend to the dinner preparation including tapping a new keg set up on a nearby stump dag went off to see the fellow with the bad foot fawn caught whits eye and scowled the grin right off his face whats your trouble he whispered at her those couldve been papas sheep she muttered back his brow wrinkled i dont think papa would have been taken in by some smoky fiddle about the graymouth murrain fawn he knows his sheep better than that thats not the point that farmer may not be as smart as papa but ill bet he works as hard trickings same as stealing in my eyes and it was cruel on him the smoke wafted their way and whit inhaled appreciatively well those sheep are beyond saving now fawn best anyone can do now is see they didnt die in vain waste not want not as mama herself says well im not eating any she declared and you shouldnt either fawn he protested we cant go complaining and beingbeing walking talking blights and spoiling everybodys party these keeler men work hard this is a pretty innocent pleasure here a picnic and a singsong that farmer worked hard too harder than rivermen or you wouldnt be thinking of switching now would you thats not why ioh crap anyways dont eat that tastysmellin mutton if thats what pleases you but dont be ragging me he stalked off to console himself pretty promptly with a tankard of the turtles fresh raintree beer fawns jaw set but truly what right had she to blight the party especially if it was more or less wains apology to the fetch and its boss about that sand bar but she remained determined to touch no trickedaway mutton remo was now helping dag with the fellow with the hurt foot she withdrew quietly to the fetch and watched the camp on shore from a perch on the edge of the cabin roof the sun set and the firelight blazed brighter and more invitingly the noisiness of the boatmen grew more repellent bo was staggering already grinning foolishly though hod seemed to be looking out for him hawthorn was showing off his raccoon kits tricks such as they were to an appreciative or at least tolerant audience barr and remo were sitting together eating along with the man with the freshly bandaged foot so even they werent being standoffish lakewalkers wain saddler and whit were all grouped tightly around berry fawn began to wonder what the point was of spurning the affair for principles sake if nobody was going to even take notice at least one person noticed dag walked across the gangplank and lifted himself up to the roof to dangle his legs over beside hers whats the trouble spark you feeling all right i thought your monthly was past it is she shrugged i just keep thinking about that poor farmer that wain robbed or tricked whichever its just not fair she eyed him suspiciously are you going to eat that stolen mutton erim afraid i already have well dont try and kiss me with those greasy lips she said grumpily he cleared his throat i actually came aboard to find my tambourine and a couple of buckets for the boys to thump on berrys about to tune up her fiddle and she allowed as how shed like some help oh thatll be good it had been ages since dag had played music with anyone around a campfire and she knew that had been one of his pleasures out on patrol a tambourine was not much as a solo instrument blight that boss wain up the bank in the shadows a dim white shape uttered a mournful maaa it occurred to fawn that not all of that poor farmers sheep were beyond saving and a faint thump against the side of the hull reminded her that the fetchs skiff was presently tied to the stern down in the water rather than onto the side of the cabin where it often hung in rougher weather she could never have launched it by herself could she row it by herself upstream she eyed dag sideways could he be roped into helping with her scheme maybe not sometimes catfish notwithstanding he could be a little too grownup and responsible that left whit maybe but he seemed to have gone over to the other side in any case she now had good reason to cheer the party along merrily with lots of food and beer all around and any boatman or lakewalker who was laggingnot that this seemed to be a problemshould certainly be encouraged to drink up i wouldnt miss your music for all the mutton in the world she smiled at dag who looked heartened by her change of mood she even let him kiss her brow with muttony lips as he swung her down from the roof and as for fickle brothers well when youd watched someone all his life while he hardly noticed you you ended up knowing a lot more about him than he might credit a lot more she almost skipped across the gangplank after dag the moon rode high above the river valley shedding silveryblue light on the mist that wisped above the water the night air was as silent as though some ancient sorcerer had cast a spell of enchantment clearly a midnight made for romance although the chill suggested the kissing might better be conducted beneath a thick quilt the one shed left dag snoring under would have suited fawn fine instead well fawn this is crazy whit hissed at her lift your end whit someone will hear us not if you shut up and lift theyre all soddendrunk over there pretty much wainll be mad im mad whit if you dont help me hoist this stupid sheep into this stupid skiff not only will i tell berry what you and the roper boys did with tansy mayapple in millersons loft ill wake her up and tell her right now maaa bleated the confused sheep its hooves slipping and splashing in the mud and stones of the bank you shut up too fawn whispered fiercely now lift a grunt a swing and the last sheep was rocked over the thwart to join its two companions twelve cloven feet thumped and clattered echoing on the planks of the boats bottom round yellow eyes rolled in long white faces fawn leaped to thrust back the front legs of one trying to struggle out again soaking her shoes we better get in and start rowing she said you dont think theyll try and jump out when were out on the water do you they might and probably get their fleece waterlogged and drown to boot sheep are stupider than chickens whit nothings stupider than chickens well thats true he conceded almost as stupid as chickens then fawn scrambled aboard after whit to find that the boats end was now stuck in the mud from the added weight she climbed back out and prepared to give it a push off the bank only to freeze when a puzzled voice behind her spoke why are you taking sheep for a boat ride she spun around to find barr standing in the moonstriped shadows of the bare branches scratching his head and peering blearily at them why arent you asleep she hissed at him i was asleep i got up to piss he replied good beer those keeler boys had what are you doing none o your business go back to your bedroll barr ran a hand over his jaw and squinted at them does dag know you two are out here the absent look of a groundsense consulted slipped over his face no hes asleep good dont you dare wake him up he needs his sleep fawn stuck one alreadywet shoe into the mud and gave them a hard shove off the skiff slid away from shore if you dont want dag to know what youre up to then im definitely curious said barr stubbornly beginning to follow them up the bank were unstealing sheep said whit dont look at me like that it wasnt my idea wont boss wain be mad no said fawn hell think they chewed through their ropes and ran off i made sure to leave the ends ragged and all over sheep spit she rubbed her hands on her skirts and took up her oar unfortunately whits pull once they got coordinated was about twice as strong as hers which resulted in the skiff turning toward shore unless he waited for her to stroke again and in the pause the downbound current pushed them back barr was having no trouble keeping up even with the need to pick his way across the rocks and fallen logs you two are never going to make it upstream against this current he observed well were gonna try so get out of our way not that barr was actually in the way but he was being very annoying off to the side barr continued walking up the bank very slowly a passenger said maaa youre not making much progress he said again lets try farther out in the channel whit suggested fawn that makes no sense said whit currents stronger out there yes but itll be more private maaa maaa dagd flay me if i let you two babies go drown yourselves in the grace barr complained so dont tell him said fawn through her teeth her hands were beginning to ache after a few more minutes barr said i cant stand this give over come inshore and ill take fawns oar we dont need your help said fawn yes we do said whit and rowed harder fawn splashed madly but was unable to keep the skiff from turning in no the stupid sheepll try and jump out well go nab em you herd sheep barr and i will row fawn gave up barr edged past and he and whit pushed the boat out into the river once more fawn settled irately on the next seat and shoved a sheep face out of her lap but she slowly grew consoled as their upriver progress became more visible whits muscles were on the whippy side but a farmer sons life had left them harder than they looked and he kept up with barrs broader shoulders well enough the sheep dropped dung trampled it around the bottom of the boat and bleated one attempted suicide by leaping into the river but fawn lunged and pulled it back with her hands dug into its greasy fleece another tried to follow the firsts example cant you settle these sheep down with your groundsense fawn asked barr i bet dag could i dont do sheep said barr distantly no only boat bosses said whit which resulted in a chilly silence for a time the moonlit woods slid slowly past silvered and remarkably featureless im getting blisters whit complained how much farther well were looking for a sheep pasture that comes right down to the water said fawn what if the sheep are in the fold for the night said whit there are lots of pastures that come down to the water weve been passing em for days fawn was quiet do you even know which one were looking for asked barr erwellnot really fawn protested whit it could have been any farm for the last twenty milesor more likely morestands to reason wain wouldnt stop too close in case that farmer figured out hed been diddled and came after em im not rowing any twenty miles said barr the mutiny was unanimous the skiff put in at the first likelylooking pasture it came to and barr and whit united to heave the bleating cargo overboard the sheep cantered off a few paces and clustered to glower ungratefully back at their rescuers whit yanked fawn back into the boat and turned it downstream i sure hope they find a smarter owner she muttered yeah sheep dont bother thanking us for saving your lives or anything whit called sarcastically turning and waving whit theyre sheep said fawn you cant expect gratitude you justknow you did the right thing is all just like f barr began and abruptly shut up fawn shot him a suspicious look after a moment he said instead they sure did stink whos cleaning up this boat not me said whit somebodyll have to said barr i meanevidence i will take care of it said fawn through her teeth lovely moonlight and less lovely silence fell they came in sight of the fetch in about a third of the time it had taken them to labor upstream thank you both said fawn gruffly even if i couldnt make it right it seems less wrong now i couldnt have done it without your help ill remember that said whit dont you two unsheepstealers go congratulating each other too soon said barr with a nod toward the fetch fawn followed his glance and went still to see dag sitting crosslegged on the roof in the moonlight gazing upstream crap said whit though im suddenly glad youre here whit muttered barr to prevent misunderstandings and all he glanced circumspectly at fawn fawn thought the greater fear might be perfectly correct understandings actually as the skiff eased alongside the flatboat dag dropped down to the back deck to catch the painterrope fawn tossed up to him he sniffed and inquired dryly nice boat ride uhhuh said fawn staring up in defiance whit barryou look a mite sheepish one could say no we only smell it muttered whit it wasnt my doing barr blurted dags lips twisted up this time barr i believe you he leaned down to give them each a hand up in turn and oversee the skiff properly tied whit said uneasily are you going to turn us in who to they werent my sheep he added after a moment or yours barr breathed stealthy relief and dag shepherded fawn firmly to bed he actually kept his face straight until he had a pillow stuffed over it the chortles that then leaked through had fawn poking him stop that it took a while till he quieted down the fetch left its mooring soon after dawn when the snapping turtles bleary crew were just beginning to search the nearby woods for their escaped mutton the sweepmen draped on their oars maintained just enough motion to give steering way to the rudder and sometimes not even that even berry seemed content to drift at the rivers pace despite being as cottonheaded from lack of sleep as everyone else was from other excesses fawn kept strong tea coming and as the morning wore on folks slowly recovered the rivers pace picked up abruptly around noon when a great brown flood swept in from the right and the current grew rolling thats not the gray already is it fawn asked berry startled when she looked out her moving kitchen window to find the shore grown alarmingly distant nope said berry in a tone of satisfaction and took another swig of tea thats the beargrass river it swings up through raintree to farmers flats were threefourths of the way from tripoint to the confluence now they must have had heavy storms in raintree this past weeki havent often seen the beargrass this high do boats go on it fawn peered some more sure all the way to farmers flats which is the head of navigation pretty much which is why the town is where it is i spect the beargrass is almost as busy as the grace blighted greenspring had lain on one of the beargrasss upper tributaries as fawn recalled soberly bonemarsh camp too last summers grim campaign against the malice had all played out north of the big town of farmers flats the disruption hadnt reached down here dag might thank the absent gods but fawn thought the thanks were better due to dag with the addition of the beargrass the grace nearly topped its banks and in some places overflowed them some of the lowerlying islands were drowned already bare trees sticking up from the water as if growing out of a lake except that the lake was moving sideways at a fair clip fawn sometimes saw animals trapped up the island trees possums and raccoons of course a couple of black bears and once excitingly a catamount quite close they passed a wild pig swimming strongly in the current and the men aboard were barely restrained from trying to hunt it from the boat floating wrack either lodged on or broke loose dangerously from towheads those accumulations of trees and logs at the top ends of the islands that from a distance resembled the boatmen said the unruly locks of a fairhaired boy hence the name beargrass toward evening berry put two men on each sweep to fight the unwieldy fetch in to shore as they were tying up in the lee of a bend a peculiar arrangement floated past in the dusk two flatboats lashed together side by side the crew apparently struggled in vain to steer this lumbering rig because it was slowly spinning in the current out on the back deck bo called across the water for them to break up and tie to shore before dark but the men on the doubleboat either didnt hear or didnt understand their return cries were unintelligible whyd they fix their boats together like that asked fawn curiously coming out to look i expect because theyre fool raintree boys who dont know a thing about the river and have got no business being on it said bo and spat over the side for emphasis for company maybe or not to lose each other in the dark it likely made em feel safer out on this big river said whit slowly even the fetch is starting to look pretty small do you see why it dont make em safer said berry oh i do said fawn excitedly staring after the receding raintree flatties berry grinned i bet you do now wait for whit whit squinted into the dusk and said slowly theyre trying to move twice the weight with half the oars fawn nodded vigorously thats right said berry straightening in satisfaction we may make a riverman of you yet whit smiled blindingly at her i sure hope so she smiled back involuntarily not her usual wry grin but something unwitting and almost unwilling she rubbed her lips and shook her head and to top it theyre running at night unless they got themselves their very own lakewalker aboard not too bright im afraid she leaned on the back rail and stared down the river her eyes growing grave and gray in the gathering gloom fawn barely heard her mutter papa was no fool country boy so what happened during an easy stretch of river in the morning berry took whit topside to give him a lesson on the steering oar mildly inspired dag assembled the lakewalkers on the front deck for a drill in groundveiling hed a shrewd suspicion such groundwork had been somewhat neglected by these two partners in favor of more vigorous training in bow knife sword and spear dag took the bench barr leaned against the goat pen and remo settled crosslegged on the deck eyes closed or open they went around the lopsided circle taking turns at that inwardfurling blindness that sacrificed perception for privacyor invisibility unfairly barr had the stronger native groundsense of the pair though unsurprisingly remo was more disciplined at handling what he had you cant veil yourself any better than that and they let you out on patrol said dag to barr amma osprey must be harder up for patrollers than i thought barr waved a hand in protest going blind like this feels like being a little kid again he complained back to before my groundsense even came in theres a deep difference in vulnerability but leaking like you do youd never get close enough to a malice to make a rush with your knife if you had a knife at that range it could see me couldnt it i mean they do have eyes right usually but thats not the point a good groundveiling also resists groundripping at least by a weak sessile or early molt which youd better hope is what youll find yourself facing it occurred to dag that this could be another use for his own weak groundripping abilitytraining young patrollers to resist it he was tempted to test the notion except for the certainty that it would scare the crap out of these two even worse than it scared him and then there would be all those awkward explanations but it was a heartening realization that any patroller who could resist a malice could resist dag as readily as a brawler could block a blow to his face if he saw the blow coming leastways but not any farmer he bit his lip and pushed that troubling thought aside for later examination and whether youre the patrol member who places the knife or not the better your groundveiling the better the chance of not spending the week vomiting your guts out from the blight exposure after remo eyed him you ever do that it was closer to two weeks dag admitted after that i took my ground drills a lot more seriously lets go around again my turn to veil you two close your eyes but leave your groundsenses open and try to watch me dag furled himself firmly watching as the two obediently scrunched their eyes closed softly he rose from his seat barr grinned hey whered you go here he breathed in barrs ear the boy yelped and jumped sideways blight dont do that its how you get close to a malice you need to learn too ive heard an advanced malice can groundrip you all the same said remo dubiously ive only tangled with two that strong in my forty years of patrolling the wolf ridge malice i didnt see closeup just heard about from the survivors of the actual attack on the lair the raintree malice i saw eyetoeye that malice opened up one of the best groundveilers in my company as easy as youd gut a trout how can you even take down a malice that strong asked remo gang up on it go after it all at once with a lot of patrollers with a lot of knives and hope one gets through worked at wolf ridge worked the same at raintree he added after moment wellveiled patrollers so lets go around again after a couple more circuits barr remarked so are you saying if i stayed this lousy at my groundveiling id never be chosen for one of those suiciderushes in luthlia wed set you out for bait dag said remo sniggered barr grimaced at him again said dag interestingly barr improved but then barr had more room for improvement judging by his increased flickering remo was growing fatigued time to wind up thats enough for today said dag easing back onto the bench i think well spend an hour a day in this drill from now on barr stretched and rolled his shoulders squinting so much for the benefits of running away from home depends on what you run into dag drawled if we rode slap into a river malice around the next bend would you be prepared no said remo bitterly none of us has a primed knife then your job would be to survive and run for help to the next camp which is where blight said barr im not even sure where we are amma made us memorize the locations of all the camps in oleana remo offered good said dag too bad youre in raintree now and led the boys through a list of every lakewalker ferry camp and its location in river miles from tripoint to the confluence and made them each recite it back individually and in chorus granted the obscene version of the old memoryrhyme sped the process the cool morning was failing to warm the climbing sun absorbed by graying skies dag glanced down the river valley to see dense mist advancing up it berry popped her head over the roof edge if you can spare one of your patroller boys to pilot duty up here in a few minutes id be much obliged she said looks like were in for a real grace valley fog and i dont want to run up over it into some pasture half a mile inland like in bos tale the fetchd look funny on rollers ill come up said dag i could do with a stretch he joined berry and whit on the roof bo and hod climbed down for a turn at the hearth if im right in my reckoning said berry were coming up on a big island around this next bend that i dont want to get on the wrong side of do we want the right or lefthand channel righthand will do boss dag took a sweep and matched whits slow scullingjust enough to give berrys rudder steeringwaywhich they had learned how to keep up for hours if necessary the mist thickened about them beading on dags deerskin jacket which fawn had lately lined with quilting to help fit his scant summer gear for fall they followed the main channel as it hurried around the wide bend dag extended his groundsense to its full mile range to locate the split in the current before they were swept wrongsideto hey he said theres somebody on that island cant be said berry peering into the clinging damp they could see maybe three boatlengths ahead now with this rise from the beargrass that islands under three maybe four feet of water that could explain why they dont seem too happy dag reached opening himself as wide as he could ignoring the familiar and much louder grounds closeby seven men blight i think they may be those same raintree flatties who passed us by backwards last night he added after a moment and a bear theyve all taken refuge from the flood up in the trees must be exciting for the one whos sharing with the bear said whit dubiously bears got his own private tree after a moment dag added no sign of their boats not moored within a mile leastways i think those fellows are in trouble over there boss at least one ground shows signs of being hurt berry drew breath through her teeth bo she bawled hod you patroller boys git out here we need to get the skiff in the water afore we float too far the rest of the crew turned out onto the back deck and berry leaned over and explained the situation after dag confirmed the headcount of men stranded on the island they decided to launch both the skiff and the narrow boat in the hope of rescuing them all in one pass also dag pointed out so the two boats could partner each other in case of snags literal or figurative dag stayed with the fetch to guide it down the channel whit and remo each took an oar in the skiff barr paddled his narrow boat you sure about those fellows dag remo called up from the water once theyd all clambered down and were ready to push off yep just over half a mile that way he pointed barrs head turned oh yeah ive got em now follow me remo itll be just like old times his boat shot away as his paddle dipped and surged remo snorted but trailed dutifully whits voice drifted back through the fog beats shifting sheep anyhow sheep said berry dag shook his head long minutes slid past as the fetch slipped downstream floating with the current the banks obscured it felt as if theyd stopped altogether in a quiet fogwalled harbor running fulltilt into a snag or a big rock at five miles an hour and opening the fetchs seams would cure that illusion right quick dag thought he kept all his senses alert them lakewalker boysll be able to find their way back to us wont they said berry uneasily thats why we put one in each boat dag assured her theyve made it to the island ah good for the narrow boat barr can get it right in between the trees just sos he dont catch it sidewise to the current and lean too far over he could fill it in an eyeblink that way these pearl riffle patrollers are up to the rivers tricks i expect said dag handier than i would be and those narrow boats are made to float even full of water air boxes in the prow and stern tarred up and sealed so thats how they do that i always wondered she added after a moment we thought it was magic fawn took hod and hawthorn below to help assemble a warming welcome for the expected influx of unhappy boatmenor boatless men it was nearly an hour before the narrow boat appeared out of the fog astern two cold wet strangers crouched in a miserable huddle in the center clutching the thwarts nervously but a third sat up in the bow helping barr paddle bo and hod gave them hands to climb stiffly outone nearly dumped the boat over in his clumsiness but barr kept it upright wheeoh said the paddling man straightening up and pulling off a shapeless felt hat much the worse for wear he was a lean strappy fellow unshaven and shoeless his feet were scratched and his toes purple with the cold we sure are glad to see you folks we hit the top of that there island broadside in the dark last night and it just sucked our boats down under that big towhead like the river was swallowing em bo leaned over the steering oar and nodded sagely yep it would fawn hovering in the rear hatch looked on wideeyed they had barely hoisted the narrow boat back aboard when the skiff too emerged from the mist remo and whit rowing strongly the skiff rode low in the water with the weight of the four rescued men one was not only shoeless but shirtless the skin of his shoulders and torso scraped bloody some hanging in ugly strips he handed up an ash boar spear of all the things to have hung on to in the wreck he groaned as he was hauled and pushed up by his anxious companions but when he found his battered feet and gingerly straightened clinging to the upright spear he gazed around with a lively smile unbent he proved a tallish man by farmer measures with black hair straggling down his neck and bright brown eyes this heres our boat boss captain ford chicory the paddling man explained im boss berry and this is my boat the fetch said berry raking an escaped hank of hair out of her eyes youre right welcome aboard the skinned flattie blinked at her in frank appreciation well maam you folks sure fetched us out of a heap o trouble we called all night from those trees as the water was gettin higher till we got so hoarse we couldnt yell no more but youre the first as heard us thank the lakewalker here said berry nodding to dag hes the one that spotted you wed have passed you right by in this soup yeah and if we had heard you wed likelyve thought you was ghosts crying to lure us to our doom in the fog hawthorn offered helpfully the skinned flatties startled eye was drawn from dag by this he looked down at hawthorn in bemusement and scratched his head yeah i could see that too many tall tales berry explained cuffing hawthorn on the ear go help fawn she turned to her crew i want at least one of you patroller boys topside with bo both volunteered and climbed up and bo berry called after them this time if remo tells you its a sand bar or snag you mind him his crew herded their skinned boat bossor former boat bossthrough the back hatch dag ducked in after mentally locating his medicine kit the crowded kitchen was warm and steamy and there he found fawn had prepared gallons of hot tea and a huge heap of potatoes fried with onions and bacon drenched in salt butter a basket of apples stood ready warmed if not hot water waited for washing up stacks of every blanket and towel the boat carried were heating in front of the hearth the exhausted men fell on it all with moans of gratitude the limited supply of spare dry clothes was shared around as best as might be with blankets making up the rest hot water soap and dags kit waited by the hearth as well it seemed he was expected to take on the injured which he was willing enough to do it was mostly cuts and scrapes which he set hod to washing with strong soap whit helped bandage with a little instruction the flattie leader was the worst off and dag set him on a stool before the fire and borrowed fawns hands to help clean the odd injuries on his torso what in the wide green world happened to you fawn asked him as she started in with rags and soap did that bear claw you the fellow smiled back at her the way most sane fellows did despite his winces from her scrubbing not this time missy why didnt you bring back the bear too demanded hawthorn of whit both pausing to watch this process it wasnt a cub hawthorn whit said impatiently it wouldve sunk the skiff if it didnt try to eat us bossorcaptain chicory told hawthorn kindly bears can swim fine if theyve a mind itll get itself off that island when it gets bored he whispered to fawn ive got a boy about that size at home and his little brother to keep him in trouble in case he runs out which he never has yet i admit he raised his voice no see how it wasow sorry said fawn folding a cloth to pat new blood leaks from a scrubbed scab keep on missy i can tell youre doing me good how it was was wed come up shorthanded just before we reached the grace because three of our fellows got scared at the size of the river and run off with our skiff so we lashed the boats together but now i think that wasnt such a good idea as the rig was mighty obstinate after that we pretty much gave up and just went with the river figuring wed get a chance to sort out and maybe hire on a real pilot downstream a ways had any of you been on the river before asked berry joining the circle no not down this far some of my hands had worked the upper beargrass a time or two but boats are a new start for me my main line is huntingbear and wild pig mostly though my missus keeps her garden im no hand at farming tried it once if things are mainly going to die on a man anyway huntings a more natural trade for him i figure he took a long swallow of tea warming to his tale i was sitting down by the fire last night in the trailing boat trying to get my feet thawed and wishing i was back hunting bears on hard land where a man can at least pick his own direction when i heard the fellows running and yelling over my head then we struck that towhead thunk i knew right off we were getting sucked under tailend first because the upstream side o the floor tilted down like a rooftop i bolted for the hatch which was in the middle of the roof but the river was already apouring in like a regular cataract the only other opening was this little window in the side which wed mainly used for dipping up water before wed lashed the boats together berry glanced fore and aft to the fetchs two exits and its generous pair of windows i see you boys make those boats yourselves not exactly i bought em from a widow woman whose man was killed in that ruckus in north raintree this summer seemed a way to help her out hed been in my company was how it was he took another swig and continued i scrambled over to our dipping hatch but it was plain to see it was too small for me but with the river pouring in it was plainer it was go through it or be drowned and my papa always said i was born to be hanged so i chucked out my good ash spear stuck my arms through and yelled for bearbait and the fellows to grab me and pull with all their might or i was a goner the man with the battered hatdag trusted that bearbait was a nicknamenodded earnestly we didnt so much pull as just hang on tight and let the boat get yanked off around you i was mainly thinking how much i didnt want to go back to your wife and explain how you was drownded after all that she being strongly not in favor of this whole scheme in the first place he added aside to fawn who nodded perfect understanding that little hatch scraped off my shirt and skinned me like a rabbit but they got me through chicory beamed around at his crew who grinned back despite their fatigue we all scrambled onto the towhead before the second boat went after the first and spent part of the night clinging to the wrack like wet possums till it started to break up too then we waded back and found some trees that were rightsideup and not moving you know i suppose i should have been glum having lost my boats and lading and all my trouble not to mention my clothes and skin but i felt prime up in that fine tree every once in a while id break out chuckling couldnt help it it felt so good to be breathing air and not river he sighed i dont suppose ill ever see my poor boats again you never know said berry if they werent busted to pieces when they went under the towhead sometimes they come up again all waterlogged and get picked up downstream by folks what was your cargo barrel staves mostly and bear and pig hides kegs of bear grease and lard i dont care for the staves but i regret the other a passel of bears and pigs those were and not easily come by he glanced at his ash spear leaning in a corner your staves would likely be too warped to be anything but firewood later and the hides well itll depend on how long they soak and if they can be dried again without going moldy some of your kegs might make it if theyre good and tight chicory brightened at this news his partner bearbait looked less enthusiastic fawn finished washing and drying the wounds then traded places with dag who bent in for a close inspection with both eye and groundsense dag reported youre well gouged and scraped and your joints are wrenched sore but nothings dislocated or broken bleed pretty freely last night did you he was a sight confirmed bearbait i was ready to bust him in the jaw for laughing like that while looking like that but the bleedings mostly stopped on its own now dag gently worked out a few deep splinters with his ghost hand and tweezers the rips are too ragged to make stitching you up worthwhile i think he fingered a hanging ribbon of skin considered whether to detach it with knife or scissors then on impulse ripped its ground crossways in a slice as thin as paper the strip fell away into his hand he pitched it into the fire did that hurt what said chicory trying to crane his sore neck to see over his shoulder the tiny bit of the raintree mans ground in his own felt little different than a normal ground reinforcement not even as odd as a mosquito or an oat dag removed the other two bad strips the same way trying for as fine a slice as he could they did not bleed better stop here and think about this one eh youre going to have scars there chicory snorted indifference ive done worse to myself dag didnt doubt it give me your sayso and ill put a little lakewalkerstyle ground reinforcement in the deepest gouges to fight infection which is the biggest danger left then have fawn put some ointment on and wrap them up so the scabs dont crack when you move in a few days a clean shirt should be enough to protect them while they finish healing chicorys brows arched wryly if i had a shirt i could wash it sure if i had a bucket and soap he hesitated whats that thing you say you want to put in me fawn translated a touch of lakewalker magic healing oh chicory looked both impressed and alarmed thatd be a new start for sure all right he craned suspiciously as dag laid in lines of ground but his lips parted as his hurts eased how de thats a strange thing never had a lakewalker offer me anything like that before i aim to be a medicine maker to farmers once i learn more of the trade dag explained it isnt anything anyones done before mighty strange place this big river sighed chicory plans were made to deliver the boatwrecked men to a town two days down the river where chicory hoped to find an old friend who would help them to shoes clothes and enough gear to commence walking home meanwhile berry undertook to watch for signs of their lost boats the exhausted men slept in piles and didnt wake again until the fetch tied to the bank for the night and fawn had to clear the decks of her kitchen to start supper dag wasnt sure if he wanted to wrap a cloak of husbandly protection around fawn or clutch her to him like a talisman against such a concentration of strange farmers just who was supposed to be protecting whom but with fifteen people crammed aboard the fetch privacynot to mention private conversationwas out of the question dag quickly learned that chicorys crew were mainly his friends and neighbors from a small town on a feeder creek to the lower beargrass southwest of farmers flats and so not in the direct path of last summers horrors news both dag and fawn took in with reliefhis covert hers warmly expressed chicory had acquired his tag of captain by getting up a troop of local volunteers to go help out when the troubles began when the malice had grown advanced enough to kidnap and mindslave raintree farmers marching them to attack other settlements in turn by the looks they exchanged barr and remo were inclined to mock this selfappointed rank dag the more he listened was not ford chicory proved to be an excellent taleteller he was no blowhard like boss wain his place at the center of his tales was as often as the butt of the joke as the hero but he had a knack for holding his listeners in thrall either way after dinner aware of his audience and perhaps in return for the boats hospitality he even told a creepy ghost story that had both hawthorn and hod bugeyed and half of the crew pretending not to be tales now being as readily exchanged as coins in a dice game everyone clustered around the hearth as chicory and his crew learned in turn about berrys quest dag and fawns west blue marriage andinevitably dag supposeddags place in the campaign against the raintree malice dag did not willingly volunteer his words but with fawn whit the crew of the fetch and once in a while even barr and remo chiming in he didnt need to do much more than adjust their dagtales for overenthusiasm as the raintree mens picture of him shifted from itinerant medicine maker to expatrol captain they grew warierdag could not decide if this was a relief or an annoyancebut chicorys attention sharpened id seen old blight bogle lairs when i was out hunting from time to time chicory told dag dag wondered how often the man had ventured into forbidden territory above the old cleared line but now did not seem the time to ask chicory went on gray patches all nasty and dead it didnt take no highnosed patrollers to convince me to stay off em no sir dag let his groundsense flick out a successful hunter like chicory might well possess a rudimentary groundsense like aunt natties if some passing lakewalker had climbed his family tree a few generations back it was impolite to inquire though and since chicory seemed to have led an irregular wandering life far from his birth kin he might not know himself the raintree man continued ive met your patrols run across your campsthey never invited me in mind more like invited me to move alongbut id never seen lakewalkers run before they went streaming past us like rabbits when we got up north of the flats said a crewman in a faintly scornful tone now that was the women and their young shavers mostly said chicory in a fairminded way malices snatch the youngsters first by preference dag said when a malice goes on the move lakewalkers have learned to get the little ones out of the path as fast as they can with the restoffduty patrollers other adultsfor rearguard likely you didnt get far enough north to meet the rearguard or the malice might have taken you too we met plenty of them mudmen bearbait put in face darkening in memory both before and after they lost their wits ugly mugs they were the malice makes them up out of animals it catches you know fawn said by groundwork she went on to describe the grotesqueries of the mudman nursery shed seen at bonemarsh camp with such simple directness that she seemed unaware of how thoroughly she was topping chicorys ghost story for keeping folks awake in their bedrolls later upon reflection dag was not surprised to learn that chicorys troop had acquitted itself well upon the mudmenhunting and killing bears and wild pigs would have trained them in both methods and daring but chicorys face grew graver when he remarked ugly as they was they didnt bother me near as much as those boglemaddened farmers we met up with because they werent driven witless it took you a little to realize they werent right in the head because they walked and talked as if what they was doing was sensible and they looked just like anybody else too you couldnt hardly tell who was on what side till they jumped on you and then it could be too late what we did find thoughhe rubbed his chin and frowned at dag in the lantern glow and firelightwas that if we rode in and grabbed up a few and took em back south far enough theyd come to their senses we first found that out trying to capture one to make him talk got him far enough away and he talked all rightnot that you could make much sense of it through the crying after that we tried to catch as many as we could and carry em away till they found their lost minds again wouldnt any of them join us to go fight after though dags brows rose in increased respect i didnt realize farmers could do that on the edge of a malice war huh that would begood draw down the malices forces you took a chance said remo in disapproval if youd got too close to the malice it might have caught your minds in turn and then the malices forces would have been up not down chicory said stiffly seems to me such a chance wouldve overtaken a man sitting still just the same he eyed dag sidelong and added i was never too fond of lakewalkers and the ones ive met have pretty much returned the favorbut i do admit after last summer i dont like blight bogles a whole lot more the leadin could not be spurned dag set fawn to describing greenspring again as he did not think he could bear to fawn and whit together managed a creditable explanation of groundsense and sharing knives barr and remo listened with troubled faces to these deep lakewalker secrets being bandied around the boatmen with expressions ranging from disturbed to disbelieving chicory though just grew quiet and intent chicory seemed a village leader of sortsif a terrible boatmanwith initiative and wits enough on dry land to persuade friends and kin to follow him into discernible danger for a good cause his words as well as the slices of his ground gave dag much to digest as he retreated with fawn to their curtained nook the bits of ground were converting far more readily than those of the mosquito or even the oats nearly indistinguishable from an ordinary supporting or healing ground reinforcement as with malices it seemed people made the best food lakewalker cannibals indeed neither chicorys ghost tales nor his war stories had unnerved dag but as fawn cuddled into the curve of his body and drifted into sleep that last reflection kept him awake for a long time the fetch didnt handle any worse for its added passengers but neither did it handle any better dag noted the next morning as he took his turn on the roof hod was on the opposite oar and whit at the rudder very proud to be permitted to steer all on his own down this straight stretch berry would be coming up shortly to take over as she said the next bend would bring them to one of the trickiest passages on the river berry had allowed a few of the raintree flatties to volunteer for oar duty but only one at a time and under her or bos close supervision the rest seemed willing to help out with the increased scullery chores their presence as inadvertent guests had caused so except for the unavoidable crowding and the friction on the lakewalkers groundsenses a day more of their company seemed likely to pass pleasantly enough since a chill wind funneled up the valley with sunshine intermittent between the scudding bluegray clouds most everyone stayed inside near the hearth or curled up in nests amongst the stores as dag studied the river two men in a skiff put out from a feeder creek beneath a bluff rowing in their direction when they pulled to within shouting distance the older one rose up on one knee from his bench and hailed them waving his hat hallo the boat how de whit called cheerfully in return what can we do for you fellows well its more like what we can do for you that last flood messed up the channels all through crooked elbow something fierce ill undertake to pilot you through safe this was a common way all along the river for local men to earn a bit of coin berry now that shed come to trust her lakewalker crews groundsenses usually turned down such offers politely though she did enjoy the exchange of river gossip that went with sometimes the rowboats also brought out fresh food or other goods to sell or trade im not the boat boss whit called back but what do you charge just ten copper crays to the elbow twenty to the wrist a nominal sum well worth it to the average boat given the timeor worsethat could be lost to an accident dag opened his ground furled to block out the uproar of the crowd on the fetch and paused in his sculling huh he said to hod and whit thats funny one of those fellows is as beguiled as all getout by a malice said whit in alarm hod gaped curiously no theres not a touch of blightsign he must have had some encounter with a lakewalker lately dag stared as the men rowed nearer the beguiled man was middleaged shabby roughlooking a typical tough riverman he hardly seemed the sort to have attracted the attention of some female lakewalker lover perhaps he had less visible attractions but his ground was certainly no brighter than the rest of him he hadnt been healed of any obvious injury lately the other dag could imagine drawing a female eye well built young openfaced with crisp brown hair and cleanly in his dress and bearing but no beguilement distorted his ground for all that it was furrowed by old stress it was a puzzle you can come up and talk to our boss i guess whit called down as the skiff came alongside i dont think we need a pilot but we have some things to trade if youre interested some real fine glassforge window glass to start the skiff men waved apparent understanding hod shipped his oar and swung down to the bow to help them tie their boat and clamber up past the chicken pen they both gazed around with interest the pilot could have been watching his prospective customers approach for the past ten miles from a vantage on that bluff dag realized hey boss hod called through the front hatch more visitors dag locked his oar and walked forward to the roof edge he looked down to see the top of berrys blond head bob through she stopped as if stonestruck the tin cup in her hand fell to the deck with a clank and rolled disregarded spilling a last mouthful of tea the handsome young man looked up at her with recognition in his gray eyes and dag would swear a flash of horror alder berry shrieked and flung herself forward to wrap around the startled fellow nearly from top to toe his arms hesitated in the air then closed around her to return the hug alder alder berry repeated joyously her face muffled in his shoulder youre alive berrys radiant joy seemed to light up the air around her in contrast alders roiling ground darkened in consternation dag set his feet apart and stared down hand on his jaw fingers spread hard across his lips what is this hod grinned uncertainly whit abandoned his steering oar and came to dags side to peer over his eyes widening in a suddenly set face hawthorn bo fawn come on out here ive found alder berry called alders hand made a futile gesture and fell to his side he stretched his mouth in a smile as hawthorn came bolting out of the hatch with a yell of glee the boy might have hugged alder if berry hadnt already held that space with no sign of giving it up as it was he danced around the pair whooping fawn and bo followed at a less violent pace a curious remo dodged the crowd by hoisting himself up from the back deck and strolling forward to watch as the cries of greeting swirled around alder his skiff mate looked up and spotted remo alder he gasped theres a lakewalker on this here boat we have to leave off you know crane dont want us to mess with no lakewalkers alder stared up at the row of spectators lining the edge of the cabin roof he drew a short breath no skinktheres two that tall ones haircut fooled me at a distance berry grinned widely at him three actually dag and remove been in my crew since pearl riffle and barr um signed on later theyre all real tame thoughyou dont have to be scared of em alder gulped no not scared buti guess you wont be needing a pilot huh no agreed skink loudly these folks dont need us come on away alder alder swung to his companion no you dont understand this girl herehe waved at berryshes my betrothed was is from back at clearcreek did you come all theno yes of course you came from clearcreek had to have we cant hire on this boat skink skink said uneasily right thats what i said what you want t do then hawthorn interrupted urgently alder where were you wheres papa and buckthorn and the briar rose wheres the other boat hands that was with you berry stood a little away from alder wrenched unwillingly from her elation by these harder questions oh alder why didnt you come home or write or send word up the river with someone its coming on eleven months since you left weve been worried sick about you all alders lips moved wordlessly he swallowed and found at least a few im so sorry berry the briar rose sank in a storm near here last winter i was the only one as got off some fellows fromhe glanced at skinkfrom a hunting camp up in the elbow picked me up off the shore nearly dead i was sick for weekslung fever by the time i got better there was no sign of the boat but a few boards caught in a towhead the river took the rest are you sure asked berry anxiously they might have got downstream of you and thought you was lostno they would have sent word somehow her breath went out of her in a long sigh hawthorns hopeful face crumpled berry folded him in one arm his back shook shh hawthorn she said hugging him tight we always sort of knew didnt we because papa and buckthorn and she hesitated they wouldnt have left us without saying unlesswell she scrubbed her free arm across her damp eyes why no word alder it was so cruel on us alder drew breath it took me months to get stronger and then i owed the camp fellows for their help and then i thoughti went down the river to get us a grubstake and i didnt want to come dragging back to you with my hands full of bad news and nothing i meant to at least replace the value of the rose for you but its took longer than i thought it would remo whispered urgently in dags ear dag hes dag held up his hand and murmured back wait let him finish he stared down intently at the anguished people on the front deck groundsense as open as he could bear which was not wide at this point berry cried alder youre making no sense you know me better you must how can you think id put a bag of coin above my kinfolks lives or even the knowing of their fates im sorry berry alder repeated helplessly hanging his head i was wrong i see that now i never dreamed youd come after me a variety of expressions had moved across the listening bos face from muted pleasure to muted grief now he was simply mute chewing gently on a thumbnail fawn had tumbled out onto the deck almost as excited as hawthorn her face had fallen in mirror to her friend berrys now she stood by bo with her arms folded listening hard on the whole dag was glad she did not seem to be swallowing all this down as readily as berry but then she had less reason to alder had sworn no heartoaths to fawn and any hopes she held for berrys happiness teetered on a balance against fears for whits my sparks shrewd she feels the twist in this berry went stiff alderyoure going to have to tell the truth sometime so it may as well be now if theres another girl youll have to betray one of us or tother so you cant win that toss nohow if shemaybenursed you back to health or something i dont suppose i can even hate her berry stared beseechingly at him they were standing wholly apart now no said alder in surprise no other woman i swear remo whispered blight s the first true thing that fellows said aye replied dag and sorry he was for it it would have been a tidy wrap for the tragedy he added softly keep an eye on that beguiled fellow hes getting ready to bolt skink was edging toward the skiff remo nodded and slipped quietly down past the chicken pen skink stopped and edged back looking furtively around the crowded bow berry searched her betrotheds face and decidedhowever wishfully even dag could not tellthat he spoke true then come with me now well sell the fetch in graymouth and have all the grubstake we need the house in clearcreek is waiting her voice skipped a breath i had it all ready for us alder ran a harried hand through his hair i cant run off with no word to the camp fellows as helped me of course not said berry we can stop around the bend id want to thank them myself for their care of you orshe paused as a new realization apparently overcame herif you have debts to them well i have some coin as will clear them its not much but its enough to cover a sick mans keep and nursing she hesitated again in unwelcome suspicion unless they were gambling debts that got all out of hand on you berry theyre a pretty rough lot better i should deal with them and you take your boat straight on illcollect my things and meet you at the wrist bos slow voice broke in you never found any bodies to bury proper alder shook his head the roil in his ground was growing frantic you dont have to soften it for me said berry in a low voice i know what this river can do was this dags business he glanced at fawn who was anxious for berry but more anxious for the stricken whit at bo at the bewildered hawthorn dag was not above supporting lies to shield someone from futile pain but all directions seemed bad here so lets have the truth out and see where the pain falls fairly he looked down gravely and said berry alder is lying to you her face turned up white and wild what about everything skink lunged for the rail he was caught by remo and by chicory who had come out partway through the uproar to lean against the cabin wall and listen in baffled fascination chicory was quick enough to help catch skink before he went over into the water a hunters reflexes but his face twisted up in doubt once the struggling man was held between them what are we doing here lakewalker he called up to dag im not sure but that fellow is beguiled to the gills i dont know who did it or when or why had it been on purpose oh thats no good said hod can you fix him dag what would happen if he unbeguiled the unsavory skink it was gutwrenching to imagine having to take in that repulsive groundrelease but beguilement was a hurt in its own way if dag would not leave a man bleeding or lying with a broken bone could he turn away from this why are you trying to run off skink i wont hurt you skink glared around madly crane wont like this he told alder the fear from both their grounds pulsed like a stench but alder at least held his stance as dag eased down from the roof and approached skink on my head be it he lifted his left arm not that he needed to touch the man at this range but aligning body and ground helped him concentrate the act was growing easier with practice dag flinched as the backwash of skinks agitated ground poured into him but he forced himself to accept it dag wasnt sure what response hed been expecting but it certainly wasnt skinks collapse into utter shock and violent weeping a sudden shuddering heap on the deck no no no he wailed no no no chicory bit his lip in appalled fascination tense with surmise yes dag thought the troop captains seen something like this before and so have i skink pull yourself together alder snapped he looked around at his gaping audience now augmented by barr and bearbait sorry folks sorry it takes him like that when the drink wears off sometimes i better get him back to camp any one of alders lies might have been plausible the accumulation was surely not what truth does he fear so desperately this was dags last chance to avoid finding out alas there wasnt much to choose between regret for a disaster from a mistake or regret for a disaster from being perfectly correct strike at the weakest point strike fast he strode forward yanked up skinks head by the hair and bought his attention with if not a fence post between the ears his harshest companycaptains voice look at me skink stared up his breath catching in midsnivel dag demanded what are you really doing here boat bandits babbled skink were supposed to check the downbound boats and if theyre any good bring em in to crane and the boys for the plucking oh gods what cried berry alder what she wheeled to stare in horror not at skink but at her betrothed the mans in a drunken delirium the man said chicory thoughtfully reminds me a whole bunch of those fellers we used to pick off the edge of the blight bogles camp dag just barely kept himself from saying its related not a parallel he wished to draw attention to he compromised on maybe but this is human mischief it seems he yanked skinks hair again refusing to let him retreat into breathless weeping how many bandits where thirty forty and crane always him where cave theres this cave up around the elbow thirteen river miles around the loop but just three across the neck gives time to scout out the boats and prepare see hes spouting good now keep up the pressure was there ever a malice in the cave what a blight bogle skink shook his head aint no blight bogles around here just crane thats bad enough and them drum brothers before the drums come alder was cranes righthand man but he likes them better now and even alders not crazy enough to be jealous of them two drums dag shook skink again leaning down on his shoulder as if skink were a leather waterbag and dag was trying to squeeze out the last drops so you lure in the boats with offers of piloting and then what steal their valuables what do you do to the crews that wasnt how they got my boat when i first come the cave was still fixed up as brewers cavern tavern bring us in get us drunk set on us while we was in a stuporexcept the ones crane saved out for his gameoh the blood and pitifulness of it all very quietly bo and barr had moved in on either side of alder dag was glad to see berry had stepped back her face drained cold distant fawn gripped her bloodless hand in support or restraint or both what happens to the crews nowadays dag kept on kill em in their sleep or from behind if we can cant let any run off to tell ride em down if they run crane can always find em burn the boats or hide them in the blocked channel back behind the island cant let any boats go down to be recognized either brewer used to do that but crane is cannier brewer invented the game too but crane won it in the end and the bodies used to plant em in the ravine till little drum showed how you could slit their bellies and load em with rock and sink em in the river sos they dont come up faster than buryin oh gods see them drum boys dont always kill em first was this enough too much dag knew their urgent danger now and surely decanting more grotesque detailswhat was the game could wait till they were not in front of fawn berry hawthorn and hod one more who is crane the lakewalker our lakewalker barr and remo both took that in immediately dag could tell by the way their grounds snapped shut like mussels a renegade a madman a malices pawn where did he come from dag pressed relentlessly dont know he was here already when i come along oleana somewheres i guess did he start the gang no fellow named brewer i said was brewer a lakewalker surely not with that name no course not before mebefore aldercrane was just a passenger on a downbound flatboat that brewer lured in to the cavern tavern somehow he talked brewer out of killing him and then he was brewers righthand man for a time and thenno more brewer just crane skink hesitated brewer they say he just wanted to get filthy rich but nobody can figure out what crane wants hes alone no theres about thirty or forty of us depending i mean no other lakewalkers with him dag clarified oh yeah alone like that i guess where is he right now do you know nowhere within a mile but a mile seemed suddenly much too short a distance between this madness and spark skink shook his head cave last i seen alder seemed to cringe inward dag looked up and eyed him in cold speculation berry swallowed and said to dag ask him if they tooksaw the tripoint steel them struttin keelers skink snorted they was through here last week crane he said to lie low and just let them fools float on by which they did dag met berrys eyes and read the message no help there but it set his mind to spinning the fetchs complement was outnumbered by at least two to one but other boats came behind in a steady stream clever of the bandits to take only the richest and let most pass unmolested but even so their crimes could not go unmarked much longer how much time did the fetch have to prepare prepare what some of the raintree flatties had taken over the oars or the fetch would have drifted into a sand bar they were much closer now to that feeder creek with the good lookout just above it dag motioned to chicory and bearbait did you ever have the hunting of bandits up in raintree once chicory admitted scratching his head it was only a couple not thirty or forty brought them in alive to be tried before the village clerk but we didnt have to stay for the hangings not my favorite sort of hunting but it needed doin dag said it seems to need doing again ive helped take out bandit gangs a couple of times plus the big one that plagued glassforge first trick is you make sure you outnumber the targets the snapping turtle is not too far behind us and there may be other boats following soon if we can get enough help by nightfall are you fellows in chicory glanced at bearbait who nodded might as well be if i could id prefer to leave the farmers to the farmers and the lakewalker to the lakewalkers said dag barr and remo both flinched at the word of their new task but returned his nod this crane is likely to be dangerous in ways you cant fight that would suit me said chicory slowly as long as theyre all brought to the same justice after his gaze at dag was hard and questioning if hes guilty of half the horrors skink suggests that wont be a problem threes been a quorum for field justice before this chicory gave this a very provisional nod well if you want to make a rabbit stew first you catch your rabbit aye said dag after the fetch tied up at the mouth of the feeder creek fawn watched anxiously as dag and most of the rest of the men took their prisoners ashore for further questioning they all returned in about threequarters of an hour looking even grimmer although neither alder nor his shattered partner showed signs of much new roughingup bo closely supervised the chaining of alders hands behind him around one of the sturdy posts holding up the fetchs roof between the kitchen space and the stores he advised dag id put a gag in his rotten mouth too dag just shook his head but he told berry and fawn dont let those chains loose for any reason if he has to piss turn your backs and have hod hold a bucket he held berrys eyes as he said this she nodded shortly then they all settled down to wait for reinforcements whit signaled from the bluff fairly soon he and bo went out in the bandits skiff to explain matters to a downbound flatboat which then rowed in to tie alongside the fetch its nine ablebodied flatties were shocked at the news not to mention at their own narrow escape and readily volunteered for the attempt to burn out the river robbers the snapping turtle came into sight around noon and fawn saw dag start to breathe a little easier its raucous crew pronounced themselves all in for the dirty job the serious planning began then amongst the cadre of leaders and bosses gathered on the shore wain and saddler chicory and bearbait the new flattie boss and dag wain claiming to be the best brawler on the river bar none was inclined to assume leadership he called for a roundabout river attack although it was plain dag preferred chicory to lead a land strike up over the neck when the blustering threatened to grow loud and prolonged dag took wain aside for a brief word fawn watching from the fetchs bow was not at all sure it had been words alone that persuaded wain to settle down and she nibbled on her knuckles in worry as dag looked darker than ever but the land ploy was finally agreed upon the men spent the afternoon assembling or devising weapons all had knives and cudgels were readily fashioned but there were fewer spears and bows amongst them than dag plainly would have preferred he set whit with the bowmen does whit have to go fawn murmured to dag in a rare private moment snatched out on the fetchs back deck he volunteered it would be an insult to leave him with the boats and im short on archers he pushed a curl of hair back from her brow at least bowshot puts him farther from the rough and tumble theres a point she conceded andid rather not leave him with alder her gaze flew up dag no matter how heartbroke he is for berry whits not an assassin no but alder has as twisted a tongue as ive ever encountered if he talks berry intoanything theres as much danger of whit being persuaded to some foolishness out of misplaced nobility as there is of his going to the other extreme im as happy to remove him from the dilemma altogether he hesitated were all going to have to turn hangmen come morning you know if this goes as it should berryll need all the support you can give her through that does alder have to hang i mean he was beguiled by this lakewalker crane wasnt he is he guilty if he did what he did under compulsion is skink isnt that going to be a real problem to figure out comecome morning dag was silent for a long time staring out across the river im not planning to bring it up if the others dont please dont you either theyre all guilty enough dag she said reproachfully i know i know he sighed no matter what first we have to capture the bandits we need to get through that with a single mind argue after when its safe to her lips twisted in doubt he held her bent his face to her hair and murmured into it i thought when i quit the patrol this sort of work would all be behind me and i could turn my whole heart and ground to fixing folks instead of killing them and even lowervoiced and once id fixed as many as id ever killed id be square and then start to get ahead does it work like that i dont know spark im just hoping she gave him a hug for support and turned her face up cant you at least unbeguile alder before you boys go off tonight itll be horrible for berry to watch him fall to pieces like that skink fellow but at least he mightnt be so dangerous i cant unbeguile alder why not you did the other its not like groundgifting is it where you can only give so much before you collapse yourself or is it like that piece of pie too much at once no he said in slow reluctance i cant unbeguile alder because hes not beguiled in the first place a silence oh said fawn at last oh gods poor berry just when were you planning to mention this to her i dont know i have way too much tumbling through my head right now to trust my judgment on that get the bandits first and their leader crane especially i know that much it may well be the only thing in the world i know for sure right this minute it seemed oldpatroller thinking to her get the malice first everything else after she didnt think he was wrong but after was starting to loom in a worrisome way she settled on reaching up to give a heartening shake to his shoulders and say you get those bandits good then he gifted her back a grateful smile and a jerky nod in the afternoon another flatboat arrived but it proved to hold a family the papa and the eldest son volunteered along with two boat hands to the dismay and fright of the mama who was left with four youngsters and a grandpa no one expected arrivals after nightfall when most sensible boats tied to the banks but at the last glimmering of dusk one more keelboat came almost slipping past in the shadows its crew of toughlooking silver shoals men when the awful litany of deceit murders and boatburnings was recited yet again made no bones about joining up then there was nothing to do but feed folks talk over plans in more detail and keep the men quiet and sober till midnight there was little work to getting dags war kit ready as he planned to be gone for mere hours not weeks fawn had thought they were done with these partings in the dark when hed quit the patrol the returning memories unnerved her but the crowd of river men assembled on the bank was encouraging in its numbers and bristle dag had set barr and remo and some of the raintree hunters out ahead as scouts the rest tramped away over the hill by the light of a few lanterns doubtless noisier than a company of stealthy lakewalker patrollers but with determination enough sleep was out of the question fawn and berry turned to assembling on the kitchen table what bandages and medicines the fetch offered in readiness for the mens returnat dawn dag had guessed fawn hoped there would be no need to break out any of berrys stock of tripoint shovels for burial duty at least not of folks on their side it was likely much too optimistic a hope but she had to fight the bleak chill of this night somehow with nearly everyone gone off the row of boats tied along the bank of the feeder creek seemed much too quiet hawthorn had disappeared up amongst the nearby trees for a while most likely to cry himself out in privacy when he returned he lay down in his bunk with his back to the room as his hands loosened in deep sleep the kit escaped his grip and went to hide in the stores bo went out to take a walk up and down the row of boats and talk with the few other men some older like himself one with a broken arm left to watch over them hod detailed as bos supporter as well as boat guard tagged along alders head came up from an uncomfortable doze he didnt look crisp and handsome anymore sitting on a stool with his back to his hitching post just strained and exhausted fawn wondered if hed often been sent out on decoy duty because his clean looks and glib tongue reassured folks his eyes shifted in the lantern light a furtive gleam then focused on berry i couldnt escape he said you dont know what crane does to deserters berry stared across at him from her place at the table but said nothing fawn ceased fiddling uselessly with her sewing kit and wondering if she would have to sew up live skin and flesh with it and turned in her chair to watch them both just what does this crane do to deserters she asked at last when berry didnt hes clever horrible clever one or two hes killed outright in arguments but mostly if a fellow or a couple of fellows demand to leave his gang he pretends to let them he lets em load up with their pick of goods their share the lightest and most valuable then trails after em in secret you cant get away from his groundsense ambushes em kills em hides the goods for himself nobody back at camp even knows you cant get out alive it seemed almost inadvertent justice to fawn with a few hitches she glanced up wondering if berry spotted them too if its so secret how do you know cause it seems to me crane wouldnt be doing all this ambushin and buryin by himself alder shot her a glance of dislike how come theres any bandits left fawn went on or is that cranes plan to be the last one left at the end men drift in like the drum brothers sometimes he recruits from captives like skink and like alder fawn wondered if she wanted to ask how in front of berry maybe not she suspected bo already knew from that earlier interrogation that had left the men all so grim and there would likely be other witnesses taken alive to tell the tale tomorrow i tried to save you alder went on looking longingly at berry out there today i tried everything i could think of to get you to go on i always tried to save as many as i could when i was put on catching duty boats with families women or children i waved them on likely they were also the poorer boats fawn suspected bed boats she inquired alder flinched we never got any of those he mumbled berrys gaze flicked up if crane was as clever and evil as alder said more likely he let the women in to ply their trade loaded them up with presents and disposed of them on their exit just like his deserters or else word of the lucrative cavern tavern would have trickled out in at least some channels before this and berry had not overlooked the bed boats in her inquiries but it was undoubtedly true that alder had tried frantically to convince berry to go on his voice grew lower more desperately persuasive but we could get away now you and me when i saw you it was like i woke up from a yearlong nightmare i was so afraid for youi would never have let crane have you i never imagined youd rescue me but see i know where some of cranes caches are if we slipped away now tonight while the others are busy we could both go back to clearcreek rich and never have to go on the river no more i never want to see the river again its been the ruination of me we could wipe all this out like a bad dream and start over is that what you was plannin to bring back to me said berry in a scraped voice staring down at her clenched hands bags of coin soaked in murdered folks blood alder shook his head crane owes you death payment for the rose at least i figure why if it sank in a storm fawn inquired lifting her eyebrows his return glare was nearly lethal alder recovered himself and went on its all that lakewalker sorcerers fault he messes with folks minds puts them in thrall to him destroys good mendelights in it you saw skink he was just an ordinary boatman not a speck different from your papas hands on the rose before crane caught him and turned him thats why i could never get away gods i hate crane that last had the ring of truth berry looked up at him and for a moment fawn thought she saw her hardpressed resolution waver if that wasnt just the water in her reddened eyes if crane beguiled you said fawn then youre still beguiled right now and it isnt safe to let you go because youd just run right back to him you couldnt help it see just like you couldnt help the other alders lips began to move then stopped in confusion did he see the dilemma hed backed himself into berry spoke at last course if you aint beguiled its hard to see how it was you couldnt get away before this seems to me a man who just wanted to escape and didnt care about no treasure couldve swum out in the night and set himself on a bit of wrack and floated away most anytime this past summer come to the first camp or hamlet past the wrist in about a day and gone ashore for help and gave warning what nasty things was hiding up in the elbow and this would all have been over long before now if you wasnt beguiled so which is it alder make up your mind alders mouth opened and shut he finally settled on that lakewalker hes sorcelled me all up i cant hardly think these days then i darent let you loose huh said berry and rose to her feet come on fawn theres aint no sleeping in here lets go set to the roof the airs cleaner up there i expect i expect it is said fawn and followed her out the back hatch into the chill dark the night sky was clear and starry over the river valley a halfmoon was rising above the eastern shore they sat crosslegged on the roof looking around at the black bulk of the bluff the few dim lights leaking from the boat windows down the row the creek water gurgled in the stillness giving itself to the grace fawn heard no shouts or cries of commencing battle but from three miles away on the other side of a hill she didnt expect to alder was a good man all his life up in clearcreek said berry at last fawn said nothing the river really did ruin him fawn offered maybe he just never met such hard temptations before and after a little spare me from ever doing so aye breathed berry no insect songs enlivened the frosty night their breath made faint fogs in the starlight she said at last so is alder beguiled or not did dag say fawn swallowed it wasnt as if there would ever be a better time or place to tell berry the truth he said not a long inhalation i sort of realized it must be that way after a while or dag wouldve released him along with skink cold haze trickled from her lips i cant think which way is worse aint neither is better no agreed fawn i dont see no good way out of this no agreed fawn they huddled together in silence for a long time waiting for light or word but the cold drove them inside before either came dag braced one knee on a fallen log checked the seating of his bow in his wrist cuff and locked the clamp he opened himself for another quick cast around cursing not for the first time his groundsenses inability to penetrate more than a hands breadth into solid rock barr and two of chicorys bowmen had reached their position on the opposite side of the cave mouth remo and another raintree hunter were creeping up on the opening in the cave roof through which a trickle of wood smoke steelgray in the light from the rising halfmoon made its escape it would be remos job to see that nothing else escaped by that route lastly dag checked on whit clutching his own bow at dags side whits face striped by the shadows from the bare tree branches was nearly as pale and stony as the moon entirely drained of all his wearing humor the effect was not as much of an improvement as dag would have thought he choked back anger not only at the cruelty of the bandits but at finding them here now in the middle of the journey hed intended as fawns belated wedding gift shed been terrorized once by the bandits at glassforge and hed sworn that no such horror would touch her again granted she hadnt seemed terrified tonight just tense and resolute he would keep the ugliness well away from her this time if he could he tried not to think about the fact that her monthly fertile days were starting up a lovely sparkle in her ground normally the signal for them to switch to subtler lakewalker bed customs far from bandits of any sort dont dwell on that threat old patroller youll just make yourself crazy crazier but he was determined that none should escape this cave trap to trouble her or berry or anyone else he bit his lip in frustration unable to make a count of targets through the shielding rock walls wonder of wonders the two trampling gangs of boatmen one led around the upstream side by chicory the other around the downstream side by boss wain nearly joined again by the entrance to the cave before the guard there woke from his drunken stupor and yelled alarm too late thought dag in satisfaction his groundsense flexed open and shut wavering between picking up events and blocking the flares of the targets injuries all his fooling around with medicine making seemed to have left him much more sensitive to suchhe cringed taking in the sizzle of a knife cut the explosive flash of a thump with a cudgel still searching for his true target where was this crane blight it they must have caught the lakewalker leader asleep inside just as dag had hoped or else the boatmen would never have crept this close before being spotted because none of the fetchs lakewalkers had bumped grounds with him outside not within a mile cries crashes and screams sounded from the cave mouth borne outward in the orange flickering from torch fire and wildly wavering lantern light a bandit trying to lift himself out the smoke hole was knocked back in by remos partner like a man hammering down a peg remo followed disappearing from both view and groundsense good dag had at least one scout inside to help the rivermen deal with the renegade he ruthlessly stifled worry for remos inexperience as a group of five bellowing bandits clumped together and fought their way out the cave mouth past wains men breaking and running toward dag and whit see em said dag raising his bow and drawing hard yep said whit through dry lips and mimicked him both steeltipped arrows flew together both found targets great shot said dag beginners luck more likely dags second arrow was on its way before whits shaking hands could nock his next it wasnt a disabling hit lodging in the bandits thigh the man was not felled but only slowed this bunch must realize how little mercy they could expect from their boatmen preyturnedhunters the three still on their feet turned back and began running or limping the other way around the cave mouth and up onto barrs position none made it past dag waited a few more minutes but no more fugitives broke free archers task accomplished he eased forward and led whit down the slope more anxious now to reach the cave than to keep whit away from it one of their victims lay dead an arrow through his eye the other whimpered and shuddered in the fallen leaves clutching a shaft that was lodged deep in his gut should we whit began uncertainly leave him for now he wont be running off murmured dag he would worry about men due to be hanged in the morning only after he had tended to the injured on their own side if there was time or any of himself left over for the task but iwhich one did i hit whit stared back over his shoulder yours was that brainshot clean very quick oh whits expression teetered between triumph and revulsion and dag realized it wasnt just barr and remo he ought to meet with when this was all over to check for damage due to leaks from targets and who will check my ground never mind first things first reeling disarmed bandits were already being passed out through a gauntlet of boatmen and tied to trees dag trusted the rivermen knew their knots the inside of the cave was arrested chaos benches and crates lay knocked over bedrolls kicked around goods of all kinds were strewn across the floor including an inordinate number of bottles and jugs broken and whole the cave seemed to be composed of two chambers one behind the other each about twenty feet high and forty across the fire beneath the smoke hole spouted up around a broken keg emitting a glaring light burning oil from a broken lantern spread and sputtered but already a boatman was stamping it out some men lay groaning on the ground others were being tied up there seemed to be at least two boatmen standing for every live bandit leftgood dag winced trying to hold his groundsense open long enough to get an accurate headcount he still couldnt find the lakewalker leader was crane groundveiled and hidden amongst the others noremo was upright and uninjured though better still bearbait sprang up at his elbow and grabbed him by the arm dag controlled a reflexive strike at him lakewalker quick you have to help he jerked dag toward the cave wall a little out of the way of the noisy mob two boatmen lay there on hastily tosseddown blankets a kneeling friend held his hands frantically to the neck of one of them blood spurted between his tight fingers the other was chicory lying stunned breathing irregularly his face the color of cold lard oh no dag let his groundsense lick out the raintree hunter had taken a cudgel blow on the left side of his skull fracturing it just above the ear bad bearbait wet his lips and said hed took on two with his spear see when a third one got him from behind i wasnt quick enough the one with the cut to the neck was now or never dag dropped to his knees unlocked and tossed his bow aside and let his hands real and ghostly slide over those of the frightened friend one of the silver shoals fellows dont move he murmured keep holding tight just like that the man gulped and obeyed the jugular vein was only nicked not sliced in two this might not be impossiblethe uproar of the cave faded from dags senses as he descended down and in felt with his ground projection caught up the cut edges of the big vessel and mated them one to another once more a shaped ground reinforcement not large but dense and tightwould it hold against internal pressure external jostling had the pallid young man already spent too much blood to recover the soil beneath dags knees was soaked in red sticky and caking he drew breath and backed out evading groundlock staring around in disorientation at the dire scene in the cave unholy noises mens shadows leaping in the wavering torchlight dag shook his head and swallowed chilled and shaking you can let up now he told the bloodyhanded friend removing his own hand and wrist cuff from above get blankets around him get him warmed up any way you can but dont bump him or that big vein will bust open again that surface cut needs stitches if you have anyone with a real light hand to do it not right away but in a bit the jagged ugly gash across the victims neck still gaped but blood only oozed now instead of flowing like some terrible spring dont try to move him yet later the shoals lad would need as much drink as they could get into him but he darent be made to swallow while still out cold choking could kill him dag tried to remember what hed been doing medicine making and captaining didnt mix well it seemed each took all of a mans attention chicory yes oh gods he didnt want to lose chicory and not just for his affable humor he was exactly the sort of natural leader who could go home and make a difference in his village and amongst a widespread array of friends if he could be convinced to see things dags way if he lives dag lurched half up and over to chicorys side and knelt again watched closely by the fearful bearbait he cradled the hunters head in his spread fingers the skull was cracked in spiderweblike rings around the blow pushed inward but no sharp shards had pierced the brain beneath but atop that strange thin skin that overlay brains in the smooth goblets of their skulls a pocket of blood was collecting actually pushing the skull dent out again but also pressing into the delicate tissue beneath like a grinding fist im pretty sure thats not good a real medicine maker or a farmer bonesetter might drill into the skull to let the bad blood out at any rate he was sure hed seen such drills amongst hoharies tools dags medicine kit included a fine knife tweezers needles and threads of gut and cotton fluid to clean wounds bandages herbs and powders no drills do i really need one dag recentered himself and groundripped a peasized hole in skin and bone a spurt of blood trickled out making a slippery mess of chicorys black hair seeping through dags fingers as the pressure in the bulging pocket lessened he found the bleeding inside starting up again not good groundlock youre risking groundlock he drew back out still holding chicorys head in his spread hand and looked around woozily a few paces away a man with a knife wound to his gut choked out his last breath and died bandit dag hoped although he was blighted if he could tell the difference between bandits and boatmen from this confused vantage lakewalker said bearbait dag shook his head skulls busted but you knew that its too soon to say if he has a chance he surreptitiously dropped another general ground reinforcement into the brain flesh around the blow and blinked at his own dizziness a big figure trod past dag called wain the boat boss wheeled around there you are he thrust out a suspicious chin what are you doing best as i can said dag wearily i cant leave off here just yet you find that crane by now if hes not here find out where hes gone and if there are any more bandits missing with him get exact numbers get names dont let them hold out on you wain had wanted undisputed leadership of the boatmenbut to his credit not at such a cost to his rival chicory the boat boss chewed his lip briefly but decided not to argue he cast dag a curt nod and moved off bellowing for his lieutenant saddler if dag wanted questions answered wain was the man for the job he was pretty sure most of the captives would be surly and hopeless tightlipped but amongst a group this large there were bound to be a few babblers beguiled or not skink and alder blight them had both claimed crane was at the cave and dag would have sworn neither had been lying by that time but they had been camped on their lookout for more than a day dag had seen goodoncebuttoooldnow information devastate plans before this blight the little hole in chicorys skull was clotting off with his ground projection dag teased the clot out letting the blood keep trickling was this right when would it stop he wanted to go back in to find the source of the flow and pinch it off but didnt dare yet one more of these deep groundexplorations and he wasnt sure hed be able to get up and walk after let alone fight this fight did not seem finished whit had been drawn off to help the raintree men secure prisoners he returned to dags side and draped a blanket around his shoulders dag smiled up gratefully whit stared wideeyed at the grayfaced chicory is he going to die cant say yet can you find me remo or barr where the blight have those two gone off to back of the cave i think ill go check thanks whit nodded and picked his way through the rubble dag thought his young tentbrother was holding up well thrust into scenes of such lethal brutality for the first time in his life he wouldnt have sent whit to assist wain though dag grimaced at the ugly thumps and yells from the interrogation going on over at the far side of the cave cutting through the moans and groans whit brought barr and remo back in a few minutes the pair looked black indeed and not only from their first experience with putting down farmer bandits remo held up a sharing knife look what we found back there yeah theres a cache piled to the ceiling whit put in sounding amazed all the most valuable stuff i guess dag squinted the knife was unprimed could it be cranes i found it in amongst what has to be a whole narrowboatload of furs remo said looks like cranes crew didnt always avoid lakewalkers dag carefully set chicorys head between his knees and raised his bloodsoaked hand to take the knife remo recoiled to see dags sleeve wet with darkening red but he reluctantly released the knife to the gory grip dag held it to his lips unprimed yes and with a peculiar stillness in its embedded involution whoever this knife was bonded to is dead now so probably not cranes though dag supposed he could hope barr startled said you can tell that my brother is a knife maker dag said vaguely the two patrollers brows rose in respect keep this aside he handed it back remo slipped the bone blade back into its sheath and hung the thong around his neck as he hid it all inside his shirt his voice hushed in outrage they mustve murdered a lakewalker without even letting him share or her dag didnt want to think on that there would have been women amongst the boat victims from time to time but there werent any around now cant let any run off to tell skink had claimed should dag hope that theyd died quickly and were his hopes worth spit chicorys drainage was clotting off again blight it the pressure in the blood pocket growing once more did you find any sign at all of crane or of those mad drum brothers who seemed to have become his principal lieutenants dag definitely wanted to locate themdead alive or prisoners barr shook his head not within half a mile of here anyway we have to find him take him and not only for his monstrous crimes if the lakewalker leader was not tried with the rest perfunctory as dag suspected the trial was going to be the boatmen would always suspect the patrollers had colluded in his escape blight it whats taking wain so long as if in answer saddler crunched across the cave to stare down at dag shake his head in worry at chicory and report that all the bandits were accounted for but five two it seemed had left the night before last cashing out their stakes and quitting the gang permanently unable to stomach the drum brothers grotesque cruelties any longer crane and his two lieutenants had left separately early the next morning some hours before alder had flagged down the fetch it had been a chance to the boatmens benefit it seemed because the bandit crew bereft of their leaders supervision had broached some kegs crane had been saving and had been a lot drunker than usual this night so up to five bandits still loose out there including the worst of the bunch have we left enough men to guard the boats dag suddenly didnt think so but he dared not move his two charges yet and besides there would be no point jostling them up over the hill in litters when the boats had to come downriver anyway the convoy could float around the elbow in the morning and tie up below the cave carrying them smoothly but i cant wait that long dag wet his lips anyone on our side killed saddler looked dubiously at dags two patients not yet seems nine of the bandits are goners twentyone here left to hang though theres one that might not live for it dag stared in frustration at chicorys drained face he must bring the raintree man to a point where he could be left for a while because dag had to start moving after crane but in what direction haring off the wrong way would be worse than useless he did know he wanted copperhead under him to speed the search barr and remo might be mounted on a couple of the bandits horsestheyd found a dozen or so hobbled not far from the cave saddler go back and see if you can find out anything at all about which way those five fellows might have gone barr take a turn around the perimeter againthey might be coming back and we want to spot them before they spot us remostay with me i need you whit unassigned tagged off after saddler remo knelt beside dag what do you want me to do he asked quietly break me out if i appear to groundlock myself i need to do some deeper groundwork inside chicorys poor bashed head here remo nodded gravely trustingly absent gods did dag look like he knew what he was doing surely remo should know better by now dag sighed and dropped down into that increasingly easy ever more familiar level of groundawareness the inner world expanded to fill his horizon as vast and complex a landscape as the luthlian woods no wonder that once a fellow had done this any other sort of making seemed trivial and dull a calling indeed but his elation was shortlived these injuries were subtler by far than hods knee the groundscape deeper and much stranger far beyond dags understanding i dont have to understand everything the body is wiser than ill ever be and will heal itself if it can let him just start with the obvious mend the biggest broken vessels hed done that before maybe that would be enough it had better be enough he continued the inner exploration this end went with that one ah a little shaped reinforcement would hold them together for a time another another another ah that torn artery was the main source of the trouble yes dag brought it back into alignment reinforced it doubly and then blood was leaking into the pocket more slowly than it was leaking out and then it was hardly refilling at all this time when the bulge deflated it stayed shrunken another push to position the shellcracked bone the squashed brain tissue expanded back into its proper place still throbbing another ground reinforcement quelled its distress in his exacerbated sensitivity remos little groundbump felt like a blow to the side of dags head he gasped and fell disoriented upward into the light are you all right asked remo dag gulped and nodded blinking and squinting thanks that was timely seemed to me youd been in that trance for an awful long stretch had he it had seemed like mere minutes to dag whit appeared at his side he handed dag a cup of something and dag unsuspecting drank and nearly choked it was nasty sickly sweet but it burned down his throat in a heartening way some sort of horrible fruit brandy he decided from the bandits stores his stomach after a doubtful moment elected not to heave dag had done all he could think of for the skull fracture for now they were into the wait and see what happens part he set chicorys head down gently cradling it in a folded blanket and clambered to his feet his stiffened joints moved like chalk scraping over a slate bearbait reappearedwhen had he gone off and earnestly took in dags brief instructions about keeping his leader warm and lying still till dag got back for once dag had no objection when remo grabbed his arm to steady him on his feet weirdly the tiny groundrip hed taken from chicory seemed to be giving him a spurt of strength even as whits vile liquor quickened the blood in his veins he suspected hed have cause to regret both later but now whit give me another drink of that skunk syrup barr wheres barr here sir find anything outside dag lifted the cup again and sipped with an effort the fumes did clear his sinuses barr shook his head not yet any other word which way our missing bandits all went the first two had evidently talked about heading back toward the beargrass reported whit nobody knows about crane and the drums they need not have all gone the same way only the latter trio really concerned dag so that northerly hint was not too useful it occurred to dag suddenly that alder had been cranes lieutenant before the drums and might possess clues that were beyond the rest of the bandits which gave dag an excellent excuse to ease his heart and go back to the boats first even better than his need for his horse alder hadnt been very forthcoming before but he could be made to be dag decided grimly one way or another supported by remo barr and whit dag stumbled out of the reeking cave into chilly predawn dew the sky had a steely cast the stars fading the halfmoon turning sallow overhead he could find his way through the foggy woods with his eyes alone now he sent barr and remo off to pick out mounts for themselves from the bandits string then made his way back up the hill behind the cave his stride lengthened despite his exhaustion so that whit was pressed to keep up fawn had lain down fully dressed in her lonely bed nook despairing of sleep but she must have dozed off because she woke drymouthed and grainyeyed grayness in the shadows hinted of dawn a tall shape eased past slipping through the storesdag back her relief was so great that she relaxed again almost letting her exhaustion draw her once more into precious sleep but no she had to hear his tale she lay a moment more listening to faint clinks from the kitchen muttering the scrape of the rings of berrys bunk curtain being pushed back the red flare of someone turning up the oil lantern burning low on the table berrys voice sudden and shocked what fawns eyes flew fully open and she started up in bed thumps bangs crashes a wrenching groanbo a yelp from hawthorn alders cry dont hurt her a strange voice curt and cruel no how about this one fawn swung upright uncertain which way to run she darted toward the kitchen a pace or two craning her neck and skidded to a halt alder was loose swinging around and onto his feet with his chains still dangling from his wrists she saw the back of a tall mana lakewalker patroller by his clothes and the dark braid down his backbut it wasnt remo bo had fallen to his knees clutching his stomach with reddened hands and hod crouched with him whitefaced and frozen with fear the tall man she saw held the squirming hawthorn tight to his chest a knife blade gleamed in his other hand dont move berry hell do it to hawthorn same as to bo cried alder desperately he never bluffs fawn turned and sprinted she banged through the front hatch sped past the animal pens and thumped across the gangplank drawing breath for a scream to wake the whole row of boats a huge shape in the clinging mist lunged at her smacking her so hard in her gut that she was thrown backward and her scream sputtered out halfvoiced she wrenched and bucked violently as the manmountain pulled her off her feet and whipped her through the air one sweaty hand grabbed her face spanning it nearly from ear to ear the other clamped her shoulder the grip tightened like a vise and she realized he was about to snap her neck abruptly she went limp a gruff voice growled huh thats better her captor felt down her body as he repositioned her ah a girlie maybe ill save you for little drum he strode forward holding her half by her head half under his arm like a wet cat carried by its scruff over the gangplank and past copperhead who laid his ears back and snaked his neck but alas didnt whinny or squeal dag dag dag help me if he was within a mile he must sense the terror in her ground and if he isnt he wont she struggled for air against the pressing stinking hand thought of biting thought better of it the light of the lantern seeped around her blocked vision then she was twisted upright and set on her feet both hands held easily behind her back by just one of the big mans paws she managed one sharp inhalation before the other paw clamped over her mouth once more the back of her head was jammed against a warm chestbarely winded to judge by its steady rise and fall she peered down over her nose at a loglike arm in a frayed sleeve stained brown and redbrown reeking of sweat and blood berry hod and bo had all been forced to kneel around the post that had lately held alder who was securing their wrists one to another with a length of line he had to jerk bos hand away from his stomach blood soaked the front of the old mans shirt his face had gone gray looking worse than any hangover fawn had ever seen on him and he squinted as if in bewilderment panting for air berrys terrified glance jerked back and forth between him and hawthorn still held tight by the stranger the man turned halfaround he had black brows and a craggy face shadowed with beard stubble and his eyes gleamed darkly fawn wondered if they would be a different color in daylight like dags so whats this he inquired nodding at fawn two girlies said the manmountain one for me and one for little drum i figure he grinned gaptoothed and sourbreathed the lakewalker said wearily havent you two had enough fun for one night not the yellowhaired one said alder urgently he hesitated they can split the other if they want sure he added after a moment she claims to be married to one of the lakewalkers we surprised on this boat but shes really just a farmer the black stare narrowed on fawn what the man was thinking she could not guess seems to me they surprised you alder he drawled after a moment what happened here it was skinks fault said alder still knotting line we went up to check out this boat like usual but the lakewalkers were all inside and we didnt spot em except for the odd one that didnt look like a lakewalker see they got the drop on us the odd one he did something some groundwork and skink began spewing like a waterspout told them everything about the cave everything alder wasnt telling everything fawn realized hed left out how he had been recognized by all the folks from clearcreek did he imagine he could lie tothis had to be the renegade crane yes and the manmountain was big drum so where is little drum those patrollers they stopped every boat coming down the river and got up a gang to go jump the cave hours ago they could be coming back at any time only if they succeeded murmured crane raising his brows he didnt sound terribly disturbed by the news they had sixty or seventy fellows and that onehanded lakewalkerhe had to be at least a patroller captain acted like this was all in a days work he did its all up with us now alder sounded almost relieved weve got to cut and run his voice went wheedling you told me yourself you didnt expect the cavern tavern to last out the year those tripoint fools was the warning you said best we heed it crane sighed well at least it seems i get a new horse out of the deal he paused his head turning toward the bow his curiously chiseled lips pinched his eyes narrowed consulting his groundsense aw whats little drum stirred up now he wheeled and quite without expression struck hawthorn in the face with his knife haft hard enough to knock him across the room hawthorn fell in a stunned heap breath stuttering berry cried out hod whimpered fawn strained uselessly against the heavy grip that held her crane drew a long breath were about to have company too late to get off this boat alder go cast off the rear lines big drum drop the bow lines and then get yourself up on the roof and get an oar ready you too alder well push out and take it down to the crook of the elbow insteadshould give us enough of a start give me that spare girl reluctantly big drum handed fawn over to his leader crane grasped one arm with bruising pressure and turned her in front of him the knife blade rose to her neck and pressed there most convincingly what about little drum big drum demanded thatll depend entirely on how quick he can run well see if she can buy him time to get here but were not waiting long following big drum crane shoved fawn ahead of him out onto the front deck dags legs jarred like hammer blows as he bounded downhill so fast it felt like falling fawns fear howled through his groundsense he tried to make out what was happening on the fetch through a cacophony of distress bo hurt bad hawthorn and berry in terror hod distraughtalder loose and moving and two new grounds both grossly knotted and distorted the darker one halfveiled on the way back from wherever theyd gone crane and his lieutenants must have checked their lookout point and seen the inexplicably deserted boats tied up along the creek below cranes lakewalker groundsense would have found alder on the fetchnot happy but for all crane knew still hoodwinking the boatmen if alder was still duping his victims crane might want to support him if a prisoner maybe free himbut in either case the first thing crane had to do was slip aboard and reach him between groundsense and the dank mist eluding notice by the sleepy watchmen and then things went bad for both sides by the time hed barged through the last of the trees and the fetch came into sight dag was so winded he had to stop and put his hands on his knees as black patterns swarmed in his vision he raised his head as his eyes cleared the big fellow with the knotty ground tossed the second of the two bow ropes over the side and retreated to the roof unshipping a broadoar the man with the halfveiled ground shouldered through the front hatch coming out onto the deck he held fawn a knife blade gleamed against her neck he wiggled it to make it wink and nibble into that soft flesh and he looked up to lock dags gaze frozen not twenty feet away beyond the end of the gangplank whit came dashing up his bow waving in one hand and an arrow in the other with shaking hands he tried to nock it your little friend can just drop that bow said the man dryly shoving fawn in front of him for a shield and tightening the bite of the knife dag thought he saw a line of red spring along its edge drop it whit said dag not taking his eyes off the stranger crane without doubt whits lips moved in protest but he let his bow fall to his feet fawns eyes shifted and her feet dag prayed she would not try to break away this one would slice her head off without a blink a trio of boatmen attracted at last by the ruckus thumped down the creek bank toward the fetch dags fear of no help coming gave way to terror that this helps clumsy advance would crowd crane into dreadful action behind this tense tableau alder climbed to the roof and unshipped the second oar push off the leader called over his shoulder what about little drum asked the big man the strange lakewalker glanced up the hill not coming alders oar swept backward although the other oarsman still hesitated the gangplank creaked as the boat began to pull away under it dag lurched forward ah crane chided lifting his knife under fawns chin so she rose on her toes you really need to believe me he flicked open his ground to display his cold determination to dag it wasnt even a decision dag raised his left arm stretched out his ghost hand twenty feet and groundripped a cross section as thick as a piece of boot leather from cranes spinal cord just below his neck the mans dark eyes opened wide astounded as the knife dropped from his nerveless fingers he crumpled like a blanket folding and his head unsupported hit the deck with a weird double thump he did not cry out it was more of a questioning grunt fawn after a gasping hesitation leaned over snatched up the knife and pelted inside the big oarsman trod forward to the edge of the roof to see what was happening he met whits arrow released from his grabbedup bow square on one hand lifted to grasp the shaft halfburied in his broad gut but as the boat shifted he stumbled and fell over the side with a cry and a smacking splash dag leaped for the gangplank but not before he glimpsed berry jump up from the stern to grab the short end of the steering oar jump down again to swing on it like a tree branch and bring the long end around in a mighty arc smashing into alders hip and sweeping him over the opposite side of the roof and into the cold creek water what dag most wanted to do was question crane fawn knew this because putting her back on her feet after grabbing her up in a breathstopping hug and mumbling a lot of broken words into her hair it was the first thing he said that she could actually make out but after one glance at bo he reordered his plan dispatching the panting whit to organize the boatmen whod been drawn by the ruckus to fish alder and big drum out of the water and secure them preferably on some boat other than the fetch what about crane whit demanded just leave him lay hes not going anywhere dag had the queerest look on his face as he said this but before fawn could figure it out she was drafted as his hands helping to straighten out the groaning bo atop a blanket on a hastily cleared stretch of kitchen floor peel away his shirt and wash around the stab wound dag sat crosslegged irritably cast off his arm harness and fell into the healing trance that was becoming increasingly familiar to fawnand she thought to him he was in it for a long time while the shaken berry cut ropes still dangling from her wrists tended to an even more shaken hawthorn who was bleeding from a broken nose and crying hod helped everyone as best he could whit took a long time to report back the arrowriddled big drum had been easy to capture as hed waded to shore and put up no fight when he got there alder had tried to swim away some boatmen chased him down in a skiff and wrestled him out of the water beating him into submission hed almost drowned and fawn glancing at berrys stiff face thought it was a pity he hadnt dragging out his existence one more miserable day seemed a great waste of time emotion and hemp both men had been tied up on the snapping turtle the shaft in big drums belly cut off but left in lest botching its removal keep him from his hanging fawn was wondering if she should shake dags shoulder or send someone to find barr or remo to do whatever it was lakewalkers did to break unintended groundlocks when he at last drew a long breath and sat up animation returning to his face he stared around blinking found her and cast her the ghost of a smile emerging from his task he looked much less wild and distraught as though the effort had recentered him somehow except that fawn hadnt seen him look so drained since raintree bo had been conscious throughout but silent watching dag with a brow furrowed as much in wonder as in pain well lakewalker he breathed at last then muffled a cough that healin o his is a thing aint it commiserated the hunkering hod dont try to talk whispered dag his dry voice cracked and he cleared it fawn hustled to retuck the blanket shed put around his shoulders and to fetch him a drink he raised the tin cup to his lips with a trembling hand swallowed and went on more easily ive groundglued together the two slices through your stomach walls where the blade punched in and out and likewise some of the bigger blood vessels in there cranes knife missed the biggest ones or youd have bled to death before i got here fawnll have to stitch up your skin fawn nodded carefully washing away the gory matter that dag had drawn from the wound by ground projection she had dags medicinekit needle already threaded and bent to the task bo made little ow noises but endured dag went on cautiously biggest danger nows infection i expect therell be some got to wait and see how that plays out truly a gutwound like this was more usually a death sentence fever finishing what bleeding started as bo likely knew because he nodded shortly when fawn tied off her last thread whit hod and berry combined to lift bo carefully into his bunk dag simply lay back on the floor and stared up at the roof fawn was just wondering if they should also unite to lift dag to his bed when barr and remo clumped in to apologize for killing what they sincerely hoped had been an escaping bandit up in the woods fawn nipped to the front hatch to peek out and saw a couple of saddled horses beyond the gangplank over one was draped the body of a skinny redhaired fellow his sharp contorted face pale in death crane was still lying in a heap beside the animal pen his chin moved and his eyes shifted to glare at her and she flinched and fled back inside dag what did you do to him that was like no making i ever seen or heard tell of in the kitchen barr was frowning down at dag and asking the very question shed longed to dag what the blight did you do to that fellow out on the front deck is that crane remo added glancing toward the bow yes said dag still staring at the roof i broke his neck in effect he wont be getting better in case anyone was worried about tying him up his expression glazed dag watched fawn upside down as she bent and peered at him in worry she remembered the shock in cranes eyes when hed dropped the knife and collapsed like a wall falling in effect but not in any other way would the patroller boys think to follow up that little flag of truth amongst dags laconic misdirection either dag would explain in his own time or shed wait for a private moment to ask she decided hod and whit took tumbling turns giving a description of the events around and aboard the fetch to the two patrollers with an occasional corroborating moan or snort from bo berry added little still holding the sniffling hawthorn but as their words turned his frightening experience into a tale he seemed to revive uncurling from his childlike clutch in his big sisters lap slowly regaining the dignity of his eleven years and finally adding a few flourishing if gruesome details of his own by the time theyd finished he mainly wanted to go off and inspect the corpse of little drum dubiously berry released him i about swallowed my heart when i saw that big knife at fawns throat said whit but i swear she looked more mad than scared i was plenty scared enough said fawn and yetcrane hadnt been nearly as scary as the glassforge malice even if she might have been equally dead at eithers hands how odd flying from a knife at her throat to an immediate need to pull things together for bos sake maybe she just hadnt had time to fall apart yet some boatmen called from outside a troop sent back from the cave to help guard the boatsa bit belatedly fawn thought tartly the two young patrollers and whit went off to help sort out things it was full dawn dag sat up i have toi cantlet me sleep for one hour bo can have a few sips of water nothing else he climbed to his hand and knees then to his feet making no protest when fawn lent him a shoulder to help him lurch to their bed nook she did insist on pulling off his boots he was asleep by the time she flung a blanket over him barr remo and whit had been grimly excited describing their victory at the bandit cave after theyd defeated the glassforge malice fawn recalled dag had been wildly elated despite his weariness there was not a trace of triumph in him now and she wondered at the difference in the kitchen space that still reeked of the nights terror the floor splotched with blood fawn sighed and quietly started fixing breakfast fawn let dag sleep for closer to three hours he woke on his own when the fetch pulled away from shore stumbling out to the kitchen he ran a hand through his bent hair and asked whats been happening not much she said passing him a mug of tea everybody decided to move their boats around to the cave landing berry whit and hod are topside she gestured upward with her thumb i sent hod and remo out to clean crane up a while back dags brows bent whether in bewilderment or disapproval she was not sure she explained it was more for us than him getting paralyzed like that loosed his bowels and bladder seemingly he was stinkin up berrys boat besideseven corpses get washed before burying he nodded glumly she ran him out onto the back deck to wash up took his bloodied clothes to soak in a bucket and handed him fresh ones the day was turning pale blue as the weak sun climbed not so much warming up as thinning the chill since his hand was still shaking she also helped him shave a skill shed acquired that time his arm had been broken just before their marriage hot food and a cleanup were worth at least a couple hours of the sleep he hadnt got she figured their rattling around woke barr from his own nap remo had been lying in his bunk but not sleeping and he too rose to join them i have to question crane dag repeated he nodded to the patrollers you two had best sit in a quorum of sorts i want to hear that tale too said fawn he shook his head its like to be nasty spark i would spare you if i could but you cant she pointed out which made him wince feeling pressed by his dismay she struggled to explain dagill never be a fighter im too little my legs are too short to outrun most fellows the only equal weapon ill ever have is my wits but without knowing things my wits are like a bow with no arrows dont leave me disarmed after a bleak moment he ducked his chin in assent when hed finished swallowing down his breakfast and his tea they all followed him out onto the front deck the snapping turtle was out ahead approaching the crook of the elbow and the keelboat from silver shoals trailed them at some distance the fetch seemed very far from any shore running down this stretch of swollen river crane was laid outlike a funeral fawn couldnt help thinkingin remos spare shirt covered by a blanket and with another folded under his head his arms lay flaccid along his sides nerveless feet to the bow dag settled down crosslegged next to him tidying up the two men first had lent this encounter a curious formality as though they were couriers from distant hinterlands meeting to exchange news even crane seemed to feel it or at least he was no longer trying to bite folks as he had when hed first been washed fawn wondered if his several hours of being stepped past and ignored like a pile of old laundry had felt as weird for him as it had for everyone else and then she wondered if dag had arranged it that way on purpose the way hed left barr without food to help tame him fawn dragged the bench forward a little behind crane and settled on it out of his direct view but however mangled his ground and groundsense he had to know she was back there barr leaned against the pen fence across from dag overlooking the captive remo sat at cranes feet so whats your real name dag began your camp howd you come to be alone did you lose your partner barr asked did you desert asked remo dag continued or were you banished crane pressed his lips together and glowered at his interrogators one of the prisoners told me he was an oleana patroller remo put in uncertainly silence if thats the case said dag and hes a banished man then hes likely something crane log hollow cranes head jerked and dags lips twisted in grim satisfaction dag went on because thats the only oleana camp ive heard tell of thats banished a patroller in the past halfdozen years and there can hardly be two the same crane looked away as much as he could crane will do he said his first words so it will said dag so i have the start of you and i have the end whats in between what difference does it make to your fate not much now but if you mean to tell your own tale and not just leave others to tell it for youor on youyouve got maybe two more hours while we go round the elbow after that youll be out of my hand cranes black brows drew down as though this argument unexpectedly weighed with him but he said only youll look pretty funny dragging a man who cant move off to be hanged i wont be laughing lakewalkers fawn was reminded seldom bothered trying to lie to each other could crane even close his ground in his disrupted state dag had to be partly open at least and not enjoying it barr and remo kept tensing like people flinching from a scratched scab they couldnt leave well enough alone so fawn guessed they were partly open too crane turned his head from side to side frowning what the blight did you do to me anyway i cant even feel most of my body with sense or groundsense i once saw a fellow fall from a horse dag answered not quite directly who broke his neck in about the same place as i broke yours he lived for some months we wont inflict that on you but you never touched me you were twenty feet off over on the bank it was some sort of evil groundwork you did it was said dag impassively not quibbling with the modifier remo and barr looked disturbed cranes startled gaze said what are you plain as plain but he didnt voice it cranes utter helplessness had been made clear during his cleanup he must realize by now he was a dead man talking fawn knew how to feign indifference to torments one could not escape but shed never before seen real indifference used so crane seemed pained to have his mind roused from its sullen retreat more silence so dag probed again you were a muleheaded rulebreaker and didnt care to reform so log hollow threw you out maybe a thief that was a lie said crane but added after a moment then was it said dag mildly there was a farmer woman i heard maybe youngsters what happened to them when your camp stripped you and booted you out did you find your way back to her for a while said crane she didnt much care for what i brought her from hunting compared to what id used to bring from patrol then the blighted strumpet died i gave it all up for nothing howd she die fever i was away came back to a blighted mess dag glanced at fawn his face set tight and she touched the thin drying scab on her neck left from cranes knife dag had been skinclose to losing her last night shed sometimes worried what might happen to her if dag were killed never she suddenly realized what would happen to dag if she died his first widowing had nearly destroyed him even with all the support of his kinfolk and familiar world around him what would it be like with nothing around him and the youngsters dag said his voice was very level devoid of judgment it would have to be fawn thought to keep crane talking at all she bit her knuckle picturing the lost children foisted them on her sister she didnt want halfbloods we had an argumentthen i left after that i dont know fawn suspected that had been an ugly argument the death of either parent would be a disaster for young children but the loss of a mother could be lethal for infants even with near kin or dear friends to take up the burden crane had clearly owned no knack for keeping either dag did not pursue this but led on then what i knocked around oleana for a while when i got tired of living in the woods id take what jobs some farmer would give me or try the dice took to thieving when those didnt play out it was so easy with groundsense i could walk like a ghost right through their shops or houses i specially liked doing places where theyd given me the evil eye and run me off when id asked honest first remo said in an outraged voice oh thatd make it good for the next patrol to go through to have lakewalkers suspected of stealing dag waved him to silence cranes lips turned in a mockery of a smile how old was crane older than barr or remo to be sure but younger than dag fawn guessed about halfway between remo was looking at barr the rulebender in a way that made him shift uncomfortably barr glared back at his partner as if to say i would not have but fawn thought both could see yes how easy crane continued one night some farmer woke up before i was done gathering and cornered me i had to shut him up but i hit him too hard thats when i decided to leave oleana took myself down to the river spent his money on passage on a farmer flatboat i started to thinkmaybe if i got someplace far enough away i could become somebody else shed my skin my name start over somehow i was going to decide when i reached the confluence whether to go south to graymouth or maybe north to luthlia though id no love of snow by then its said they dont ask too many questions up there if a patroller can take the cold but then the fool boat boss put in at the cavern tavern and i met brewer and his game what was his game dags voice was curiously soft now remo squinted at him in doubt cranes words were flowing as if hed halfforgotten his listeners wound up in his tale and his memories dag did nothing visible to disrupt the flow fawn couldnt tell if he was doing something invisible to channel it it was how it amused brewer to restock on bandits when hed run low crane said when hed taken captives alive two or more at a timeit worked best with at least fourhed set them to fight each other in pairs if they refused to fight theyd be slain outright the second pair almost never refused if he had more captives he might make the winners fight each other too but anyway the prizebesides being allowed to livewas to join his gang he said he could turn most men that wayafter theyd killed their friends for him hed own their minds alder fawn thought was that what had happened to alder in that case what exactly had happened to buckthorn and berrys papa and the rest of their crew she shuddered realizing dag wasnt keeping his voice low just for the menace of it it was so his words would not carry to the top deck his arithmetic was off by my reckoning crane continued but i was his prize when i showed up to turn a lakewalker to thievery and murder he thought he was the gamemaster he did i didnt tell him i was ahead of him down that road a strange brag if crane couldnt be the best hed compete for being the baddest evidently so i won my rounds of course it was too easy i stayed on a few weeks learned the trade persuaded and beguiled a few fellows just to see what would happen then i took brewers game to its logical conclusion from behind i was never quite sure if he was surprised or not once youd won you could have left surely however you were guarded before dag said suggestively if you could walk past farmers like a ghost why not bandits go where farmers still wouldnt have me and lakewalkerswouldve been able to smell the blood in my ground by then so maybe brewer won after all eh suicide said dag mildly crane stared at him in astonishment i didnt have a bonded knife nor any way of getting one once i was banished the blighted camp council stripped mine from me along with everything else crane turned his head away the flow of his talk dried up for several minutes fawns face screwed up in the slow realization that craneeven crane was taken aback at dags suggestion not because he feared selfmurder but because he scorned to so waste a death with no sharing knife to catch it his response seemed quite unthinking and altogether sincere and remo and barr looked as though they found nothing odd in this at all she pounded her fist gently against her forehead lakewalkers theyre all lakewalkers all mad dag finally spoke again youve kept this gang going for a long time though as such things go i can see where you gave the bandits a sort of twisted leadership which held them to you but what held you to them crane jerked his chinin lieu of the shrug he could no longer make fawn supposed the coin the goods id not much use for but brewers game fascinated me besides being mad after money i think brewer liked running the cave because it gave him something lower than himself to despise meit was like owning my own private fightingdog kennel except with much more interesting animals i hardly had to do a thing you know they just arranged themselves around me drop any lakewalker down amongst farmers thats what happens if he doesnt rise to the top theyll blighted shove him up they want to be ruled by their betters theyre like sheep that cant tell the difference between shepherds and wolves i swear so did you make them or did they make you dag asked quietly cranes smile stretched you are what you eat any malice learns that this time it was dags turn to twitch and crane didnt miss it dag took a long breath and said remo give me that knife you found remo rather reluctantly pulled the sheath cord over his head dag weighed the knife in his hand and regarded crane sternly whered you come by this and that boatload of lakewalker furs crane twisted his head it wasnt my doing just an evil chance pair of lakewalker traders down from raintree chose to pull in their narrow boat and camp practically in front of the cave there was no holding the fellows though i told them they were being blighted fools i lost six of those idiots in the fight that followed did you try the game on the lakewalkers they didnt live long enough dag touched the knife sheath to his lips in that odd habitual gesture youre telling me half the truth i think this knife was bonded to a woman cranes jaw compressed in exasperation all right it was a stringbound couple they both died the same you murdered her and didnt even let her share said remo she was dead before i got to her fought too hard there was an unlucky blowat least it saved me a tedious argument with the drum boys i figured itd be a bad idea to let them learn they could play with lakewalkers a rather sick silence followed this pronouncement crane did not break it past hope past rage past revenge upon the world just waiting not waiting for anything justwaiting he spoke as if from the lip of a grave he no longer feared but wanted as a tired man wanted his bed dags hand folded tightly around the sheath he asked if you had a bonded knife would you choose to share or to hang cranes look seemed to question his wits if i had a bonded knife because i think i could rededicate this one said dag to you barrs mouth dropped open but youre a patroller or a medicine maker remo put in more doubtfully i said i think it would be my first knife making if it worked he added dryly and if it didnt work leastways no one would complain crane blinked squinted said cautiously do you fancy the justice of it to put an end to me with that womans own knife no just the economy i need a primed knife i hate walking bare dag said remo uneasily that knife belongs to somebody shouldnt we try to find the rightful heir or at least turn it in at the next camp dags jaw set i was thinking of applying riversalvage rules same as with the rest of the caves treasure barr said should he be allowed to share his own camp council didnt think so even back when he carried far fewer crimes in his saddlebags hes crane nocamp now id say which makes me his camp captain by right of might if nothing else i guarantee his priming would have no lack of affinity leastways his glance met fawns startled one his lids fell rose yes she thought dag would know all about affinity barr and remo were both looking at him with some misgiving after these peculiar statements fawn didnt blame them an even stranger look lingered in cranes face as if it shocked him to find there was something still in the world for him to wantand it was in his enemys hand to give or withhold wonder grew in fawn winding with her horror shed expected crane to say blight you all and let the malices take the world not yes i beg for some last share in this as if testing his fortune in disbelief crane growled blackly we made better sport in the cave would it give you a thrill big man to kill me with your own hand dags gaze flicked down i already did all were doing now is debating the funeral arrangements he leaned on his hand and pushed himself up with a tired grunt he was finished with his questions evidently although barr and remo looked as though they wanted to ask a dozen more not necessarily of crane captain nocamp crane called as dag started to turn away dag looked back down bury my bones dag hesitated gave a short nod as you will fawn followed him to the kitchen where he drew the bone knife from its sheath and hung the cord around his neck he made no move to hand either back to remo scoop up a kettle of river water and put it on the fire for me spark i want to boil this knife clean of its old groundwork before we reach the cave landing after the fetch moored above the mouth of the bandit cave crane was removed on a makeshift litter of blankets stretched between two keelboat poles borrowed from the nearby snapping turtle heads turned and murmurs rose both from boatmen and roped bandits as he was carried past he shut his eyes possibly pretending to be unconscious an escape of sorts the only one fawn trusted that he would have dag followed but was seized on almost at once by bearbait and one of the raintree hunters who dragged him off to the cave to look at the hurt men again or maybe at more hurt men wains lieutenant saddler tramped down the stony slope and hailed berry we found a slew of boats tied up behind that island over there he told her with a wave at the opposite shore the same level leafless woods that lined most of the river along here save for the weathered ridge that backed the cave and shaped the elbow only therelativenarrowness of the channel gave a clue to a riverwise eye that it was an island wain wanted to know if you could pick out your papas or name any of the others for that matter if the briar rose is back there i suppose i ought to look berry agreed halfheartedly she glanced at fawn you come with me fawn nodded it had to feel to berry like being taken to look at a body dragged from the river to see if it was a missing kinsman youd want a friend to go with you ill come tooif you want whit offered cautiously a silent nod berrys mouth was strained her eyes gray and flat it was hard to read gratitude in her face though fawn thought some might be hidden there it was hard to read anything in her face really saddler and another strongarmed keeler rowed them across in a skiff paths threaded between the trees and across the island wet and squelchy underfoot as though the river had recently overtopped the banks and left a promise to return fawns shoes were soaked through before they reached the other side this channel was narrower choked with fallen trees and other drifted debris up and down the shore derelict boats were tied both keels and flats a few curious boatmen were poking around in them some boats in better condition looked as though theyd been in the process of having their original names scraped away and replaced by new ones or other identifying marks altered others had sprung leaks and settled into the mud the newest captures were tied at the top end upstream and fawn thought she recognized a couple of the names of the tripoint boats cap cutter had been seeking fifteen or so in allfawn found herself estimating the sizes of the missing crews and shivering and this didnt even make up the whole because the bandits had burned some boats as well as many died here as at greenspring if accumulated secretly over a year or more and not in a few dreadful days and there wasnt even a malice malice aplenty though two flatboats at the far end of the row must have lain here since last fall for the ice had opened their seams and buckled their boards and what caulking hadnt given way in the winter cold had rotted out in the summer heat they sat low in the water weathered and ghostly and even fawns eye could pick out the rose second from the last because it was the exact same design as the fetch berry made her way across a sagging gray board and lowered herself carefully to the decaying deck fawn and whit followed with a creaking of rusted hinges berry pulled open the front hatch and peered into the shadows within she wrinkled her nose hiked up her skirts and stepped down into the cold water fawn deciding her shoes could get no wetter did the same whit saved his trousers and waited in the hatch watching berry in worry most of the fittings had been removed including the glass windows in the gaping frames toward the back of the cabin blue daylight filtered through reflecting off the water to give a drowned glow to the space a lot of warped barrel staves were still left halffloating slowly rotting some kegs might once have held salt butter or lard fawn wasnt sure if theyd been broken open by humans or a passing bear wildlife had been in here certainly berry waded right through water to her knees back and forth twice she reached down and pulled up unidentifiable trash it took fawn a few minutes to realize she was looking for bodiesor skeletons maybe by this timeand was immeasurably relieved when none were found berry climbed up briefly through the kitchen hatch to peer around the back deck then still in that same silence made her way to the bow and onto shore where saddler waited anything left he asked she shook her head its good for nothing but firewood now half of its too waterlogged even for that he nodded unsurprised wain says youre to have a share from the cave plan is we mean to fix up what boats here will still float and take the goods we found piled up down to the confluence youll see that cap cutter gets word of his lost boats and men i expect youll catch up with him about there would boss cutter be wounded in his male pride to learn that the lowly fetch had destroyed the river bandits when all the tripoint steels bristling bravado had missed the mark no more likely by the time the tale was carried downriver by the keelers boastful boss wain would feature as its hero well berry would not begrudge it to him cutter from tripoint aye we know the fellow will do saddler ducked his head what dont get claimed by the old owners kin will be sold together with our salvage shares its going to add up to quite a bit i dont want no share of this said berry more for us but that aint right boss berry i expect wainll have a word or two about that wain can have as many words as he wants theyre free on the river she scraped strands of pale hair out of her eyes saddler shrugged dropping the debate for the moment theres a couple other flats up the row we got more than one guess on id be grateful if youd take a look at em settle an argument maybe she nodded and let herself be drawn off whit stood on the muddy bank looking from berrys straight retreating back to the rotting hulk of the rose he ran a harried hand through his hair and said to fawn i had one shoulder for if her betrothed was dead and another for if he was run off with another gal but i got no shoulder for this and shes not cryin anyhow i dreamed of cutting out alder but not this way whatll i do fawn i want to hold her but i dont dare its too soon whit i dont think she could stand having her hurts touched yet but im afraid that soon itll be too late fawn considered this dag once told me that lakewalkers wear their hair knotted for a year for their losses and its not too long a time shes just been hit with a lot of losses her papa buckthornalder too alders the worst of all because shes lost and found and lost him twice she dont cry at all maybe shes like hawthorn and goes off in the woods to cry private you do wonderwhat sort of life a girl must have had to spurn comfort even in the worst pain as if needing help was a weakness maybe she figured if only she was strong enough she could save everything but it doesnt work that way she frowned and went on after the glassforge malice dag comforted me but he had some pretty deep experience to draw on i reckon i aint got no deep experience whit said a little desperately id say youre getting some now pay attention he rubbed the back of his wrist across his nose fawni grant that malice roughed you up and scared you silly but it wasnt as complicated as this she took two long breaths and finally said whitwhen it caught me the glassforge malice groundripped the tenweeks child i was carryin in my womb when i miscarried of it i almost bled to death dag saved my life that night taking care of me nothing could save my baby by then hit on the head with a fence post about summed up the look on whits face well shed certainly got his attention huh he breathed you never said why did you think i ran away from home she asked impatiently but who was thewait no not dag couldnt have been fawn tossed her head no the papa was a west blue boy and it doesnt matter now who except that he made it real plain he wanted no parts of his doin so i walked on down that road by myself she drew air through her nose and went on where i met dag so it came out all right in the end but it wasnteversimple you never said he repeated faintly silence doesnt mean youre not grieving i didnt want my hurts rummaged in either or to have to listen to a lot of stupid jokes about it or otherwise be plagued to death by my family i wouldnt have made he hesitated for berry you just be there whit be the one person in the wide green world she doesnt have to explain it to because you were there and saw it all for yourself hand her a clean cloth if she cries or bleeds and some warm thing for the pain that doubles her over the time to hold her will come this day isnt over yet oh said whit quietly he followed her up the riverbank to rejoin saddler and berry flanked by remo dag exited the cave and dragged his hand over his numb face the groundwork on the silver shoals fellows cut neck was holding and chicory had opened his eyes a while ago swallowed a mouthful of water complained that his head hurt like fire and pissed in a potall good signsthen fallen back into something more resembling sleep than blackout in the meanwhile however one of the flatboat mennot the papa or his son thankfullyhad died unexpectedly when a deep knife cut his friends had thought was stanched had opened again beneath his bandages and blood had filled his lungs if i had been here i might have saved him but if dag had been here he wouldnt have been at the fetch and others would surely have perished if i were ten thousand men everywhere at once i could save the world all by myself yeah dag shook his aching head grateful to fawn for sneaking him those extra hours of sleep because that last blow atop his fatigue might well have shattered him else he had an old deep aversion to losing those who followed him in trust they werent following you they were following wain and chicory dag considered the argument dubiously for who had aimed wain and chicory after all but it was bandage enough on his brain for now it was a bright though chilly noon if he looked out into the distance he could take it for a peaceful early winter day on the river which glimmered beyond the fantail of scree that swept down from the cave to the shore as long as he kept his eyes to the silverygray tree branches and didnt let them drop to take in the mob of men scattered below some cook fires had been started along the edge of the woods with men moving around to tend to them other men slept in bedrolls or lay injured or tied up dags squint at the latter was interrupted by barr hurrying up to him and remo dag you better come over here another man gravely hurt dag let himself be dragged down the slope stones turning under his boots why havent they hanged those fellows yet i confess i was hoping that part would all be over by the time we got here well theres a problem with that said barr not enough rope not enough trees berry had rope in her stores he thought although if they had to lend it to hang alder it might be best not to tell her no theresjust listen i always listen a circle of men sat on logs and stumps at the edge of the scree near the line of moored boats wain was there and bearbait and the other three boat bosses greenup from the big oleana flatboat who looked not much older than remo slate from the silver shoals keel a muscular man of an age with wain and the one named fallowfield the fatherly flattie from south raintree they seemed variously confused worried or angry but all looked mortally tired after being up all night for the brutal fight followed by the uncovering of the caves full history of horrors in whatever confessions theyd collected from the bandits possibly in even more gruesome detail than what dag had obtained from skink alder and crane crane himself now lay in his blankets over on the opposite side of the scree shadowed by the leafless scrub walked wide around by the nervous boatmen whatever the debate was it had apparently been going on for a while there he is said slate an unsettling greeting dag nodded around the circle fellows he didnt add anything hazardously polite like what can i do for you he squatted to avoid looming and after an uncertain glance at each other barr and remo copied him wain never loath to take the lead spoke first theres a problem come up with the bandits and this lakewalker of theirs dag said cautiously we agreed that the farmers would look to the farmers and the lakewalkers to the lakewalker luckily we caught crane early this morning while he was trying to get to alder on the fetch gesturing at barr bearbait said yeah your boy here told us that tale i hear you got big and little drum too good so far aye thing is wain continued some of these here bandits are claiming they shouldnt ought to be hanged because they couldnt help what they did that they were forced to it by cranes sorcery boss fallowfield put in yeah and once one of em claimed it they all took up that chorus what a surprise muttered barr dag ran his hand through his hair and you entertained that argument for more n five seconds bearbait frowned are you saying they arent none of em beguiled and mindfogged because some of em seem more than a bit that way to me and bearbait would have seen the real thing in the raintree malice war last summer dag bit his lip some are some arent skink was beguiled as you know nods from all who had helped interrogate skink when theyd been planning the attack yesterday which was everyone but the late arrival slate dag added have you all heard anything yet about that cruel recruiting game of brewers and cranes oh aye said wain troubled nods all around seconded this although some didnt seem as troubled as others it occurred to dag that the game was a bit like the rougher keeler tavern duels in a way and yetnot i dont believe there was any of what you call sorcery involved with thatit worked for brewer just the same remember dag pointed out besides some men were here before crane ever arrived and some drifted in on their ownthe drum brothers for instance bearbait squinted at dag could you pick out which of them bandits over there was beguiled and which was lying he nodded toward the prisoners amongst the trees opposite dag said carefully do you think it should make a difference in their fates when all of them are red to the elbows pretty much the same youre surely not thinking of letting any of these murdering thieves go said remo in a voice of indignation after all the trouble we went to catching them greenup grimaced at least one was begging to be hanged to end it dag wasnt sure what the grimace meant did the young boat boss prefer his bandits to be stoical granted hangings were much less embarrassing that way bearbait dug in the ground with the stick in his hand then looked across at dag see the way it was i saw folks the malice had mindslaved up in raintree when the spell was brokenor outrun anywaysthey would come back to themselves their true selves with their memories intact dag murmured that was a mixed blessing true sighed bearbait dag picked through his next words very carefully what crane did was very different from a malices compulsion was it in power if nothing else its like comparing a pebble to a landslide boss fallowfield scratched his graying head landslidesre made of pebbles soare you actually saying it is the same dag shrugged you wouldnt say that if youd ever been caught in a landslide he must not be drawn into being made judge of these men selecting some to live and some to die but if he was the only one with knowledge enough to make the judgmentlook he leaned forward on his hook gestured with his hand all here are either survivors of the game or helped run it they all had another choice onceand there are a lot of bodies up in that ravine or down in the river bottom to prove it was possible for some men to choose otherwise i dont think any here were so beguiled that they couldnt have escaped or at least tried in fact thats why crane was away from the cave last nightbecause he was hunting down two fellows whod chosen to walk away from the horrors grant you they didnt make it dag paused to contemplate the unpleasant ambiguity of that yet it would surely be a huge injustice to those whod died resisting this evil to let these laggards go free most were ruined men by now schooled in arcane cruelties it would be madness to unleash them on the world the rivermen had no way to hold them as prisoners such was his opinion but it shouldnt be my judgment if youre going to hang them all the same its pointless for meor barr or remodag hastily stopped up that possible gapto pick out one from another and if youre notit means farmers arent judging farmers anymore lakewalkers are youd just have to take our word blind because youd have no way of checking it yourselves i dont think thats such a good idea in the long run if you mean to let any here go it should be for your own reasons on your own evidence farmers to farmers the lakewalker renegade to us dag thought it important to get in that word renegade so whos nocamp now slate said will crane hang with the rest then remo unfortunately sounding up on a high horse said hes chosen to die by our own rituals privately greenup stared distrustfully you lakewalker fellers arent planning to spirit him away are you barr rolled his eyes with a broken neck it could be some trick said slate dag said unexpectedly even to himself it wont be private youll see it all every step dag cried remo and barr together remos appalled voice tumbled on dag you cant i can and will could he dags knife maker brother dar worked in careful solitude possibly for a reason beyond dars general misanthropy he should hang with the rest to be fair said young greenup hes chosen to die by sharing knife said dag i promised to make the knife for it to try leastways wains eyes narrowed but dont lakewalkers think thats an honorable death that dont seem quite right either when hanging sure aint patroller its not about honor its about saving something useful from all this this river of waste said dag slate said scratching his chin i admit it dont sound quite fair to me either all the boat bosses were frowning suspiciously at the lakewalkers now dag sighed all right then lets talk about something you do understand lets talk salvage rights which you all were divvying up in prospect a while back i claim this knife as my salvage share he fished the bone blade from his shirt twisted the cord over his head and held it up this knife and its priming slates brows flicked up that alone he inquired in a very leading tone quick to scent a bargain these silver shoals fellows greenup too looked intrigued as if mentally recalculating something dag added hastily as the other lakewalkers stirred i dont speak for barr and remo who also put their lives in the balance for this last nightas some of you may yet remember this is just for me oh sure said slate brightly give the patroller his knife if thats all he wants and its priming its priming dag went on for any of you who dont realize what im talking aboutalthough when this day is over i swear you will understand it through and throughwill be cranes mortality cranes hearts death which he will pledge to it faces screwed up around the circle in deep misgiving breaking the silence bearbait drew breath the other patrollers can make their claims as may be but give that medicine maker whatever dueshare he asks i say boss slate perhaps reminded of his crewman with the cut throat shrugged in discomfort welli guess its all right maybe i do say that lakewalker bandit should die first though where all those fellows he tricked can see it thatll be a lifelong lesson to em barr muttered at least a few around the circle quirked their lips in some slight sympathy to his exasperation briefly aye dag agreed wearily ye gods but it wasnt the bandits he wanted to take the lesson it was the boatmen and everyone else because tales of this days doings would go up and down the river as fast as a boat could travel they would inevitably end up garbled but dag swore that they wouldnt start out that way not if he could help it so youd better get this right old patroller dag returned to the fetch trying to remember everything hed seen dar do to prepare himself for his knifebindings sharing knife makers generally he reflected were sheltered in the center of most camps in the most protected and private of spaces in the very heart of lakewalker life he would be turning that heart inside out he told his shadows barr and remo to go find something to do for half an hour because any hint less broad would not have been taken and led fawn out onto the back deck as the nearest they could manage for a scrap of privacy there he explained what he meant to try she merely nodded anything dar can do i spect you can do better he wasnt sure if all that confidence was wellplaced but he had to admit it was warming he gripped her strong little hand in his the groundwork will be up to me but the thing is some parts of the task are going to need two hands bleeding crane mainly to bring his ground into the knife blank when i set up the involution much like the way you led your ground into my marriage cord back when we wove them i wouldcouldask remo or barr to help me except that id really prefer to keep them clear of this task in case theres trouble about it later her brow wrinkled why should there be because im not just making a knife i plan to make it a demonstration of lakewalker groundwork for every boatman here who i can get to look and listen he added after a moment you could leave before i actually um prime the knife you wouldnt need to watch that part ah she breathed she looked up to catch his gaze square but you know its not impossible if im to be a true lakewalkers kinswoman that such a task might fall to me someday it would be the worst thing to botch i can imagine dont you think id better watch and learn how its done right he swallowed nodded folded her in tight yes he whispered that too at length he let her go and she went into the kitchen to fix him a meal with no meat because he did remember dar ate no flesh before a binding when he came in after carefully washing up she set before him a dish of potatoes apples and onions fried up in salt butter took a little for herself and passed the remainder on to hod and hawthorn who would be staying in to keep watch on bo in an attempt to spare dag remo had given a ground reinforcement to hawthorns swollen nose for the pain and bruising dag would release the trace of beguilement later he decided when he had the chance to set it properly as dag scraped up his last bite fawn set down a cup beside his right elbow he looked over in surprise to find it piled with oats there you go you sit there and groundrip those till my hair turns purple you hear um she sat quietly beside him her back to the room because it seems to me that when you take in something vile that you cant hack up next best thing for it is to take in something bland to cushion it ah you umrealized i groundripped crane pretty much straight off yeah so now theres a bit of him in you isnt there till you break him down at least does thatbother you i think it bothers you a lot true spark he sighed he took her hand and pressed the back of it briefly to his forehead stay near me through this it helps me remember who i am and what i am about when things get too confusing he took up oat grains and rolled them between his fingers tossing the ripped ones onto his dirty plate until indeed the outlines of things started to look preternaturally sharp and strange if there was anything more he ought to do in preparation well he didnt know what it was after a moment of consideration he unbuckled his arm harness set it aside and rolled down his sleeve buttoning the empty cuff so it wouldnt flap he adjusted the knife sheath on his chest clasped fawns hand and rose dag had the littercarriers position crane in the middle of the scree just a few paces from the shore heartside toward the river so that the sixty or so boatmen could sit or stand on the slope that rose toward the cave and all hear and get a clear view whit wain and two other keelers set down the litter and retrieved wains poles and whit retreated to one side to wait with berry remo and barr sat a little way off on the other at a deliberate distance chosen by dag to mark them as witnesses not participants dag folded a blanket for his knees and fawns on cranes far side where they would not block the boatmens view she knelt and looked up at him expectantly the boatmen crunched around on the rocks of the incline finding positions hunkering or sitting or standing none crowded all that close the half dozen or so of the snapping turtles keelers whod heard his talk on lakewalker groundwork back at pearl riffle were amongst those toward the front staring with interest at least this afternoon they were all stonesober so dag stood up raised his voice to carry to the edge of the crowd and beganagain first i have to explain about ground and lakewalker groundsense ground is in everything underlies everything live or inert but live ground is brightest you all have ground in you but you dont sense it hed made this explanation so many times down this valley that it felt as smoothed as stones in a streambed some here had heard earlier versions but it never hurt to hammer it in again how many hundreds of times had he repeated himself explaining patrol techniques to each years new crop of young patrollers ground groundsense malicesthat last caught any attention still drifting loose the youngsters took it for tale their elders whod seen blight for an eyeopener the raintree men whod brushed up against the malice war nodded and exchanged murmurs both amongst themselves and with their curious neighbors crane was staringglaringup at dag with eyes gone wide with disbelief dag hadnt asked cranes permission to make him the material of this demonstration but he felt no qualms if crane hadnt lost his choice with that first murdered farmer back in oleana hed done so a hundred times since his disordered life had done the wide green world a great deal of harm let his death do it some scrap of good if this is good now dags rattling chain of words came to the secret heart of things he pitched his voice up again the creation of sharing knives is considered the most demanding of lakewalker makings and the mosthis tongue hovered a moment on secret but chose insteadprivate the knives are carved from bones lakewalker bones willed as gifts not robbed from graves and not ever despite the rumors stolen farmer bones these are legacies from our kin the gifting is a solemn part of our funeral customs also the messy part but he wasnt going to go into that yet because now came the most essential most questionable part of todays desperate lesson he drew the bone knife from the sheath at his neck and handed it to fawn who rose to take it my wife fawn is going to go around amongst you now and show you a real sharing knife please touch it and hold it a moment but blight and absent gods dont drop it on the rocks all i ask is that you handle it carefully and with respect becausebecause i once had such a bone blade willed to me by my first wife and i know how id feel if he broke off with a gulp fawn moved amongst the crowd overseeing the knife being passed back and forth dag found his voice again and went on we found this knife lost in the cave cache with those lakewalker furs we figure some lakewalker maker in raintree made it from the thighbone of one of his or her campkin no telling whosethere was no identifying writing burned on this blade as there sometimes is it was bonded to a lakewalker woman who was murdered by these river bandits just about on the spot where im now standing of all todays revelations the knife was the one dag was most determined the boatmen should understand bodydeepand so through their hands as well as their ears and eyes how much closer could he bring folks without groundsense to the feared lakewalker socalled sorcery than to actually let them touch the cool smooth surface of that fraught bone weigh it in their palms pass it one to another dag who never prayed if he could help it prayed forgiveness of the unknown donor for this use of the gift but to his immense relief fawns passage was marked not by repulsed groans or worse nervous laughter but by reasonably reverent or at least polite quiet remos and barrs mouths were tight their eyes wide they both looked ready to bolt if only they knew where but they held on fawn at length returned handed the blade back to dag and knelt attentively once more he held it up the knife makers dont just shape the surface of bone when its carved they also shape its ground both naturally as its nature changes from bone to knife and through groundwork to prepare it for its next taskwhich is to hold a lakewalkers mortality as if sealed in a bottle this knife was already dedicated like that but with some groundwork and boiling water earlier today i cleaned out the unused bonding this is now a bone blank same as if it just came from the carvers hand so the next step i have to show you is the new bonding he knelt by cranes left side his back to the muted gleam of the river blood is specially interesting for groundwork he called up the slope because it bears a persons live ground even after it leaves the body at least till it dries and dies in a regular bonding the prospective heartsdeath donor would bleed a little into a new greenwood bowl but were going to sort of skip that step the knife to cut open the vein would be heated too to prevent infection there were several refinements that dag recalled from the time hed been bonded to kauneos knife that were just not needed here in a moment of wild panic dag wondered whether he could fake it if this didnt workstab crane with the useless blade before he could complain and pretend to his audience that hed actually made and bonded a true knife but remo and barr would know blight dag found himself settling crosslegged more comfortably as if for a healing which was disturbingright let it join the yapping pack of his doubts to deal with later this groundwork had even less room for irresolution than did patrolling he glanced at fawn and relieved her of one concern he cant feel a thing anywhere below his neck you cant hurt him she nodded grimly he tipped the bone knife down below cranes arm as fawn holding up the dead weight a little awkwardly took dags war knife and scored a deep cut on the pale surface of skin squeezing it to make it bleed and drip and then dag dropped down into that other world of inner essence seen from the inside closeup the material worldthe light of the afternoon the bare trees the stone slope the rustling men craning their necksfaded like a ghostly vision present but formed of fog and the coursing torrents of the ground beneath it all became palpable to him the men were roiling complexities fawn a blazing fire dag was his ground the knife in his hand was a knotted pattern of potential cranecrane was a dark and furrowed mess but his blood dripped brightly dag extended his ghost hand beneath the vivid stream casting his mind back over the involution hed known best the one in his own pledged knife which hed watched be made for him by the maker in luthlia he had himself unmade it again in raintree as part of breaking the malices deadly groundlock the involution was the knife makers greatest gift the cupped hands to hold the offered mortality he folded his ghost hand around a splash of crane his current unwelcome affinity with the renegade might well be rendering this easieradd that dark thought to the pack no time for it now he let his ground flow into the furrow along the inner edge of the blade there to join with the knifes own waiting ground let it all set solidify he pulled back parting from that piece of himself hed turned into a cup for crane and gasped in astonishment ah blight i didnt know it was going to hurt this much he watched in horrified fascination as his ghost hand tore away from the part of itself caught in the knife it felt like biting off his own finger ye gods and dar went through this every time he bonded a knife brother i beg your forgiveness if the curl of ground was just righti either have it now or i dont if i dont i can boil the blade again and start overmany a makers apprentice has had to do just that their first few trials but beneath that was the stronger thought muleheaded in its certainty i have it he came back blinking to the surface world trembling and cold as if from a deep healing the bloody knife shook in his tight grip but it was his left arm that ached and his ghost hand felt on fire a quick check found his groundsense down to a hundred paces again i wont be recovering from this in a day but the groundwork was over everything after this was going to behe declined to finish the thought easy everything after this was going to be as blighted bizarre as everything before likely dag swallowed and found his cracked voice now at this point in a usual knife making the maker would clean it up and give it to its new owner to use later on a good binding can last a lifetime by definition he stuck his hand out rather blindly toward fawn she raised her brows at him pried the knife from his stiffened fingers and rubbed the spare blood from it with a cloth dag wasnt so sure how good this binding wasit seemed clumsier than his luthlian knifes not as fine but solid yes possibly overbuilt maybe he was only supposed to have say bitten off the tip of one finger but the lifetime this binding waited on would be measured in minutes primings vary my father put his knife through his own heart during a dire illness a dozen years ago my first wife rolled over on hers when she was dying of wounds on a far northern battlefield remo had one from an elderly kinswoman who gave up the last precious months of her old age to itout of the corner of his eye dag saw remo flinchand had to be helped to it by her own daughter ive seen patrollers help each other you understand a sharing knife is not normally used as an instrument of execution or as a means of instruction to a pack of farmers dag had to admit but one way or another this is something no farmer has ever seen so pay attention he snapped that last to the back of the crowd in his captains voice they jolted upright and attended youre a blighted madman you know that crane murmured up to him hed kept his face turned halfaway from the gawkers on the hill through most of this i have my reasons dag murmured back down you might even have understood them once before you wrecked yourself me they banished if they have a lick of sense you theyll burn alive ignoring this dag sat again and said open his shirt spark her nimble fingers undid the buttons folded back the cloth bared cranes chest dag wondered if remo was going to want his shirt back after he looked gravely into cranes silvery eyes and received a blackbrowed scowl in return ready do you assent of all requirements for this making that was the most profoundly unalterable if you want my dying curse growled crane you have it figured that so if my curse is as good as a blessing is my blessing worth a curse blight it take both you can sort them out yourself im done he turned his face toward the bright river let me out of this hopeless world he added after a moment dont let your blighted hand falter assent enough dag positioned the tip of the sharing knife under cranes rib cage pausing only long enough to explain softly to fawn about the correct angle to reach the heart and how much force to use to reach it in one swift punch without breaking the blade prematurely her face was taut but her eyes were intent she nodded understanding dag extended his groundsense to be sure of cranes heart gripped the haft and in an abrupt motion forced in the blade to its full length cranes lips shivered and his eyes rolled up but all dags attention was back at ground level he froze still clasping the haft as the dissolving mortal ground began to flow toward the knife as if sucked into a drain would his involution hold it all would it close and seal properly yes dag breathed again as crane did not he blinked looked up looked around the hillside of watching men had gone really really quiet dag drew the primed knife from its fleshly sheathing and held it up high this lakewalkerhe declined to use the terms renegade or banished at this pointhas now given his mortality into this knife to share again if the chance favors me with the next malice to cross my path twentysix lakewalkers before crane had trusted dag not to waste their deaths and had their trust upheld of all the knives and lives that had passed through his hand this was surely the darkest blight but i came by this one the hard way he handed the knife to fawn to clean and slip back into the sheath at his neck because his hand was still too clumsy with the shakes to manage the task in one try whether crane has paid for his crimes i cant tell you this is a separate tally her face carefully held stiff to hide how her stomach shook fawn helped dag rise from cranes still body she had prudently brought along dags hickory stick with that in his hand and fawn under his left shoulder he made his way along the shoreline at fawns nod of invitation berry followed and whit came after her barr and remo were left to oversee the disposal of the corpse the crowd of sobered boatmen too broke up and moved into the trees to tend to their next grim chore dag headed not back to the fetch but downstream to the next creek and up its rockstrewn banks to the narrow meadow where the bandits had hobbled their horses some of the meadow grass was still green especially along the creek though most had turned from autumn gold to winter dun a sort of standing hay the dozen or so horses grazing there swiveled their ears at the newcomers then put their heads down once more except one big brown fellow who whuffled curiously as they passed near dag stopped to rub its poll which made the beast droop its lip and flop its ears foolishly i like horses murmured dag theyre so big and bright and simple in their grounds and best of all right nowhe sighedtheyre not people over there spark he nodded to a lone cottonwood tree at the meadows edge soaring up to scratch at the sky with its bare branches and ambled over to sit and lean his head back against the ridged gray bark closing his eyes fawn sat herself beside him unusually he let his left arm lie in her lap and she stroked it gently which made his lips move not unlike the horses the whuffling horse followed them in short hops of its hobbled front legs then lowered its face to nudge him for more rubs which he reached up and supplied without opening his eyes fawn suspected that the animalscalm warm and nearby in his groundsensemaybe helped blot out what was going on beyond the treeclad ridge that lay between them and the cave if dag had any groundsense range left after all that performance he could furl it in fawn supposed but that would leave him alone in silence silence was all right just now the alone part maybe not so good whit wandered out amongst the horses looking them over in expert evaluation berry who had also stopped to stroke a quiet one if more dubiously turned her head at a faint cry out of sight of the cave they might be apparently they werent quite as far out of earshot as could have been hoped she stepped away from the horse and stood rigid staring back up the slope at the woods face set tall alone and at the next cutoff cry trembling she looked fawn thought like an aspen tree being gnawed down slender and doomed whit watched her anxiously then held out his open hands toward fawn in desperate question fawn cast him an encouraging nod he gulped walked over to berry and still without a word folded her into his embrace it wasnt a gesture of courtship simply one of comfort offered in a bleak hour something warm to wrap herself around when the pain folds her over berry rested her head on whits shoulder eyes closing tight the blond head was a little higher than the dark onewhit was a sawedoff bluefield after allbut with her chin bent down their hair mingled on a level that was close enough whit held her for a long time till she stopped shaking then led her to a more comfortable seat on a fallen log near the stony creek side he put his arm around her and snugged her in tight as they watched the horses graze do patrollers ever hobble their horses fawn asked dag because she didnt think she could bear to talk about anything harder just yet you do wonder how well those things work to keep em from running off he fell in willingly with her lead perhaps for similar reasons we use them sometimes because if a patrollers horse gets out of his groundsense range hes put to the same wheezing work of chasing it down as any farmer dags lips turned up in some wry memory he opened his eyes to stare out on the benign scene hobbles dont slow a horse down much if its seriously panicked i imagine the habit of feeding them here does more to keep them close they dont look as illcaredfor as youd think i wonder how many were stolen from boats and how many came with the bandits well i suppose wain and the boatmen will work it out yeah its all salvage at this point dag said he tucked the knife sheath out of sight in his shirt and leaned his head against the bark once more after a time remo and barr came over the ridge and picked their way across the creek to dags tree they both looked gloomy dag opened his eyes again hangings finished not quite said remo we did get crane laid out im glad we didnt have to butcher him barr made a face whod want a knife from cranes bones the boatmen dug a trench remo continued he was the first to go in it its not very deep said barr but i imagine theyll pile some river stones on top some of the boatmen were for making the bandits dig it themselves but finally decided it was more trouble guarding them than it was worth remo added morosely one of the keelers had kin on one of the boats the bandits took a month or so back he found out just what exactly had happened to them i guess wain let him cut off big drums head personally little drums too even though he was dead already theyre going to put them up on poles in front of the cave as a warning to others we left right after that said barr healthy young men or no to fawns eye both looked as shaken as she felt and not just from the extra sensitivity lent by groundsenses possibly not closed tight enough during these proceedings barr wandered out into the meadow to pat a horse too a tidy piebald mare hey he called back over his shoulder after a moment this ones in foal whoever takes her is going to get a bonus horse remo walked out to see and fawn tagged after she was reminded of grace left back in west blue and was washed by an unexpected wave of homesickness how could you be homesick for a horse but she suddenly missed her own mare fiercely wondering how she was getting along and if graces round barrel looked any rounder yet she stretched her hands and ran them over the blackandwhite belly speculating how far along this mare was dags horseraising tentsister omba could have told exactly with her groundsense maybe barr shared the talent remo put his hand on the mares withers and looked across at barr who had started picking burrs out of her mane remo pitched his voice low wain said we were due a share of the salvage rights we could take a couple of these horses ride back to pearl riffle before the snow flies barr looked up in surprise huh when did you change your mind cranewas pretty awful im thinking now its not such a good thing for a lakewalker to be exiled from his kin even if they do badger him half to death maybe we should just go take our lumps fawn stroking the mares warm flank observed i dont think its good for anyone to become outcast lakewalker or farmer look at all those bandits speaking of ending up in a pit of your own digging yeah said barr he picked at another brown spiky burr carefully separating the coarse hairs from it i thought you wanted to see the sea or else go drown yourself in it neither one anymore remos voice went lower the world is uglier than id ever dreamed ive had enough lets go home this hopeless world crane had said and crane had certainly done more than his share to make it worse not all of its that bad barr said mildly he glanced across the meadow fawn followed his gaze to dag still leaning headback looking utterly spent thing isi think ive changed my mind too and even if i hadnt i dont think itd be so good to let himhe jerked his head dagwardgo walking around out there all by himself either in fact he added judiciously i think that might be worse than the worst snagbrained thing ive ever done he raised his eyes and you know ive done some champion snagbrained things fawn cleared her throat dag does have a partner she pointed out she held up her cordwrapped left wrist drawing their eyes and maybe groundsenses as well were as roped together as any two luthlian patrollers out on the ice and im not about to let him go drown in the dark and cold neither remo rubbed his lips barr undid another burr neither argued ive taken everything dag was and thought the trade fair because he did but he needs more than just me she stood straighter and said still i really think having you two along has been good for him an anchor in the old when hes straining and reaching for something so new no one has ever grasped it before because hes not really a patroller anymore not in his ground hes trying to turn into something else remo nodded yes medicine maker or knife maker said barr more doubtfully and if hes going to be that we sure enough have a duty to guard him camp or no camp fawn shook her head though not in disagreement with that last first thing a new maker has to do is make himself i think its hard for any youngster to do that even apprenticed to a mentor in a chosen craft but dags trying to do it all on his own somewhere in midair ive seen him mend a busted glass bowl and a lot of hurt people and a lost sharing knife and what he did in raintree i cant begin to describe but what he really wants to mend is the world remo stared at her appalled no one can do that no one no i spect dag would say the worlds big and were small and i guess we all break in the end but when all the old arguments about farmers and lakewalkers have gone round and round bout sixteen times and plowed into exhaustion the problem of greenspring will still be sitting there fawn swallowed we may not be able to win that toss either but itd sure be nice to have some company while were losin thats one remos lips moved but no sound came out he blinked rapidly fawn drew breath and went on cracking that beguilement mystery open was worth your coming along all on its own thats two and i dont know how many more boats and lives those bandits would have destroyed before the end if we hadnt chanced along to stop them thats three three good reasons are good enough for going on with dag says she glanced aside i could wish it was less hard on berry but the boat boss was sitting on the log next to whit finally beginning to talk a bit whit was listening attentively he had an arm around her waist in a comforting sort of way and she was making no move to shrug it off berrys strength still impressed fawn but she was glad that maybe she didnt have to be strong so allbyherself now because that could be wearing on a woman i dont know said remo i dont think i know anything anymore blight i never did said barr it hasnt stopped me he blinked cheerily and fell into his old wheedling voice youve got to come along remo to keep me from falling into the sea or to push me in whichever remo scratched his head and said wryly hard choices hey leaving them to take up their comfortable habitual squabbling fawn made her way back to dag satisfied a while after the last unnerving noises stopped drifting over the ridge they all made their way back to the fetch the long way around back of the cave avoiding both the woods and the new poles down by the shore fawn expected shed go peek at those gruesome standards later and then be sorry she had she definitely wasnt going to venture into the winterbare woods until the crop hanging there had been harvested and planted and maybe not even then dag thought berry would have been glad to shove off that very afternoon as the fallowfield familys flatboat did but they were all held there by the boatmens demands on dag for medicine work yet by the following morning chicory was doing better than dag had anticipated sitting up and eating if wincing at his tender skull and throbbing headache the raintree men made plans to camp at the cave for a few more days then ride home in gentle stages taking the bandits horses and horse gear for their salvage share fawn opined that it was a good idea to get chicory back into the hands of missus chicory as soon as might be to finish recovering in all dag thought the raintree hunters would be trailing home with fuller bags than if theyd managed to successfully complete their original river venture and much sooner so missus chicory might forgive the broken head if perhaps not let anyone forget it for a good long time or so bearbait feared after dag released his lakewalker assistants around noon the pair disappeared and did not return till after dark he intercepted them at the end of the gangplank as they approached the fetch somewhat surreptitiously each lugging a sack whats this dag asked shh said remo with a glance at the boat dag allowed them to lead him out of earshot along the bank barr said we decided to patrol upstream a ways and see if we could track where crane and the drums caught up with his two deserters which we did we buried the bodies he grimaced which dag took to indicate the scene had been rather worse than just plain bodies he did not feel any need to ask after the details remo continued it took a bit longer to trace cranes cache i dont think anyone without groundsense could have found it does wain know about this oh yeah said barr we took the goods to him first he allowed as how since it was twicestolen and wouldnt have been found at all without us we could keep it for our salvage share we swapped out the things we didnt want with some of the boatmentheres a regular market going on up at the cave just now i couldnt quite stomach the clothes and boots but some of those keeler boys are not so finicky they didnt fit us remo interpreted this more precisely a fellow could come back someday and do some real interesting treasurehunting within a day or sos ride of this place barr said a speculative look in his eye that accounts for you two missing dinner but why the tiptoeing asked dag remo rubbed his mouth boss berry refused any salvage share for the fetch barr put in which about broke poor whits heart i think but he wouldnt take any if she wouldnt remo went on i know you said that wasnt to apply to us sir but i figured it might be better not to trouble her mind dag who had put his new sharing knife away deep in his saddlebags because he flat declined to wear it around the same neck where he had kept kauneos in honor for so many long years nodded understanding yes he agreed put those bags away discreetly and no dont trouble boss berry just now yes sir said barr brightly both patrollers looked relieved to be freed from responsibility for this ruling although dag doubted berry would say anything even if she noticed the pair made their way quietly across the gangplank discretion somewhat spoiled when daisygoat bleated curious greetings dag shook his head and followed berrys hard quest was over but time and the river flowed only one way and flatboats perforce went with them the fetch left the cave landing the next dawn of the patients dag was taking along hawthorn was recovering enough to be active if still ouchy about his reset nose but pleased to be let off chores for another few days when active turned to pesky dag would pronounce him well bo was more worrisome developing a rising fever dag gave up his sweep duties on the roof to sit with him and together with fawn keep a close eye anxious for the old man hod proved a dab hand as an attendant steady and careful when it came to the needed lifting and turning and he bore up bravely even when the hurting bo unjustly swore at him during the periods when bo fell into an uneasy doze dag turned to another chore gathering up what few pieces of paper the fetch harbored he sat down at the kitchen table to pen a letter to fairbolt crow about the renegade crane and his fate at the river cave whether as patrol leader or captain the writing of reports had never been dags favorite task and hed ducked it whenever he could which still meant that hed written more of the blighted things than he could rightly remember the lurid events and cranes evil history fit oddly into the wellworn forms and phrases of a patrol report but dag trusted fairbolt at least to be able to read between the lines dag was not entirely satisfied with the results but he had no more paper to do it over fairbolt was not strictly speaking dags camp captain anymore but dag could not escape the conviction that someone with his head on straight ought to have the facts bos fever grew worse that night and dag gave ground reinforcements till he nearly passed out but in the midmorning the fever broke dag fell wordlessly into his own bed awakening in the afternoon with an incipient cold his first in years happily barr and remo were both able to help with that a familiar task for patrollers on search patterns in all weathers and dagwith another cup of oats silently proffered by fawnfended it off with no worse effects than a sore throat and slight sniffle dag had the fetch stop at the last lakewalker ferry camp on the north bank of the grace just long enough for him to deliver his letter to the patrol courier there turn over the effects of the murdered lakewalker couple for possible identification and give a very truncated account of the late doings up in crooked elbow to the shocked camp captain he did not linger they came to the confluence in the late afternoon of the following day dag berry and whit were on the sweeps dag having now no need to begor attempt to bega knife berry was just as happy not to have to struggle to pull in the fetch at the big lakewalker camp that occupied the point though barr and remo climbed to the roof to stare at the many tents to be seen amongst the trees and at the wharf boats and goodssheds maintained along the shore by the lakewalkers themselves fawn joined them as the fetch swung past the point and the gray river could at last be seen she shaded her eyes with her hand her lips parted in an unimpaired worldwonder that eased dags heart the waters of the two great streams did not at once mingle but ran along side by side for some miles clearbrown and opaque the gray really is gray said fawn yep said dag it drains the whole of the western levels its wellwooded along here but about a hundred miles due west depending the trees fail and the blight gradually starts its said that after the first great malice war the blight reached the river here and the whole gray was dead from the poison but its long since come alive again i find that a pretty encouraging tale myself the westering sun was playing hideandseek behind cold bluegray clouds with glowing edges that filled the sky from horizon to horizon i think thats the widest sky i ever did see fawn said is it because the lands so level out here uhhuh said berry and i thought raintree was flat whit marveled its beautiful in a severe sort of way never seen a sky like that at home fawn turned completely around drinking in all that her eyes could hold thats a thing to come see all right in a maternal spirit she dragged hod outside to share the sight he gaped gratifyingly but rubbing his red nose soon went back inside to hug the hearth despite the chilly wind fawn sat at dags feet for the next halfhour watching for when the two streams would at last become indistinguishable during the stretches when they had merely to ship their oars and float on whit and berry doubled up boat cloaks guarding each other from the blustery discomfort dag found himself thinking im so glad we brought whit he wished the boy all good speed and fortune in his courtship because he thought fawn must warmly welcome such a tentsister and my tentsister too how unexpected the most important thing about quests he decided was not in finding what you went looking for but in finding what you never could have imagined before you ventured forth keep that in mind old patroller as the year slid toward its darkest turning the late dawns and early sunsets squeezed the daylight hours down to less than a double handful after encountering a spurt of snow flurries the morning before theyd passed the confluence boss berry took advantage of having three lakewalker pilots aboard and reversed her ban on night runningalso because she no longer needed the daylight fawn figured to watch for wrecks that might be the briar rose for five nights straight they floated down the wide channel far into the evenings until nearly half the winding river miles between the confluence and the graymouth were behind them and the cold breath of winter eased into something if still damp much less penetrating then one afternoon the wind swung around to the south the clouds broke up and the air grew downright warm berry relented enough to tie up the fetch during a spectacular sunset in the immense western sky and declare an evening of rest after a string of nights handing out hasty meals to the offwatch crew to eat while crowding around the hearth fawn celebrated by fixing a bangup sitdown supper with everyone squeezed together around the table for once even bo though she made sure his food was soft the meal was eaten with appetite enough but in uncharacteristic and rather weary silence after a glance around at the long faces fawn swallowed her last bite of fried potato and declared well this is no good youre all looking as glum as a chorus of frogs with no pond we should do something after the dishes to ginger folks up how about archery lessons everybody liked those we still have plenty of lanterns in stock and theres hardly any wind tonight hawthorn and hod looked interested but whit scrubbed his hand over his face and said naw i dont think that would be so much fun anymore dags eyelids had been drooping in a combination of fatigue and foodinduced mellowness at this they flicked open he watched whit but did not at once speak fawn glanced at dag then badgered why not whit shrugged made a face and seemed about to fall into hunched silence but then got out it feels funny to be making a game out of it after i shot a man big drum said berry whit were right glad you shot big drum no not him whit made a frustrated wavingaway gesture besides i didnt kill big drum that fellow who cut off his head later did that it was the other one the first one what first one fawn asked carefully it was the night before at the cave some fellows ran out trying to get away which was exactly why dag put us bowmen where he did i guess i was so scared and excited i couldnt hardly see what i was doing butmy first shot my very first shot ever went right through this bandits eye killed him outright fawn winced and murmured eew hawthorn unhelpfully made a very impressed ooh whit waved again it wasnt the eye thing that bothered me well it did but that wasnt he drew air through his nostrils and tried it was too easy bo rubbed his rough chin in some sympathy but rumbled whit some men need killin berry put in perhaps more shrewdly it doesnt need to be catching its not that exactly said whit his brows drawing in dag spoke for the first time so unexpectedly that fawn gave a little jump no but youre not the same person after it changes you in your ground and thats a fact whit barr and remo all crossed that line for the first time that night at the cave and theres no stepping back over it you have to go on from where you are i suppose you did the same once said remo diffidently so long ago you dont remember likely oh i remember said dag nods all around the table at this received wisdom dag set his tankard down so hard his drink slopped out absent gods do you people have to swallow down every blighted thing i say dont you ever choke fawns eyes widened and hers were not the only ones surprised heads turned toward dag all around the table hod flinched what the blights bit you said barr saving fawn the trouble of composing a more tactful question to the same effect dag drummed his fingers grimaced blurted i killed crane by groundripping a thin little slice out of his spinal cord thats how i dropped him on the deck from twenty feet away mind you remember that mosquito back in lumpton market whit just like that but inside his body same as i do healing groundwork oh said whit his eyes growing big i um didnt realize you could do that i realized even back then dags glance darted around the table it was too easy fawn recalled then where shed heard that exact phrase before if in a different tone of voice and it wasnt just now from whit cranes confession but whit hadnt been there for that his echo of the renegades words was accidental dags isnt she thought did barr and remo catch the twisted meanings too do i that was what you did to crane groundripped him said barr blankly i didnt know any person could do that said remo more warily i thought only malices its a very weak version of the same thing yes i have reason to believe its an advanced makers skill as well or some variant but since its come outcome backin me i havent had a chance to find a maker skilled enough to ask you can easily defend against it by closing your grounds which is why i had to wait for a moment when crane opened his it only worked because i took him by surprise oh said barr relaxing thats all right then for some of us here said dag dryly whit at least looked as though he caught the full implications his mouth went round whatever was dag about to plop out this admission here now in this company was it for whits sake or his own fawn sat up straight dag this is morbid you arent no more going to turn into a malice or even into crane than whit is going to turn into little drum for that matter i made that arrow whit shot in that fellows eye with my own hands as strong and straight and sharp as cattagus could teach me and i made it for killinwhatever needed killinbecause i figured it would be down to either the other fellow or dag at that point and i knew which i wanted it to be same goes for my brother if youve any doubt she drew breath a knife an arrow groundripping theyre all just different tools you can kill a man with a hammer for pitys sake the farmerly alarm around the table faded as folks digested this thought dag said nothing though his tension eased he cast fawn that odd little salute of his and a slow nod had he never thought of groundripping as a tool before or only as some uncanny magical menace fawn loved him beyond breath but there was no doubt his tendency to lakewalkerish gloom could be awfully exasperating some days dag said so you see whit if theres an answer to your trouble i havent found it yet either as for the bow lessons though i do enjoy them very much they were never a game for me not even when i was a tadpole hawthorns size theyre earnest training for earnest business he blinked and added same as groundveiling drills come to think which weve also neglected for the past week ill see you two out on the deck tomorrow morning he tilted his head at barr and remo who did not argue dag went on i wont invite you out to play a game whitand hod and hawthorn and the rest of youbut i will invite you out to continue your training becauseas youve seenyou never know when youll need a skill and more lives than your own may depend on it my papa usedberrys breath caught broke free againused to say nothing worth doing is fun all the time but its still worth doing all the time whit gave her a crooked smile and nodded the archery lessons commenced by lantern light as soon as the dishes were washed up fawn was pleased to see the companys mood lift with all the exercise and interplay and stretching of legs running up and down the riverbank which had been her whole purpose for the proposition in the first place so that part was all right she was more worried for dag as he wrapped himself around her and fell into exhausted slumber that night they hadnt made love since before the cave if fawn hadnt watched dag convalescing after raintree she might have feared it meant some dwindling of his affection but she was clear this was only profound fatigue yet this time he hadnt been physically injured or blighted or groundripped he had put out ground reinforcementsand unimaginably more complex healing effortstill he couldnt stand up though and the tally of the strange ground hed taken in directly or as part of unbeguiling was daunting skink chicory bo hawthorn who knew how many boatmen most of all that big wedge of crane yet fawn wasnt sure but what crane had done more damage with his poisonous tongue than his dubious ground hed sure tried anyhow dag should have paralyzed that part of the renegade too she decided had dags odd outburst at dinner been some belated response to crane or just general accumulation dags ground had to be in the most awful mess just now come to think like a house the day after some big shindig where all the neighbors and kinfolks came and ate and danced and drank and fought till all hours and your least favorite cousin threw up on the floor you couldnt hardly expect to get any work done till youd cleaned up the place again all tidy and you couldnt tackle that till the hangover passed off upon reflection fawn was profoundly thankful that dag showed no weakness for drink patrollers in their cups had to make the most morose drunks in the world she snorted and rolled over cuddling in tight please be well beloved gloomy man the next day the fetch floated through yet more of the bleak treeless unpeopled country theyd been passing for the last hundred miles berry promised there would only be about another day of this then the banks of the river would grow more interesting than these endless scrubby sand bars strange new trees still green in the dead of winter and bearded with moss mysterious creeperhung side channels an abundance of birds fawn mainly wondered if they would see any of those scary swamp lizards of dags and if bos tales about the snakes were true by noon the air was warm enough to go up on the roof without a jacket or boat cloak and fawn joined berry dag and whit to keep company and to soak up the pale but valiant sun with no duty to watch ahead for hazards she was the first to look behind them hey is that a narrow boat comin downstream oror not if it is thats the biggest narrow boat i ever did see dag swung around a slim vessel some thirtyfive feet long was rapidly overtaking them paddles flashed in the hazy winter light ten to a side the occupants kept up a song to unite the rhythm of their strokes distance muffled the words but dag seemed to smile in recognition barr whose own watch was coming up soon came out and stared over the stern rail a halfeaten apple in his hand isnt that a luthlian boat he called up excitedly yep said dag but those arent luthlians paddling exactly those are southern lakewalkers heading home from a couple of years of exchange patrol how can you tell asked fawn their clothes their ages the big narrow boat was already shooting past thema quartermile off but still in the channel as the river was a mile wide at this point even at that distance fawn could see the mix of strong young men and women laughing and leaning into their work that and the enthusiasm though if you were outrunning the luthlian winter youd paddle hard too thats twenty or thirty new patrol leaders over there young veterans see therere areas to the south that havent seen a malice emergence in two three hundred years but the rule is you cant be a patrol leader till youve been in on at least one malice kill preferably more for obvious reasons fawn who had not only seen but made a malice kill nodded perfect understanding barr who hadnt looked envious so the southern lakewalkers export all their best young patrollers up the gray for a couple of seasons and hope they get them back do the malices take so many asked berry no actually the biggest causes of losing young patrollers inor toluthlia are accidents and the weather and marriage the malices are a long ways down the list there are those who say the malices arent nearly as scary as the luthlian girls dag grinned briefly not you said fawn i was a much braver man when i was young whit cocked his head watching the narrow boat pulling out of sight south around a broad curve of the great river hey dagit just occurred to me i never asked what was your name up in luthlia when you were married to kauneo because it wouldnt have been dag redwing hickory oleana then dag something something luthlia right barr about to abandon the back deck again for the kitchen paused and glanced up over the roof edge ears plainly pricked dag cleared his throat and recited dag wolverine leech luthlia in point of fact he added in hasty clarification leech for leech lake like hickory lake so wolverine was kauneos tentname and erleech would have been your camp name yep its a pretty wellknown camp up in those parts whit scratched his chin yknow that dag bluefield thing is starting to make all kinds of sense all of a sudden fawn ignored him to ask did the lake really have leeches oh yes said dag big onessix inches a foot long they were actually pretty harmless to frolic with kept you alert while swimming though he grinned to watch her wrinkle her nose and go eew which made her wonder if that had actually been the aim of his anecdote six more days brought them to graymouth but not fawn discovered to her disappointment to the sea the town lay not on the shore but ten miles inland downstream from the bluffs on which the town stood the river split into several channels that ran out into a broad marshy delta the town itself was divided into two portions uptown along the bluff downtownsometimes called drowntownalong the riverbank fawn supposed she could think of them as the two lips of the graymouth and smiled at the notion uptown as near as fawn could tell from this waterside vantage was built of substantial houses and goodssheds and pleasant inns downtown of cheap temporary shacks rough boatmens taverns rickety sheds and camps the shore was lined with much the same sort of businesses as silver shoals if not so many of them plus long rows and double rows of flatboatssome for sale some being used as floating shacksand keelboats on the southern end the boats were of a very different shape and had tall masts sticking up fishing boats and coasting vessels that actually dared thread the delta and put out to sea downtown boasted a lively day market and trade of all sorts keelers looking to hire on upstream crewmen propositioned whit and hod within a short time of the fetch tying to the bank and another fellow tried to buy copperhead right off the deck copperheadrested refreshed and rowdy after his long boat rideshowed off by trying to kick out the pen slats dag rescued berrys boat and the innocent bystanders by saddling the beast and taking him out for a hard gallop whit and hawthorn took off down the row of boats fawn snagged berry to guide her to the market to find fresh new food for supper barr and remo followed them trying to look tall and grim like guardsmen of some sort fawn thought if it werent for the sheer embarrassment of it theyd be clinging to each other like youngsters lost in the woods surrounded by all these strange farmers they stuck tight to her anyhow staring around warily its not as big as silver shoals remo muttered couldnt prove it by me barr muttered back whos protecting who fawn didnt say aloud tact was a fine thing she did spot a pair of older lakewalkers at the far end of the market square a man and a woman but they were too far away to hail and by the time she worked around to that side they had gone off were they local or from upriver was there a camp near here she would have to ask dag but they all returned to the fetch before the oleana boys had a chance to work each other into some sort of groundpanic there she discovered whit had undermined her dinner menu by bringing in a fish the size and shape of a platter which he said was fresh from the sea and which hed bought off a sailboat a ways down the row fawn stared at it in horror as he proudly held it out whit that fish has two eyes all fish do not on the same side whit those fellows spotted you for an upcountry boy and foisted off some defective fish on you no this kind is supposed to look like thathe studied it in some doubt himselfthey said but the important thing is i got us a ride down to the shore tomorrow morning in their boat they go out every day the weather allows to do their fishing see theyll drop us off on the beach in the morning and pick us up again on their way back we can take a picnic a picnic in the heart of winter well why not in west blue a foot of snow would have fallen by now here it was merely cloudy and chilly bo vouched for the twoeyed fish which didnt exactly reassure fawn especially after his tale about the rolling hoop snakes used for cart wheels but so did berry so she cooked it up as best she could dag ate it without hesitation but well patrollers fawn conscious of his crinkling eyes on her eventually broke down and nibbled it was alarmingly delicious so it was she found herself packing a big basket with food and another with blankets by lanternlight the next morning as the laggard sun would not be up for another hour berry and whit undertook to bring hawthorn fawn supposed she and dag would trail remo and barr behind them in a notdissimilar fashion hod elected to stay with the stillconvalescing bo and not just due to the tales about the peopleeating sea fish with giant teeth and the things with tentacles sporting suckers that popped blood from your skin the twoparentless hod and childless boseemed in a fair way to adopting each other theyd all come a long way from oleana fawn thought but hod especially hed become a competent boat hand and more he was not so skinny not so shy and was a good two inches taller partly from her cooking but mostly from not carrying himself so sshaped theyd be in graymouth some weeks yet when bo felt better she would make sure hod found his chance to visit the shore fawn had never ridden in a sailboat before the creaking of its lines and tilting of its deck as the patched and discolored sails caught the faint dawn breeze made her nervous but dag was watching her closely so she raised her chin and tried to sit bravely the four fellows who ran the boattwo brothers and a couple of their halfgrown sonsdid appear to know what they were doing and were glad to show the curious whit too after a bit even barr and remo unbent and horned in on the deal dag seemed content to lean back with his arm around fawn dawn over the marshes was gold and gray a severe winter beauty all its own birds swarmed up to greet the light though their cries seemed strange and sad in the misty air from time to time along the channel fawn could spot the decaying remains of flatboats amongst the other wrack wrecked and washed down in a flood or else simply abandoned and allowed to drift out to sea half in fear and half in hope fawn made out every drowned log to be a lurking swamp lizard but dag said not though he promised to find her one later an offer for which she thanked him politely but unencouragingly one good thing about this time of year whit called slapping his neck hardly any mosquitoes true enough dag agreed amiably come high summer these southern mosquitoes carry off small children to feed to their young they do not hawthorn cried indignantly which made the fishermen grin you shouldnt ought to tell such tales to whit hes bound to believe you cause on account as youre tentbrothers the corners of dags mouth tucked up he murmured ah you never met my luthlian tentbrothers those wolverine boys trained me out of that right quick the boat bore left at the next split in the channel and in a halfhour more a line of duncolored sand dunes rippled across the flat horizon the ascending sun began to draw up the mist so that the far distance seemed to be veiled by a gilded gauze curtain shifting in a gentle draft the boat scrunched bowfirst into the sandy shore just behind the dunes and the fellows jumped out took the baskets carried fawn hawthorn and berry dryshod across the last stretch of water and united to help give the sailboat a good shove back out into the channel fawn watched it drift away so if the boat sank out there on the big sea would they ever be able to get back to graymouth far up the channel a faded red sail loomed so perhaps they would be able to hail another fisherman and not be stranded on that reassuring thought she took dags proffered hand warm in the cool light and scrambled up the dune sand shifting under her sliding feet which made her laugh breathlessly dag watched her profile anxiously as she pressed to the crest and the worlds rim opened before her astonished eyes the vast expanse of water gleamed like steel blending in a muted distant silverygold line with the equally vast lavenderedged sky it was like being inside a great bowl of liquid light on the strand stretching away like wool rolled for spinning waves broke and murmured the damp strangesmelling air caressed fawns flushed cheeks as she stared and stared the smell seemed to be some stronger cousin to that of a riverbank or creek bed but with a tang all its own like nothing shed smelled before she took in a huge breath of it oh my hawthorn whooped and ran down the sand dune berry laughing called him to slow down and slid after whit on her heels remo and barr with a wild look at each other followed dag scanned the horizon brows pinched it was all warm and blue first time i was down here he muttered which was fifty or a hundred miles west of here though that was late spring too you said course it was warmer said fawn he cast her a grave look and swallowed this isntthis wasnt the wedding trip id promised you im afraid you promised to show me the sea that there is it isnt it most amazingly the sea fawn tossed her head i didnt anticipate crane nor river bandits nor exposing you to all those horrors with a hesitant finger he traced her neck where cranes knife had lain he added after a moment nor making you cook for a boatload of folks the whole way blight crane i dont think we anticipated the fetch at all nor berry nor bo and hawthorn and chicory and wain and all those others but im glad to have met them even remo and barr turned out pretty good in the end ive learned so many new things ive lost count which i wouldnt want to give back nohow she hesitated searching for the right words to ease his misplaced fear of disappointing her without pretending that the cave hadnt mattered mama used to say to me when i was young and pining for my birthday or some other treat to come quick right now dont go wishing your life away she tightened her grip on his hand dont you go wishing my life away either he smiled a little although she was afraid it was half for amusement at that when i was young part theres a point spark youd best believe it firmly she pulled him down the slope hawthorn already had his shoes and socks stripped off and trouser legs rolled up and was prancing about in the foam that bubbled and hissed around his feet barr and remo watched him rather enviously they set down their baskets beside a likelylooking mess of driftwood and all walked up the beach together everyone including dag bent to collect seashells and marvel at the strange shapes and colors fawn was especially taken with the round hollow ones like sugar cookies with flower patterns pressed in the center trying to imagine what wondrous creatures had made them or lived in them noting that no bloodsucking tentacles had yet reached out to grab hawthorns ankles she took off her shoes and socks too gave them to dag to carry and walked through the tickling foam despite the chill she scooped up a handful of the water and not that she hadnt been warned tasted itsalty metallic and vile but for all that not regretted she spat it out and made a face that made dag grin or at least smirk a halfmile on they came upon a huge dead fish washed ashore it was even bigger than dags channel cat sleek gray with a pale belly with an ugly underslung mouth lined with far too many sharp triangular teeth it had teeth in rows it had evidently been there awhile because it also stank to the sky which at least saved any argument about its edibility and whether fawn should be made to attempt to cook it hawthorn remo and barr were delighted by it especially the jaws dag and fawn walked on leaving them crouching down trying to cut out the jawbones from the smelly carcass to carry off for a souvenir possibly to work the teeth later into some sort of lakewalker hair ornaments there certainly seemed to be plenty of teeth to go around berry and whit wrinkled their noses at the aroma wafting up from this process and retreated as well to walk side by side along the top of the dunes fawn and dag held hands and strolled on though after the fish with the teeth fawn put her shoes back on and kept her feet safely to the damp sand you just never could tell about bos stories fawn glanced up to find dags brows had pinched again she thought of shaking him out of his abstraction or making him wade in the water to wake up or something instead she simply asked whats weighing so heavy on your mind he pressed her hand smiled too briefly too much its all a tangle in my head start somewhere doesnt matter which end whatever had bit him was still gnawing that was plain he shook his head but drew a long breath so he wasnt going to go all surlyquiet anyhow my healing work for one i saved two fellows in the cave if thered been three or more hurt that bad the rest would have died all the same how can i set myself up as a medicine maker for farmers when i know itd be a cruel false promise for all but the firstcomers even lakewalker medicine makers have helpers fawn pointed out he frowned thoughtfully i sure do understand now why they leave as much to heal on its own as they can twos still more than none and most days they wouldnt come in mobs like that but on days they did it could sure get ugly his frown did not lift there were other problems came clear to me at the cave ones i hadnt thought of justice for one how can lakewalkers and farmers live together if they have to have separate justice because theres bound to be clashes thats what justice is all about dealing with clashes folks cant settle for themselves now it was fawns turn to say hm crane said he hesitated you shouldnt let cranes lies get under your skin isnt his lies that bother me its his truths did he tell any a few you are what you eat for one fawn sucked her lower lip all folks learn from the folks around them good behavior and bad behavior both you cant hardly help it he ducked his head lakewalkers tend to think themselves above that when theyre amongst farmers takes em by surprise to be taught anything it does he added after a moment it did me leastways but the other thing he said sudden silence now were getting down to it mm about lakewalkers rising to the top one way or another whether they want to or not that im afraid ive seen on her own boat berry defers to me fawn wrinkled her nose in doubt youre also a man near three times her age she pointed out youd be a leader amongst lakewalkers you wouldnt expect to be less a leader amongst farmers amongst lakewalkers there would be others to keep me in line wellwain didnt defer so easy for one oh yeah wain i sure settled him down didnt i his hand waved and clenched in a gesture of disgustor selfdisgust umbefore the attack you mean when the boat bosses were all arguing you spotted that did you yes i persuaded him what barr tried to do to berry but was too clumsy to bring off his face seemed to set in a permanent grimace contemplating this though at least i didnt leave him beguiled it was an emergency fawn offered there will always be another emergency along how long before a need becomes a habit becomes a corruption lordship comes too easy for some and it was lordship near slew the world his stride scrunching through the sand had lengthened fawn quickened her steps to keep up he continued unless we keep separate lives did we come all this way down that long river just to find out the folks we were arguing with back at hickory lake were right all along slow down dag fawn panted he stopped she gripped his sleeve and turned him to face her looking up into his troubled gold eyes if thats the truth then that is what we came all this way to find yes and well need to face it square but i cant believe its a truth so solid that theres no cracks at all with space left for us to fit in as long as malices exist then the patrol must be maintained and everything that backs it nobodys arguing with that but making farmers less ignorant and lakewalkers less obnoxious doesnt have to mean turning the whole world tail over teakettle you made a good start on the way down here i thought yeah he dug his toe in the sand bent scooped up a smoothed rock lying there swung back and flung it out over the waves it vanished with a faint plop i made a start like throwing a rock into this sea i could stand here and throw for years and never make a difference you could tell fawn straightened her spine and scowled up at him youre not fretting because you couldnt keep your promise to show me the sea youre fretting because somewhere in that murky head of yours you were hoping to have the whole problem solved by now and hand it to me tied up in a bow for my birthday present his long silence after that broke in a rueful chuckle oh spark im afraid so i should have thought a patroller would be more patient he snorted you should have met me at age nineteen i was going to save the whole world that year i was patience and exhaustion turn out to have a lot in common well then you ought to be real patient right now he laughed out loud a real laugh finally and hugged her in tight you would think so wouldnt you they turned around and started walking back toward the distant carcass fawn was pleased to see that barr and remo had finally taken their boots off and were wading around in the surf with hawthorn even if they were only washing up after the fishbutchery but there was a suspicious amount of splashing going on for such a practical purpose they collected the boys and their prizesfawn was fascinated to handle the sculpted teeth with their strange serrated edges once the blood and smelly gristly bits had been cleaned offand made their way back to their cache where the men built a driftwood fire hawthorn made dag light it while he watched closely venting hoots of delight fawn was grateful for the orange heat on her face because the breeze was still chilly and damp even the patrollers thought the colors licking up around the bleached woodblues greens spurts of deep redwere magical at length berry and whit came back only now they walked up the wet sand not just side by side but holding hands tightly as they came near fawn saw that berry looked wistful and whit looked sappy she and dag sharing a blanket like a cloak glanced at each other and grinned in recognition as the pair came up to the fire dag leaned back eyes crinkling and called congratulations whit looked faintly horrified lakewalkers sighed berry dag fawn poked him in reproof at least let them say it for themselves well um said whit berry scraped a strand of seablown hair out of her eyes whits asked me to marry him and she said yes put in whit in a tone of wonder it made the ensuing picnic properly celebratory to be sure hawthorn was quite taken with the notion that he would now have a tentbrother in the lakewalker style whit glanced at hawthorn glanced at dag and looked quite thoughtful all of a sudden later handing around the food fawn murmured to whit good work but you sure took a chance you were real lucky to bring it off so soon he whispered back well you said i ought to wait till i was as far from that cave as it was possible to get he stared out at the gleaming sea you cant get any farther than this they ate drank restedin some cases nappedand watched the repeating miracle of the waves and the turning of the tide the sun sloped down to the west lighting distant clouds that towered peach and blue above the lavender horizon making fawn think of the tales of the great shining cities of the lost lake league on a drowned shore halfway across the continent on a lake so wide you could not see across so it had to be something like this i should like to see that lake someday dag was asleep with his head on her lap when a white speck out to sea resolved into a familiar sail distant figures waved at them from the deck as the fishing boat rode the tide and breeze into the estuarys mouth she awoke him with a kiss and they packed up and climbed the line of dunes to meet it at their landing place at the top whit turned to walk backward then stopped this is the end of the world all right i once said i would follow dag to the end of the world well here we are whit continued sure is impressive but just too big i think the river will be enough water for me from now on he smiled at his river lady and tried to steal a kiss thwarted because she gave him one first hawthorn only wrinkled his nose a little the fetch wont go upstream berry reminded him well be walking home and all uphill too said whit making a wry face thatll be one long walk said remo to which barr added yeah i need to get me some new boots fawn turned from the sea to look out over the flat marsh fading into immense hidden distances and felt dizzy for a moment imagining the wide green world tilting up before her feet you know whit it all depends which way youre facing this way around it looks to me more like the worlds beginning dags grip on her hand tightened convulsively though he said nothing together they all slid down the slope of sand to meet the boat authors note feeling that my memories of houseboating on the ohio river in my youth werent quite enough to support my tale i turned with great reading pleasure to additional sources i quickly found that while material on steamboating ran the length of the mississippi the earlier era of keelboats flatboats and muscle power was much less widely documented especially worth sharing with the reader curious for more are the keelboat age on western waters by ld baldwin old times on the upper mississippi the recollections of a steamboat pilot from to by george byron merrick arafting on the mississip by charles edward russell a narrative of the life of david crockett by himself bison books facsimile reprint and rather a prize because it was only printed in a limited edition of copies the adventures of tc collinsboatman twentyfour years on the western waters compiled and edited by herbert l roush sr the merrick the russell the crockett and the collins were all authentic firsthand accounts immensely valuable for the kind of detail that cannot be found in general histories i owe russell for whits memorable phrase when falling in love at first sight with a great river because i could not sum up those feelings any more perfectly and crockett not only for the flatboatsinking incident for inspiration for the charming character of ford chicoryhimself i heartily recommend this autobiography which seems to have been penned as an early political memoir its politics have been pared away by time but its personal aspects remain riveting to this day
