ian rankin let it bleed introduction i first heard the rolling stones album let it bleed when i was only ten or eleven years old i didnt like the music at that age i was listening to marc bolan and not much else it was my sisters boyfriend who was the stones fan i did find the lyrics intriguing however even though i barely understood the references i could tell that there was something dirty about them they hinted at sex debauchery violence and drugs there was even one song midnight rambler which seemed to be about a reallife serial killer i eventually had to buy the album for myself by this time however i was in my twenties and had already written a couple of books i was also working as a music journalist and hifi equipment reviewer in london let it bleed with its fantastic studio sound soon became a constant on my linn sondek and when the time came in to write the seventh john rebus novel i felt emboldened to borrow the albums title though the book is set in the depths of an edinburgh winter it was written at my house in southwest france mostly in blazing summer heat id long since given up the hifi job but still used the linn record deck im not sure now if working on the book provided me with some sort of internal airconditioning but one thing i knew was that during any cold snap in edinburgh you would want your central heating to be working hence the pun in the title what rebus really needs to bleed in the book is a radiator for a little while in the s i became convinced that in order to make a decent amount of money i would have to transfer my skills to television i had already made several attempts at scripts for the established cop show the bill at meetings with the production team i learned that each bill script had to contain three scenarios and that none of the action could involve the cops private lives or show them offduty somehow i couldnt stick to this formula at around the same time television had shown some interest in rebus i attended more meetings this time with the bbc and tried writing a few scripts both adaptations and original stories but seemed to hit a series of walls eventually i started pitching nonrebus ideas at my tv contacts but still to no avail all of which however may go some way towards explaining the slambang action opening of let it bleed its still something id love to see on the big screen done hollywoodstyle a nighttime car chase in a blizzard with the forth road bridge beckoning fantastic let it bleed was a political novel in that it used local and national politics for much of its plotting by this time i had a reallife detective on my side a fan of the books who had pointed out various procedural errors in previous stories and with a few published novels under my belt i was a known commodity in edinburgh so could approach complete strangers council officials for example with a view to aiding my research on my trips back to edinburgh for let it bleed i slept on a friends sofa asked a lot of questions at the reception desks of various government agencies and bought a few lunches and rounds of drinks in some ways the new book would be a return to the edinburgh of my second novel hide seek both stories are concerned with the changing face of edinburgh its attempts to embrace new employment opportunities meaning new technologies while still retaining a sense of identity structural change to scotlands capital was already under way there was a plan for one of the breweries to open a theme park near the palace of holyrood eventually the site would house our dynamic earth and the scottish parliament instead but at the time i was filled with a sense of glee a theme park built on booze well why not several city landmarks including the usher hall had been built with cash from brewing dynasties the least we could do in the late twentieth century was celebrate our national relationship with alcohol hence the use of a favourite martin amis line at the very start of the book without women life is a pub while there is an abundance of action in let it bleed it is also to my mind rather a soulful book we are allowed access to rebuss thoughts as never before we learn why he likes music and why he turns so frequently to the bottle memories from his childhood are revealed adding to our sense of him as a threedimensional human being the book contains some of my favourite scenes and images for example rebuss visit to a drystane dyker or his invitation to a perthshire shooting party and ends with a few loose ends left straggling those loose ends seemed realistic to me but irritated my american publishers to such an extent that they asked me to consider contributing an extra final chapter for us publication this i eventually did though i didnt feel it added anything to the sum of the book which is why its not being reprinted here between times some old friends return to the series rebuss daughter sammy his exlover gill the reporter mairie henderson this plus the fact that rebus is back in his old flat having jettisoned the students hed been renting the place to gives the book a solid comfortable feel by now i was confident in my ability to write a decent crime story and to recreate rebuss world which probably explains why i would be at pains to make my next book so different providing me with a fresh set of challenges but for now i was happy i knew the inside of rebuss head and he was happy too happy with his booze cigarettes and music after a drink he liked to listen to the stones women relationships and colleagues had come and gone but the stones had always been there he put the album on and poured himself a last drink the guitar riff one of easily half a dozen in keiths tireless repertoire kicked the album off i dont have much rebus thought but i have this on the album let it bleed theres a song about the boston strangler mick jagger had written about a reallife crime and what was good enough for mick was surely good enough for me as my next novel would demonstrate may avarice the spur of industry david hume of civil liberty the more sophisticated readers simply repeated the italian proverb if it isnt true its to the point muriel spark the public image without women life is a pub martin amis money one bridges a winter night screaming out of edinburgh the front car was being chased by three others in the chasing cars were police officers sleet was falling through the darkness blowing horizontally in the second of the police cars inspector john rebus had his teeth bared he gripped the doorhandle with one hand and the front edge of his passenger seat with the other in the drivers seat chief inspector frank lauderdale seemed to have shed about thirty years he was a youth again enjoying the feeling of power which came from driving fast driving a wee bit crazy he sat well forward peering through the windscreen well get them he yelled for the umpteenth time well get the bastards rebus couldnt unlock his jaw long enough to form a reply it wasnt that lauderdale was a bad driver well ok it wasnt just that lauderdale was a bad driver the weather bothered rebus too when theyd taken the second roundabout at the barnton interchange rebus had felt the cars back wheels losing all grip on the slick road surface the tyres werent brand new to start with probably retreads at that the air temperature was near zero the sleet lying treacherously in wait they were out of the city now leaving traffic lights and junctions behind a car chase here should be safer but rebus didnt feel safe in the car in front were two young keen uniforms with a ds and a dc in the car behind rebus looked into the wing mirror and saw headlights he looked out of the passengerside window and saw nothing christ it was dark out there rebus thought i dont want to die in the dark a telephone conversation the previous day ten grand and we let your daughter go the father licked his lips ten thats a lot of money not to you wait let me think the father looked at the pad where john rebus had just scribbled something its short notice he told the caller rebus was listening on an earpiece staring at the tape recorders silently turning spools that attitude could get her hurt no please then youd better get the money youll bring her with you were not cheats mister shell be there if the money is where well phone tonight with details one last thing no police understand any sign even a distant siren and next time you see herll be the coop funeral parlour well get them lauderdale shouted rebus felt his jaw unlock all right well get them so why not ease off lauderdale glanced at him and grinned lost your bottle john then he jerked the wheel and pulled out to overtake a transit van the phone caller had sounded young workingclass in his mouth understand had become unnerstaun hed spoken of the coop hed used the word mister young working class maybe a bit naive rebus just wasnt sure fife police are waiting the other side of the bridge right he persisted shouting above the engine whine lauderdale had the poor gearbox pounding away in third right lauderdale agreed then whats our hurry dont be soft john theyre ours rebus knew what his superior meant if the front car made it over the forth road bridge then it was in fife and fife constabulary were waiting a roadblock erected it would be a fife collar lauderdale was on the radio talking to the car ahead his onehanded driving was only a little worse than his twohanded shaking rebus from side to side lauderdale put the radio down again what do you reckon he said will they come off at queensferry i dont know rebus said well those two lplates in front think well catch them at the toll booths if they decide to go all the way they probably would go all the way too driven by fear and adrenaline the combination tended to put blinkers on your survival mechanism you ran straight ahead without thought or deviation all you knew was flight you could at least put on your seatbelt rebus said i could said lauderdale but he didnt boy racers didnt wear seatbelts the final sliproad was coming up the front car sped past it there was nowhere to go now but the bridge the roadlighting high overhead grew thick again as they neared the toll booths rebus had a crazy notion of the fugitives stopping to pay their toll just like everyone else winding down the window fumbling for the coins theyre slowing the road was spreading out suddenly half a dozen lanes wide ahead of them stood the row of toll booths and beyond that the bridge itself curving up towards its midpoint as the steel coils held its carriageway in suspension so that even on a clear bright day you couldnt see the far end when you drove on to it theyre definitely slowing only yards separated the four cars now and rebus could see for the first time in a while the back of the car they were chasing it was a yregistration ford cortina the overhead lighting allowed him to make out two heads driver and passenger both male maybe shes in the boot he said dubiously maybe lauderdale agreed if shes not in the car with them they cant harm her lauderdale nodded not really listening then reached for the radio again there was a lot of interference if they go on to the bridge he said thats it dead end theres no way off for them unless the fifers fuck up so we stay here rebus suggested lauderdale just laughed thought not said rebus but now something was happening the suspects car red taillights were they braking no reversing and at speed they hit the front police car with force sending it shunting into lauderdales bastards then the front car was off again veering crazily it headed for one of the closed booths hitting the barrier not snapping it off but bending it enough to squeeze through the sound of metal sparking against metal and then they were gone rebus couldnt believe it theyre on the wrong carriageway and so they were whether by accident or design picking up speed the car was racing north along the southbound lanes its headlights switched to full beam the front police car hesitated then followed lauderdale looked ready to do the same thing but rebus reached out a hand and tugged with all his might on the steeringwheel bringing them back into the northbound lane stupid bastard lauderdale spat slamming the accelerator hard it was late night not much traffic about even so the driver of the front car was taking some risk theyll only have this carriageway blocked wont they rebus pointed out if those lunatics make it to the other side they could get away lauderdale didnt say anything he was looking across the central reservation keeping the other two cars in sight when he reached out for the radio he all but lost control the car jolted right then harder to the left slamming the metal siderails rebus didnt want to think about the firth of forth hundreds of feet below but he thought of it anyway hed walked across the bridge a couple of times using the footpaths either side of the roadways that had been scary enough the everpresent wind threatening to gust you over the side he felt a charge in his toes a fear of heights on the other carriageway the inevitable was happening the incredible just about to begin an articulated lorry up to speed after a crawl to the top of the rise saw headlights ahead of it where no headlights should be the suspects car had already squeezed past two oncoming cars and would have slipped into the outside lane to pass the artic but the artics driver panicked he pulled into the outside lane and his hands froze foot still hard on the accelerator the truck hit metal and started to rise it went up into the air hanging over the central reservation which was itself a network of steel lines the trailer snagged and the cab snapped forward breaking free of its container and sailing into the northbound lanes sliding on sparks and a spray of water directly into the path of the car in which lauderdale and rebus were travelling lauderdale did his best to hit the brakes but there was nowhere to go the cab was sliding diagonally taking up both lanes nowhere to go rebus had a couple of seconds to take it in he felt his whole being contract everything trying to be where his scrotum was he pulled his knees up feet and hands against the dashboard tucking his head against his legs whump with his eyes screwed shut all rebus had to go on were noises and feeling something punched him in the cheekbone then was gone there was a shattering of glass like ice cracking and the sound of metal being tortured his gut told him the car was travelling backwards there were other sounds too further away more metal more glass the artic cab had lost a lot of its momentum and contact with the car stopped it dead rebus thought his spine would crack whiplash did they call it more like bricklash slablash the car stopped and the first thing he realised was that his jaw hurt he looked over to the drivers seat reckoning lauderdale had landed one on him for some unspecified reason and saw that his superior wasnt there any more well his arse was there staring rebus in the face from its unpromising position where the windscreen used to be lauderdales feet were tucked beneath the steeringwheel one of his shoes had come off his legs were draped over the steeringwheel itself as for the rest of him that was lying on what was left of the bonnet frank rebus cried frank he knew better than to pull lauderdale back into the car knew better than to touch him at all he tried opening his door but it wasnt a door any more so he undid his seatbelt and squeezed out through the windscreen his hand touched metal and he felt a sizzling sensation cursing and drawing his hand away he saw hed placed it on a section of uncovered engineblock cars were pulling to a stop behind him the ds and dc were running forwards frank rebus said quietly he looked at lauderdales face bloody but still alive yes he was sure lauderdale was alive there was just something he wasnt moving you couldnt even be sure he was breathing but there was something some unseen energy which hadnt departed not yet at any rate you all right someone asked help him rebus ordered get an ambulance and check the lorrycab see how the driver is then he looked across to the other carriageway and what he saw froze him he couldnt be sure at first not totally so he climbed up on to the metal spars separating the two carriageways and then he was sure the suspects car had left the carriageway left it altogether theyd somehow vaulted the crashbarrier slid across the pedestrian walkway and had enough velocity left to send them through the final set of railings the ones separating the walkway from that drop to the firth of forth a wind was whipping around rebus blowing the sleet into his eyes he narrowed them and looked again the cortina was still there hanging out into space its front wheels through the rails but its back wheels and boot still on the walkway he thought of what might be in the boot oh my god he said then he started to clamber over the thick metal tines what are you doing someone yelled come back but rebus kept moving only barely aware of the drop beneath him the amounts of space between each metal bar and its neighbour more space than metal the cold metal felt good against his stinging palm he passed the back of the lorry it had come to rest on its side half on the roadway half resting on the central gap there was a sign on its side byars haulage jesus it was cold that wind that damned eternal wind yet he could feel he was sweating i should be wearing a coat he thought ill catch my death then he was on the carriageway where a line of cars had come to an untidy stop there was a proper gap between carriageway and walkway a short distance but all of it fresh air where the cortina had made contact it had buckled the rails rebus stepped on to them then made the short leap on to the walkway the two teenagers had stumbled from their car theyd had to climb over their seats and into the back in order to get out the front doors led only to a fall they were looking to left and right seized by fright there were sirens to the north fife police were on their way rebus held up his hands the two uniformed officers were behind him the youths werent looking at rebus all they could see were uniforms they understood simple things they understood what uniforms meant they looked around again looking for an escape that wasnt there then one of them fairhaired tall slightly olderlooking gripped the younger ones hand and started leading him backwards dont do anything daft sons said one of the uniforms but they were just words nobody was listening the two teenagers were against the rails now only ten feet or so from the crashed car rebus walked slowly forwards pointing with his finger making it clear to them that he was going to the car the impact had caused the boot to spring open an inch rebus carefully lifted it and looked in there was nobody inside as he closed the boot the car rocked on its fulcrum then came to rest again he looked towards the older of the boys its freezing out here he said lets get you into a car then things happened in slow motion the fairhaired boy shook his head almost smiling and placed his arms around his friend in what looked like nothing less than an embrace then he leaned back against the rail and just kept leaning taking his friend with him there was no resistance their cheap trainers held against the road surface for a second then slipped legs flicking up and over as they fell into the darkness maybe it was suicide maybe flight rebus thought later whatever it was meant to be it was death for sure when you hit water from that height it was like hitting concrete a fall like that through the dark and they didnt scream didnt utter a sound and couldnt see the water rising to meet them only they didnt hit water a royal navy frigate had just left rosyth dockyard and was gliding out towards the sea and thats what they hit embedding themselves in the metal deck which as everyone said back at the station saved the police frogmen from a thankless subzero dip they took rebus to the royal infirmary he travelled in the back of a police car frank lauderdale was being brought by ambulance nobody knew yet how bad his injuries were the frigate had been contacted by radio from rosyth but the crew had already found the bodies some had heard them hitting the deck the frigate was returning to base it would take a while to hammer the deck back into shape i feel like ive been hit with a hammer myself rebus told the nurse at the infirmary he knew her shed treated him for burns a while back rubbed lotion on and changed the dressings she smiled as she left the little booth where he lay on an examining table when shed gone rebus took another account of himself his jaw hurt where lauderdales fist had connected prior to flying through the windscreen the pain seemed to be burrowing deep like it was getting into the nerves of his teeth otherwise he didnt feel too bad just shaken he lifted his hands and held them in front of him yes he could always blame the trembling on the crash even if he knew he trembled a lot these days smash or no smash his palm was blistering nicely before putting on a dressing the nurse had asked how he got the burn put my hand on a hot engine hed explained figures rebus looked and saw what she meant part of the engines serial number had been branded on his flesh the doctor finally put in an appearance it was a busy night rebus knew the doctor his name was george klasser and he was polish or something or at least his parents were rebus had always assumed klasser was a bit too senior to do the night shift yet here he was bitter outside isnt it dr klasser said is that supposed to be funny just making conversation john how do you feel i think im getting toothache anything else dr klasser was fussing with the tools of his trade penlight and stethoscope a clipboard and nonworking biro eventually he was ready to examine the patient rebus didnt put up much of a fight he was thinking of drinking the creamy almost gasfree head on a pint of eightybob the warming aroma from a glass of malt hows my chief inspector rebus asked when the nurse returned theyre taking xrays she told him car chases at your age dr klasser muttered i blame television rebus took a good look at him and realised he hadnt ever really looked at the man before not properly klasser was in his early forties steelhaired with a tanned and prematurely ageing face if you only had head and shoulders to go on youd guess he was taller than was actually the case he looked quite distinguished which was why rebus had pegged him for a senior consultant something like that i thought only lackeys and lplates worked nights rebus commented while klasser shone a light in his eyes klasser put down the light and started to squeeze rebuss back prodding it like he was plumping up a cushion any pain there no what about there no more than usual hmm in answer to your question john i notice youre working nights does that make you lackey or lplate that hurts dr klasser smiled so rebus said easing his shirt back on whatve i got klasser found a pen that worked and scribbled something on his clipboard by my estimate the way youre going youve got a year maybe two the two men stared at one another rebus knew precisely what the doctor was talking about im serious john you smoke you drink like a fish and you dont exercise since patience stopped feeding you your diets gone to hell starch and carbohydrate saturated fat rebus tried to stop listening he knew his drinking was a problem these days precisely because hed learned selfcontrol as a result few people noticed that he had a problem he was well dressed at work alert when the occasion demanded and even visited the gym some lunchtimes he ate lazily and maybe too much and yes he was back on the cigs but then nobody was perfect an uncanny prognosis doctor he finished buttoning his shirt started tucking it into his waistband then thought better of it he felt more comfortable with the shirt outside his trousers he knew hed feel even more comfortable with his trouser button undone and you can tell that just by prodding my back dr klasser smiled again he was folding up his stethoscope you cant hide that sort of thing from a doctor john rebus eased into his jacket so he said see you in the pub later ill be there around six fine rebus walked out of the hospital and took a deep breath it was twothirty in the morning about as cold and dark as the night could get he thought about checking on lauderdale but knew it could wait till morning his flat was just across the meadows but he didnt fancy the walk the sleet was still falling beginning to turn to snow and there was that stabbing wind like a thug you meet in a narrow lane one who wont let you go then a car horn sounded rebus saw a cherryred renault and inside it dc siobhan clarke waving towards him he almost danced to the car what are you doing here i heard she said how come he opened the passengerside door i was curious i wasnt on shift but i kept in touch with the station just to find out what happened at the meet when i heard about the crash i got dressed and came down here well youre a sight for sore teeth teeth rebus rubbed his jaw sounds crazy but i think that dunt has given me toothache she started the car it was lovely and warm rebus could feel himself drifting off bit of a disaster then she said a bit they turned out of the gates heading left towards tollcross hows the ci i dont know theyre xraying him where are we going im taking you home i should go back to the station she shook her head i called in they dont want you till morning rebus relaxed a little more maybe the painkillers were kicking in whens the postmortem ninethirty they were on lauriston place there was a shortcut you could have taken back there rebus told her it was a oneway street yes but nobody uses it this time of night he realised what hed said jesus he whispered rubbing his eyes so what was it siobhan clarke asked i mean was it an accident or were they looking to escape neither rebus said quietly if id to put money on it id say suicide she looked at him both of them he shrugged then shivered at the tollcross lights they waited in silence until red turned to green a couple of drunks were walking home bodies tilted into the wind horrible night clarke said moving off rebus nodded saying nothing will you attend the postmortem yes cant say id fancy it do we know who they were yet not that i know of i keep forgetting youre offduty thats right im offduty what about the car have we traced that she turned towards him and laughed it sounded odd to him there in that stuffy overheated car that time of night with all that had gone before sudden laughter as strange a sound as youd ever hear he rubbed his jaw and pushed an exploratory finger into his mouth the teeth he touched seemed solid enough then he saw feet suddenly sweeping out from under two young bodies the bodies leaning back into space and disappearing they hadnt made a sound no accident no escape attempt something fatalistic something agreed between them cold no he said im not cold she signalled to turn off melville drive to the left what he could see of the meadows was covered in a fresh glaze of slow to the right was marchmont and rebuss flat she wasnt in the car he said flatly there was always that possibility siobhan clarke said we dont even know shes missing not for a fact no he agreed we dont just two daft laddies shed picked up the expression but it sounded awkward given her english accent rebus smiled in the dark and then he was home she dropped him outside his tenement door and refused a halfhearted offer of coffee rebus didnt want her to see the dump he called home the students had moved out in october leaving the place not quite his there were things not quite right not quite the way he remembered cutlery was missing and had been replaced with stuff he hadnt seen before it was the same with the crockery when hed moved back here from patiences hed brought his stuff back in boxes most of the boxes were in the hall still waiting to be unpacked exhausted he climbed the stairs opened his door and walked past the boxes making straight for the living room and his chair his chair was much the same as ever it had remoulded itself quickly to his shape he sat down then got up again and checked the radiator the thing was barely warm and there was a racking noise from within he needed a special key some tool that would open the valve and let it bleed the other radiators were the same he made himself a hot drink put a tape into the cassette deck and got the duvet off his bed back at his chair he took off some of his clothes and covered himself with the duvet he reached down unscrewed the top from a bottle of macallan and poured some into his coffee he drank the first half of the mug then added more whisky he could hear car engines and metal twisting and the wind whistling all around he could see feet the soles of cheap trainers something close to a smile on the lips of a fairhaired teenager but then the smile became darkness and everything disappeared slowly he hugged himself to sleep down at the city mortuary in the cowgate dr curt was nowhere to be seen but professor gates was already at work you know he said you can fall from any height you want its just that last damned halfinch thats fatal with him around the slab were inspector john rebus detective sergeant brian holmes another doctor and a pathology assistant the preliminary notification of sudden death had already been submitted to the procuratorfiscal and now the sudden death report was being prepared on two deceased males probable identities william david coyle and james dixon taylor james taylor rebus looked at the mess over which professor gates was fussing and remembered that final embrace aint it good to know that youve got a friend the force of the impact of the bodies upon the steel deck of her majestys naval frigate descant had turned them from human beings into something more like hairy jam there was some on the slab the rest sat in gleaming steel buckets no next of kin was going to be asked to participate in a formal identification it was the sort of thing they could just about accomplish by dnatesting if such proved necessary flatpacks we call them professor gates said saw a lot at lockerbie scraped them off the ground and took them to the local ice rink handy place an ice rink when you suddenly find yourself with two hundred and seventy bodies brian holmes had seen bad deaths before but he was not immune he kept shuffling his feet and shifting his shoulders and glaring with hard judgmental eyes at rebus who was humming scraps of youre so vain establishing time date and place of death was straightforward certified cause of death was easy too though professor gates wasnt sure of the precise wording blunt force trauma how about boating accident rebus offered there were some smiles at that like most pathologists professor alexander gates md frc path dmj path frcpe mrcpg was possessed of a sense of humour as wide as his letterheading a quite necessary sense of humour he didnt look like a pathologist he wasnt tall and cadaverously grey like dr curt but was a bossy shuffling figure with the physique of a wrestler rather than an undertaker he was broadchested bullnecked and had pudgy hands the fingers of which he delighted in cracking one at a time or all together he liked people to call him sandy im the one issuing the death certificate he told brian holmes who filled in the relevant box on the roughup sudden death report my address care of police surgeoncy cowgate rebus and the others watched as gates made his examination he was able to confirm the existence of two separate corpses samples were taken of veinous blood for grouping dna toxicology and alcohol usually urine samples would be taken also but that just wasnt possible and gates was even doubtful about the efficacy of blood testing vitreous humour and stomach contents were next along with bile and liver before their eyes he started to reconstruct the bodies not so they became identifiable as humans not entirely but just so he could be satisfied he had everything the bodies had once had nothing missing and nothing extraneous i used to love jigsaws when i was a youngster the pathologist said quietly bent over his task outside it was a dry freezing day rebus remembered liking jigsaws too he wondered if kids still played with them the postmortem over he stood on the pavement and smoked a cigarette there were pubs to left and right of him but none were yet open his breakfast tot of whisky had all but evaporated brian holmes came out of the mortuary stuffing a green cardboard file into his briefcase he saw rebus rubbing at his jaw you all right toothache thats all it was too it was definitely toothache or at least gumache he couldnt positively identify any one tooth as the culprit the pain was just there swelling below the surface give you a lift thanks brian but ive got my car holmes nodded and tugged up his collar his chin was tucked into a blue lambswool scarf the bridge is open again he said one lane southbound what about the cortina howdenhall have it theyre fingerprinting just in case she ever was in the car rebus nodded saying nothing holmes said nothing back something i can do for you brian no not really i was just wondering werent you supposed to be at the station first thing so so why come here instead it was a good question rebus looked back at the mortuary doors remembering the scene all over again the artic assuming the crash position lauderdale spread across the bonnet then seeing the other car a final embrace a fall he shrugged noncommittally and made for his car chief inspector frank lauderdale was going to be all right that was the good news the bad news was that di alister flower was looking for temporary promotion to fill lauderdales shoes and with the funeral meats not yet cold said chief superintendent farmer watson he blushed realising what hed said not that theres i mean no funeral or he coughed into his bunched fist flowers got a point though sir said rebus covering his bosss embarrassment its just that hes got the tact of a tomcat i mean somebodyll have to fill in how longs frank going to be out of the game we dont know the farmer picked up a sheet of paper and read from it both legs broken two broken ribs broken wrist concussion theres half a page of diagnosis here rebus rubbed his bruised cheekbone wondering if it was responsible for the broken wrist we dont even know the farmer went on quietly whether hell walk again the breaks were pretty severe meantime the last thing i need is flower and you vying for any temporary promotion it may or may not be in my power to give understood good the farmer paused so what can you tell me about last night itll be in my report sir of course it will but id prefer the truth what was frank playing at how do you mean i mean driving around like the dukes of hazzard weve got expendables for that sort of escapade we were just maintaining a pursuit sir of course you were watson studied rebus nothing youd like to add to that not much sir except that it was no accident and theyd no intention of getting away it was a suicide pact unspoken but suicide all the same and why would they do that ive no idea sir the farmer sighed and sat back in his chair john i think you should know my feelings on all of this yes sir it was an utter ballsup from start to finish and that was putting it mildly they were only there because of power because of influence because a favour was asked that was how it had started with a discreet call from the citys lord provost to the deputy chief constable of lothian and borders police requesting that his daughters disappearance be investigated not that anything unlawful was hinted at it wasnt that shed been abducted assaulted murdered nothing like that it was just that shed walked out of the house one morning and not come back yes shed left a note it was addressed to her father and the message was simple arseholes im off it was unsigned but was in the daughters handwriting had there been a disagreement an argument strong words well it was impossible to have a teenager in the house without the occasional difference of view and how old was the lord provosts daughter little kirstie kennedy there came the crux she was seventeen and a mature welleducated seventeen at that well able to look after herself and old enough legally to leave home any time she wished which should have taken the matter out of the polices hands except except that it was the lord provost asking the right honourable cameron mcleod kennedy jp councillor for south gyle so the message filtered down from the dcc take a look for kirstie kennedy but keep it quiet which was everyone agreed next to impossible you didnt ask questions on the street without rumours starting people fearing the worst for the subject of your questions this was the excuse given when the media got hold of the story there was a photograph of the daughter a photo police had been given and which somehow the media got their paws on the lord provost was furious about that it proved to him that he had enemies within the force as rebus could have told him if you went demanding a favour someone down the line could come to resent it so there she was on tv and in the papers little kirstie kennedy not a very recent photo maybe two or three years out of date and the difference between fourteen or fifteen and seventeen was crucial rebus father of a onetime teenage daughter knew that kirstie was grown up now and the photo would be next to useless in helping trace her the lord provost quietened the media hubbub by giving a press conference his wife was with him his second wife not kirsties mother kirsties mother was dead and she was asked what shed like to say to the runaway id just like her to know were praying for her thats all and then came the first phone call it wasnt hard to phone the lord provost he was in the phone book plus his appointments number was listed alongside every other councillor in a useful pamphlet handed out to tens of thousands of edinburgh residents the caller sounded young a voice not long broken he hadnt given a name all hed said was that he had kirstie and that he wanted money for her return hed even put a girl on the phone shed squealed a couple of words before being pulled away the words had been dad and i the lord provost couldnt be sure it was kirstie but he couldnt not be sure either he wanted the polices help again and they told him to set up a drop with the kidnappers only there wouldnt be money waiting for them thered be police officers and plenty of them the intention wasnt to confront but to tail a police helicopter was brought into play along with four unmarked cars it should have been easy it should have been but the caller had selected as drop zone a bus stop on the busy queensferry road lots of fastmoving traffic and nowhere to stop an unmarked car inconspicuously the caller had been clever when it came time for the pickup the cortina had stopped on the other side of the road from the bus stop the passenger had come hurtling across the road dodging traffic picked up the bag full of wads of newspaper and taken it back to the waiting car three of the police cars were facing the wrong way and it took a devil of a time to turn them round but the fourth had radioed back with the suspect cars whereabouts the helicopter of course had been grounded earlier the weather being impossible all of which left lauderdale officer in charge furiously gunning his car to catch up with the race and shedding years in the process rebus hoped it had been worth it he hoped lauderdale lying strapped up in hospital would get a thrill from remembering the chase all it had given rebus were a sick feeling in the gut a bad dream and this damned sore face there was a collection going around to buy something for the chief inspector pointedly and all too quickly di alister flower put in a tenner he was walking around with his chest stuck out and a greasepaint smile on his face rebus loathed him more than ever everybody kept looking at rebus wondering if hed be promoted over flower wondering what rebus would do if flower suddenly became his boss the rumours piled up faster than the collection money it wasnt even close rebus was not alone in reckoning the kidnapping for a hoax theyd know for sure very soon now that they had traced the car located its owner discovered that hed loaned it to two friends and gone to those friends shared house only to find nobody home the car owner was downstairs in an interview room they were telling him that if he was straight with them theyd forget about the cars lack of proper insurance he was telling them story after story the life and times of willie coyle and dixie taylor rebus went down to listen for a while ds macari and dc allder were doing the interview detective inspector rebus enters twelvefifteen hours macari said for the benefit of the tape recorder so he said to the seated youth how did they make out willie and dixie both on the broo but you can always supplement the broo eh rebus stood against the wall trying to appear casual he even smiled towards the car owner nodded to let him know everything was all right the car owner was in his late teens presentable enough neatly dressed and groomed he wore a discreet silverloop earring in his right ear but no other jewellery not even a watch they got along he said like the dole moneys no bad even social security you can live on it if youre careful and they were careful macari paused mr duggan nods his head this again for the tape recorder so why would they pull a stunt like this duggan shook his head i wish i knew i never got an inkling willied never asked for a loan of the car before he said he had something to shift what sort of thing he didnt say but you loaned him the car anyway like i say willies the careful sort and dixie duggan gave the hint of a smile well dixies different he needed looking after what was he soft in the head like no he was just laid back he didnt it was hard to get him interested he looked up its hard to put into words just try your best mr duggan ever since school willie and dixie had been best pals they liked the same music same comics same games they understood one another and they shared digs ever since they left home rebus liked macaris style around the station they called him toni after the character in oor wullie hed managed to get duggan relaxed and talkative hed forged a relationship rebus wasnt so sure of allder allder was one of flowers men i think so duggan was saying they were right close we had a book at school once it had two characters like them in it one daft and the other not of mice and men rebus offered i thought that was burns allder said rebus indicated to macari that he was leaving inspector rebus leaves room twelvethirty hours so mr duggan to get back to the car as ever rebus timed his exit just wrong alister flower was walking along the corridor towards him whistling dixie theres a lad in there rebus reminded him has just lost two pals one of them called dixie flower stopped whistling and barked a short unpleasant laugh mustve been my you know subconscious youve got to be conscious to have one of those rebus said moving away which sort of disqualifies you flower wasnt letting him off so easily he caught up with rebus at the double doors thingsll be different when im chief inspector he snarled yes they will rebus agreed because by then theyll have cured cancer and put a man on mars then he pushed through the doors and was gone he drove out to stenhouse it was further out of town than he remembered and nicer too quiet once you came off gorgie road twostorey semis with tidy front gardens and swept pavements some of the doorsteps looked scrubbed his mother had got down on her knees with all the other women in their culdesac a couple of times a week to scrub the step with hot soapy water or bleach a dirty front step reflected badly on the home within rebus was more used to central edinburgh tenement city the little suburbia managed to surprise him salt had been put down along the pavements and roads in summer the neighbours would be out gossiping over fences but this was winter and they were hibernating an edinburgh winter could be a real stayer starting early in october and lasting into april the days were not constant sometimes it was twilight all day other times with fresh snow on the ground the suns glare scoured your eyes people walked everywhere squinting either peering into the gloom or protecting themselves from the fierce light today was a twilight day the sky a dull maroon threatening a fall rebus stuffed his hands into his pockets and felt the small paper bag hed found an ironmongers on gorgie road and had been directed to a specialist shop where hed been sold a radiator key now he looked around found the house he was looking for and walked up to the front door afternoon sir said siobhan clarke answering his knock how are you feeling rebus pushed his way inside the house wasnt much warmer than outside in the living room brian holmes was flipping through a collection of cds anything rebus asked holmes stood up there are a few newspapers with items about the kennedy case probably gave them the idea no sign shes ever been here pretty unlikely shed run about with dossers like those two shes a gillespies girl willie and dixie were strictly comprehensive looks like a straightforward hoax sir clarke agreed rebus was looking around he turned to clarke say youre a well broughtup wee lassie good school nice lifestyle say you want to run away from home and just disappear for a while maybe for ever would you take up with people your own class or would you head downmarket where nobodyd know you and nobodyd care down to guys like willie and dixie you mean rebus shrugged im only speculating if you were to ask me id say shes done what every runner from scotland does gone to london god help her holmes said quietly so have you finished looking around no sir then dont let me stop you in fact plug that electric fire in and i might even lend a hand brian holmes searched in his pockets for coins for the electric meter then they got to work there were two bedrooms one tidy the bed made the other a mess the tidy room belonged to willie coyle as a letter from the dss lying by the bed confirmed there were books on a bookshelf most of them brand new rebus wondered which bookshop had been losing stock recently he pulled out something called trainspotting and saw that there were some sheets of paper hidden behind the row of books the sheets were stapled at one corner professionally wordprocessed with charts and graphs they seemed to comprise a business report a plan of some kind holmes looked over his superiors shoulder dont tell me willie was an entrepreneur rebus shrugged but rolled the report up and put it in his pocket in here siobhan clarke called by the time they reached her she was pulling out her haul from beneath dixie taylors bed three disposable syringes still in their wrappers a candle burnt to a nub and a dessert spoon blackened on its bottom no sign of any skag she said standing up and straightening her hair ill check beneath the other bed holmes said rebus was smiling skag he said what sort of books have you been reading then his face turned serious better call for backup give this place a thorough going over right sir when rebus was alone in the room he examined the syringes there was a fine layer of dust on the packets and little balls of fluff lay in the spoon dixie obviously hadnt used his works in some time rebus went to the bathroom checking for methodone or whatever the doctors gave you these days to wean you off but he found only flu powders paracetamol mouthwash he checked the mail again but found nothing from any hospital or rehab centre then he phoned professor gates and asked about the blood samples i havent had the results yet is there a problem possible heroin use rebus said at least by one of them i could check the bodies again i wasnt really looking for puncture marks would you find them if they were there well as you saw yourself the bodies arent exactly pristine and iv users are good at hiding their wounds theyll inject into the tongue the penis well see what you can do professor rebus put down the phone he suddenly didnt feel comfortable indoors so went to get some air he lasted thirty seconds outside then went next door and pushed the bell a middleaged woman opened the door and rebus started to show her his id i know who you are she said its a crying shame those poor wee lads come in come in her name was mrs tweedie and she kept a warm house rebus sat down on the sofa and rubbed his hands getting some feeling back into them while avoiding the burn on his palm did you know them well mrs tweedie she watched him take out his notebook and pen you dont mind do you he asked not at all but i thought i might make us a cup of tea first is that all right that was just fine with john rebus he sat there for over half an hour the room was so hot he thought he might nod off but what mrs tweedie had to say brought him wide awake nice lads the pair of them helped me home with my shopping once and wouldnt stop for a cup of tea you saw them often well i saw them coming and going did they keep regular hours i mean were they active at night i wouldnt know im not late to bed they sometimes played their music a bit loud but all i did was turn up the telly if they were having a party they always warned us in advance rebus brought out the kirstie photograph have you seen this girl before mrs tweedie gracious yes oh i saw her in the daily record rebus felt his hopes sink but never round here no never i saw their landlord often though rebus frowned i thought these houses were councilowned mrs tweedie nodded so they are rebus started to get it but its not willies and dixies names in the rent book they explained to me that they were er subsomething subletting aye thats it from the lad who had the house before them and whats his name mrs tweedie well his first names paul i dont know his second nice young lad always smartly dressed only thing i didnt like he wore one of those she tugged her ear and made a face doesnt look at all right on a man paul duggan rebus suggested she tried the name out you know she said you could be right as rebus drove out on to gorgie road he had a song in his head it was an old neil young number the needle and the damage done he stopped the car in front of the jail to collect his thoughts an access road ran from gorgie road up to the gatehouse the tall fence and the solid building behind with its massive door and large clock though not yet five oclock it was dark but the prison was well lit officially it was hm prison edinburgh but everyone knew it as saughton jail the main building looked like a victorian workhouse theyd have ended up in jail he thought to himself they knew even a hoax kidnapping was a serious offence willie coyle the taller the fairhaired of the two rebus was imagining what had gone through willies mind in those final seconds before he took the plunge dixie and he would go to jail theyd almost certainly be separated different wings if not different jails dixie would have no one to look after him rebus thought of lenny in of mice and men dixie had been an injector maybe hed been helped off helped by his friend willie but in scotlands jails there were plenty of drugs of course youd have to have something to trade and a boy dixies age always had something to trade had willie weighed up the options and had he then hugged his friend hugged him to death rebus was beginning to like willie coyle he was wishing he wasnt dead but he was they both were cold and commingled on the slab leaving not much behind except the fact that paul duggan was a very cool customer indeed rebus would be talking to paul duggan sooner rather than later but for now he had other people to see another appointment it was the one appointment hed known all day he would keep come hell or high water there was a gasfire the kind that gave out actual flames burning in what looked like the original grate and smoke too though the smoke came from cigarettes and pipes the tv was on all but drowned out by the live music as often happened on a winters evening edinburghs folk musicians managed to find themselves in the same pub at the same time they were playing in a corner three fiddles a squeezebox a bodhran and a flute the flautist was the only woman the men were bearded and ruddycheeked and wore thickknit jumpers the pints on their table were threequarters full the woman was thin and pale with long brown hair but her cheeks were bright from firelight a few customers were up dancing arms linked and birling in what space there was rebus liked to think they were just keeping warm but in fact they looked like they were having fun three more halfs and a couple of nips he told the barman and what are your friends drinking ha ha said rebus he was flanked at the bar by his drinking companions george klasser and donny dougary while klasser was known as doc dougary was called salty rebus didnt know either of them very well outside the confines of the pub but most evenings between six and halfseven they were the best of pals salty dougary was trying to be heard above the general confusion so what im saying is you can go anywhere on the superhighway anywhere and in future itll be even bigger youll do your shopping by computer youll watch telly on it play games listen to music and everything will be there i can talk to the white house if i want i can download stuff from all over the world i sit there at my desk and i can travel anywhere can you travel to the pub by computer salty a drinker further down the bar asked salty ignored him and held his thumb and forefinger a couple of inches apart hard disks the size of credit cards youll have a whole pc in the palm of your hand you shouldnt say that to a policeman salty george klasser offered causing laughter he turned to rebus hows that tooth the anaesthetic helps rebus said tipping the last of his whisky into his mouth i hope youre not mixing alcohol and painkillers would i do that salty give the man some money salty stopped talking to himself the barman was waiting so he pulled out a tenpound note watching its sad ebbing as it flowed into the till salty was called salty because of salt and sauce which were what you put on your chipshop supper the connection being chips since salty worked in an electronics factory in south gyle hed been a late arrival in silicon glen and was hoping the industry would continue to prosper six factories before this one had closed on him leaving long periods of jobless space between them he still remembered the days when money was tight i could have collected social security for scotland and watched his money accordingly he made microchips these days feeding an assembly plant on clydeside and another in gyle park west ye dancing rebus half turned to see a woman grinning toothlessly at him he thought her name was morag she was married to the man with the tartan shoelaces not tonight he said trying to look flattered you could never tell with the man with the tartan shoelaces dance with his wife and you were flirting turn her down and you were by implication snubbing him rebus rested his foot on the polished brass barrail and drank his drinks by eight oclock both doc and salty had left and an old guy in a shapeless bunnet was standing next to rebus the man had forgotten his false teeth and his cheeks were sunken he was telling rebus about american history i like it ken just american not any other kind whys that eh why just american the man licked his lips he wasnt focusing on rebus or on anything in the bar you couldnt be sure he was even focusing on the present day well he said at last i suppose its because of the westerns i love westerns hopalong cassidy john wayne i used to like hopalong cassidy could it be forever said rebus that was one of his then he finished his drink and went home the telephone was ringing rebus considered not answering resistance lasted all of ten seconds hello hello dad he flopped into his chair hello sammy where are you she paused too long still at patiences eh how are you fine hows work you really want to know just being polite fatherly he thought suddenly i should have said fatherly not polite sometimes he wished life had a rewind function well i wont bore you with the details then i take it patience is out it stood to reason sammy never called when she was home yes shes out with i mean at something shes out at something rebus smiled what you really mean is that shes out with someone im not very good at this dont blame yourself blame your genes do you want to meet not tonight im dogtired patience asked she wondered if youd like to come to tea some day she thinks we should see more of one another as usual thought rebus patience was right id like that when ill ask patience and get back to you deal deal well im off for an early night what about you rebus looked down at his chair im already there sleep tight you too dad love you you too pet rebus said quietly but only after hed put down the phone he went over to the hifi after a drink he liked to listen to the stones women relationships and colleagues had come and gone but the stones had always been there he put the album on and poured himself a last drink the guitar riff one of easily half a dozen in keiths tireless repertoire kicked the album off i dont have much rebus thought but i have this he thought of lauderdale in his hospital bed patience out enjoying herself kirstie kennedy in a charing cross cardboardbox then he saw cheap trainers a final embrace and willie coyles face rebus just couldnt seem to drink him off his mind he remembered the report hed found hidden in willies bedroom it was on the kitchen worktop and he went to fetch it it was a business plan something to do with a computer software company called labarum the text explained that the dictionary definition of labarum was moral standard or guide and the reason the company would use upper case for the first three letters was to emphasise lothian and borders the business plan discussed future development costings projected balance sheet employment range it was dry and it was couched in the conditional rebus got out the phone book but found no listing anywhere for labarum someone had been working on the text underlining some phrases circling words doing jotted calculations beside the graphs and bar charts sentences had been deleted in red pen words changed some points had been ticked rebus couldnt know if the handwriting was willie coyles he didnt know if willie had owned such a thing as a red biro but he did wonder what such a document was doing hidden in willie coyles bedroom when he turned to the last sheet there was a word scrawled diagonally across it and underlined heavily the word was dalgety he flipped through the report again but found no other mention of dalgety was it a person a place another company the word was scored into the paper in blue ink it was impossible to say if it was in the same hand as the amendments and marginalia he poured another drink this would be his last and flipped the album over he was annoyed more with himself than anyone it was case closed after all a couple of desperate hoaxers fell off a bridge and died that was all he should have cleared it from his mind by now yet he couldnt damn you willie he said out loud he sat down again with his drink and picked up the business plan there were a couple of letters in the top righthand corner written faintly in pencil ck he wondered if they were an abbreviation for check who cares he said trying to concentrate on the music what a shambles the band were yet sometimes they could get it so exactly right that it hurt heres to you willie rebus said raising his glass in the air it wasnt till he woke up in the morning freezing that he remembered the radiator key in his jacket pocket the pipes were gurgling the boiler roaring away yet the radiators were barely warm he got coffee and a bacon roll from a cafe and had breakfast in his car on the way to work there was a hard frost on the ground and the sky was leaden threatening worse it had taken him five minutes to scrape the ice off his windscreen and even so it was like driving a tank peering through the one clear slit a message on his desk warned of a ninethirty meeting in the farmers office rebus felt he deserved another coffee and made for the canteen a lone woman sat at a table slowly stirring a beaker of tea gill she looked up it was gill templer rebuss face broke into its first grin of the year he pulled out a chair and sat down hello john her eyes were on her drink i thought you were in fife yes sex offences unit isnt it thats it he nodded trying to ignore the coolness in her tone you look good he meant it too her short dark hair was feathercut long crescents sweeping over both ears to her cheeks her eyes were emerald green she hadnt changed a bit gill templer smiled an acknowledgment but didnt say anything brian holmes put a hand on rebuss shoulder those pathology tests have come in oh holmes went to fetch himself coffee and a doughring rebus following so whats the news he asked holmes took a bite out of his doughring and shrugged nothing he mumbled swallowing the professor cant confirm the presence of heroin or any other drug in the blood of either deceased he thinks he may have a couple of jab marks on one corpse but theyre not recent which body the shorter dixie rebus lifted his coffee and left holmes to pay for it when he turned gill templer wasnt at the table any more she had left the beaker of tea untouched who was she holmes asked tucking change back into his pocket someone i used to know well that narrows things down rebus picked a new table for them to sit at di alister flower looked like he was on his way to a fashion shoot for one of the stores on princes street run out of dummies have they rebus asked entering farmer watsons office flower was wearing a light blue suit with blue shirt and a black and white tie with a zigzag motif hed set things off with polished brown loafers and what looked like white tennis socks rebus sat down next to him and realised his own shoes could do with a polish there was a speck of grease from the bacon roll on his shirt ive called this meeting the farmer was saying to put your minds at rest inspector flowers minds always at rest sir rebus said flower attempted an unselfconscious laugh and rebus realised how desperate the man was see john said the farmer you always have to make a joke of things leave them laughing sir but the farmer wasnt laughing and rebus knew what that silence meant as long as rebus maintained an attitude hed find promotion impossible which left alister flower aly the farmer began flower sat to attention rebus had never seen the trick before aly can i get you a refill flower looked at his cup then gulped the contents down please sir the farmer got up from his desk took flowers cup and walked to the coffee machine he had his back to both men when he spoke the temporary replacement for frank lauderdale will start immediately it hit rebus then it was like hed assumed a new much greater mass her name the farmer went on is gill templer flower made straight for the toilets where he could conduct a swearing match with the mirror rebus walked thoughtfully back to the cid room gill was already there reading a pathology report congratulations he said thank you she kept on reading he didnt budge till she stopped and looked up at him john she said quietly yes boss my office lauderdales name was still on the door they wouldnt bother with a new plaque not yet but rebus noticed shed already changed a few things dont bother sitting she said rebus brought out a packet of cigarettes come on you know the rules no smoking he put the cigarette in his mouth ill just suck on it then he said she closed the door then went to lauderdales desk resting against it folding her arms john theres a lot of history here rebus looked around the office you know what i mean i hear you and dr aitken have split up rebus took the cigarette out of his mouth so so youre on the rebound and i dont want you thinking i could be your springboard dont go thinking you can jump me a few times before you dive back in the pool rebus smiled did i catch you rehearsing in the canteen all i mean is lets leave the past well alone lets keep things professional fine he put the cigarette back in his mouth she went behind the desk and sat down so what can you tell me about these two imbeciles who shut the forth bridge hoaxers maybe with debts or a habit to finance desperadoes no sign that they ever knew the girl howdenhall checked the car there are none of her prints inside so why were you so interested in the toxicology results was i someone came looking for you in the canteen to tell you theyd arrived rebus smiled again i just wonder if maybe they were working for someone else do you have a name paul duggan he loaned the desperadoes his car plus they were subletting his council house thats illegal yes it is we might want to ask him a few followup questions she thought this over then nodded what else are you working on he shrugged not a lot its always quiet this time of year lets hope it stays that way i know your reputation john it was bad enough when i knew you but the story goes that its even worse these days i dont want trouble rebus looked out of the window it had started snowing weather like this he said theres never much trouble in edinburgh trust me hugh mcanally was universally known as wee shug he didnt know why people called hugh always ended up nicknamed shug there were a lot of things he didnt know and never would know he wished hed spent his time in jail bettering himself he supposed hed bettered himself in some ways he could use machine tools and knew how a sofa was put together but he knew he wasnt educated not like his cellmate his cellmate had been really clever a man of substance not like shug at all chalk and cheese if you came down to it but hed taught shug a lot and hed been a friend surrounded by people a jail could still be a lonely place without a friend then again what difference would it have made if hed been brainier none at all really not a jot but he was going to make a difference to his life this evening it was another grievous night a wind that was like walking through razorblades councillor tom gillespie wasnt expecting many souls to make the trek to his surgery hed get a few complaints from the regulars about frozen and burst pipes maybe a question about the cold weather allowance and that would be about it the constituents in his warrender ward tended to be selfreliant or easily cowed depending on your point of view depending on your politics he smiled across the room towards the extravagance he called a secretary then studied the art on the classroom walls he always held his surgery in this school third thursday of every month during termtime between consultations he would catch up on correspondence dictating letters into a handheld recorder the central members services division at the city chambers typed the letters up for general political matters matters relating to his party there was a separate admin assistant which was why as gillespies wife had pointed out on numerous occasions a private secretary was such an extravagance but as the councillor had argued and he was very good at argument if he was going to get ahead of the crowd he needed to be busier than the other councillors and above all he needed to seem to be busier short term extravagance long term gain you always had to be thinking in the long term he used the same rationale when he resigned his job as he explained to his wife audrey half the district councillors had other jobs beside the council but this meant they could not concentrate all their energies on council or political business he needed to seem so busy that he had no time for a day job council committee meetings took place during the day and now he was free to attend them he had other arguments in his favour too by working on council business during the day his evenings and weekends were relatively free and besides and here he would smile and squeeze audreys hand it wasnt as if they needed the money which was just as well since his district councillors basic allowance was finally he would tell her this was the most important time in local government for twenty years in seven weeks time there would be new elections and the change would begin turning the city of edinburgh into a singletier authority to be called the city of edinburgh council how could he afford not to be at the centre of these changes audrey though had won one condition his secretary should be an older woman plain and bomely helena profitt fitted that bill thinking of it he never really won an argument with audrey not outright she just snarled and spat and started slamming doors he didnt mind he needed her money her money bought him time if only it could save him the purgatory of these thursday nights in the neardeserted school his secretary brought her knitting with her and he could measure how quiet things had been by how much she got done in the hour he watched her needles work then went back to the letter he was writing it wasnt an easy letter to write hed been trying for over a week now it wasnt the sort of thing he could trust to dictation and so far all hed managed were his address at the top and the date beneath the school was quiet the corridors well lit the radiators burning away the caretaker was busy somewhere as were four cleaners when the cleaners and the councillor had gone home the caretaker would lock up for the night one of the cleaners was a lot younger than the others and had a tidy body on her he wondered if she lived in his ward he looked at the clock on the wall again twenty minutes to go he heard something slam and looked over to the classroom door a short man was standing there looking deathly cold in a thin bomberstyle jacket and shabby trousers he had his hands deep in his jacket pockets and didnt look inclined to remove them you the councillor the man asked councillor gillespie stood up and smiled then the man turned to helena profitt so who are you my ward secretary tom gillespie explained helena profitt and the man seemed to be studying one another can i help you aye you can the man said then he unzipped his jacket and drew out a sawnoff shotgun you he said to miss profitt get the fuck out he pointed the weapon at the councillor you stay helena profitt ran screaming from the classroom and nearly knocked over the cleaners a pail of dirty water clattered to the wooden floor ive just polished thon a gun hes got a gun the cleaners stared at her a sound like a tyre exploding came from the classroom miss profitt who had fallen to her knees was joined by the other women what in christ was that she said a gun and now there was a figure in the doorway it was the councillor almost in control of his legs he looked for all the world like one of the paintings on the classroom wall only it wasnt paint that spattered his face and his hair rebus stood in the classroom and looked at the paintings some of them were pretty good the colours werent always right but the shapes were identifiable blue house yellow sun brown horse in a green field and a red sky speckled with grey oh the room had been cordoned off by the simple act of placing two chairs in the doorway the body was still there spreadeagled on the floor in front of the teachers desk dr curt was examining it this seems to be your week for messy ones he told rebus it was messy all right there wasnt much left of the head except for the lower jaw and chin stick a shotgun in your gub and heaveho with both barrels and you couldnt expect to win mr glamorous suicide you wouldnt even make the last sixteen rebus stood beside the teachers desk there was a pad of lined paper on it scribbled on the top sheet was the message mr hamilton allotment allocation alongside an address and telephone number blood had soaked through the paper rebus peeled off this first sheet the sheet below was obviously the start of a letter gillespie had got as far as the word dear well curt got to his feet hes dead and if you were to ask for my considered opinion id say he used that he nodded towards the shotgun which lay a couple of feet from the body and now hes gone to the other place its just a shot away said rebus curt looked at him is the photographer on his way trouble getting his car to start well tell him i want plenty of head shots pun unavoidable i gather weve a witness councillor gillespie i dont know him hes councillor for my ward dr curt was pulling on thin latex gloves it was time to search the body initially they were looking for id cosy as this room is dr curt said id prefer my own hearth in the back pocket of the deceaseds trousers rebus found an officiallooking envelope folded in two mr h mcanally he read an address in tollcross not five minutes away rebus eased the letter out of the envelope and read it its from the prison service he told dr curt details of assistance open to mr h mcanally on his release from saughton jail tom gillespie had a wash in the school toilets his hair was damp and lay in clumps against his skull he kept rubbing a hand over his face and then checking the palm for blood his eyes were redrimmed from crying rebus sat across from him in the headteachers office the office had been locked but rebus had commandeered it when the head arrived at the school the cleaning ladies were being given mugs of tea in the staffroom siobhan clarke was there with them doing her best to calm down miss profitt did you know the man at all mr gillespie never seen him in my life youre sure of that positive rebus reached into his pocket then stopped do you mind if i smoke from the odour of stale tobacco in the room he already knew the head wouldnt mind gillespie shook his head in fact he said give me one while youre at it gillespie lit the cigarette and inhaled deeply gave up three years ago rebus didnt say anything he was studying the man hed seen his photo before in election rubbish pushed through the letterbox gillespie was in his midforties he wore redrimmed glasses normally but had left them on the desk his hair was very thin and wispy on top but curled thickly either side of his pate his eyes had thick dark lashes not just from the crying and his chin was weak rebus couldnt have called him handsome there was a simple gold band on his wedding finger how long have you been a councillor mr gillespie six years coming up for seven i live in your ward gillespie studied him have we met before rebus shook his head so this man walks into the classroom yes looking for you in particular he asked if i was the councillor then he asked who helena was helena being miss profitt gillespie nodded he told her to get out then he turned the shotgun around and stuck the end of it in his mouth he shivered ash falling from his cigarette ill never forget that never did he say anything else gillespie shook his head he didnt say anything not a word do you have any idea why he did it gillespie looked at rebus thats your department not mine rebus held the stare until gillespie broke it by looking for somewhere to stub out the cigarette theres something in you rebus thought something below the surface thats a lot cooler a lot more deliberate just a few more questions mr gillespie how are your surgeries publicised theres a district council leaflet most homes had one delivered plus i put up notices in doctors surgeries that sort of place theyre no secret then what good would a councillor be if he kept his surgeries secret mr mcanally lived at an address in tollcross who the man who killed himself tollcross thats not in my ward no rebus said getting to his feet i didnt think it was dc siobhan clarke sat in on the interview with helena profitt miss profitt was still bawling her few utterances barely decipherable she was older than the councillor maybe by as much as ten years she clutched a large shoppingbag on her lap as if it was a lifebuoy keeping her afloat maybe it was she was short with fair hair which had been permed a while back most of it lost now a pair of knitting needles protruded from her bag and then she wailed he told me to get out his exact words rebus asked she sniffed calming a little he swore he told me to get the fuck out did he say anything else she shook her head and you left the room i wasnt about to stay of course not what did you think he was going to do she had not yet asked herself this well she said at last i dont know what i thought maybe he was going to hold tom hostage or shoot him something like that but why her voice rose i dont know who knows why these days she collapsed into hysterical sobs again just a couple more questions miss profitt she wasnt listening rebus looked to siobhan clarke who shrugged she was suggesting they leave it till morning but rebus knew better than that he knew the tricks the memory could play if you left things too long just a couple more questions he persisted quietly she sniffed blew her nose wiped her eyes then she took a deep breath and nodded thank you miss profitt how long was there between you running out of the classroom and hearing the shots the classrooms at the end of the corridor she said i pushed open the doors and bumped into the cleaning ladies i fell to my knees and thats when i heard thats when so were talking about a matter of seconds just a few seconds yes and you didnt hear any conversation as you left the room just the bang thats all rebus rubbed the bridge of his nose thank you miss profit well get a car to take you home dr curt was finished in the classroom the scene of crime unit had taken over and the photographer who had finally arrived was changing film we need to secure the locus rebus told the headteacher can this room be locked yes there are keys in my desk what about opening the school i wouldnt if i were you well be in and out tomorrow the door might be left open say no more and youll want to get the decorators in right rebus turned to dr curt can we move him to the mortuary dr curt nodded ill take a look at him in the morning has someone gone to that address ill go myself like you say its only five minutes away rebus looked to siobhan clarke see that the procuratorfiscal gets that preliminary notification curt looked back into the room hed only just been released from prison maybe he was depressed that might explain a suicide but not one like this the amount of forethought the setting our american cousins have a phrase for it curt said whats that rebus asked feeling he was walking into another of the doctors punchlines in your face dr curt obliged rebus walked to tollcross he had a taste in his lungs and a scent in his nostrils and he hoped the cold might deaden them he could walk into a pub and deaden them that way but he didnt he remembered a winter years back much colder than this minus twenty siberian weather the pipes on the outside of the tenement had frozen solid so that nobodys waste water could run away the smell had been bad but you could always open a window death wasnt like that it didnt go away just because you opened a window or took a walk there was ice underfoot and he skited a couple of times another good reason for not having a drink he needed his wits about him hed copied mcanallys address into his notebook he knew the block anyway it was a couple of streets up from the burntout shell of the crazy hose saloon there was an intercom at the main door he flipped on his lighter and saw that mcanally was the third name up his toes were going numb as he pressed the button hed been rehearsing what to say no policeman liked to give bad news certainly not news as bad as this your husbands lost the heid just didnt fit the bill the intercom clattered to life dont tell me youve lost the keys shug if youve been drinking and lost them you can freeze your arse off see if i care mrs mcanally whos that detective inspector rebus can i come up name of god whats he done can i come up mrs mcanally you better had the intercom buzzed and rebus pushed open the door the mcanallys lived one floor up for once rebus had been hoping for the top storey he climbed slowly trying to prepare his speech she was waiting at the door for him it was a nice newlooking door darkstained wood with a fanshaped glass motif new brass knocker and letterbox too mrs mcanally come in she led him down a short hall into the living room it was a tiny flat but nicely furnished and carpeted there was a kitchenette off the living room both rooms adding up to about twenty feet by twelve estate agents would call it cosy and compact all three bars of the electric fire were on and the room was stifling mrs mcanally had been watching television a can of sweetheart stout balanced on one wide arm of her chair ashtray and cigarettes on the other she looked feisty no other words would do cons wives often got that look the prison visits hardened their jawlines and turned their eyes into distrustful slits her hair was dyed blonde and though she was spending the night in shed still polished her nails and stuck on some eyeliner and mascara whats he done she said again sit down if you like ill stand thanks the thing is mrs mcanally rebus paused thats what you did you lowered your voice respectfully said a few introductory words and then you paused hoping the widow or widower or mother or father or son or daughter would twig the thing is what she snapped well im sorry to have to tell you her eyes were on the television it was a film some noisy hollywood adventure could we maybe have the sound down he suggested she shrugged and pressed the remote the mute sign came up on the screen rebus suddenly noticed how big the tv was it filled a whole corner of the room dont make me say the words he thought then he saw that her eyes were glinting tears he thought shes holding them back you know dont you he said quietly know what she snapped mrs mcanally we think your husband may be dead she threw the remote across the room and got to her feet a man committed suicide rebus continued he had a letter in his pocket addressed to your husband she glared at him what does that mean it means nothing might have dropped it somebody mightve picked it up the deceased the man he was wearing a black nylon bomber jacket and some lightcoloured trousers a green jersey she turned away from him where where was this warrender park well then she said defiantly wee shug went down lothian road his usual haunts what time were you expecting him home pubs are still open if that answers your question look mrs mcanally i know this isnt easy but id like you to come down to the mortuary and look at some clothing would that be all right she had her arms folded and was rocking on the balls of her feet no it wouldnt be all right whats the point its not wee shug hes only been out a week one miserable week he cant be dead she paused was it a car run him over we think he took his own life are you mad took his own get out of my house go on out with you mrs mcanally we need to but now she was swiping at him catching him with her solid fists propelling him before her out of the room and down the hall keep away from him do you hear keep away from both of us this is nothing but harassment i know youre upset mrs mcanally but an identification would clear things up put your mind at rest her blows lost some of their power then stopped altogether rebuss burnt palm stung where shed caught it im sorry she said breathing hard its only natural youre upset do you have a neighbour a friend someone who could be with you theres maisie next door fine what if i get a car to pick you up maybe maisie can go with you ill ask her she opened the door and stepped out on to the landing shuffling along to a door marked finch ill use your phone if thats all right rebus called retreating back into the flat he took a quick look around just the one bedroom and bathroom plus a box room hed seen the rest of the place already again the bedroom was very nicely furnished pink ruched curtains and matching bedspread a small dressingtable covered in bottles of perfume he went into the hall and made a couple of calls one to order a car the other to make sure someone from cid would be at the mortuary to help with the id the door opened and two women came in hed been expecting mrs finch to be around mrs mcanallys age but she was in her early twenties leggy with a short tight skirt she looked at him as if he might be some warped practical joker he offered a smile in return which mixed compassion with interest she didnt smile back so he had to content himself with the sight of her long legs as she helped mrs mcanally down the hall and into the living room a wee bacardi tresa maisie finch was saying itll calm your nerves before we do anything else well have a wee bacardi and coke have you any valium about the place if you havent i think ive some in my bathroom cabinet he cant be dead maisie tresa mcanally wailed lets not talk about him maisie finch replied strange advice rebus thought making ready to leave it wasnt much of a walk from tollcross down to c division hq on torphichen place but rebus knew he was getting further and further away from his own flat he didnt intend walking back and hoped torphichen would have a spare car he could use as a taxi there was a tall bald man in a thick shabby coat in reception the man had his arms folded and was staring at his feet there was no one behind the desk so rebus pressed the buzzer he knew it would keep buzzing till someone arrived been here long he asked the man looked up and smiled evening mr rebus hello anthony rebus knew the man he was one of edinburghs homeless one of the army who sold copies of the big issue every twenty yards or so along princes street rebus usually bought a copy from anthony whose sacred pitch was outside the st james centre here to help us with our enquiries anthony gave a gaptoothed grin just keeping warm i told the desk officer i was waiting for dc reynolds only i saw mr reynolds go into the hopscotch bar on dalry road which means hes on for a sesh and i can sit here till somebody tumbles a uniform was emerging into the reception booth rebus showed id and the uniform came and unlocked the door for him you know the way sir i know the way whos on duty its a bit of a graveyard up there rebus climbed the stairs anyway torphichen was an old station and small with plain stone walls and a slightly depressing air rebus liked it certainly he preferred it to the much newer and supposedly ergonomic st leonards his home base he looked into the cid room the very man he wanted was sitting at a long scarred wooden table reading the evening paper mr davidson rebus said davidson looked up then groaned i want a favour rebus said walking into the room now theres a surprise have you heard about warrender shotgun suicide news got around davidson closed his paper the man with the plan was called hugh mcanally lived in tollcross i know wee shug wee bastards more like it hed only just come out of saughton maybe he was pining want a drink coffee maybe but davidson was reaching for his coat i said a drink so long as youre not suggesting the hopscotch ratarse reynolds is in there davidson knotted his tartan scarf all right lets scotch the hopscotch and since youre buying you get to choose rebus chose a big public house near haymarket station the public bar was seething but the saloon was quiet they ordered doubles too cold outside to be drinking lager davidson said your health and yours rebus sipped and swallowed feeling the liquid doing its immediate nononsense business it was almost too good sometimes so he said tell me about wee shug ach he was a smalltimer used to specialise in hopeless housebreakings used to he moved on to reset counterfeiting this and that so how long had he been inside this stretch you mean funny that when i heard he was out i did a quick calculation hes out early served a bit under four years well if all we had him on was reset davidson was shaking his head sorry you misunderstand my fault he wasnt sent down for any of his usual tricks what then rape of a minor what davidson nodded thing is we nailed him for it but with hand on heart i dont know if it was a clean result explain rebus signalled for two more whiskies well the lassie was fifteen but everyone said the same thing fifteen going on thirtyfive not a shy lass at all you should read the interview transcripts but she was adamant hed raped her she was a minor and the procuratorfiscal went ahead with the prosecution i wasnt too bothered getting wee shug off the street was fine by me was he living in tollcross at that time thats always been his patch rebus paid for the second round of drinks was he the violent type not that i ever saw i mean he had a temper when roused but who doesnt that was the thing about the rape there were no physical injuries what about corroboration we had a bundle of circumstantial evidence neighbours heard raised voices a scream the girl herself was in a terrible state crying and all plus wee shug admitted having sex with her said he knew it was illegal and all but as he put it only by a few months the girl said it wasnt consensual and we just about put together a case say for the sake of argument that it was consensual yes then hes just come out of a fouryear stretch for something he didnt do davidson shrugged youre looking for a motive behind the suicide rebus was thoughtful for a moment suicides interest me right now and were always looking for motives eh john rebus drank his drink what about guns did he ever have anything to do with firearms nothing but hes probably still got cronies out there who know where to get them it was a sawnoff i can believe it you couldnt get a fulllength shotgun in your mouth and be able to pull the trigger far easier with something shorter messy though no doubt but it would do the job you dont want to go off halfcocked do you with a sawnoff theres less margin for error no margin at all said rebus it was only when they were leaving that he thought to ask a question mcanallys victim what was her name again davidson had to think about it mary something mary finlay no he screwed shut his eyes mary finch rebus stared at him maisie finch davidson thought again thats it maisie she lives next door to the mcanallys did then too shed known them for years christ rebus said quietly ive just sent her down to the mortuary to help tresa mcanally identify her husband what do me a favour will you lend me a car and a driver ill do better than that ill drive you myself but by the time they reached the mortuary it was too late the id had been completed and everyone had gone home rebus stood on the cowgate and looked longingly back towards the grassmarket some of the pubs there would still be open the merchants bar for one but he got back into the car instead and asked davidson to take him home he felt tired all of a sudden god he felt tired he what rebus said he was on the phone from st leonards to dr curt at the universitys pathology department they kept curt and his colleagues busy no mistake about that on top of police work curt had a full teaching load in the faculty of medicine and did crossover lectures to law students too but then curt had an advantage over mere mortals he never slept you could call him out at any hour and he was always alert you could catch him in his office at eight in the morning it was actually eightfifteen and rebus was nursing a large black decaf coffee from the earlyopening deli on the pleasance morning deafness john dr curt said i repeat he was dying anyway dying how great big bloody tumours pancreas and large colon to start with the man must have been in agony im willing to bet the toxicology tests show the presence of powerful painkillers you mean he was out of his box hed have to be to stand the pain rebus frowned i dont get it havent you heard of voluntary euthanasia selfinflicted in this case yes but with a sawnoff shotgun well thats not my department i can give you effect not cause rebus terminated the call and went to see his chief inspector gill templer had made more changes to lauderdales office shed brought in a few framed photographs of nieces and nephews and a thriving yucca plant had appeared there were also a couple of cards wishing her well in her new job i hear you were at that suicide last night she said motioning for him to sit he nodded distractedly theres something not right about it oh so he set out what he knew gill templer listened with her chin resting on both hands a gesture he knew of old he recognised the perfume she was wearing too hmm she said when hed finished a lot of questions but are they any of our concern he shrugged to be honest im not sure give me a day or two i might have an answer those two lads on the bridge she said another suicide another connection with the district council i know it could just be coincidence i dont see how it could be anything else ok take a day or two see what you come up with but report back to me regularly at least a couple of times a day rebus stood up thats good he said youre already managing to sound like a chief inspector john she said warningly remember what i said yes maam will there be anything else gill templer shook her head she was already getting down to some paperwork rebus left her office it was hers now no doubt about it and walked straight into siobhan clarke any news on paul duggan hes coming in for a chat this afternoon good said rebus need me along she shook her head brian and me have perfected our jekyll and hyde routine which one of you plays hyde she ignored this so what are you up to today it was a good question rebus formed his answer chasing ghosts he said making for his desk he phoned tresa mcanally shed identified her husbands clothes and had been able to identify his body albeit with the face discreetly covered now all that was left for her were the funeral arrangements sorry to bother you again rebus said after introducing himself what do you want just wondered how you were coping oh aye he shouldve known she wouldnt fall for that sort of patter you knew your husband was ill mrs mcanally he told me he was seriously ill though he never really said well what did he tell you was wrong with him where do you want me to start high blood pressure kidney stones ulcers a heart murmur emphysema see wee shug was a bit of a hypochondriac but he was ill he was on medication you know what doctors are like theyll hand you a placebo and kiss you goodbye ive read the stories i know what goes on she paused if you dont mind me asking whats the point asking about his health now well ive reason to believe your husband was seriously ill terminally ill mrs mcanally i shouldve guessed she said finally her tone chastened he was different when he came out this time quieter like was it the big c yes used to smoke rollies i always told him thats the way my own mother went another pause as she dragged on her filtertip is that why he did himself in what do you think makes sense eh poor wee bugger rebus cleared his throat mrs mcanally have you any idea where he could have got the gun not a clue are you sure whats the difference where he got it he only hurt himself thinking back to councillor gillespie and miss profitt rebus wondered about that it seemed to him that wee shug mcanally had managed to hurt a lot of people which brought him to thoughts of maisie finch the funerals next tuesday inspector youd be welcome at the house thanks mrs mcanally ill do my best the sun was out bathing the tired buildings in dazzling light edinburghs architecture was best suited to winter to sharp cold light you got the feeling of being a long way north of anywhere some place reserved for only the hardiest and most foolhardy rebus was glad to be out of the office he knew he worked best on the street besides the office was a battleground he knew flower would already be plotting against gill templer marshalling his forces waiting for her defences to slip but she was tough the way she was handling rebus was proof of that he knew she would keep him at arms length and beyond she was right he did have a bad reputation she wouldnt want any of his failures to rub off on her so what if theyd known one another had been an item she was right it was a long time ago now they were colleagues more than that she was his acting superior he hadnt known many women make chief inspector good luck to her he drove past the infirmary chiding himself for not stopping to visit lauderdale and headed for tollcross he didnt want tresa mcanally this time though he wanted her neighbour he pressed the buzzer marked finch and waited shuffling his feet his tooth was acting up hed made the mistake of opening his mouth to take a deep breath and the frozen air had made straight for the nerve he pressed the buzzer again hoping he wouldnt have to visit a dentist the intercom came to life who is it the voice was neutral miss finch my names inspector rebus we sort of met last night what do you want can i come up the door buzzed and rebus pushed it open at the top of the stairs he all but tiptoed past tresa mcanallys door maisie finchs door was ajar he closed it after him miss finch she emerged suddenly from the bathroom wearing a short towellingrobe and brushing her hair he could smell soap and feel the warmth from her body i was in the bath she said sorry to trouble you he followed her into the living room it wasnt what hed expected half the space was taken up with what looked like a hospital bed with castiron frame roller wheels and a sideguard next to it was a livercoloured commode the mantelpiece was like a chemists display two dozen assorted boxes and bottles standing in a row maisie finch was moving magazines from the sofa she motioned for him to sit and took the commode for herself tucking one leg under the other whats the problem inspector her face was too angular to be goodlooking and she had slightly protruberant eyes yet she was undeniably the word that came to his mind was charged he shifted on the sofa well miss finch i suppose its about tresa in a way yes he looked at the bed again its my mums she explained shes housebound i have to look after her rebus made show of looking around for the missing parent and maisie finch laughed shes in hospital im sorry dont be they take her every few months just for a few days its to give me a break this she said opening her arms wide is my winter holiday her movements had loosened her robe she didnt seem to notice and rebus tried not to look men he thought are daft bastards want something to drink she asked or is it too early for you one persons early is someone elses late she went into the kitchenette rebus walked over to the mantelpiece and examined the array of prescription drugs he found a bottle of paracetamol and shook two into his hand heavy night she said coming back with two bottles toothache he explained he took the narrow bottle it was chilled san miguel she told him spanish lager know what i do she sat down again legs apart resting her elbows on her knees i stick the heater on as high as itll go shut my eyes and imagine im in spain poolside at some posh hotel she closed her eyes to prove the point and angled her head towards an imaginary mediterranean sun rebus washed the pills down with lager im sorry to hear about your mum though he said she opened her eyes not pleased to have her reverie broken everyone tells me what a saint i am she mimicked a much older woman theres no many like you hen too right theres not many as daft as me you know how some people say lifes passing them by well in this case its a fact i sit on the commode between her bed and the window and just stare out at the street for hours on end listening to her breathing waiting for it to stop she looked over at him have i shocked you he shook his head his own mother had been bedridden he knew the feeling but he hadnt come here for any of this sitting by the window all day he said you must have seen mr mcanally coming and going yes i saw him you dont like him do you no i dont she stood up abruptly mrs mcanallys all right though she was moving towards the kitchenette but stopped and turned on him im not the saint that womans the saint shes suffered you wouldnt believe how shes suffered i think i would she wasnt listening married to an animal like that she looked at him you know what he did to me rebus nodded and she took a step back recovering you do she asked quietly is that why youre here im here because im curious miss finch i mean you still live next door youre friends with his wife what you think mum and me were going to move out because of him something like that shes been offered sheltered accommodation but in granton weve always lived in tollcross we always will this last week it must have been awkward i kept out of his way you can bet he kept out of mine she was by the window now staring down on to the street her back resting against the wall it was as if she didnt want to be seen he deserved what he got rebus frowned you mean what he did to himself she looked at him blinked thats what i said then she smiled and put the bottle to her lips the ballistics facility at howdenhall forensic science lab wasnt rebuss idea of a good time there were too many guns around for his liking he read the report and looked up at the whitecoated scientist whod prepared it the other thing rebus didnt like about howdenhall all the forensic boffins looked about nineteen years old theyd been in their smart new building a year and still looked pleased with themselves the new facility had been financed by selling property including police homes rebus didnt want to know how many homes the lab had cost not much is there he said the white coat who liked to be called dave laughed you cid he said plunging his hands into his pockets you always want more who fired it where did he get it we know who fired it smartarse but your second questions a good one where did he get it im ballistics not intelligence its a common enough make of shotgun the identifiers have been filed off weve tried the usual processes and theres no chance of recovering them the cartridges were common stock too what about the barrel what about it when was it filed off dave nodded the edge the file left is still shiny say in the last couple of months have you checked the register of course dave led rebus to a computer terminal and punched a couple of keys there are over seventy thousand shotgun certificates on issue rebus blinked seventy thousand compared to thirtyodd thousand for all other firearms combined nobodys really concerned about the amount of shotguns around he tapped another key see ownerships highest in rural areas northern grampian dumfries and galloway its not some brewhead from gorgie thats buying these things its the establishment farmers landowners what about thefts theyre on the computer but ive checked nobody around edinburgh has lost a shotgun recently can i take a look anyway sure rebus sat down and dave punched the keyboard again the list of recently reported thefts was not large nearly all of them were south of the border want a printout yes not that a printout would help him whats the big deal anyway dave asked its a simple suicide isnt it suicides still an offence the only one we dont prosecute after the fact is there something youre not telling me no rebus said quietly but there may be things some people arent telling me he took the printout and folded it into his pocket one other thing what the prints on the gun were they the deceaseds dave seemed amused by the question his and his alone what are you up to inspector but john rebus wasnt about to answer that thank you for coming in councillor rebus had just come into the interview room hed been biding his time outside the door letting tom gillespie get a bit nervous an interview room could do that it could destroy all your preplanning you walked in knowing what you were going to say the line you were going to take with the police but then the room started to work on you the thing was it was just a room crime prevention posters on the walls a table three chairs four electrical sockets there was a tin ashtray commandeered from a local pub the walls were creamy matt custard institution yellow and there was strip lighting on the ceiling the lights burred continuously an almost subliminal electric hum rebus wondered if it was that noise that got to people he guessed there was a simpler truth the interview room was in a police station and if you were there you were going to be interviewed by the police and when it came down to it everyone had something to hide not at all gillespie said crossing one leg over the other to let rebus know how relaxed he was i hear the poor devil was an exprisoner hed served just under four years for the rape of a minor four years doesnt seem very long no it doesnt they sat in silence for a moment until gillespie broke it i had a friend once who committed suicide he was still at university this is going back a while he was worried about exams and his girlfriend had left him he paused left him for me i should add do you mind if i smoke rebus asked i thought smoking was forbidden in police stations if it bothers you i wont light it he stuck the cigarette in the corner of his mouth and offered one to gillespie the councillor shook his head id prefer it if you didnt light up fair enough said rebus putting away cigarettes and lighter both well he thought this is interesting the guys been studying for this exam tells a personal story one that doesnt paint him in the rosiest glow and then asserts his authority and all it was supposed to be was a few followup questions how did he do it rebus asked who your friend flung himself out of the halls of residence fifth floor he was still alive so they took him to hospital checking for broken bones and internal bleeding they were so busy they didnt notice hed taken an overdose before the jump well rebus said both are fairly common roads out arent they you leap or you sleep mr mcanally on the other hand you were at the forth road bridge werent you when those two kids jumped i saw your name in the paper were here to talk about mcanally councillor well guns are a popular mode of suicide too arent they maybe among gun owners but mcanally didnt own a gun and probably had never used one before gillespie uncrossed his legs and crossed them the other way but given his background hed find it easy enough to take possession of a gun i agree said rebus all the same what why go to all the bother i mean even if youre determined to blow your head off why walk from tollcross to warrender in the middle of a blizzard with this big heavy gun clutched beneath your jacket and why walk into a school which would have been locked tight on every night of the month except one rebus had risen to his feet he rested his buttocks against the edge of the table and folded his arms why walk into a classroom and make sure councillor tom gillespie is present why do that why did he specifically want to top himself in front of you no other witnesses no one else invited it doesnt make sense to me well the man was obviously unhinged maybe on drugs ive just seen the toxicology results the police lab has all these smart machines at howdenhall rebus nodded yes i know i was there for the official opening well the results show that the deceased had had a couple of drinks but no drugs not one single painkiller whats your point inspector rebus turned around so that his hands were resting on the table he was leaning over gillespie and gillespie wasnt enjoying it see councillor wee shug mcanally was dying he didnt have long to live at all his insides were rotten and he should have been doped to the eyeballs to stand the pain those drugs though they make your brain mushy and wee shug didnt want that he wanted to be compos mentis when he pulled the trigger rebus stood up straight makes even less sense now eh he popped the cigarette back into his mouth look i dont see what any of this has to do with me frankly neither do i all i know is it has something to do with you now what could that be there was a line of perspiration on gillespies top lip he took off his glasses and pinched the bridge of his nose rebus walked to the far wall and lit his cigarette he didnt think the councillor would object look gillespie said quietly i really dont see any connection between this man mcanally and me none at all ive never met him never heard of him and he didnt live in my ward he shrugged maybe he held some sort of mad grudge something linked to his time in prison rebus walked slowly back to the table and sat down opposite gillespie thats it he said thats your explanation i dont have an explanation i just give me a cigarette please rebus lit the cigarette for him gillespie studied the burning tip then looked at rebus why are you doing this ive already told you councillor ive to prepare a report on a sudden violent death and there are inconsistencies you mean you dont know why he did it thats what i mean well i cant help you im afraid gillespie got to his feet making ready to leave cant or wont gillespie glared at rebus then sat down again what does that mean it means i think youre hiding something such as thats what i have to find out before i can finish my report are all policeman like you no some of them you wouldnt want to meet i meet quite a few actually a colleague of mine regional councillor rather than district but the same party is chair of lothian and borders joint police board gillespie drew on his cigarette and blew the smoke out in a thin stream hes quite a good friend its always nice to have friends rebus said gillespie got to his feet again look he began he swung his arms as if he was deciding to say something hed rather not say i promised he sighed and sat down yet again this may mean something or nothing inspector rebus busied himself tidying the end of his cigarette against the ashtray its helena helena profitt your ward secretary she she told me she knew him mcanally gillespie nodded when mcanally came into the room and saw her there was a moment when he just stared i asked her about it afterwards and she told me shed known him a long time ago she wouldnt say any more than that whats wrong with your mouth huh you keep poking it with your finger nothings wrong with it but rebus knew something was wrong he was just hoping it would go away there was pressure inside his gum and top lip a dull unpleasant sensation that was now spreading either side of his nose it felt as if his whole face should be swollen but it was just a little red beneath the nose and that could have been the drink or the weather whose idea was this he said folding his arms around himself they were walking on portobello beach the only souls mad enough in this seizureinducing wind mine said mairie henderson rebus had turned up at her flat expecting a hot drink and a soft couch but instead shed dragged him out for what she euphemistically called her constitutional youd have to have the constitution of an ox to survive this rebus muttered to himself the blasts of air against his ears meant he could barely hear what mairie was saying and every time he opened his mouth to yell something back the malevolent air flooded in and attacked his tooth again mairie ran to a wall and hunkered down with her back against it her cheeks looked as if theyd been sandblasted which in a sense they had rebus crouched beside her thankful for the shelter he liked to take an interest in mairie especially now she was a freelance journalist he worried about that lack of salary but she seemed to be doing all right so he asked what exactly did you come up with she smiled you forget i used to cover local government regional and district councils it was my first job on the paper i didnt have to do much digging she leaned forward and drew a circle in the sand where do you want me to start give me some background district council not regional thats right well about the only glamorous angle attached to district councildom is the fact of a big budget which means only the four major cities are worth the candle from a journalists perspective its the only perspective i can give she pushed the hair out of her eyes therefore being a district councillor is not an attractive proposition youve got long boring working hours requiring you to take time off from your daytime job plus eating into your evening hours since a lot of the meetings are evening affairs as are surgeries if theyre not on a saturday ok so i wont be standing for councillor unless the money compensates mairie shook her head its not great for such a thankless task of course you can claim expenses plus if you chair a committee theres a bonus but even so for all these reasons and others you find that councillors tend to fall into one of several groups retired unemployed selfemployed or with an affluent spouse the first two because theyve got lots of time the last two because they can make time she nodded result a lot of councils are not what youd call dynamic edinburghs more interesting than most so tell me about edinburgh rebus stared out towards inchkeith island well weve sixtytwo wards labour holding most of them no surprise but there isnt much of a gap between labour and the tories only about seven seats the libdems have a few and the snp a couple as to what the council does if youd ever had to sit in on their meetings and then write them up as even vaguely interesting prose youd know boring most councillors could bore for britain at the world ennui cup so thats how you pronounce that word this got him a smile she didnt smile much these days not since shed led rebus to a horror above the crazy hose saloon rebus looked out to sea it seemed all whitecaps as far as the horizon there are all sorts of committees and subcommittees she went on and the full district council meets once a month but despite all that what the council basically does is house people glasgow district council is the biggest landlord in britain one hundred and seventy thousand houses its rumoured the district councils were only given the housing portfolio after local government reorganisation so theyd have something to do youve lost me the tories wanted to keep housing out of regional council control she sighed at his puzzled look its all to do with politics and its all intensely dull and the councillors are dull too almost of necessity maybe worthy would be a better word she looked at him were focusing in nicely on councillor tom gillespie he chairs an industrial planning committee looking at economic and property development the council has its own department economic development and estates and mostly the committee would be checking to ensure that the department is working hard and not trying to fix anything fix you dont mean as in repair i dont land deals and building contracts can be worth millions even repairs to buildings can be worth hundreds of thousands suppose i handed you the contract to clean the windows of every council building in the city id have to buy a new chamois you could afford it the only thing about gillespie is that hes ambitious but thats nothing new twenty years ago just before the corporation became the district council malcolm rifkind george foulkes and robin cook were all councillors thats another thing the district council is about to disappear with effect from april there are elections coming up so we can install a sort of shadow authority if anyone bothers to vote any news of crooked deals bent councillors nothing tom gillespie is a diligent hardworking councillor with no bad press no apparent skeletons in his closet not even any rumours hes not a tippler not a gambler and he doesnt cheat on his wife with the secretary what makes you say that she shrugged its just one of those things people sometimes do she touched the back of his hand do you know something i dont rebus stood up thatd be the day which is he by the way selfemployed unemployed wealthy spouse his wife runs her own business rebus looked around is there a cafe open somewhere we could try the fun park she wiped her hands clean of sand am i in for an exclusive rebus rubbed his shoe over the circle shed made in the sand obliterating it well she persisted are you still singing in that country and western band now theres a subtle change of subject you were about to answer my question what question about the exclusive no i wasnt they came off the beach on to the promenade can you check a couple of other things for me what a company name labarum he spelt it for her thats all ive got on it plus another name dalgety a company i dont know ive checked and there are companies called dalgety plus its a place name and a surname so what do you want me to do he shrugged if you find out anything about labarum maybe dalgety will tie into it ill see what i can do oh i forgot to say im talking to your daughter later on rebus stopped you forgot to say ok i wasnt going to tell you im interviewing her on the mcanally suicide rebus started walking again mairie hurrying to catch him up any comment youd like to make at this point inspector strictly on the record no comment miss henderson rebus growled hed decided the interview room might prove just too much for helena proffit so made an appointment to see her at her work she worked parttime in an office on top of her post as gillespies ward secretary but someone from her office phoned to say miss proffit had been taken ill with a migraine and had gone home he tried her home number but got no answer it could wait meantime he made another appointment this time with the governor of hm prison edinburgh he told the governors secretary that it concerned the suicide of an exinmate the secretary booked him in for tuesday afternoon sooner would be better he told her sooner isnt possible she replied that night after the usual session with doc and salty he drove out to the forth road bridge parked and walked on to the bridge itself for once there was no howling gale hardly even a breeze there was no moon and the temperature was still a degree or two above freezing the bridge had been reopened some temporary repairs completed initial structural surveys had shown no real damage to the fabric though if the car had snapped one of the thick metal support cables it would have been different he stood there shivering after the warmth of the pub and his car he was a few yards from where the boys had jumped the area was cordoned off with metal barriers anchored by sandbags two yellow metal lamps marked off the danger area someone had climbed over the barriers and laid a small wreath next to the broken rail weighing it down with a rock so it wouldnt be blown away he looked up at the nearer of the two vast supports red lights blinking at its summit as a warning to aircraft he didnt really feel very much except a bit lonely and sorry for himself the forth was down there as judgmental as pilate it was funny the things that could kill you water a ships hull steel pellets from a plastic case it was funny that some people actually chose to die i could never do it rebus said out loud i couldnt kill myself which didnt mean he hadnt thought of it it was funny the things you thought about some nights it was all so funny he felt a lump forming in his throat its only the drink he thought its the drink makes me maudlin its only the drink sometimes people who knew next to nothing about them called edinburghs dropin centres dropout centres rebus knew that the police werent the most welcome guests so he phoned ahead first he knew the person who ran the centre behind waverley station rebus had done him a favour once bringing back a heroin addict whod suffered sudden cold turkey on nicolson street some officers would have lifted the hapless wretch and taken him to the station for a knee in the groin and a long sweat but rebus had taken him where he wanted to go the dropin centre at waverley turned out he was undergoing withdrawal doing it all on his own how is he rebus asked fraser leitch the centres manager and guiding light leitch was sitting in his mouldering office surrounded by the usual mounds of paperwork the shelves behind his desk were bowed under the weight of files document boxes magazines and books fraser leitch scratched his greyflecked beard he was doing all right last i heard retrained as a chippie and actually found a job see inspector sometimes the system works or hes the exception that proves the rule the eternal pessimist leitch got up and crouched in front of a tray on the floor he checked there was water in the kettle and switched it on ill make a bet with you ill bet youre here to talk about willie coyle and dixie taylor id have to be daft to cover a bet like that leitch smiled you know dixie was a user rebus nodded well as far as i know with willies help hed been clean for a couple of months his works were still under his bed leitch shrugged as he tipped coffee into two mugs the temptations always there ill make another bet with you ill bet youve never tried heroin yourself youd be right me neither but the way ive heard it described well like i say the temptation never goes away you have to take it one day at a time rebus knew fraser leitch used to have a drink problem what the man was saying was that once you had it you had it for life because even if you dried out the cause of your problem was still there never quite beyond reach theres a joke ive heard leitch said as the kettle started to boil well its not much of a joke here it is what kind of boat should dixie have landed on i give up a sampan because theyre both close to junk like i say bad joke he poured water and milk into the mugs stirred them and handed one to rebus sorry we dont stretch to pure colombian is that another joke leitch sat down again i knew dixie he said i only met willie a couple of times willie wasnt a user he probably toked up maybe dropped some e pretty cleanliving then were you surprised when you learned what theyd done surprised i dont know hows your coffee terrible terrible or not its still twenty pence leitch pointed to a box on the desk rebus found a onepound coin and dropped it in keep the change giving a quid qualifies you as a patron leitch stuck his feet up on the edge of the desk knees bent he was wearing moccasins their stitched seams coming undone the bottoms of his denims were frayed too he usually described himself as just another old hippy hows the centre doing rebus asked were hanging on by the skin of our teeth you get district council funding some leitch frowned why do you ask what happens when the district council is replaced we pray the new authority keeps up our funding rebus nodded thoughtfully i was asking if you were surprised about willie and dixie leitch thought for a moment no he said i dont suppose i was except that it was a dafter stunt than i would have expected from them because willie was smarter than that he must have known theyd never get away with it dixie was a different proposition crazy at times a real heidtheba but willie could keep him under control like keitel and deniro in mean streets thats not a bad comparison dixie would do something daft and willie would slap him about the head dixie wouldnt have taken it from anyone else you realise a lot of what im telling you is secondhand like i said i only met willie a couple of times he paused you were there werent you i was there rebus said quietly he shifted in his chair they just willie put his arm around dixie and then leaned back over the rail and dixie went with him there was no resistance they didnt jump they just slipped away christ leitch took his feet off the desk why would they do that leitch got up and walked around the desk i think you know the answer to that or at least you have an inkling they couldnt go to jail i know rebus said two people die rather than go to jail another dies rather than be out rebus touched his mouth with a finger feeling the pain the pressure almost enjoying it leitch landed a hand on his shoulder have you seen a counsellor what dont the police have counselling why would i want counselling leitch squeezed rebuss shoulder and withdrew his hand its up to you he said going back to his chair they sat in silence for a while ever come across a guy called paul duggan rebus asked at last name rings a bell i cant put a face to it maybe ive just heard him mentioned around the centre he loaned willie and dixie his car he was their landlord oh right yes a couple of guys who sometimes come in are tenants of his any idea where they live abbey hill somewhere round there what about the name dalgety does it mean anything to you leitch thought about it and shook his head rebus dug into his pocket and brought out the photo of kirstie kennedy i know its a long shot he said but have you seen her around the centre this is the lord provosts daughter a couple of uniforms came asking about her just after she went missing the photos a bit out of date shed look different now then bring me a more recent photo dont tell me an outofdate pictures the best her parents can do rebus thought about that as he left fraser leitchs office the man had a point then again how many photos did rebus have of his own daughter precious few after age twelve he was standing in the short dark hallway half its walls taken up with noticeboards the other half with markerpen graffiti rebus studied the notices one card was recent its edges not yet dogeared it was printed unlike its ballpoint neighbours altogether a very superior card rooms to let cheap there was a phone number and a name the name was paul rebus removed the card and put it in his pocket next to kirstie kennedys photo he glanced into the two open rooms in one a couple of rows of plastic chairs were positioned in front of a tv the tv was a twelveinch black and white one lad was in there holding the indoor aerial above his head as he stared at the screen from a distance of about thirty inches another kid sat on one of the chairs sleeping in the other room three more teenagers two boys and a girl were trying to play table tennis with one cracked ball two rubberless bats and a paperback book their net was a row of upended cigarette packets they played quietly without enthusiasm or hope on the steps outside two more clients of the centre tried to bum first money and then cigarettes off him he handed out a couple of ciggies and even lit them shame about dixie eh he said fuck off porker they said moving back indoors back at his flat rebus finally bled the central heating system catching the water in empty coffee jars one thing about the flat when he moved back in plenty of empty coffee jars hed meant to ask the students why there were cupboards and boxes full of them he refilled the system wondering what the pressure gauges on the front of the boiler should read when he turned the system back on there was a gushing gurgling sound from the pipes and the boiler shuddered as the gas jets burst into life he went through to the living room and stood with his hand on the radiator it got warm but stayed only warm even with the thermostat all the way up and there was a drip from the bleedcock he twisted the key as hard as he could but the drip remained he tied a kitchencloth to it and let the cloth run down into one of the coffee jars that would collect the drips and stop them making a noise yes john rebus had been here before he sat in his chair lights out and looked out of his window on to arden street thinking of maisie finch thinking of her mother and his own mother there was frost on the roofs and bonnets of the parked cars a group of students were laughing their way back to their digs rebus poured himself a whisky and told the students how lucky they were everybody out there was lucky all the people sleeping rough and bumming cigarettes and plotting and scheming how to get ahead alister flower twisting and gnawing in his sleep gill templer still and unperturbed in hers frank lauderdale with an itch beneath his cast tresa mcanally feet up in front of the tv kirstie kennedy wherever she was they were all of them lucky edinburgh was a lucky fucking town two shreds the following tuesday rebus was at work uncharacteristically early but not so early as to be the first to arrive gill templer was already there her door ajar fighting her way through paperwork rebus knocked and pushed the door open a little further youre early she said rubbing her eyes what about you have you been here all night it feels like it that coffee smells good want me to fetch you one no just give me half of yours she handed him a clean mug and he poured half the contents of his beaker into it standing over the wastebasket he was able to see what shed been working on she was trying to acquaint herself with every ongoing case everything frank lauderdale had left behind tall order he said you can help hows that boss youre slow to type up your notes the mcbrane case and the pettiford especially id like to see them this morning do you know how fast i type just do it would you settle for one out of two ive a funeral on i want them both by lunchtime inspector rebus looked back at the open door there was still no one else around you know he said quietly im going to start taking this personally she looked up from her work whats that the way youve been treating me ever since you got here frankly it stinks at first i thought it was just for show but im not so sure i know youve got something to prove to everybody but that doesnt tread carefully inspector rebus stared at her finally she looked down at the work in front of her thanks for the coffee she said quietly i still want those casenotes by lunchtime so he went to his desk and worked on them he didnt like typing up casenotes the hard slog of always using the right words of getting everything right no police officer liked it when a report which had been painstakingly prepared was sent back by the procuratorfiscal because of some tiny flaw in the surface of the whole you were waiting for news that the precognition was being prepared and instead the case came back to you with a note unable to proceed as stands the reporting officer whose job was to liaise with the crown took most of the flak and rebus was ro on both the mcbrane and pettiford cases it was his job to make a case that the procuratorfiscal would accept he supposed it was gill templers job to make sure he did the work but her attitude still rankled as far as he could gather shed been a far from popular choice as frank lauderdales replacement if lauderdale hadnt been universally respected at least hed been a man and more than that hed been one of them gill templer had been brought in from fife and she was a woman and she didnt even play golf the female officers seemed happy enough the illfeeling was among the males only siobhan clarke rebus had noticed had a new spring in her step working under a woman maybe she saw in gill templer a future that could be hers but gill would have to step carefully traps would be laid for her shed have to be careful who she trusted rebus had so far given her the benefit of the doubt reckoning she was being hard on him because she couldnt afford to be soft so far it looked like a oneway street he took his finished notes to her office only to discover she was in conference with farmer watson he left them prominently on her desk instead and went to the washroom to change his tie removing the blue one and replacing it with black brian holmes came in as rebus was checking himself in the mirror off to a party then in a manner of speaking brian in a manner of speaking certainly there was enough booze in the kitchenette to start a fair old hootenanny but this was a wake rather than a celebration by the time rebus got to tresa mcanallys flat the place was bursting at the seams with middleaged men and women and their disgruntled offspring plus a few older souls who had the honour of being given chairs to sit on and in the middle of the living room dressed top to toe in black but with red gloss fingernails sat the widow the curtains were closed as were those of the neighbouring flats a sign of solidarity the scots always rallied round for a sendoff rebus squeezed his way through the whispering throng and held out his hand mrs mcanally he said she took his hand and exerted the minimum of pressure good of you to come then he was off again backpedalling before she could turn to someone and say this is the policeman who went to the school he saw wee shug flat out on the floor and missing half his head normally at these occasions the men retreated to the kitchen and got stuck into the whisky but here there was only the kitchenette separated from the living area by nothing more than a breakfastbar so the men had crammed themselves into the kitchenette for all the world like a rushhour busful they passed around clean glasses and then the whisky tumblers of sweet and dry sherry were passed out to the ladies soft drinks for the younger mourners though you didnt have to be too old to qualify for a nip of the harder stuff rebus took a glassful and toasted the small man next to him the man was in his seventies and wore a wartime charcoalandchalkine suit he had a pinched face and kept moving his lips pursing and puckering them when he spoke it was in an undertone heres to you then son slainte they drank for a moment savouring the cheap whisky savouring was better than having to talk one reason why so much whisky was consumed at funerals the hearse gets here in ten minutes the man informed rebus right a closed casket of course tresa mcanally had been denied a final peek at her husbands blasted remains heres the minister there was nothing wrong with the old guys eyesight despite the thick smeary lenses in his glasses rebus watched the minister as he moved through the room towards tresa mcanally he wore black with the white dogcollar and as he moved the crush of mourners parted before him ministers didnt make friends not easily they were like cops that way people were always afraid theyd say the wrong thing in front of them they had a skill though these men of the cloth they could conduct a conversation while remaining inaudible to all but the person they addressed the old man was unscrewing another whisky bottle different brand shes made the flat nice hasnt she i havent been here for a couple of years rebus nodded noticing that the huge tv set had been moved out to make more space he guessed it was in the bedroom he scanned the male mourners again looking for old lags known faces looking for someone who could have procured a shotgun for wee shug oh aye the old man went on its lovely now new carpets and wallpaper really nice and new tv rebus thought new front door and bedroom fittings that didnt exactly look superannuated money where the hell had the money come from new carpet in the hall too the man was saying he lowered his voice still further i suppose she did it for wee shug you know to make his coming home a bit more welcome i mean after a jail cell you want something nice rebus looked at the man more closely served time yourself a long time ago son back in the fifties saughton was a different place then everything was different and mind im not saying it was worse their drinks replenished he screwed the top back on and passed the bottle to the next man along rebus wondered how many more old lags there were in the crush around him then he saw someone else coming into the room and he stopped with his glass half an inch from his mouth she was dressed in black a small woman with a pillbox hat and a short veil which covered her eyes but not her mouth and behind her much taller a younger woman wearing a simple navy suit lowcut and tight at the hips it looked the sort of thing you would wear a blouse under but maisie finch wasnt wearing a blouse or anything else beneath it that rebus could see for now though he was more interested in the woman with her it was helena profitt rebus turned towards the drainingboard where a rubicund man hot and jacketless and sporting bright red braces was dispensing the drinks give us a couple of sherries rebus murmured in the mans direction the order was passed along and a few moments later rebus had his sherries he left his own whisky on the breakfastbar and carried them into the living room helena profitt was having a muted conversation with tresa mcanally so rebus tapped maisie finch on the shoulder when she turned towards him he handed her the glasses thanks she sniffed the contents before handing one glass on to helena profitt funny rebus said you never mentioned knowing miss profitt she smiled then took a sip of sherry and screwed up her face too sweet its loupin is there anything else whisky dark rum soft drinks maybe some vodka a voddy would slip down she surveyed the scrum in the kitchenette and changed her mind draining the glass so rebus said in an undertone how do you know helena profitt same way most folk in this room do she smiled again and turned to the widow tresa hen mind if i smoke the packet was already out of her pocket go ahead maisie a pause its what wee shug would have wanted he liked a ciggie himself taking their signal from this a lot of hands reached into pockets and handbags packs were opened handed round rebus took one from maisie and she lit it for him nice lighter he said it was a present she looked at the slim onyx and gold lighter before returning it to her pocket so rebus said miss profitt used to live in the tenement floor below this as more people arrived and had to offer their condolences or else needed to say goodbye before leaving rebus and maisie found themselves moved away from the widow and miss profitt they ended up by the mantelpiece rebus picked up a bereavement card it was signed simply from all shugs pals in saughton we shall remember him touching maisie finch said either that or a bit sick hows that inspector he noted she said inspector quite loudly the nearest mourners looked him up and down and he knew word would now go around depends why he killed himself he said maybe it had something to do with saughton tresa tells me he had the big c thats only one possible reason he found her eyes i can think of others she looked away almost casual such as guilt shame embarrassment she smiled sourly not in shug mcanallys vocabulary selfpity thatd be more like it rebus saw a pillbox hat and veil moving towards the door ill be back he said helena profitt was at the front door when he caught her miss profitt she turned to him i think wed better talk he led her into the mcanallys bedroom cant it wait she asked looking around her not liking the surroundings rebus shook his head the tv was in here sure enough giving them a narrow aisle to move about in youve been avoiding me he said she sighed tom told me hed told you you recognised mr mcanally that night of course i did did he recognise you she nodded im certain he did did he know beforehand that you were close to the councillor now she stared at him through her veil what do you mean close im his ward secretary thats all thats all i meant how could he have known no i dont think he knew she suddenly saw what he was getting at his suicide had nothing to do with me we have to check these things why didnt you say anything at the time i she sat down on the edge of the bed hands in her lap then stood up again abruptly rebus watched the bedcover float finding its level it was a waterbed disconcerted helena profitt patted her hat and tugged at her veil it didnt make much of a hiding place is it to do with maisie finch rebus asked she thought about it then nodded solemnly before bursting into a fit of loud sobbing rebus touched her shoulder but she spun away from him a mourner opened the door and looked in rebus got the feeling there were others out there all wanting to see the tears shell be all right he said closing the door firmly helena profitt had brought a hankie out of her sleeve and was blowing her nose rebus offered her his own handkerchief and she used it to dab at her eyes there was eyeshadow on the white cotton when she handed it back the door was pushed open again the man with the red braces stood there whats going on nothing rebus said the man glowered we know who you are maybe youd better leave what are you going to do throw me out the sweaty face creased in a sneer you lot are all the same and so are you lot rebus pushed the door hard until it closed he turned back to helena profitt what is it youre not saying he asked solicitously itll come out eventually you know i moved out of this tenement four years ago she said ive only been back a couple of times since i should come more often maisies mother misses my little visits four years ago after mcanally raped maisie he guessed she breathed deeply a few times to calm herself you know we didnt do anything none of us we all heard a scream i know i heard it but nobody phoned for the police not until maisie ran into tresas it was tresa herself who phoned to say her own husband had just raped their next door neighbours girl we heard the scream but we just went on minding our own business she wiped her nose again isnt that typical of this bloody city rebus remembered the words hed used so recently guilt shame embarrassment you felt ashamed he offered you bet i did i couldnt stand to live here any longer he nodded are you surprised maisie stayed on knowing mcanally would be back she shook her head maisies mum would never move besides maisie and tresa theyve always been close especially so since the rebus tried to imagine walking out of prison and into a situation like that how much closer had tresa and the younger woman grown in mcanallys absence tell me what happened that night what she tucked the hankie back into her sleeve the night of the assault whats it to you her cheeks were reddening with anger its none of your business its long past long forgotten forgotten miss profitt rebus shook his head i dont think so not by a long chalk then he turned from her and left the room he looked into the living room smoke hung in the air like winter fog he saw maisie perched on the arm of the widows fat armchair one slim leg crossed over the other she was holding tresa mcanallys hand and giving it a pat and tresa head bowed was listening to whatever maisie was telling her listening to it and managing to smile rebus would have called tresa mcanally feisty maybe even brassy but neither description fitted her just now maybe it was just the circumstances the funeral but he didnt think so cars here someone at the window said meaning that the hearse was arriving the minister got to his feet to say a few words a tumbler of whisky in one hand cheeks redder than they had been rebus pushed his way back into the hall slipped out of the open door and made his way down the tenement stairs the man in the braces leaned over the guardrail i hope we meet again pal some place where there are no witnesses the threat echoed down the stairwell rebus kept walking when he drove off he left a space kerbside for the hearse rebus wasnt the only one interested in shug mcanallys suicide hed read the newspaper article scanning it quickly first to see if he was mentioned he wasnt which was a relief mairie hendersons was one of three names sharing the byline it was impossible to see where her contribution started and ended except of course that shed interviewed rebuss daughter sammy and though sammy wasnt mentioned by name the outfit she worked for was scottish welfare for exprisoners or sweep as it preferred to be known the police called it sooty sweep like the other care agencies mentioned in the piece was concerned that hugh mcanallys suicide only a week after his release from prison was evidence of a problem of readjustment and a lack of real concern within the system sammys words to be sure police prison staff and social services were marked out for criticism the governor of hm prison edinburgh could do no more than explain to the journalists how inmates were prepared for release back into society a spokesman for sweep insisted that exprisoners sweep never called them offenders suffered the same psychological problems as released kidnap victims or hostages rebus could hear the words in sammys mouth hed heard them from her before hed been surprised to get a letter from his daughter a couple of months back saying shed got a job in edinburgh and was coming home hed phoned her to check what this meant and found it only meant she was returning to edinburgh dont worry she told him i dont expect you to put me up the job shed landed was with sweep shed been working for some time with inmates and exprisoners in london ever since shed visited a friend in jail and had seen the conditions and as she put it the loneliness this friend rebus had unwisely said what were they in for after which their conversation had become stilted to say the least she didnt want to be met off the train but he went to waverley anyway she didnt see him watching as she flung her armystyle kitbag and scuffed red rucksack on to the platform he wanted to walk forwards to greet her maybe throw his arms around her or more likely stand there in the hope that shed throw her arms around him but she hadnt wanted to be met so he stood his ground half hoping shed see him anyway she didnt she just looked around the concourse with a good deal of pleasure swung the rucksack on to her back and picked up her kitbag she was thin dressed in clingy black leggings doc marten shoes a baggy grey tshirt and black waistcoat her hair was long these days ponytailed with pieces of bright cotton threaded through it she sported several earrings in either ear and a nosestud she was twenty years old a woman and her own woman at that striding with confidence from the platform he followed her up the ramp out of the station a bright winter day was waiting for her he didnt suppose shed worry about the cold later shed come to patiences flat for a meal rebus had suggested vegetarian to patience just to be on the safe side i always cook vegetarian for the teens and twenties shed replied i might have guessed you would after that visit there had been others sammy and patience growing closer as patience and rebus moved even further apart until one day rebus had left giving the students who rented his flat their marching orders and moving himself back in two days later his set of keys to patiences flat had been handed over to sammy and shed moved her stuff into the guest bedroom not a permanent arrangement as both women said just something they wanted to do for now sammy was still there that first evening the evening of the stuffed red peppers rebus and sammy had argued about prison and exprisoners right and wrong society versus the individual sammy kept using the words the system rebus niggled her by using the term con although he agreed with at least some of her points well thought out persuasively argued he found himself setting up in opposition to her it was something he did not just with her glancing across the table at patience hed seen a weary smile shed told him before he liked to antagonise just to get a response know why shed said because conflict is more fun for you than consensus no it isnt hed told her im just the devils advocate thats all so hed ignored the weary smile and continued his joust with his daughter he closed the paper folded it and tossed it into a wastepaperbin gill templer came into the office hed been waiting there for her for close to fifteen minutes she didnt apologise you forgot to tell me she said that your daughter works for sweep its not an issue you should have told me he saw what she meant you mean before you gave an interview some woman reporter nice as ninepence until the end of the session then and tell me what is your feeling about one of your inspectors having a close relative so involved with sweep mairie henderson thought rebus probably not interested in the answer either just trying to discomfit the interviewee see if anything shook loose what did you tell her i told her no comment then i went straight to chief superintendent watson and asked him who the hell shed meant she paused it had to be you is that my cue for a song she slammed a hand down on her desk its your cue to get the hell out of my office rebus got the hell out rebuss appointment with the governor of saughton was in the late afternoon the guardhouse phoned ahead then let him through he was met at the other side of the gate and taken to the governors office there was an anteroom where the secretary sat behind a computer she was taking a phone call but nodded for him to take a seat you see she said into the receiver control shift asterisk is supposed to clear that but its not doing it she listened and tucked the receiver between cheek and shoulder so she could work on her keyboard with both hands no thats not working either hang on thats got it thanks bye she put the phone down and shook her head in exasperation sometimes theyre more trouble than theyre worth she confided to rebus the governor will be back in a couple of minutes thanks rebus said typewriters are about as hightech as i can manage they keep sending me on courses but after half an hour im completely bamboozled the door rebus had come through opened suddenly and the governor came in rebus stood up they shook hands and the governor led him into the inner sanctum sit down inspector i appreciate you seeing me sir the governor dismissed this with a wave of his hand its not often a suicide on the outside brings me into the equation but ive had reporters hounding me on this one mcanallys death seems to have stirred up a bit of debate they must be hard up for news he sat back resting his hands on his stomach and now he said ive got you the governor was a handsome man in his late fifties he peered at rebus over metalframed glasses he was bulky rather than fat and his silvering hair was thick and healthy his suit looked expensive his shirt laundered and his unfussy blue tie had a sheen that rebus took for silk he saw himself as a manmanager and was a public voice in the drive to reform scotlands penal system an end to sloppingout and cellsharing brighter better equipped halls a strong emphasis on vocational training education and counselling not every sightimpaired open university student knew that their braille text was probably transcribed by saughtons braille unit it wasnt all sunny though saughton had its drug problems its share of hivpositive inmates but at least it had a fulltime medical staff to cope or to begin to try to cope rebus had never met the governor before though hed seen him at functions and come across him in the media his name was jim flett or more often just big jim well youre right sir rebus said i am here to talk to you about hugh mcanally so i gather flett tapped a manila file on his desk the record of prisoner chall hmp edinburgh mcanally hugh jim flett opened the file ive had a read of this and ive been to talk to some of the warders and mcanallys fellow inmates he gave rebus a grin i think im prepared by the way something to drink im fine thanks this wont take long why was mcanally released so early not so early his good behaviour was taken into account as was his illness you knew he was ill inoperable cancer normally the stage of sentence he was at wed be readying to transfer him to the tff hostel whats that training for freedom hed have gone out unsupervised to a work placement but mr mcanally was a category c prisoner and only category ds qualify for tff in any event he was due parole what made him category c flett shrugged a bustup with a warder i thought you mentioned good behaviour the bustup was a while back the man was dying inspector we knew we werent going to see him in here again did he seem suicidal not as far as im aware im just glad he did away with himself on the outside it makes him your problem rather than mine what about aggro was he subject to threats or violence how do you mean he was a convicted rapist his victim legally a child at the time of the offence i hear the stories same as everyone else if youre a sex offender and youre not put in a separate wing you get beaten up people pish in your tea youre an outcast cant exactly be good for the spirit spirit flett gave a wry smile lets just say im not aware of any incidents of that nature if any occurred theyd be dealt with i dont suppose the victims lodge complaints that often you think you know so much about us inspector maybe you should be sitting this side of the desk no thanks look theres nothing in his time here that made anyone think he was about to stick a shotgun in his gub rebus thought for a moment did you know him no i didnt hed only been here eleven months where was he before glenochil any problems while he was there not according to the files look inspector i know what youre thinking what youre trying to put together but he didnt commit harrycarry because of anything that happened to him in here his cellmate was as shocked as anyone when he heard what happened mcanally had served two previous sentences its not as if incarceration was new or strange to him rebus thought again of willie and dixie of what would have happened to them in prison surely flett was saying its much more realistic to say that the illness wore him down and led him to kill himself with respect sir his previouses werent for rape of a minor flett stared at rebus then glanced at his watch letting him know the score just a couple of final questions sir how much money did he leave prison with flett had to check that in the file there was eight pounds sixty among his effects when he came in and other than that other than that he was entitled to the same benefits as any other exprisoner it seems an odd question to ask his flat shows signs of a recent overhaul im wondering where the money came from best ask his wife anything else who was his contact on the outside you mean his supervising officer flett looked this up too jennifer benn at social services rebus entered the name in his notebook well if thats all inspector the governor was on his feet he walked around the desk and smiled towards rebus and rebus suddenly knew the man was hiding something hed been edgy during the conversation as though expecting some awkward question to arise it hadnt and his relief was evident in that smile in his complete change of attitude rebus tried to think what the question could be out in the secretarys office while big jim was shaking his hand a final time he was still thinking about it ive let him off the hook he thought he reran the meeting in his head as he walked back to his car buggered if i know he announced to himself but as he sat in the idling car he knew he was going to have to find out that evening he visited one of only two dropin centres available to excons in edinburgh it reminded him most of fraser leitchs establishment except that here there was a colour tv rather than black and white nobody could help him hugh mcanally hadnt been near the place not as far as anyone knew he wasnt about to press the point or outstay his lukewarm welcome but he took a quick look round before he left in a corner of the main room a woman with a huge canvas bag slung over her shoulder was crouching down in conversation with a man who sat slumped in a chair the man stared past her not interested eventually the woman gave up wrote something on a pad closed it and returned it to the canvas bag the man leaned forward then and whispered something into her ear she listened her cheeks reddened and she got to her feet turning to walk away rebus was right behind her she brought herself up short to avoid a collision you wouldnt be jennifer benn would you thats me my lucky night rebus looked past her to where the seated man was rubbing his forehead trying not to let rebus see his face hiya pete the man looked up and seemed to place rebus evening mr rebus how long have you been out three weeks two days and you fancy another trip back already give the lady back her purse the social worker stared in surprise as pete slipped the bulging black leather purse out of his denim jacket she snatched it back and checked the contents do you want to press charges rebus asked she shook her head fine then lets have a little chat by the time they reached the front door jennifer benn had regained her composure where are we going somewhere im a bit more welcome theres a pub across the road i dont like pubs my car then she turned to him can i see some id i thought that scene back there would have been id enough but she wasnt budging so he dug out his warrant card which she inspected slowly all right she said handing it back we can talk here here they were on the pavement she wrapped a woollen scarf around her neck and pulled on sheepskin mitts she was in her latetwenties and had frizzy blonde hair and outsized glasses its freezing here rebus complained then best hurry up he sighed you were shug mcanallys social worker thats right im investigating his suicide she was shaking her head im afraid i cant help he never kept an appointment we never met did you report him she nodded but i didnt think anything would come of it what punishment do you mete out to someone with terminal cancer and with that she turned and walked quickly to her car rebus thought that shed asked a very good question indeed next morning he found himself summoned to chief superintendent watsons office gill templer was already there when he arrived she was standing with her back to the filing cabinet arms folded there wasnt much room three large cardboard boxes marked panotech sat on the floor by the desk my new computer the farmer explained sit down john the farmer looked like a man with bad news rebus had been here before same look same tone of voice id rather stand sir been up to anything we should know about john no sir nothing at all not that i know of sir why watson glanced towards gill templer i had a phone call yesterday evening from allan gunner gunner the deputy chief constable he doesnt often call me at home do i take it he had bad news rebus decided to sit down after all hm inspectorate of constabulary are thinking of investigating us us b division thats us all right its no joking matter nor was it hmic was independent of the police service it reported directly to the secretary of state for scotland hmics public remit encompassed examining police standards and indicating areas for improvement it inspected all eight regional forces each year but only four of these were full primary inspections they looked at rises in crime stats falls in detection rates and complaints from the public no problem there the recorded crime rate was steady when it wasnt falling and recent clearup rates were marginally improved but hmic could really screw up a stations working practices just by being on the premises there were long lists of questions to answer an initial preinspection followed by the full inspection and as everyone in the room knew hmic could sometimes stumble upon something better left unqueried or as the farmer put it you know those buggers john if they want to find dirt on us theres dirt to be found we dont exactly work in an antiseptic environment thats because we dont deal with people who wash behind their ears every morning what are you getting at sir so what if weve been picked out its the luck of the draw ah watson said holding up a prodigious forefinger i only said they were thinking of picking us out i dont get it the farmer shifted so far as he was able in his chair he was not a small man it was not a large chair to be honest neither do i the dcc was being bloody cagey i think the gist was were doing something naughty and if we stop doing it another division might find itself under scrutiny instead of us did he actually say that gill templer asked the farmer shrugged im giving my interpretation thats all now after his phone call i did some thinking i asked myself who would be getting up peoples noses well i know one copper whos like cocaine in that respect nobody sniffs coke these days sir watson just sat there unblinking ok rebus said standing again i went to see big jim flett yesterday probably a couple of hours before gunner called you why gill templer asked she looked furious that he hadnt told her beforehand mcanally the suicide the farmer frowned as rebus nodded the thing is sir theres something i dont know i just think theres something there why go all the way to warrender school to blow your brains out in front of a councillor a man who says he never even knew the deceased and how come the widows suddenly got money to spend those are two questions ive got a wheen more well the farmer said that might explain the second phone call also last night and also at my home it was from derek mantoni i dont know him councillor mantoni is chair of lothian and borders joint police board rebus saw now gillespie had been complaining to his friend he was asking about you john nice of him apparently youve rubbed councillor gillespie up the wrong way i should remind you that the councillor is a victim here and one whos been through a terrible experience the farmer sounded as if he was quoting derek mantoni inspector rebus gill templer said is there any reason to believe it wasnt a suicide no rebus admitted im sure it was suicide then i dont see the problem rebus turned to her well i do he jabbed his thumb into his chest to reinforce the point and now everyone suddenly wants it covered up she turned her head away from him john the farmer warned thats out of order ive been looking at the hours youve been putting in youre due some time off a lot of time actually its a quiet time of year rebus held the farmers stare youve got to back me up on this sir im telling you to take some time off thats all who is it youre scared of the dcc mantoni hmic the farmer ignored him take a week ten days clear your head inspector rebus slammed both hands down on the desktop a framed photo of the farmers family fell off and landed on a cardboard box gill templer stooped to pick it up youve got to back me up rebus repeated he knew gill was a lost cause he had eyes only for the farmer but the farmer wasnt looking ive given you an order inspector rebus gave one of the boxes a kick on his way out of the room when he thought it over later rebus didnt blame the farmer he was covering his arse so was gill if it came down to it now rebus was a free agent or at least a loose one he couldnt get anyone into trouble but himself and that was fine with him hed cleared his desk pushing everything into drawers and when he ran out of space the wastepaperbin hed left st leonards without a word to anyone there were just the two problems neither of them insignificant and he pondered them as he sat in the back room of the oxford bar with a half of caledonian eighty and a double malt the first problem was police routine gave his daily life its only shape and substance it gave him a schedule to work to a reason to get up in the morning he loathed his free time dreaded sundays off he lived to work and in a very real sense he worked to live too the muchmaligned protestant workethic subtract work from the equation and the day became flabby like releasing jelly from its mould besides without work what reason had he not to drink it worried him because now there was nothing to stop him raising two fingers to the shade of wee shug mcanally a man not exactly universally mourned and get on with some serious bewying instead he could spend a seventoten stretch in the ox no problem augmented by bettingshop gossip and nourished by pies and bridies it would be wonderfully easy then there was the second problem not unconnected to the first for now that he had so much time on his hands what was to stop him booking a dentists appointment the only thing to do was to keep working besides there were some things he needed to do in a hurry before word got around that he was on leave the first of these involved another visit to c division in torphichen place di davidson was again on duty to rebuss relief i can smell it off you davidson said leading him to the cid room what the drink how can you torture me like that theres another two hours before i finish my shift rebus saw that they were alone in the cid room i need the casenotes on mcanally the ones from the rape charge what for rebus shrugged i just need to see them davidson went to a desk drawer and brought out a bunch of keys you know john theres enough to be getting on with in the hereandnow he went to a walkin cupboard and opened it i dont suppose therell be a copy still here everythingll have been archived by now there were reports packed tight along each shelf on every spine in fat feltmarker was an officers name depending on whose copy the report was the spines faced upwards the base of each report facing out on the base was the name of the accused there was no mcanally so then theyd to traipse to another part of the building locate another set of keys and unlock a storeroom inside which stood a dozen tall doubledoored filing cupboards davidson stood in thought for a moment then pointed at one thats probably got the year were after he unlocked the cabinet there was a smell of musty paper much stronger than in the cupboard theyd tried earlier davidson ran his finger along each row of spines mcanally he said at last pulling out two thick files of a paper and handing them to rebus each was loosebound held together by two removable metal clips the blue covers were faded at their edges davidsons surname was on the spine rebus read from one of the covers the case against hugh mcanally born he flipped through both files not surprised to see their bulk consisted of witness statements enjoy said davidson relocking the cabinet rebus stopped off on his way home and bought a jar of coffee rolls bacon and two fourpacks of export he was preparing for a long haul the flat was fairly warm he emptied the jar beneath the leaking radiator and replaced it then turned the hifi on he washed three aspirin down with a swig of beer then checked his face in the bathroom mirror the skin around and below his nose was definitely inflamed when he waggled one particular tooth it felt deadened anaesthetised while its neighbours jangled like theyd been wired to the mains the blister on his palm had receded and now sported only a thin strip of stickingplaster beneath the plaster the engines serial number was still there im in great shape he thought im the perfect fucking specimen he took the beer through to the living room sat down with the reports in his chair and started to read he started with the summary of evidence barely glanced down the list of productions and list of witnesses skipped the annual leave of officers and got to work on the statements and tape transcriptions the witnesses comprised neighbours the victim the accuseds wife a couple of barmen and the police doctor dr curt as it turned out who had examined and taken samples from both victim and accused maisie finch had been examined in hospital where she spent the rest of the night under observation it was noted that her mother unaware of her daughters presence was in the same hospital at the time just one floor up hugh mcanally had been examined in the medical examination room at torphichen during the examination he kept protesting i used a johnny for fucks sake whats the problem these words had endeared him to no one the story from the victims point of view maisie had been alone in the flat her mum being in hospital for a minor operation at this time her mother was already all but housebound looking after her a fulltime occupation for maisie nobody had asked her how it felt to be cooped up all day with an invalid or how it felt when her mum had been taken into hospital rebus remembered his own meeting with her the bottles of strong lager the holiday mood maisie knew mr mcanally very well had known him for years she regarded him not just as a neighbour but as a family friend mcanally told her he had come to ask after her mother though he smelled of alcohol shed let him into the flat and offered to make a cup of tea he asked if she had anything stronger she knew there was a bottle of whisky in the bottom of her mothers wardrobe it had been there since her fathers death maisie went to fetch it and mcanally followed he pushed her on to the bed so she was face down and held her head down with one hand afterwards he mumbled something she thought it might have been an apology but maybe not he went out leaving the door to the flat ajar she could hear him tramping noisily down the stairwell she ran to mrs mcanallys door and thumped on it till she got an answer mrs mcanally herself called the police mcanally by his own admission left the tenement and headed for lothian road drinking in a couple of pubs he frequented this was backed up by the two barmen then he bought a fish supper and was finishing it as he approached the main door of the tenement where he was apprehended by two police officers who had been waiting in their car he was taken to torphichen place police station and questioned then charged mcanallys version was he had indeed gone to maisie finchs flat to inquire about her mother but also in the hope of having sex with maisie theyd had sex once before while her mother was asleep in the other room both times maisie initiated proceedings mcanally knew she was a good girl but thought she got bored at home he knew he was no spring chicken nor yet mr universe and her home life explained why maisie wanted to have sex with him i dare say i wasnt the only one maisie herself had never said anything never explained and mcanally wasnt really bothered so long as i was getting my hole after a minute or sos conversation in the living room maisie suggested going through to her mothers bedroom her reasoning being that her mother had a double bed while maisie only had a single asked to describe maisies bedroom mcanally was able to though this proved nothing since as he later acknowledged hed been in there the previous month to change a faulty lightfitting on the night in question they progressed to the mothers bedroom where mcanallys version intercourse took place doggy style asked why that particular position mcanally said he thought maybe maisie didnt like to look at his ugly old coupon rebus was glad he hadnt interviewed mcanally hed probably have taken a swing at him mcanally said he left the flat immediately afterwards as maisie didnt like him to hang about one thing he said was that maisie herself had provided the condom i cant run around with johnnies in my pooch tresad be bound to find them yes he was a choice article mr hugh mcanally rape cases could be difficult scottish law required corroboration not just one persons word against anothers with allegations of rape there was seldom absolute corroboration rapists didnt work to an uninvited audience but in this case there was the girls cry heard by some in the tenement though not by all and the fact that she made as davidson himself commented a stonking good witness she would go into the witness box not all rape victims would for very good emotional reasons and she would testify she would put the old bastard behind bars and she did asked about the cry mcanally at first said she was a screamer in other words that she cried out at the point of climax davidson had added a pencilled comment in the margin perhaps meaning to erase it later what young girl would climax with the likes of you mcanally then changed his mind and said there was no scream no cry at all which was excellent news for the prosecution who had witnesses ready to testify that they had heard a cry which point rebus mused though tiny in the wider scheme of the case was almost certainly what had swung the jury mostly it was his word against hers but there were witnesses to the scream witnesses like helena profitt miss profitt had given a statement but had not been called to give evidence at the trial that was probably the procuratorfiscals decision the fiscals office would have precognosced miss proffit and would have made a note for future reference that she was timid nervy and unlikely to perform well in court crown counsel had picked the best neighbours to show to the jury it was part of their particular skill rebus reached down for another tin of beer and found they were all empty he went to the fridge and found a solitary can a couple of months past its expiry it was freezing to the touch but had plenty of gas when he opened it he was drinking these days with one side of his mouth only avoiding the painful side with anything too hot or cold he put the can down and fried up some bacon cutting open two rolls he ate the rolls at the kitchen table it has to be serious he thought the governor of saughton the deputy chief constable maybe even the constabulary inspectorate they just didnt want him around why not that was the question it had to have something to do with mcanally it looked to rebus very much as though it had something to do with mcanallys time in saughton he went back into the living room and got out mcanallys list of previous convictions small beer he thought taking a drink hed been lucky though landing more than his fair share of fines and tickingsoff when a custodial sentence might have been more usual hed served a year one time eighteen months another both for housebreaking and that was about it otherwise it was just fines and admonitions rebus sat back forgetting to swallow the beer in his mouth he was thinking something something he didnt want to think there was only one good reason he could think of why wee shug had been so lucky one good reason why a judge might be so lenient time and time again someone had put in a word and who was it usually put in a word with the judge answer policemen and why did they do it rebus swallowed the beer he was a grass wee shug mcanally was somebodys bloody snitch next morning he woke up raring to go to work then remembered he had no work to go to no place he would be welcome just when he needed to ask some of his fellow officers a few very discreet questions hed lain awake half the night watching the amber streetlight on his bedroom ceiling tumbling configurations in his mind he couldnt get past the notion that mcanally had been somebodys eyes and ears on the street all good policemen had them anyone who wanted to get anywhere had them grasses stoolies snitches informers they had a hundred titles and a hundred job descriptions it made sense it explained those lenient sentences but then mcanally had crossed the line no judge was going to listen to too many pleas for leniency in a rape case four years off the street and a snitch lost his usefulness there were new bandits around people he didnt know and could never get to know four years was a long time on the street the world moved fast down there something else had occurred to rebus in bed around three am by the bluelit numerals on his clock it whatever it was whatever it was people were scared of had to do with mcanally yes but the councillor was involved too rebus had let the councillor slip from the equation hed been busy on fractions on one half of the board while the councillor sat untroubled on the other and the councillor unlike mcanally was still alive to answer questions rebus was only going to get so far following the trail of the dead it was time to concentrate on the living it was time to get concerned councillor tom gillespie lived in a huge baywindowed semi not five minutes walk from rebuss flat the house had been divided into two flats one on the upper storey one on the lower gillespies was the groundfloor property there was a trim lawn in front of the house and a low stone wall topped with black glossy railings which ended in arrowheaded points rebus opened the gate and walked up to the front door claycoloured roadsalt crunched underfoot spread up and down the path during the worst of the snow and ice now the ice had melted apart from trimmings of sooty white in corners the sun never reached and roads and paths throughout the city were blighted by salt as treacherous underfoot as the ice it replaced rebus could see movement behind the bay window as he rang the doorbell it was an oldfashioned pull affair the sprung bell chiming inside rebus heard an inner hallway door open then a lock being pulled the solid main door was opened by the councillor himself good morning mr gillespie mind if i have a word im up to my eyes in it inspector from within rebus heard a motorised whine then the sound of a woman sneezing gillespies arm was across the doorway blocking any attempt by rebus to enter it wasnt exactly costa del sol weather on the doorstep but the councillor was sweating i appreciate that sir rebus said but this will only take a minute did you speak to helena profitt i did yes and by the way thanks for setting the joint police board on me gillespie wasnt about to apologise i told you i had friends there was a yip from within like a pekinese getting a deserved kick up the arse and then a furious female voice tom tom gillespie pretended not to hear i think youre wanted indoors rebus remarked look this really isnt the time for tom for christs sake gillespie snarled turned on his heel and sprinted indoors the front door was closing on rebus with infinite slowness he pushed it open and walked into the hall bloody things jammed again the woman was saying why the hell cant you do this then gillespie trying to keep his voice low just dont let him in go on then a woman stumbled out of the front room like shed been pushed from behind she bumped into rebus and some empty files clattered to the tile floor damnation she said as the door closed behind her rebus could see that the baywindowed room was some kind of office he glimpsed a desk with a computer chests of drawers with heaped documents slewed across their tops he couldnt see whatever was making the noise and he couldnt see gillespie but he heard a slap as the councillor either punched or kicked a piece of machinery he helped the woman retrieve the files nice colours he said what she tucked some stray hairs back into place behind her ear she was a tall heavyboned woman with a face full of strong features her thick dark hair was shoulderlength and parted to one side a little lacking in life her eyes were full of life though her eyes were blazing she looked harassed but was dressed with thoughtful elegance in a pearlcoloured silk blouse and a long skirt of black watch tartan the files rebus explained the ones i always seem to buy are blue or grey or green these are well theyre more colourful she looked at him like he was mad they were only files a stationers on george street she said rebus nodded trying not to look like he was memorising the letters on the front of the file hed been studying not that the letters sdase were difficult to remember something jammed rebus asked she had been brought up a polite girl taught manners at home and in school she couldnt not answer a question so casually put a harmless inquiry the shredder she said rebus nodded confirming that he too had problems with his papershredder you must be mrs gillespie thats right hes got you helping him eh she tried to laugh pressganged i thought councillor gillespie had a secretary her smile vanished she was thinking up some lie to tell him when the door opened and gillespie emerged this time peering into the room rebus saw several cardboard boxes full of long thin strips of paper shredded documents gillespie propelled his wife gently but firmly back into the office closing the door after her i dont recall inviting you in inspector maybe youll want to talk to your friend councillor mantoni again gillespie pulled out a handkerchief well now youre here come into the kitchen he wiped the handkerchief across his forehead im parched he led rebus down the long hall past a sitting room and dining room they took a left past the blockedin staircase and passed through a shorter darker passage into the kitchen there was pine everywhere pine units pine tongueandgroove covering every surface except the floor which boasted boards freshly sanded and varnished a conservatory had been added to the back giving views on to the wide rear garden mature rose bushes and laurel hedge a small brick patio gillespie busied himself with the kettle i wont offer you a cup inspector i know youll be keen to be on your way im not that busy today actually mr gillespie but i wont stay for coffee rebus paused thanks for the offer gillespie opened a cupboard and glowered at the mugs and glasses within reflected glare thought rebus so what is it you want gillespie reached for a mug dog shit said rebus gillespie fumbled the mug but retrieved it what did you say dog shit councillor on the pavements the grass everywhere its a disgrace are you trying to tell me youre not here in your official capacity did i say i was no im here as a private individual a constituent voicing a complaint to his elected representative gillespie opened a cafetiere and poured ground coffee into it from a packet by the time he finished hed regained his composure well mr rebus he said people only usually complain in the summer thats when the offending article is at its softest and smelliest ive never received a complaint in the winter then im speaking for the silent majority gillespie managed a smile what do you really want if i had a mind i could construe this visit as harassment after what rebus had seen he didnt really want anything else but he was enjoying himself and what were holidays for if you didnt enjoy yourself just what i say he replied gillespie poured boiling water over the coffee grounds well im surprised at you why because id have expected you of all people to know that dogs fouling the byways are a matter for the police its down to the police to trace the owners and bring a prosecution and the council doesnt do anything on the contrary weve a dog warden section whose job is to educate owners to act responsibly the wardens also help the police in cases of prosecution the warden section is part of the ehd environmental health department precisely i can give you their number if you like its the least i can do for a constituent rebus smiled and shook his head he put his hands in his pockets and made as if to leave but he stopped beside the councillor and lowered his voice how scared are you what you look to me like youre shitting snowballs the councillor started sweating again he opened his mouth to say something then changed his mind and concentrated on stirring the contents of the cafetiere all the shit thats about these days rebus went on youve got to watch you dont tread in it you might end up on your arse isnt that right councillor just get out will you rebus turned to leave gillespie put out a hand to stop him inspector youre making a mistake not a threat a simple statement of fact talk to me gillespie thought about it biting his bottom lip then shook his head rebus stared at him willing him to change his mind but gillespie was scared it was in his eyes in the sheen of his face the man was terrified ill let you out gillespie said leading rebus back down the hall he had the cufetiere in one hand two mugs in the other through the office door they could hear mrs gillespie cursing the machine again she sounded like she was kicking it bit of a temper your wife rebus commented he saw that gillespie didnt have a free hand so did the kindly thing and opened the office door for him has he gone yet mrs gillespie snarled just on my way mrs gillespie rebus told her popping his head round the door taking a good look round nice to have met you her face was flushed anger turning quickly to embarrassment im sorry she said no need for that and rebus left them to it whatever it was it took rebus half the afternoon to decide that he was doing the right thing more accurately it took him ten minutes to make up his mind and a couple of hours to drink himself into a state where he was confident enough to follow through he wasnt just drinking though he was hunting eyes and ears open for news of rico briggs rico was just about the best and worst housebreaker on the east coast it wasnt that he was cackhanded he could be in and out of most homes in minutes flat be the occupants asleep slumped in front of the tv or making merry at a party ricos problem was that he was conspicuous and fences didnt like that rico had been a big hearts fan not missing a fixture in seasons except when hed served a wee stretch in peterhead one night in leith walk dizzy after a trouncing of the hibees rico had marched into a tattoo parlour and demanded the works next morning rico had looked at his face in his bathroom mirror and seen that both tender cheeks now boasted the hearts badge a maroon heart with a cross in the middle it took him only a day or two to start loathing his onceloved team which was ironic considering he was now a public postersite for the men of gorgie not surprisingly the tattoos were unique and as good as fingerprints as far as the police were concerned realising this rico had started sporting a balaclava when working which accentuated his other remarkable facial feature a nose the dimensions of the pyramid of cheops this too people tended to notice rebus had tried talking rico briggs into retiring and had been semisuccessful these days rico concentrated on passing his skills on to a series of apprentices hed even given rebus a few clandestine lessons in lockpicking they helped when the policeman mislaid his housekeys and at other times too rebus finally found rico in a bar off nicolson street a place whose sadfaced clients were usually in hiding after a haircut at the halfblind barbers next door surrounded by bad haircuts it was surprising how rico blended in hiya rico rebus said sliding on to the wooden stool next to him how are you doing rico had the daily tabloid folded at the quick crossword and was tapping it with a halfsize bettingshop pen the kind with a tenminute lifetime guarantee eight letters rico said in a voice like roadsalt msomethingrsomething on a desert island he looked to rebus marooned thanks in that case ill have a double rico chuckled not heard that one before mr rebus not since double barrel was at the top of the charts rebus ordered the drinks while rico rubbed both cheeks the idea being that if he rubbed them often enough hed sand the tattoos away so mr rebus is it a job rebus nodded wary of saying too much he might be surrounded by bad haircuts but nobodys ears had been severed tell you later they drank their drinks in silence the whole bar was quiet further down the bar a customer nodded to the barman for a refill and the barman nodded back a silent order rebus thought like monks which given the tonsures wasnt such a bad image they got out of the pub and walked towards the pleasance if they took a right theyd come to st leonards but they went left instead and headed to the cowgate and canongate they talked as they walked then entered a howff on the high street to toast the mission at six oclock dark overhead except for an arc of moon looking like someone had pressed their thumbnail into the sky rebus and rico sat in rebuss parked car engine running to keep the heater on they were across the road from the gillespie house and rebus was describing the layout rebus was more nervous than he would admit if rico were caught if he talked then rebus could end up one of big jim fletts clients rico asked a few questions and rebus supplied answers where he could ill go in through the conservatory rico decided youre sure about the alarm no alarm rebus said people were hurrying along the pavement faces down to avoid the icy wind which edinburgh fashion was blowing horizontally just at head height rebus was having doubts about the whole enterprise but could see no way round it he thought of something else hed wanted to ask rico know anyone whos just come out of saughton i dont mix with felons inspector of course you dont youve gone straight we both know that rebuss voice was quiet but insistent only if you did know anyone id like to talk to them nothing heavy or official just a chat a bit of info on saughton itself thered be a cash incentive thered be a drink in it for both of you well wouldnt do any harm to ask around no harm at all rebus agreed he looked over to the gillespie house what time will you go in two in the morning should do it best not stay here much longer though we dont want to attract attention rico had a point in marchmont you were always in somebody elses parking space there were barely enough gaps for the residents never mind visitors rebus put the gearstick into first well get a bite to eat he said hiy hold on rico was pointing towards the house the front door was standing open and mrs gillespie suddenly appeared carrying two black binbags behind her her husband carried two more they opened their gate and deposited the bags on the pavement outside something wonderful dawned on rebus he looked up and down the street sure enough a few bags were already out rubbish day the morn rico suggested rico it looks like i wont be needing you after all in the end rico helped load the boot rebus sat alone in his flat having paid rico off and dropped him back in the town centre one of the binbags had contained nothing but empty tins bags and boxes and now it sat outside the main door of rebuss tenement but the other three sat open in the middle of rebuss living room he emptied the first bag on to the floor strands of white paper fell in a shivering heap rebus picked up one strand it was the length of an a sheet and no more than two millimetres wide hed heard stories that shredded documents could be reconstructed all it took was patience colossal patience he was sure there were clever ways of doing it uv analysis or watermarkmatching or batchsorting but all he had were his eyes he couldnt just march into howdenhall and drop the stuff off too many questions would be asked he sat on the floor picked up a few strands and tried putting them together it took him about four minutes to realise the job was impossible he sat there smoking a cigarette staring at the strands they might tell him everything he needed to know he finished the cigarette poured himself a drink and tried again it took him a while to lose his temper he dragged the kitchen table through and sat at it then he brought the anglepoise lamp through from his bedroom and plugged it in the machine had jammed there was a chance not all the strips had been separated completely he didnt find as many as two strips still joined at any one point he swore for a while and walked around the flat emptied the coffee jar and set it back under the radiator then put his coat on and went to buy cigarettes and whisky the corner shop was closed when he reached it his watch said elevenfifteen he couldnt believe it was so late he walked on to the nearest pub and waded through the smoky shouting throng the barmaid gave him change for the cigarette machine but couldnt sell him a carryout it was after last orders she told him about a licensed chip shop he could try but it was a carrun away so he walked briskly back to the flat and sought out untried bottles there was a quarter of bacardi for emergency dispensation should he ever manage to drag a woman as far as his bedroom the thought of neat bacardi repelled him only slightly more than the thought of mixing it with anything which means he thought i cant be an alcoholic he unscrewed the top from the bacardi anyway and sniffed it then screwed it back on hed have to be a lot more desperate say come four in the morning then he remembered the freezer he opened it up and chipped away at the ice until hed broken through to two trays of ice cubes a single fish finger and a small bottle it was polish vodka a neighbour had given it to him after a trip home to lodz a present for feeding the cat for a week rebus found a glass filled it and belatedly toasted solidarity before draining it the stuff was as smooth as anything hed ever tried a third of a litre of eightyfour proof he took glass and bottle into the living room and put exile on main street on the hifi it sounded as good as ever he got back into the game then decided to leave the first bag and start on the second he filled the first bag back up then dumped bag two on to the floor and his doorbell rang it was a little after midnight the main door was sometimes left unlocked no need for visitors welcome or not to announce their presence until they were outside the door of the flat at this time on a thursday night rebus looked at the mess on the floor then went out into the hall and tiptoed to the front door just as the bell rang again he could hear two voices at least little more than murmurs suddenly fingers pushed open his letterbox rebus stood to the side of the door back pressed to the wall maybe he leaves the lights on when hes out aye and maybe hes halfshot and sleeping it off rebus turned the snib silently and yanked open the door siobhan clarke whod been peering through the letterbox stood up but rebuss eyes were on brian holmes halfshot is it brian im glad you hold me in such high regard holmes just shrugged its what id do on holiday rebus filled the doorway his arms folded so what are you doing canvassing polling or maybe you were just passing we were working brian holmes explained we went to get something to eat afterwards and when we ran out of interesting topics the conversation came round to you what about me we wondered siobhan clarke said what the hells going on rebus smiled you and me both he stood back from the doorway you better come in youre the first to arrive i havent even got the party snacks out he noticed a brown carrier bag on the landing behind brian holmes we brought our own party with us when holmes picked up the bag rebus heard cans and bottles collide youre always welcome here brian rebus said leading them indoors they sat in the living room staring at the pile of paper strips siobhan clarke took a gulp of coffee you stole these rebus shook his head a public service i saved the binmen a job holmes looked to siobhan we did say we were coming here to help yes but this lot she flapped her arms i doubt the blue peter appeal could sort this lot out talk about shreds of evidence rebus held up a pacifying hand look this is my problem not yours i wont be disappointed if you scurry off home in fact it would be better for you if you did we know said holmes rebus looked at him what do you mean siobhan clarke explained the farmer spoke to us this afternoon basically he warned us off he said you were on leave but he didnt think that would stop you sticking your nose in she looked up his words not mine weve been given new duties brian holmes added desk work restructuring the filing system prior to full computerisation to keep you busy yes and away from me they both nodded so naturally you come straight here rebus got to his feet you could be fucking up both your careers im not in cid to sort through a lot of old paperwork siobhan clarke retorted then she realised what shed said looked at the mound of shredded paper in front of her and laughed they all did they hit lucky with the third bag look siobhan clarke said its not just white paper rebus took a strip from her yellow card files he said they shredded the folders as well must be some machine brian holmes added thats a bloody good point brian the folders were a breakthrough the problem with the paper was that there was so much of it there wasnt nearly so much card and what there was could be grouped by colour the front of each file had a white printed label and these were what rebus wanted he wanted the reconstructed labels but even knowing what they were looking for it took time and effort rebuss eyes were stinging and he kept rubbing them which only blurred his vision get you two anything he kept saying they would only shake their heads rebus demolished the cans on his own he knew hed had too much when he polished off a tin of irnbru without realising it was nonalcoholic the streets grew quieter after the students had slouched home on the wings of blasphemy around twothirty the central heating clocked off and rebus turned on the gas fire they each worked on a different colour of folder i saw one of the folders when mrs gillespie dropped it rebus said it was marked sdase i presume the letters stand for scottish development agency and scottish enterprise scottish enterprise took over when the sda was wound up councillor gillespie by the way sits on an industrial planning committee so holmes remarked the sda file could be completely innocent certainly he had a genuine reason for having a file on the sda but why be in such a panic to shred it holmes conceded the point i think ive got something siobhan clarke said shed all but completed a yellow file the label intact save for a strip or two looks like the letters a c she said then a name haldayne rebus fetched the phone book there was no a c haldayne in edinburgh strange spelling brian holmes said ive never come across haldayne with a y misspelt siobhan clarke said the name of one of the councillors constituents rebus shrugged half an hour later it was holmess turn to complete a red file gyle park west he read out rebus wasnt paying much attention he was close to completing the last of the coloured folders this one a lurid green mensung he said looking up what the hell is mensung siobhan clarke yawned and rubbed at her eyes then blinked a few times looking around the room you know she said its a good job this papers lying everywhere without it this place would look like a tip it was six on friday morning when rebuss phone started ringing he fell off the chair the duvet sliding with him the phone was underneath one of the heaps of paper strips whoever you are he said whatever you want youre dead its siobhan sir ive been thinking about a c haldayne me too rebus lied ive been thinking about that funny spelling american names are sometimes spelt differently arent they is that why you woke me up well it would tie in with ac would it christ youre slow sir its six in the morning clarke all i mean is ac could stand for american consulate haldayne could be a surname and ac the consulate rebus sat up and opened his eyes thats not bad i tried phoning the consulate but got an answering machine it offered me a lot of options mostly to do with visa applications then put me through to the consulate proper but all i got was another answering machine message telling me the opening hours try again in the morning yes sir sorry for waking you thats all right listen siobhan thanks for helping me its no problem really then you wont mind doing something else he could almost hear her smile what that shredder im wondering how long gillespies owned it you want me to check yes will do goodnight sir goodnight clarke rebus put down the receiver and decided to get up half a minute later he was asleep on the livingroom carpet on sunday rebus was invited to oxford terrace for afternoon tea he was glad of the break having spent much of the previous fortyeight hours trying to piece together some of the strands of a paper he hadnt made any progress but it had taken his mind off his swollen gum by saturday afternoon hed had enough and phoned a dentist but of course by then all the dentists in edinburgh were in the clubhouse deciding over a second gin whether to bother with eighteen holes or in this weather just settle for nine on sunday afternoon dress smart but casual he went to start his car and found it recalcitrant probably a loose connection he looked under the bonnet but was no mechanic he was alone on the street no one around to give him a jumpstart so he went back indoors and called for a cab noticing too late that he had oil on his hands a smudge of which had transferred itself to his trouser leg he was not in the best of moods as his driver took him north across the city sammy answered the door she was wearing thick black tights with a short jumblesale dress falling over them under the dress she wore a white tshirt youre almost on time she said we werent expecting you so soon did patience teach you that one he followed his daughter down the hall into the living room lucky the cat took one look at rebus seemed to remember him and stalked off into the conservatory rebus heard the catflap rattle shut now it was only two against one the odds were improving in rebuss favour he knew there were things fathers said to their daughters little criticisms they were expected to make to show they cared but rebus knew what his little criticisms would sound like theyd sound like criticisms so he kept his counsel patience came out of the kitchen wiping her hands on a dishtowel john hello patience they kissed the way friends did a peck on the cheek a hand on the shoulder be about two minutes she said turning back into the kitchen he didnt think shed really looked at him go into the conservatory sammy again led the way the table had a clean white cloth on it with some dishes already laid patience had brought her potted plants indoors for the winter leaving not much room for anything or anyone else the sunday papers were heaped on the windowledge rebus chose the chair nearest the garden door looking out of the conservatory window he could see in through the kitchen window patience was busy at the sink her face lacking emotion she didnt look up liking it all right rebus asked his daughter she nodded its great and sos patience hows the job very stimulating not easy but stimulating what do you do exactly sweeps pretty small we all muck in im supposed to be developing communication skills in my clients rebus nodded you mean so they can be a bit more polite next time they mug their granny she glowered at him and he raised his hands just a joke he said maybe you need some communication skills yourself hes as blunt as a butt to the head patience said bringing in the teapot can i help sammy offered you sit there ill be back in a second she was away far longer than a second there was no conversation between times rebus watched lucky the cat staring at him from the garden path patience returned with plates of cakes and biscuits his mouth was imploring him no hot drinks no cakes or biscuits no sugar no crunching ill pour sammy said there was a clatter as lucky came back in seeking tidbits cake john patience said offering him the pick from the plate he took the smallest item he could find a thin endslice of madeira patience regarded his choice with suspicion hed always preferred ginger sponge and she who hated it had bought one specially sammy patience said try the ginger its a bit sweet for me sammy replied ill just have a biscuit fine this outfit of yours rebus began its called sweep sammy reminded him yes sweep who funds it weve charitable status we get some donations but spend more time than we ought to thinking up fundraising schemes the bulk of the money drips down from the scottish office she turned to patience weve this brilliant guy he knows just how to word an application for funding knows what grants are available patience looked interested is he nice sammy blushed hes great and he deals with the scottish office rebus asked yes sammy couldnt see where this was leading she worked with people who were mistrustful of police officers and other authority figures mistrustful of their motives her colleagues were careful what they said in front of her shed been open with them from the start shed stated on the application form that her father was in edinburgh cid but there were some people who still didnt trust her entirely she knew one problem was the media when the media learned who her father was they sought her out for a quote her background made it more interesting they called it personalising the issues there were some people in sweep who felt resentful of the attention she got she didnt really blame them it was the system more cake john the catflap clacked again as lucky went back outside no thanks patience rebus said i think maybe ill try the madeira sammy said which left an awful lot of ginger cake you havent touched your tea john im waiting til it cools in the past hed always liked it scalding why are you so interested in sweep all of a sudden sammy asked him im not but i might be interested in the scottish office sammy looked like she didnt believe him she started to defend sweep going on at length her cheeks colouring with conviction rebus envied her that sense of conviction then he said a couple of things and an argument started he couldnt help himself hed just had to take a contrary point of view he tried drawing patience into the debate but she only shook her head slowly and sadly finally when sammy had collapsed into a sulk patience was ready with her summingup you see sammy your father is the old testament type retribution rather than rehabilitation isnt that right john rebus just shrugged drank some lukewarm tea and absentmindedly chewed on a slice of buttered ginger cake and hes the classic calvinist too patience went on let the punishment fit the crime and then some thats not calvinism rebus said its gilbert and sullivan he sat forwards in his chair besides the problem is that sometimes the punishment doesnt fit the crime sometimes theres punishment and no crime at all other times theres crime but no punishment and worst of all he paused nearly all of the time theres unfairness he looked at sammy wondering what sweep would have done for willie coyle and dixie taylor wondering if anything at all anything worth a candle would have been left of them after prison eventually they found other things to talk about sammy didnt contribute much she just kept staring at her father as if seeing him afresh the sky outside conceded defeat and collapsed from slategrey to lateafternoon black while patience and sammy were clearing the table rebus stared at lucky through the window then went over to the catflap and locked it shut the cat saw what he had done it miaowed at him once registering its protest rebus waved it cheerio they sat in the living room and patience handed over a few things hed left behind after the move his secondbest razor some clean handkerchiefs a pair of shoelaces a tape of electric ladyland he stuffed everything into his jacket pockets thanks he said youre welcome sammy saw him back to the door and waved him off that evening back at the flat rebus sat listening to hendrix with a lined pad of paper in front of him there were some words on it sdase scottish office a c haldayne us consulate mensung not in phonebook gyle park west industrial estate he knew about gyle park west because hed driven out there that morning it was a lowrise sprawl of smallish industrial and commercial units sited next to the imposing panotech electronics company at the entrance to the estate there was a sign listing the various companies on the site including deltona he remembered that salty dougary worked for deltona and that deltona provided microchips for panotech the panotech factory being more of an assembly line constructing computers from components sourced elsewhere none of which seemed to tie councillor gillespie to wee shug mcanally none of which was in itself suspicious the councillor was on an industrial planning committee which was excuse enough for owning files on the sda and scottish enterprise and on gyle park west but then why the panic the hurry to destroy those files that was what interested rebus as he drove out of gyle an area of the city he didnt really know he realised something else gyle itself had boomed in the eighties gaining new homes industries even its own railway station before then it had just been a place near the airport the airport had been its big advantage in the eighties making for good fast communications these days gyle had an identity and a lot of that was down to the injection of cash into the place but there was something else in gyles favour its district councillor just happened to be the lord provost cameron mcleod kennedy the telephone rang bringing him out of his reverie he snatched the receiver hello hello yourself it was mairie henderson i was beginning to think youd forgotten me rebus said ive only finally managed to track down labarum rebus picked up his pen and moved the pad closer the reason i had trouble was it doesnt exist what not yet at any rate its a panotech project do you know who they are the computer company thats right labarum is something theyve been toying with see the problem with silicon glen with the whole scottish electronics industry is that its a manufacturer it puts bits and pieces together but thats about all everythings sourced elsewhere not everything theres deltona a very small cog in the machine what we need in scotland is a software giant a microsoft somebody researching developing and producing software to go into the machines labarum thats right but my source tells me its not up and running yet theres a question of funding the talents there but to keep it in scotland is going to cost money lots and lots of money she paused my source was curious how did you hear about it i saw a business plan you did where at panotech no what could he tell her in a sublet council house in stenhouse hiding behind a teenagers paperback collection where then the city chambers rebus started why do you then he thought about it a plan to start up a computer software company presumably in gyle park west he looked at the writing on his pad the district council would want to discuss it theyd need to be aware of it tom gillespies committee would certainly know about it and if it was to be sited in gyle park west if it had anything to do with the district council at all then the lord provost would know about it cameron mcleod kennedy rebus picked the business plan off the floor and looked at the initials on the front page mairie was telling him shed drawn a blank with dalgety but he wasnt listening ck he said quietly cameron kennedy jesus mairie those two kids did know kirstie kennedy after all on monday morning rebus went to the national library on george iv bridge he passed through the security barrier and climbed the imposing staircase at the main desk he explained what he was looking for and was issued with a oneday readers card then he found a spare computer console and sat down at it reading the instructions for using the online system his search didnt take long there was desperately little on the scottish development agency even less on scottish enterprise he was sure that before its demise the sda had been under the aegis of the scottish office so tapped scottish office into the computer there were a lot of entries he went through screen after screen of them welfare roadwidening schemes grants to the fishing industry corporal punishment but nothing new on either the sda or scottish enterprise across the road in the central library he met with similar results the edinburgh room directed him to the scottish library downstairs and the scottish librarys microfiches were every bit as unhelpful as the hightech facilities across the way finally rebus approached one of the librarians she sat at a desk sorting newspaper cuttings into five distinct piles yes she whispered im looking for information on the scottish development agency have you checked the fiches yes well those are our holdings she thought for a moment you might try the scottish office direct yes he might at that he walked down the high street and across north bridge then made down the side of the st james centre noting that anthony wasnt on his usual pitch to where the scottish office had hidden itself in a concrete box called new st andrews house he told the guard on the door what he wanted and was pointed in the direction of the reception desk the woman there was very pleasant but couldnt help she phoned up to the library and publications room who couldnt help either rebus found it hard to believe that there was no history of the sda available they say nobodyd be interested she explained putting down the telephone well im interested you could ask at the hmso bookshop on lothian road yes she saw the look on his face ive some other literature here you could take away with you desperate for something to show for his morning rebus picked out a few leaflets one of which was an introduction to hm inspectorate of constabulary rebus wondered if it would mention anything about bribery thanks anyway he told the receptionist there was a display in the reception area and he went over to look at it new st andrews house was about to relocate to leith the move was costing millions rebus didnt feel any better for knowing where his taxes were headed sleet was coming down as he left the building which gave him the excuse he needed to drop into the cafe royal it was elevenfifteen and he was the second customer of the day he liked the place when it was empty it was one of the few bars he knew which had less atmosphere the busier it got his feet were tingling from the walk hed left his car at home only expecting to walk as far as george iv bridge the sleet had stopped by the time he left the bar he walked along george street in order to avoid the shoppers on princes street then headed up lothian road a lothian road wind was one of natures wonders people were walking into it at an angle close to fortyfive degrees the headwind could exhaust you in minutes rebus kept his eyes to the pavement and concentrated on putting one foot after the other like he was getting the hang of false legs the new convention centre was up there was a lot of recent building work around the city the festival theatre convention centre court annexe national library annexe not to mention the new scottish office hq he stopped in a doorway to catch his breath and to consider the scale of the building programme new roads new developments there was talk of building another road bridge across the forth but where was the money coming from he walked on deep in thought and entered the hmso shop hed been explaining his needs to the counter assistant for about thirty seconds when the man started to shake his head i havent finished yet rebus snapped the man listened in silence and when rebus was finished he advised you could try scottish enterprise direct he brought out the phonebook to find its address the hq was in glasgow but there was a branch in edinburgh leel lothian and edinburgh enterprise limited had offices in haymarket terrace which wasnt that far to walk not compared to the distance hed come the smart new building which housed leel boasted two very boredlooking receptionists and no guard at all on the door he explained that he wanted general background information agatha will bring down what weve got he was told with a pleasant professional smile if youd like to take a seat he sat down and read the bumf spread across the table in front of him he noticed that his calves were aching this he thought is called exercise some people did it every day the lift opened and a young woman walked towards him she too had a stepfordwifely smile for the public as she handed over a lavish folder inside which was a set of glossy documents this is all weve got at the moment she said thank you agatha this is fine since he was so close he dropped into torphichen for a coffee davidson wasnt around but dc robert burns was so rebus chewed the cud with him enjoying the feel of being back inside a cop shop then he asked burns for a favour i need a lift home rab he said medical reasons back in his flat rebus read through what little he had he hadnt found anything on gyle park west or anyone or anything called mensung the sum total of his recent discoveries had nothing to do with councillor gillespie at all but what he did know was that kirstie kennedy had known willie and dixie in some capacity how else to explain a document belonging to the lord provost turning up in willies bedroom what he didnt yet know was why it was there he assumed kirstie had taken it from her parents house but why had it meant something to her and why had willie hidden it his phone was ringing it was siobhan clarke whereve you been she asked walking walking how are things at st leonards the chief super is keeping tabs on brian and me and he keeps piling the work on so you havent been able to do anything on the contrary ive some interesting news councillor gillespies document shredder wasnt bought it was rented theres a business supply company in stockbridge they hire out all sorts of office equipment which reminds me when you get back theres a little surprise for you what the new pcs have arrived good we could do with a few more men on the beat gosh her voice dripped irony ive not heard that one today anyway theres one on your desk plugged in and ready to run when did gillespie rent the shredder wednesday he told the shop assistant hed been trying to find one for a few days but they were too expensive to buy thank god hes mean with money or we might never know hed shredded anything want to hear the rest i finally got through to the consulate and asked to speak to haldayne she paused they told me mr haldayne was out of the office his first names richard i got them to spell his surname for me it has a y in the middle youre a genius want to hear the rest rebus forgot all about his sore calves his weary feet go ahead i ran a check on mr richard haldayne have you ever had dealings with the diplomats in town no well i have i handed out a few parking tickets when i was in uniform my boss said i was wasting my time ticketing a diplomatic plate they never pay their fines because were not allowed to prosecute them so you looked in the computer eighteen unpaid parking tickets dating back to thats under two a year which counts as lawabiding for a diplomat its still a lot of tickets an officer might want a quiet word with mr haldayne about them just dont get caught sir same goes for you clarke and thanks he put the phone down and tapped his fingers on the receiver it was a start definitely a start he lifted the receiver again and dialled sammys work number she wasnt there the woman who told him this sounded upset im her father rebus said is anything wrong she was in a terrible state someone had to take her home why was she in a state her landlady the woman sniffed what about her landlady well shes upset and she got sammy all upset rebus stopped pretending to be calm upset about what i love cats the woman said what cats its her landladys cat it was torn to bits last night by somebodys dog rebus finally plucked up the courage to phone patiences flat and was relieved that sammy herself answered i heard he said hows patience shes gone out she was it was horrible rebus swallowed what happened lucky was in the garden and some dog must have come over the wall lucky ran to the catflap to get in but the catflap was locked her voice fell and that was that oh dear said rebus the thing is dad patience blames me im sure thats not she says i must have locked the flap shes hardly spoken a word to me since i got back the lock must have fallen by itself i dont know but i know i didnt do it look sammy the reason im phoning yes rebus stared at the notes in front of him sweeps contact at the scottish office can you give me his name he had an appointment that afternoon with the lord provost rebus hadnt been specific on the telephone hed just told the secretary that it was part of an investigation hed been careful not to preface the word with official policed the secretary had taken his home number and called him back the lord provost could see him for five minutes at four oclock five minutes should do it rebus had said as he walked through the main door of the city chambers he looked down at the floor aware that directly beneath it was mary kings close edinburghs buried plague street theyd covered the street up and built on it anew that was the edinburgh way to bury and forget the lord provost came out of his office to meet him he looked tired his pale face deeply lined his square jaw slack he had dark hair streaked with silver and thick black eyebrows it was a strongly defined face the kind that might have been found a generation back at the coalface inspector they shook hands the lord provost turned to his secretary my constitutional he said ill be five or ten minutes he turned back to rebus i like to get out of here for a few minutes in the afternoon it clears my head do you mind rebus said he didnt no one on the street seemed to recognise cameron kennedy he crossed the high street and nodded towards st giles cathedral rebus followed him into the huge old church it was empty save for a party of three tourists who huddled around their guidebook rebus and the lord provost walked the central aisle how can i help you inspector well sir its about your daughter the lord provosts face became more animated have you found her no sir but i know where shes been quite recently you remember those two hoaxers dont i just you were in that terrible crash werent you rebus nodded the thing is it may not have been a hoax after all how do you mean well the girl you spoke to on the telephone ach i dont think it was kirstie it could have been theres evidence she knew the two boys who died the lord provost looked at him evidence something we found in a bedroom rebus brought out the business plan and handed it to the lord provost this is yours isnt it sir the lord provost studied it where did you say you found it it was hidden in the bedroom belonging to one of the boys do you know when and where you lost it no i it was a while back i thought id taken it home with me kirstie probably took it with her when she left the lord provost nodded slowly the question is why i mean did it have any significance for her i dont see how it could me neither i was hoping you might help take a look at the last page please the lord provost turned to the last page and looked startled did you write that sir no he was staring wideeyed at the name is it kirsties writing i dont know well do you know what it means the lord provost shook his head slowly and closed the report inspector i it seems to me maybe im making too much fuss over kirstie im sure shes managing fine what are you saying im saying im grateful to the police for trying to trace her but maybe its time to call a halt rebus narrowed his eyes why now he made to take the report back but the lord provost was folding it into his pocket does there have to be a reason is it something to do with that report youve read it yes sir its just an initial report of a possible business venture in gyle park west the lord provost nodded a new subsidiary of panotech youre well informed inspector rebus shrugged im just curious why kirstie would take it and why it was kept hidden like it had some importance kennedy smiled its of no importance inspector its a projection its just something that might happen god knows we could do with it whys that sir the jobs of course tell me is the labarum plan before any committee at present the lord provost sat in a pew rebus sat one pew in front of him i dont see what that could have to do with my daughter rebus shrugged im just curious it will be discussed soon yes by councillor gillespies industry committee initially yes look i really dont see what this has to do with kirstie i accept that she could have taken the document from my office at home id say if it was anything it was an act of pure rebellion she took it because she could is she a rebel then sir arent all teenagers not all teenagers are drugusers sir rebus watched the colour come back to the lord provosts cheeks what did you say thats why you didnt have a more recent photo to give us junkies arent exactly photogenic the lord provost shot to his feet how dare you the tourists stopped consulting their guidebook then tell me im a liar rebus said quietly the lord provost opened his mouth then closed it again tell me im a liar and ill take back what i said cameron kennedys eyes were glistening in the halflight he looked all around him at the frayed standards hanging limply from the walls at the altar and the windows and the roof then he looked back to rebus shook his head and walked away rebus sat a few minutes by himself hands clasped in his lap he didnt exactly feel good about himself but then that was nothing new the name of sweeps contact at the scottish office was rory mcallister and he agreed to meet rebus for lunch the next day suggesting an italian restaurant at the top of leith walk when rebus arrived at twelvethirty mcallister was already there hed just about completed the scotsman crossword with an elegant chrome ballpoint pen he stood up long enough to shake hands rebus noticed he was drinking mineral water stick to the businessmans lunch mcallister prompted as a waiter handed rebus an oversized menu so rebus stuck to the businessmans lunch rory mcallister was in his late thirties with thinning neatly cut hair and a face which still seemed to bear traces of both puppyfat and acne he peered at rebus with eyes slightly narrowed as if he might need spectacles but was too vain to wear them his dark wool suit went well with a creamcoloured shirt and grey tie knotted tightly at the throat every inch the civil servant rebus thought mcallisters voice was educated edinburgh nasal and lilting not wanting to let go of the ends of syllables so inspector he said putting his newspaper out of sight under the table your call was intriguing what is it you want exactly i want you to tell me about the scottish office mr mcallister i also need to know about the sda and scottish enterprise well mcallister started to unwrap a breadstick lets order while i collect my thoughts shall we he spoke to the waiter in a quiet firm voice rebus knew the type loud only in agreement never in denial when roused to anger hed bet mcallisters voice would drop to a whisper the tomato soups not bad rebus was informed ditto the veal but the pollo is very good too and as for the wine rebus shrugged assent with any suggestion mcallister might make a half each of house white and red the civil servant snapped shut the wine list another piece of business brought successfully to a close he waved to two diners across the room their suits were like a uniform the restaurant was filling quickly half the diners looked like refugees from new st andrews house so mcallister clapped his hands together and rubbed them you want to know about the scottish office well shall i start at the bottom or the top youve met me so thats the bottom taken care of he smiled to let rebus know this was a joke sammy had said mcallister was a highflier clever and dedicated and helpful so he went on maybe ill start at the top the top of course being one of two men depending on your situation you can say that the secretary of state for scotland is the head of the scottish office and as far as the public is concerned youd be right but politicians come and go the scottish office remains youre saying the real head is the most senior civil servant exactly and thats the permanent undersecretary more usually known as the permanent secretary why bother with two titles mcallister laughed a sound like a pig at the trough dont question just accept a basket of bread rolls arrived and he broke one into three now the scottish office has responsibility for most functions of government in scotland excepting defence foreign policy and social security weve a small outpost in whitehall but most of us are based here either in st andrews house or new st andrews house st andrews house being its on regent road you know it looks like the reichstag oh the power station mcallister conceded the image thats where the secretary of state and his advisors do their work the rest of us are relegated to the neobrutalism of new st andrews house until victoria quay is ready two bowls of thinlooking tomato soup arrived the secretary of states retinue consists of the likes of the lord advocate and the solicitorgeneral theyre both ministers of the crown of course of course plus a minister of state and three pusses pusses mcallister wiped the corners of his mouth with his napkin dont tell anyone i called them that parliamentary undersecretaries of state i thought you said there was only one mcallister shook his head dont confuse parliamentary with permanent the permanent undersecretary is the only one whos a civil servant hes the only one who is permanent mcallister nodded he took some soup and chewed on his roll preparing for another onslaught the wine had arrived and he poured a glass of white for himself rebus opted for red now mcallister said we come to the departments he counted them off on his fingers soid soed soend sohhd soafd and shamefully prosaic central services rebus smiled mr mcallister i think youre purposely trying to bamboozle me mcallister looked shocked no i assure you look what i really want is a rundown on the sda and scottish enterprise well get to them dont worry the waiter came to take their bowls bit peppery today mcallister told him not a complaint a simple matter of interpretation the civil servant was halfway through his next dissertation before rebus realised theyd moved on to the topics he was interested in so he was at sohhd until the lecs came along the sda and hidb became se and hie and the poor man whod been responsible for rdgs and rsa found himself keep going you might just drift back into english mcallister produced another snorted laugh maybe i dont have enough dealings with the public im used to people who understand the codes well i dont understand the codes so humour me mcallister took a deep breath the sda he began was set up by wilson in some say to appease the rising nationalism of that time it had a budget of million which was not inconsiderable for the time and took over from three old existing bodies including the siec the scottish industrial estates corporation the siec brought with it twentyfive million square metres of factory space sounds like a lot a hellish lot a lot to keep occupied the sda got busy its been estimated there were as many as five thousand projects under its aegis at any one time and remember the sda didnt cover the whole of scotland there was the highlands and islands development board too in fact hidb was by far the elder of the two the pasta starters arrived mcallister sprinkled parmesan cheese over his and got to work with his fork then someone had the bright idea of getting rid of the sda he shook his head do you know the old saying if it aint broke dont fix it the sda was in good fettle it had been investigated by several bodies and committees and given a clean bill of health it did get into trouble over the glasgow garden festival and over a deal with a building contractor called quinlon but by then the blueprint for scottish enterprise had already been set up on the first of april note the date the sda and hidb became scottish enterprise and highlands and islands enterprise basically the changes were twofold the new agencies took on the scottish remit of the training agency and more importantly the central role of the sda became more devolved how so rebus wasnt touching the wine he needed all his wits about him authority was devolved to a network of privatesectorled local enterprise companies lecs for short like lothian and edinburgh enterprise limited yes leels one is there any scottish office control oh yes scottish enterprise is sponsored by soid the scottish office industry department mcallister gave a round of silent applause which leads us rebus said to funding oh i could talk all afternoon about funding its my specialty so whats scottish enterprises annual budget mcallister puffed out his cheeks around four hundred and fifty million rebus swallowed the last of his pasta forgive me that sounds like a lot well the money has to be split it covers enterprise environment youth and adult training plus admin costs well put like that i can see it represents excellent value for money mcallister nearly choked with laughter you sound just like a civil servant i was being ironic tell me mr mcallister why did you agree to meet me the question took mcallister by surprise he took time forming his answer ive never met a police officer before he said i suppose i was curious besides its nice to meet someone whos actually interested in what we do no matter what his motives you know only about one in three voters in this country even knows theres such a thing as the scottish office one in three he sat back and opened his arms and weve got a budget of millions tell me rebus said quietly any word of any impropriety at scottish enterprise rebus nodded no none at all what about the sda one waiter removed their bowls another set down the main course and accompanying vegetables mcallister tucked in he swallowed the first mouthful before answering rebuss question if there had been inspector it would be dead and buried by now when the sda became scottish enterprise the accounting procedures were changed new setup new set of books like wiping the slate clean so what would have happened if any impropriety had been found mcallister made a sweeping motion with his fork under the carpet with it rebus pondered this wiping the slate clean under the carpet the district council was about to disappear just as the sda had done you know mr mcallister you dont seem very curious about why i want to know about the sda and scottish enterprise mcallister chewed on that i suppose youll tell me if and when youre ready until then i dont see that its any of my business im not the curious sort inspector in my line of work thats seen as a strength after a while rebus asked who appoints the boards at se and hie the secretary of state mcallister poured the last of the wine into his glass not on his own of course hed be advised by the permanent secretary that after all is the job of the permanent secretary to advise though he implements too of course mcallister glanced at his watch then signalled for the waiter i dont know about you he said to rebus but i think i might skip pud and he patted his ample stomach when the waiter approached mcallister ordered espresso is that what youre investigating inspector impropriety at the sda rebus smiled i thought you werent curious tell me does the word mensung mean anything to you mcallister tried it out hed torn open a plastic toothpick and was working on his mouth the sight made rebuss teeth jangle i do seem to know it cant think why or what it is want me to check id be grateful sir one other thing any connection between the sda or scottish enterprise and the us consulate again mcallister seemed surprised by the question well yes he said at last as his coffee arrived i mean we do try to persuade american companies to locate here so contacts at a consular level are helpful vital even they were especially so in the eighties why was that microelectronics was booming silicon glen locate in scotland was working superbly did i mention lis it was partsda partscottish office with a remit to get foreign companies to locate here most of its successes were american mostly in the early to mideighties rumour had it that its successes had less to do with canny persuasion and economic argument than with a kind of informal freemasonry how do you mean well a lot of top executives in american companies were and are scottish either born here or with scottish roots lis would target those individuals and work on them trying to get them not only to open a factory here but to persuade other scots in positions of influence look at ibm actually this isnt an example of lis at work ibm has had a presence in scotland for forty years they started in greenock and theyre still there the plants massive about a mile and a half long but what took them to greenock in the first place ill tell you it wasnt economics or a skilled workforce it was sentimentality the head of ibm at that time was in love with the west coast of scotland and thats all it was mcallister shrugged and blew on his coffee rebus wanted to go back a stage or two is that how a lot of it works who you know oh definitely and bribes not for me to say why not thought rebus youve said every bloody thing but it was twothirty the restaurant empty save for their table i mean mcallister said one mans bribe is anothers financial incentive look at pergau dam theres always room to bend the rules without necessarily breaking them regional selective assistance for example was and is discretionary whos to say it doesnt make a difference if the person applying for it went to school with the person wholl make the final decision its the way the world turns inspector he tried to find some dregs of coffee in his cup then unwrapped the amaretto biscuit rebus paid their bill and the waiter locked the door after them mcallisters face was flushed his cheeks a network of broken blood vessels now that hed asked his questions rebus was keen to be elsewhere there was something about mcallister he didnt like he knew how easy it was to cover something up by talking about it at length one confession could be made to disguise another hed had cleverer men than mcallister in the interview room but not very many the two men shook hands i appreciate you taking the time and trouble sir rebus said not at all inspector i appreciate you paying for lunch besides who knows maybe one day i might need a favour from you mcallister winked you might at that rebus said after all it was the way the world turned the civil servant was right about that rebus turned and headed off in any direction that wasnt mcallisters all ive got rebus admitted are questions and loose ends and none of it is getting me any closer to why mcanally killed himself or why the councillors so scared added to that the lord provost sees the word dalgety scrawled on a sheet of paper and suddenly doesnt want us looking for his daughter any more he was on the phone to st leonards speaking with brian holmes the drip from the radiator was getting worse his mouth was getting worse behind him in the living room were the binbags full of paper all the answers he felt were there just beyond his abilities so said holmes thanks for the vote of confidence what do you want me to say rebus pushed at the skin around his nose feeling the pressure increase on his poor tooth the reason i phoned he said is to ask what the state of play is with friend duggan holmes rustled some papers now there i can help you paul duggan is edinburghs answer to rachman hes been cheating the council for years lives with his parents doesnt pay them a penny rent but hes applied for and been allotted four council properties thats how many weve traced so far there could be others he doesnt mind hardtolet flats thats his secret how does he do it a series of pseudonyms plus girls he drags along to housing office interviews with a few bambinos in tow the girls are friends of his the kids arent his but he becomes their father for the duration of the interview and gets himself priority listed once hes been allocated a place all he does is let it out im amazed he can find anyone for some of them that place in saughton was a palace compared to the others in his portfolio rebus dug into his back pocket and brought out the card hed taken from the waverley dropin paul cheap rooms why do you think rebus asked willie and dixie had the pick of duggans properties house that size he could have squeezed a few more bodies in right enough the flat i checked in granton had sleepingbags in the living room kitchen and bathroom rebus studied the telephone number on the card maybe ill have a wee word with our friendly slum landlord is the farmer keeping you busy he keeps asking if i know what youre up to and what do you tell him i can keep my mouth shut i just hope you know what youre doing sir well brian theres a first time for everything rebus broke the connection and called the number on the card hello it was a womans voice polite not young eh is paul there ill just get him for you thanks she put the receiver next to the phone and he could hear her calling for her son who was probably in his bedroom counting shillings into a sock finally the receiver was picked up aye paul whos this my names john i saw your notice at the dropin centre which one ive got half a dozen notices up the one behind waverley oh aye right i need a room are you claiming social security rebus winged it id be paying cash if thats what youre worried about no its just that youve caught me at a bad time john bit of pressure on me at the moment if you know what i mean i know all about pressure so im not really opening any new transactions right this minute there was a pause did you say cash would you need a rentbook cash no rentbook tell you what john can we maybe meet rebuss smile didnt translate to his voice whats the address no address do you know leith cop shop rebus stopped smiling hed been rumbled but duggan misinterpreted his silence not keen eh been in trouble have you a little bit were only meeting outside i can take you to a flat near there down by the shore and that areas coming up in the world by the way rebus almost admired the cheek what time five on the dot ill be there said rebus he phoned brian holmes back rachmans portfolio anything down near the shore leith no said holmes nearest one to leiths the place in granton why just that you havent tracked them all down yet thats all at five minutes to five he was across the road from the police station he stood two steps up from the pavement in the doorway of a disused building leith was taking a few faltering steps towards respectability trendy cafes and restaurants had opened in hastily refurbished premises usually carved out of larger blocks of unrented space there was a temporary feel to these new businesses they always seemed to be under new management leiths revival had begun down on the shore and had all but stopped there with warehouse conversions and a couple of upmarket bars now the revival had been given fresh momentum the new scottish office hq was under construction at victoria dock and a sailors home had been turned into a luxury hotel on queens quay but leith still retained its old unique charm it was still just about the only part of the city where youd see prostitutes in daytime freezing in short skirts and skimpy jackets rebus had passed some on his way down bernard street readying themselves for the goinghome trade one quick leap for the homeward bound he stood in the doorway for quarter of an hour before paul duggan turned up the young man was wearing an anklelength black woollen coat its collar turned up on his feet were white trainers so new they were almost luminous when caught in the headlamps of the passing traffic duggan didnt pay any attention to rebus as rebus crossed the road he was on the lookout for someone entirely different waiting for me rebus asked it took duggan a moment to place him christ what do you want it was me that phoned we didnt know you had another place on the shore i dont know what youre talking about come on paul lets have a chat in there rebus looked towards the police station no he said not in there this is just between us understood rebus started walking a hand on the sleeve of duggans coat where are we going duggan asked were just walking thats all ive got a question for you we know about four or five of your properties and we know the saughton let was the best of them by a fair old margin so how come you only picked up two rents from it duggan stopped dead is this a trap are you miked up rebus laughed for a tadpole like you behave son youre the councils problem not mine rebus started walking again duggan caught him up so whats the game im interested in willie and dixie thats all you told me you were their friend so now im a wee bit interested in you too thats why i gave them the house duggan blurted out thinking on his feet they were my pals you gave them it they didnt pay rent oh oh aye they paid rent what i meant was dont bother son dont compound one lie with another youll never keep track my guess is they worked for you what did they do duggan bit his lip they collected the rents he said at last and got free rent in return that makes more sense when i look at you i see a skinny young kid a sap the kind of tenants you must deal with youd need backup isnt that right just in case someone decided not to pay duggan nodded theydve been perfect for that rebus continued willie had brains he could reason with the nonpayers and if that didnt work crazy dixie could go to work is that about the score thats it rebus sniffed and seemed to be thinking whose idea was the kidnap ruse he said casually ive told you i didnt know anything about that they just asked for my car must have been willies idea rebus went on as if duggan hadnt spoken dixie didnt have the brains he turned to duggan unless it was your idea of course duggan made to protest but thought better of it they walked on in silence ok he said at last ok between you and me right rebus shrugged like i said im not after you particularly paul unless you lie to me lying to me is not advisable i knew what they were up to of course you did a tightfisted wee bastard like you wouldnt lend someone the steam from his breath without there being a payoff rebus produced the photo of kirstie kennedy you saw her with willie and dixie didnt you no what about dalgety eh the name clearly meant nothing to duggan come on rebus said i know youve seen her you spend a lot of time in dropin centres no i dont you told me yourself your cards are up on half a dozen noticeboards how do they get there by magic rebus pushed the photo towards duggan youve seen her no youre lying what are you afraid of paul they were down on the shore and duggan was just realising it they walked close to the waters edge across the street from the bars soon theyd be up to the dock entrance rebus stopped and tugged on duggans arm look at her he spat duggan averted his face look at her duggan glanced at the photo then away again his eyes were glinting in the streetlight she knew willie well enough to leave something in his bedroom she knew him and i know damned well you knew her duggan blinked what did she leave in his bedroom he asked quietly just tell me where she is duggan started to shake his head and rebus hauled him by the coatsleeve to the waters edge the street was empty save for a line of cars whose owners were all in the howffs fancy a dip paul it can be invigorating at this time of year if the sewage and the rats dont get you this coat cost a fortune duggan squealed you wont need it in jail son youll be tucked up in bed with some big bad bastard keeping you warm all right all right rebus released his grip duggan looked up and down the street run if you like paul ill find you jesus calm down will you ok ive seen her she hung around for a while with willie and dixie how long a week maybe a bit longer is she still around i havent seen her i only saw her a couple of times at the house in saughton no no at a couple of dropin centres but you dont know where she is or what shes doing duggan shook his head right heres what were going to do youre going to find her for me what somebody like you lots of contacts should be easy you dont know what youre asking rebus pointed to the water theres your alternative he held out the photo take this it might help it wont why not thats not what she looks like we had a laugh when we saw that picture in all the papers i mean i can believe she might have looked like that before she started using drugs and plenty of them by the look of her rebus frowned you think shes been on them long long enough maybe a year or so a year duggan shrugged only a guess im not into that scene ill bet you dont mind them as tenants though eh duggan straightened his shoulders how about looking at it this way im doing the councils work for it putting roofs over the heads of people whod be on the street otherwise mr social conscience theyll be giving you the keys to the city next get out of my sight and take the photo its got my phone number on the back if i dont hear from you in a day or two well have another chat maybe at your place this time with your mum and dad listening how would you like that duggan didnt answer he rearranged his coat which had fallen down over one shoulder then pocketed the photograph rebus watched him shuffle away back towards the traffic so now he knew for certain why the lord provost hadnt had a more recent photo of his daughter he wondered why duggan had been so curious about whatever kirstie had left in willie coyles bedroom but rebus was beginning to get an idea about that too he drove to the ox where doc and salty stood in their allotted places room was made for rebus and doc ordered him a pint oh what blessed company rebus said lifting the glass he turned to salty dougary i was out at gyle park west the other day in your professional capacity sort of what can you tell me about the place its an industrial estate i work there what else is there to know the businesses there would they have dealings with scottish enterprise salty nodded leel he said our boss at deltona is mad keen on worker participation which means once a week we have to sit in the canteen for twenty minutes listening to him rattle on about client satisfaction inward investment productivity and the like hes always on about leel so deltona has had money from leel john everyone on that estate has had help of some kind relocation incentives startup incentives retraining incentives you name it he raised his glass god bless scottish enterprise why the interest dr klasser asked this was not their usual level of conversation it could be peripheral to a case im working on except that there was no case and he wasnt supposed to be working well keep your paws off deltona salty dougary warned rebus smiled ever heard of mensung he asked dont they measure your intelligence there was a snort from down the bar theyd only need a sixinch ruler to measure yours salty salty laughed so the speaker would know he wasnt amused rebus was still looking at him to be honest salty told him it does ring a bell way at the back of the old brainpan i think it was a company on the estate dougary shrugged the barman was taking a phone call his eyes met rebuss for you john he brought the telephone over rebus had another question for salty what about labarum ever heard of that what is this mastermind rebus took the receiver from the barman hello is that you john rebus recognised the voice but it couldnt be not calling him by his first name is that you flower yes di alister flower the little weed calling rebus john something was wrong whats up just wondered if you could drop into the station for a chat a chat will you have the tea and biscuits ready flower laughed like he hadnt heard a better one all day rebus was more than curious when he asked whenever you like rebus said hed be there in half an hour the station was midevening quiet to keep busy most of the cid contingent had gone off to the scene of a car smash the smash had taken place outside one of the neighbourhoods better indian restaurants so there was no one around the main office no one but alister flower john hows the holiday im having a bit of trouble getting a tan rebus studied alister flower there were a hundred reasons to dislike or even thoroughly loathe the man the fact that he was a complete prick came pretty close to the top flowers eyes were always in movement seeking out an angle or the main chance the eyes were puffy like the skin around them was constantly swollen it could be genetic or to do with boozing and it turned his eyes into slits rebus didnt like the fact that he couldnt always see those eyes flower had friends around the station spies junior officers who were a bit like him and would even like to be him it scared rebus but there were no allies with him tonight he sat on a desk his feet on a chair it wasnt his desk wasnt his chair walking past his own desk rebus saw the new computer console it didnt interest him at all i was promised tea and biscuits he said we can nip down the canteen after after what after ive shown you something come on and he led rebus down to the cells there was a man in there longhaired unshaven not happy so who is he his names terry shotts flower explained hes from newcastle we found him leaving a house in prestonfield avenue with half the contents under his arm so rebus closed the viewingflap in the cell door so we went to his digs there was some other stuff there including some that we could trace immediately from the register his scam is he thieves here and sells in newcastle and what he thieves there he lays off here its a tremendous feat of detection flower i want to thank you for sharing it with me rebus started back upstairs flower following he handed rebus a folded sheet of paper this is a list of the stuff the geordies found in his flat they traced some of it to a couple of breakins but the lists didnt match looks like hed already sold some of the stuff on including a shotgun rebus began to see the point shotts has been up here three weeks i think he sold it to shug mcanally have you asked mr shotts hes as good as admitted it rebus stopped maybe i should talk to him flower blocked his path i dont think that would do any good rebus wasnt in the mood for a fight so kept on walking i thought youd be pleased i mean it ties up the loose ends doesnt it it might tie up one of them but it just unravels a couple more want to know what they are number one why are you interested number two why would you want me to be pleased they were back in the cid room well flower said making for his desk i just thought youd want to know thats just so much keech flower what are you up to flower reached into a drawer and showed rebus a bottle of whisky rebus shook his head but flower poured himself a measure into a brokenhandled mug what are you so damned paranoid about rebus you for a start flower took a gulp of whisky then lit a cigarette its a fair point he conceded through a wreath of smoke ok ill tell you straight someone asked me to talk to you you know i wouldnt do it otherwise thats more like it rebus sat on the edge of a desk so whos the someone just someone important the farmer flower smiled and exhaled noisily someone higher than the farmer then a lot higher and just what rebus asked does this anonymous patron want me to know flower examined the tip of his cigarette that youre on your way out the way youre going out of the force flower paused at the very least why you dont need to know that which meant thought rebus that it was because of something he might do rather than something already done so what should i do he asked stop being so bloody nosy about what mcanally for christs sake what does look im just the messageboy ok if the cap fits flowers eyes narrowed still further look he said at last you know if it was up to me id leave you to squat on the pan and send your career down the lavvy like the night befores kebab all im doing is a favour for someone who wants you to have a final warning hear me a final warning he stood up and flicked his butt into a wastebin pretty convenient rebus said the source of the shotgun suddenly turning up who is it flower the dcc big jim flett what have they got to hide rebus was standing inches from flower whats it got to do with you he jabbed flowers chest with his finger touch me again youre dead tell your friend if he wants to threaten me he should do it himself nobodys scared of the messageboy then he turned and walked away he was worried though if they were serious whoever they were when he was so far from solving the puzzle how would they react if he got any closer he stopped at the door by the way he said your fagend just set fire to that bin flower turned and saw that the contents of the wastebin were indeed smouldering he reached for some liquid to douse the fire hed forgotten that it was whisky not coffee in his mug rebuss phone was ringing as he got home it was rico briggs i had a word with a friend he told rebus rico never liked to say too much on the phone and be in the bus station at eleven tonight tonight whereabouts in the bus station just be there youll pay him his share and mine the line went dead at ten to eleven rebus was in the st andrews square bus station a few early drunks had assembled for the last bus home there was a pub in the bus station it sounded busy a man sprinted out of it slipped in a patch of oil and fell like a snipers bullet had got him he got back to his feet in time to see his bus pull away and started swearing there was a gash in the knee of his trousers exhaust fumes lay in heavy strata just above ground level rebus tried not to breathe too deeply as he walked up and down the ranks a few teenagers were asleep on the precarious benches an old man looking dazed crossed the concourse dressed in a duffel coat pyjamas and slippers the slippers looked brand new maybe a christmas present where are you rebus hissed stamping his feet he pushed his hands deeper into his pockets and walked the ranks again sit down a voice said rebus looked down at the figure hed thought the man was asleep arms folded head tucked into the front of his jacket he was sitting at the last rank there was a bus there but with its lights off rebus sat down and the man looked up at him he had greasy brown hair which fell over one eye and he could have done with a shave there was a small scar no more than a nick below his right eye the eyes were piercing blue with long lashes when he spoke rebus saw there was a tooth missing from the front of his mouth money youre ricos friend the man nodded money he repeated rebus showed him two twenties then handed them over he said half for him hell get half the voice was a lazy west coast drawl you want to know about saughton a man killed himself with a shotgun he was fresh out of saughton which bit c hall the man shook his head cant help you then a driver had come over to the bus cashbox in hand he opened the doors and went inside closing them after him lights came on all the way up the bus what do you mean just what i say i cant help the engine started up spewing fumes a couple of people had joined the queue and were wondering whether to jump ahead of the two seated downandouts why not never really knew anyone in c hall the man stood up rebus rising with him this is my bus wait a minute the man turned to him the bus doors were opening the people behind wanting to be in the warm ask gerry dip gerry dip he was in c hall came out a few weeks back where can i find him dipping fish thats how he got the name the man climbed on to the platform i hear hes working in a chip shop on easter road every chip shop in scotland was at its busiest after the pubs had emptied even the bad ones the ones with bony fish and rubber batter had queues rebus took one look at the wares on display in the second chip shop he tried and decided he would go without there was a queue almost out the door but he walked to the front ignoring the stares a teenage girl was serving mouth open in concentration salt and sauce she asked the customer is gerry in rebus asked she nodded further along the counter there was a small man there dipping fish in a bucket of batter before tossing them into the fryer gerry rebus asked the man shook his head and pointed towards the back of the narrow shop where a very tall very skinny young man wearing a white cotton apron was playing the video machine it was one of those kickandchop games the enemy bounding into view only long enough to be taken out again by the snarling cartoon hero gerry dip rebus said the player was in his midtwenties with cropped black hair and a nosestud his bare arms sported tattoos and there were more on the backs of his hands on his right wrist was a tattooed watch the hands of which pointed to twelve rebus checked his own watch and saw that gerry dips was deadon rebus saw that dip was watching him in the screens reflection not many people call me that he said im a friend of a friend someone you knew in saughton he said you could maybe help me thered be a drink in it how big a drink rebus had been to a cash machine he laid a crisp twenty on the console maybe it affected dips concentration a landmine tore the arms and legs off his man the game over message flashed and a digitised voice said feed money me hungry gerry dip palmed the note lets retire to my office he led rebus behind the counter and told the fish batterer hed swop places in five minutes then he pushed open a door and led rebus into a kitchencumstoreroom sacks of potatoes waited to be peeled and two large freezers hummed i hope youre not environmental health gerry dip said getting a glass of water from the sink and gulping it actually i know what you are it gets so you can smell it after a while rebus let the remark go a man was released from c hall a couple of weeks back he stuck a gun into his wee shug dip nodded i knew him played cards a few times talked about telly and the football dip refilled his glass youre up from six in the morning till nine at night lightsout isnt till ten you get to know people plus i worked with him in the upholstery workshop he said hed come down the chippie and see me then i read about him in the papers did you know he was ill he saw the doctor a lot never talked about it though i know he had some medicine we wanted him to hand it round so we could get a buzz what was wrong with him cancer that why he topped himself could be well if you want to know about wee shug you should talk to his cellmate now there was a fucking character hoitytoity stayed in his cell even when he didnt need to big jim flett had mentioned a cellmate rebus saw suddenly why flett had been relieved at the end of their interview gerry what was wee shug in for housebreaking you sure about that thats what i heard not rape what no thought rebus because rapists are usually kept away from the other prisoners but the governor had let it slip that wee shug shared a cell he wasnt inside for rape gerry dip said how can you be sure wedve known hes not likely to have told you himself no but the screws would have somebody would have its one secret you cant have in the nick unless rebus said quietly nobody wanted you to know rebus called cid from a phone box near st leonards and without identifying himself asked to speak to either ds holmes or dc clarke it was a morning of heavy haar floating across the city in a wet cloud from the coast the kind of morning where you could imagine yourself back in time a horse and coach clopping out of the mist rather than cars with their headlights on full rebuss skin and clothes were damp to the touch dc clarke speaking its me i want you to look up a name on the computer well its a bit chaotic here just now there was a small fire last night a wastebin went up its a bit of a mystery nobody was here at the time dear me the chief supers ordered an investigation meantime half the office is off limits but the computer systems ok the only damage is the bin and the desk next to it it was inspector flower found the blaze really he threw a coat over the bin to snuff it out it was holmess coat the one nell gave him for christmas thats the one whats the name you want checking charters he spelt it for her i dont have a first name but hes serving time in saughton id like his record im in a callbox about a hundred yards away theres a cafe across from the diy store ill wait for you there ill be as quick as i can the doughrings are on me but when siobhan clarke finally turned up at the cafe she ordered a friedegg sandwich instead then handed rebus a manila envelope did anyone see you at the computer i dont think so watch your back its not just the farmer flowers up to something too what fireraising for a start rebus opened the envelope and read through the contents clarkes food arrived and she bit into it dripping yolk on to the plate derwood charters rebus read aloud age fortysix divorced excompany director found guilty of fraud serving three years of a sixyear sentence at hmp edinburgh home address in cramond till the place had to be sold date of birth name of solicitor no wife or next of kin rebus skipped through what little else there was its a bit bald isnt it a bit like somebodys been into the computer and shorn it which station dealt with him he looked through the notes again well well st leonards but before our time rebus nodded i was still at great london road but then so was chief inspector lauderdale yet his names down here as part of the team he was thoughtful for a moment right what i want you to do is go back to the station and pull the casenotes out of the vault i know its asking a lot only my career but he knew shed do it anyway rebus waited over an hour for clarke to return she carried a supermarket carrierbag with her and laid it on the floor next to him he ordered her a mug of tea his own stomach was swilling with the stuff it wasnt where it should have been she told him it had been put back out of order like someone wanted to hide it but without being too obvious there are so many reports in the vault its easy for one to disappear if its filed in the wrong place did anyone see you brian came to see what i was up to i got him to keep an eye out for anyone else meantime the sooner you read the casenotes the sooner i can put them back the woman who ran the cafe brought siobhan clarkes tea and saw rebus lift a heavy folder out of the carrierbag thinking of taking up residence she asked him im doing you a favour he said glancing at all the empty tables nobody comes into an empty cafe you did she replied rebus just smiled and opened the casenotes starting to read at lunchtime rebus made a dentists appointment when he explained the problem the receptionist asked him to hold the line when she came back she told him dr keene could squeeze him in at five the surgery was in a substantial semidetached property on inverleith row facing the entrance to the botanic gardens rebus was in a sweat as he sat in the waiting room there was a woman in there with him and he was relieved when she was called first but that left only him his ears seemed more receptive than usual he could hear the whine of a drill the clatter of metal probes being dropped on to trays when the woman patient came out she walked to the reception desk to make another appointment the dentist was with her then the dentist turned and smiling came to the waitingroom doorway mr rebus through here please he wore a white coat and halfmoon glasses and rebus judged him to be in his late fifties sit down please dr keene said washing his hands some swelling around the mouth rebus sat on the chair and swung his legs up on to it his hands gripping the armrests dr keene came over now just lie back and try to relax rebus could hear his own hoarse breathing thats it the dentist used an electric footswitch to set the chair back so it was nearly flat and to raise it up he angled the lamp over the chair and switched it on well just take a look he swivelled a tray of dental tools towards him and sat down on a high chair by rebuss side open wide there was music playing radio two the airwaves answer to a placebo rebus opened his eyes and stared at the ceiling there was a blownup photograph there a huge black and white aerial shot of edinburgh from trinity in the north to as far south as the braid hills he started to map out the streets in his mind looks like a wee abscess the dentist was saying he put down one tool and reached for another tapping it against one of rebuss teeth feel anything rebus shook his head the assistant had joined them dr keene said a few things to her in a language the patient wasnt supposed to understand then started packing rebuss mouth with cotton what im going to do is drill into the tooth from behind to try to drain off the poison thatll release the pressure the tooth is pretty well dead anyway ill do a root canal later but for now the abscess needs to drain rebus could feel sweat on his forehead a tube was being placed in his mouth hoovering up what saliva there was a little injection first itll take a minute or two to take rebus stared at the ceiling theres calton hill where davey soutar ended up theres st leonards and great london road hydes club was just down there ooyah theres stenhouse where willie and dixie lived you could see saughton jail quite clearly and warrender school where mcanally blew his head off he had a sense of the way the streets interconnected and with them the lives of the people who lived and died there willie and dixie had known kirstie kennedy whose father was lord provost mcanally had sought out a councillor as witness to his act of selfdestruction the city might cover a fair old area its population might be half a million but you couldnt deny how it all twisted together all the crisscrossed lines which gave the structure its solidity now the dentist was saying you might feel some discomfort at first rebus raced up and down the streets marchmont where he lived tollcross tresa mcanallys home south gyle only just taking off when the photograph was taken there was no sign of the newer building work around the town he saw holes in the ground and areas of wasteland where now there were structures and roads and jesus christ almighty it was hurting ah dr keene said at last there we are rebus could feel something nasty trickling down his throat the pressure beneath his nose was easing like bleeding a radiator he thought drill into the poison the dentist was saying almost to himself and you relieve the pressure yes rebus thought that was absolutely right the dentist gave the rest of his mouth a onceover the assistant had a card in her hand and was writing on it as dr keene recited a litany of decay i wont do any of these fillings today he said to rebuss relief eventually he was allowed to rinse and spit and the assistant removed the elasticated bib from around his neck rebus ran his tongue around his mouth there was a gaping hole in the back of one of his front teeth weve got to let that drain give it a few days once its drained i can do the root canal all right and he smiled at rebus incidentally when did you last have your teeth checked eleven twelve years ago the dentist shook his head ill make up your appointments the assistant said leaving the room dr keene removed his latex gloves and went to wash his hands now that we all wear gloves he said i dont really need to wash them but ive done it for thirty years hard to break the habit you wear the gloves because of hiv yes well goodbye then mr inspector rebus actually oh i wonder if i might have a word rebus knew he was mumbling the anaesthetic had frozen his mouth but dr keene had no trouble understanding him you mean officially sort of i believe you know a man called derwood charters dr keene snorted and started rearranging his instruments ill take that as a yes rebus said very much to my cost like you he walked into my surgery one day requiring treatment then i bumped into him socially we met a few more times and he put a proposition to me a financial proposition he needed investors for a startup the man had a proven track record hed helped finance the panotech startup for one thing and youd hardly call that a failure mind i didnt just take his word for anything i had my accountant look at the figures the projections seemed sound professionally done what was the company derry was very persuasive he always stipulated the downside of any project somehow the more he talked them down the more attractive he made them sound he came across like he wasnt trying to sell you anything the scheme i invested in the company was going to profit from the downturn in the economy that was the downside other peoples misery was going to make his investors money he was offering retraining and counselling for employees who suddenly found themselves reorganised out of a job he explained that once the company was up and running it was to be called albavise hed be able to draw on european community grants scottish office funding all that what he needed was startup capital dr keene paused know what i believed him then and i believe him now if hed used the money to start the company it would have succeeded but he didnt set up a company did he dr keene sighed he used it to pay off debts and to finance his lifestyle hed picked out ten investors each handing over five thou fifty thousand pounds inspector and he blew the lot inside three months yes and then tried to do a runner only one of his investors had an accountant who was sharper than most charters was arrested as he made to board the shuttle to london once they started investigating his affairs the inland revenue fraud squad what have you they found a lot of discrepancies none of which derry was willing to discuss he kept his peace all through the trial he looked at rebus has something happened rebus shrugged early days yet sir the stock response but dr keene accepted it it wasnt the cash that hurt you know he told rebus it was that sense of betrayal i can imagine the charters casenotes had made for fascinating reading for example rebus now knew that frank lauderdale had been attached to the fraud squad at the time theyd been investigating albavise and derwood charters other business interests thinking back on it rebus did recall a period when lauderdale had been away from great london road but lauderdale was the least interesting part of it for the man who had been head of the fraud squad back then chief superintendent allan gunner was now deputy chief constable of lothian and borders police and that wasnt all dr keene do you know a man called haldayne spelt with a y i dont think so hes american works at the consulate dr keene was shaking his head no i dont know him is it important hes another of the investors ripped off over albavise i thought you might have met thats all we might have met in court had any witnesses been called but charters changed his mind at the last minute and pled guilty really any idea why none my solicitor was amazed the case against him was by no means watertight and as i say he had a very good track record it was possible he might have gone free or at least got off with a heavy fine but instead he went to jail ive often wondered why he did that rebus was wondering the same thing maybe he said to protect someone or something that could have come to light at the trial but who or what rebus just smiled and winked he collected his coat and put it on in the hallway the assistant had already gone home there was an appointment card on her desk dr keene picked it up and handed it to rebus see you in a few days rebus looked at the card there was a long column of appointments listed on its back six of them dates and times dr keene he said exactly how many fillings do i need fifteen the dentist said matteroffactly then he saw rebus to the door that night rebus went to see tresa mcanally the tenement door wasnt locked so he climbed the stairs to her flat he could hear music inside goodtime music and the sounds of hands clapping in time rebus pressed the bell and waited then pressed it again the music was turned down a voice came from behind the door who is it inspector rebus wait a minute will you she was a long time opening the door even then she kept the chain on what do you want behind her the door to the living room was closed there was a case of mixed spirits on the hall carpet tresa mcanally was dressed casually baggy tshirt tight black slacks looped gold earrings and she was sweating from recent exertion can i come in rebus asked no you cant what is it its about wee shug hes dead end of story she made to close the door rebus pushed his hand against it where did the money come from tresa what money the money you spent on the flat youve no right to maybe not but ill keep coming back till you tell me then youll be coming back till doomsday rebus smiled that may be closer than you think he lifted his hand from the door but she didnt shut it what do you mean whos in there with you nobody nobody not even tresa mcanally was brassnecked enough to repeat the lie she pushed the door closed rebus stood for a moment listening then walked along to maisie finchs flat he rang her bell but she couldnt very well answer not when she was busy hiding behind tresa mcanallys livingroom door next morning rebus called the us consulate youre not another recording are you rebus asked no im not good can you put me through to mr haldayne please your name detective inspector john rebus hold the line inspector he didnt have to hold long inspector what can i do for you an american accent smooth urbane rebus wasnt exactly sure what ivy league meant but haldaynes voice brought to mind the image well sir for one thing you can start paying your parking tickets a confident chuckle goodness is that what this is all about well certainly if you insist i wouldnt want to make a diplomatic incident out of it but you could is that what you mean the tickets arent the main reason im ringing id like to talk to you about derwood charters jesus what has he done this time a pause dont tell me im getting back my money could we discuss it in person yeah i guess you want to come here the us consulate where haldayne would be at his most consular the north british rebus suggested for morning coffee its not called the north british any more is it youve got a lot to learn about scotland mr haldayne tenthirty thats fine inspector i look forward to meeting you rebuss next call was to st leonards he asked for siobhan clarke hows life ms templer had me in her office first thing wanting to know if youd been in touch she was asking a lot of questions let her ask as far as you know im in lanzarote right listen haldaynes parking tickets what were the exact locations i think i jotted them down he could hear her searching her notebook how goes the blaze inquiry a nonstarter its down to an act of god they didnt find a cigarette or a match in the bin of course not flower tidied up before he reported the fire here we are princes street james craig walk and royal circus those are all ive got and no dates the last two were multiples rebus thanked her and hung up he found his az and looked up james craig walk it was hard by new st andrews house so haldayne did have dealings with the scottish office princes street could just mean he was shopping rebus wasnt sure what or who royal circus represented he remembered the councillors files sda se a c haldayne gyle park west mensung he still didnt know anything about mensung he was hoping haldayne could help rebus sat in the lounge of the balmoral forte grand formerly the north british and told staff he was waiting for a guest but hed order anyway coffee for two decaffeinated and cakes or biscuits or something fruit scones sir fine whatever thank you sir rebus was glad he was wearing one of his better suits theyd made a good job of the hotel last time hed had morning coffee here it had been with gill templer way back when theyd been an item the walls had had cracks in them and the whole place had seemed faded and slightly seedy rebus knew the american as soon as he walked in he was tall and exceptionally well groomed and wearing a creamcoloured burberry raincoat haldayne had fair hair so fine and thin you could see pink scalp beneath it he was around forty and wore glasses with tortoiseshell circular frames his face was thin his forehead bulbous and shiny inspector rebus he shook rebuss hand and rebus motioned for him to sit cold enough for you over here rebus asked i was brought up in illinois haldayne slipped his coat off we got winters you wouldnt believe he shivered at the memory and chuckled again it was becoming an annoying habit rebus had an annoying habit too he kept poking the tip of his tongue into the hole in his tooth and trying to suck the poison out he was getting to like that little borehole do you know a dr keene he asked the american haldayne made a sceptical mouth care to give me a clue hes a dentist and another of derry charters victims haldayne sat back in his comfortable chair took me for five biggies that still hurts im a diplomat not a millionaire what do you do at the consulate i have an industry remit in some countries that would be a twoway process but there arent too many scottish companies thinking of setting up plants in the us so i tend to look after american companies whore thinking of setting up here its not as busy as it was he looked left and right waiting staff are slow ive already ordered i hope you dont mind haldayne shrugged how did you come to know derry charters i was introduced to him at a party cant recall now who did the introducing can you remember whose party oh it was some scottish office thing thats why i was there and mr charters well he was a businessman how much do you know about him before his bust practically nothing rebus lied wondering what tack haldayne might take he ran a few companies and ran them profitably but he was always looking to expand i think he just got bored simple as that he liked to set things up get projects running but after that he lost interest and started looking for something new he was good at what he did though thats why i wasnt overcautious when he asked me to be a backer did you know him well not really when he was talking deals he was fine but he wasnt a social animal i got the feeling normal polite conversation bored the hell out of him he was a genuine product of the eighties one of lady thatchers bulls the tray arrived with cafetiere and a plate of fruit scones with butter jam and clotted cream hey this looks great thank you haldayne said to the waiter he immediately took over putting the cups out serving the coffee while he was pouring rebus asked a question ever heard of something or someone called mensung run it by me again mensung haldayne shook his head and handed rebus a cup and saucer he hadnt spilled a drop hadnt even paused while pouring if you help american companies mr haldayne does that mean you have dealings with scottish enterprise all the time and locate in scotland ive had dealings with them all inspector thing is youre just beginning to establish a working relationship then the government changes everything changes the name the rules the players sda becomes scottish enterprise hidb becomes hie and ive got to start again from scratch building up contacts letting people know who i am its a tough life but somebodys got to do it right haldayne spread cream on to half a scone i love these pastries he confided before taking a huge bite youve been here a while rebus asked nine years on and off they did send me back to the states for a couple of years in the middle but i wangled my way back over again i love scotland my ancestors came from here i heard a rumour once rebus said about a kind of scottish mafia at the top of some us businesses persuading people to locate in scotland haldayne wiped cream from his mouth with a napkin it happens he said what can i say its not illegal what would be illegal mr haldayne bribes money changing hands companies can set up here very cheaply cant they some areas some types of plant sure a lot of grant money swilling around some from the european community some from british government coffers there was the delorean scandal rebus said but the guy did have a sensational car and he took the british taxpayer for millions youd still have paid those taxes inspector if delorean hadnt taken them some other guy would haldayne shrugged again his expressions whether vocal or physical were always slightly exaggerated slightly more than youd get from a scot so the scottish mafia story is true id guess so im being as open with you as i can i appreciate it sir hey youre the one holding those parking tickets at my head another chuckle what kind of coffee is this decaf its not bad actually but i do miss that caffeine rush waiter a teenager trotted over can i have a double espresso thank you haldayne turned back to rebus so whats the story here inspector we dont seem to be talking about derry charters any more just part of an ongoing inquiry sir im not at liberty to well thats hardly fair is it hardly british youre not in britain now mr haldayne but ive told you mine now you should tell me yours rebus saw that haldayne was having a good deal of fun at his expense suddenly he didnt know how much of haldaynes story to believe lies usually came giftwrapped in a thin tissue of truth rebus knew he would have to examine the wrappings later come on inspector haldayne persisted youre checking up on derry this much i know but hes still serving time right so what has he done set up some paper company from his cell paper company you know one that exists only on paper haldayne came to an abrupt stop and reached into his pocket for a handkerchief hes stalling thought rebus why is he stalling the espresso arrived and haldayne took a couple of appreciative mouthfuls regaining his composure i came here in good faith inspector he said at last i didnt need to speak to a man whos not here in his official capacity haldayne saw the look on rebuss face and smiled i wanted to check that you were who you said you were we us diplomats cant be too careful these days your chief inspector told me youre on official leave rebus took a bite from his scone saying nothing for a man on leave inspector you sure as hell look busy to me haldayne finished his cup of sludge id like to say its been a pleasure but in fact it has been deeply frustrating he started to push his arms back into the sleeves of his coat i dont expect to be troubled by you again inspector i sent a cheque off today to cover those parking fines as far as im concerned theres no other reason for you to contact me who do you know who lives in royal circus haldayne was disconcerted by the question in the new town thats the only royal circus i know haldayne made show of thinking about it not a soul he said brightly my superior might move in those kinds of circles but not me what kinds of circles but haldayne wasnt about to answer that he got to his feet and made a little formal bow from the waist i hope you dont mind picking up the tab inspector then he turned and walked away rebus let him go he had plenty to think about and plenty of coffee still to drink rebus had two options he could go home and wait for the farmer or gill to catch him or he could go to st leonards and get it done with he chose the latter route hed been in the building less than three minutes before the farmer spotted him my office now rebus noticed that the farmers computer was up and running it had taken over his desk the photo of his family had been moved to the top of the filingcabinet getting to grips with it all right sir rebus asked but the farmer was not to be deflected what the hell are you playing at i ordered you to take a holiday and im enjoying every minute sir making a nuisance of yourself at a foreign consulate thats your idea of fun i couldnt afford to go abroad the way youre going maybe you cant afford not to it was just a bit of unfinished business sir what sort of unfinished business its not really a police matter sir the farmer glowered at him i hope to god thats the truth inspector cross my heart and hope to die sir youre one step from an official reprimand two steps from suspension and three steps from heaven rebus thought he told the farmer he understood in the main office he checked for messages there were half a dozen stuck on to the screen of his new panotech computer around him he could hear the soft clackclack of muffled keyboards he stared at his own console as if it was an unfriendly visitor his reflection stared back at him three of the messages were from rory mcallister at the scottish office rebus picked up the telephone mcallister speaking mr mcallister its john rebus inspector thanks for getting back to me mcallister sounded relieved but also edgy not like himself whats wrong can we meet sure but give me some idea calton cemetery at one oclock the phone went dead during the day calton cemetery was more or less deserted in summer youd get visitors looking for david humes grave the more knowledgeable or curious might seek out the resting places of the publisher constable and david allan the painter there was a statue of abraham lincoln too if it hadnt been sledgehammered by vandals at one oclock on a crisp winters day nobody was interested in headstones such at least was rebuss first impression as he walked through the cemetery gate but then he saw that a gentleman was perusing the monuments using a black rolled umbrella as a walkingcane what hair he had mixed black with silver and was slicked back from the forehead his face and ears were red maybe just from the cold and he wore a black woollen overcoat belted at the waist he saw rebus and gestured for him to join him rebus climbed the stone steps towards him havent been here in years the man said his voice had been scots once before the inflexions and elisions had been milked out of it i take it youre rebus rebus studied the man thats right mcallisters not coming im a colleague of his close up the mans face was pockmarked and he had one slightly lazy eye with his free hand he played with the cashmere scarf tucked inside the collar of his coat whats your name rebus asked the man seemed both surprised and amused by the questions bluntness my names hunter something about the way he said this and his whole bearing told rebus he wasnt so much mcallisters colleague as his superior well mr hunter what can i do for you im interested in your line of inquiry inspector and what line is that sir you were asking certain questions of mcallister a bus roared past and hunter raised his voice the line of those questions intrigues me why why because the scottish office likes to take an interest in what exactly the bus gone hunter lowered his voice again ill be succinct id prefer it inspector if you would discontinue your present line of inquiry i dont believe it germane youd prefer it there may be a conflict of interests hunter lifted the walnut handle of his umbrella until it rested under his chin of course im a civil servant and you are a policeman its not for me to interfere with your business good of you im sure but we are both are we not servants of the state hunter swung the umbrella at some leaves on the ground all i can say to you at this point inspector is that your inquiries may well interfere with longstanding investigations we are pursuing i didnt know investigation was part of the scottish offices remit mr hunter unless youre talking about an internal inquiry you are a clever man inspector and i appeal to your intellect to be honest sir you dont appeal to me at all hunters face darkened slightly lets not cross swords on this he swung at more leaves cooperation hunter considered this not yet im afraid the affair is confidential but later definitely full cooperation what do you say he held out his hand a gentlemans agreement rebus knowing himself no gentleman took the hand just to put hunters mind at rest the older man didnt look relieved just quietly pleased that negotiations had been bloodless and in his eyes successful he turned to leave ill call you when ive something i can say he told rebus mr hunter why did you get mcallister to phone me why not just call yourself hunter smiled with half his mouth whats life without a little intrigue inspector he negotiated the steps carefully with a slight limp too proud to carry a cane he used a brolly instead rebus waited half a minute then walked quickly to the gate and peered along the street to the right hunter was walking along waterloo place as if he owned it rebus kept well behind him as he followed it was a short walk only as far as the reichstag st andrews house which rebus recalled was where the most senior scottish office bureaucrats did their business he recalled too that it was built on the site of the old calton gaol rebus walked past the sooty building and crossed the road he stood outside the old royal high school putative hq for any scottish assembly that might come along it was mothballed and a lone protestor had taken up residence outside his banners arguing for devolution and a scottish parliament rebus stared at st andrews house for a couple of minutes then walked back along waterloo place to where hed illegally parked his car it had received a ticket but he could square that later over the years hed collected more tickets than haldayne a wheen more do as i say he thought not as i do there had been other fringe benefits along the way too cafes and restaurants where he ate for free bars where his money was no good a baker whod slip him a dozen rolls he wouldnt call himself corrupt but there were some out there whod say hed been bribed or greased for a future bribe there were those whod say hed been bought do as i say not as i do and with that he tore up the parking ticket back at his flat rebus got out all the information he had on the scottish office he didnt find the name hunter anywhere the documents were shy about naming names where civil servants were involved though happy to trumpet the names of the incumbent secretary of state minister of state and parliamentary undersecretaries all of whom were either mps or held seats in the house of lords as mcallister had explained these were the temporary boys the figureheads when it came to the permanent force the senior civil servants rebus found only silence and anonymity modesty he wondered or discretion or maybe something else entirely he called mairie henderson at her home got a story for me she asked i could do with one what do you know about the scottish office i know a bit senior management there may have been changes since i last looked phone the paper talk to whod be best home affairs or parliament yes roddy mcgurk talk to him say i gave you his name thanks mairie and im serious about the story inspector rebus called the newspaper office and asked for roddy mcgurk he was put through immediately mr mcgurk im a friend of mairie hendersons she said maybe you could help me clarify something fire away the voice was west highland its an identity actually a man called hunter scottish office latefifties uses an umbrella when really he should have a stick mcgurk was laughing let me stop you there youre describing sir lain hunter and whos he when hes at home mcgurk laughed again he is the scottish office hes the permanent undersecretary usually known as the permanent secretary rebus said feeling queasy in his gut policy initiator for the whole country you might call him mr scotland not a very public figure though he doesnt need to be in the words of the old song hes got the power rebus thanked mcgurk and put the receiver down he was trembling slightly mr scotland hes got the power he wondered what hed got himself into then the telephone rang i forgot to say mairie henderson began yes remember you asked if there was any dirt on councillor gillespie go on well there wasnt in my day but i got talking yesterday to someone at bbc scotland you know im doing some radio stuff down at queen street anyway its not really gillespie its about his wife what about her word is shes involved with someone else having an affair you mean yes rebus remembered his visit to the councillors home there had seemed little love lost but at the time hed blamed other things whos her partner in crime that i dont know so how does your source at the beeb know he didnt say its just some rumour he picked up when last in the city chambers the way it was told to him he thinks maybe its another councillor well let me know if you hear anything more bye mairie rebus put the phone down and tried to put his thoughts into some semblance of order he stared at the bags of shredded paper but they didnt help he ended up repeating a question to himself what have i got myself into chief inspector frank lauderdale was in an open ward of the royal infirmary but his bed was in a corner by a window with a view over the meadows hed drawn the curtain between his own bed and his neighbours affording some privacy there was a vase of flowers on his bedside cabinet they looked ready to expire in the hospitals infernal heat you can almost see my flat from here rebus said looking out of the window thats been a constant source of comfort to me lauderdale said its taken you long enough to visit i dont like hospitals frank neither do i you think im in here for the good of my health they shared a smile and rebus examined the patient you look like shite frank lauderdales face looked like an infant had tried shaving it with a safety razor there were dozens of nicks and scars where the windscreen had cut him his eyes were bruised and swollen and there were black ugly stitches on his nose with all the plaster and bandages he sported he looked like the joke patient from a comedy sketch how are the legs rebus asked itchy thats supposed to be a good sign oh ill walk again so they say lauderdale smiled nervously maybe ill have a limp or two two would be better said rebus theyd balance you up want to sign my stookie rebus looked at the plastercasts on launderdales legs theyd been signed by several visitors which one take your pick rebus took a ballpoint pen from his pocket it wasnt easy to write on the coarse surface but he did his best what does it say lauderdale asked craning his neck clunkclick every trip lauderdale lay back again whats happened about those two he meant willie and dixie search me said rebus im on holiday so id heard oh your new boss told me frankly i have my doubts if i know you while youre still in this city youll always be working how is she shaping up he meant gill templer rebus nodded shes doing fine he wasnt sure this was what frank lauderdale wanted to hear he pulled a chair over to the bed and sat down ive got a problem actually frank of course you have thats why youre here its not the lord provosts daughter you havent found her yet im getting closer she did know those two in the car id not heard that rebus shifted in the chair i havent exactly gone public with it lauderdale shook his head christ john like i say shes not my immediate problem my problem is a smalltime loser called wee shug mcanally the one who gave himself a sawnoff haircut yes rebus ran his tongue over the hole in his tooth see he shared a cell in saughton with a fraudster called derwood charters wee shug was moved from another jail and just happened to end up in that cell rebus was staring hard at lauderdale it also just happened that none of the other cons knew what mcanally was in for it was rape by the way of a minor now frank what does all that tell you lauderdale said nothing what it tells me rebus went on is that there was collusion at the top to stop the other cons getting to know give me some water will you rebus poured some for lauderdale why would anyone do that lauderdale asked taking the beaker there could be a multitude of reasons let me try one on you say mcanally was in there as a plant lauderdale took his time drinking the water a plant he said at last either to spy on charters or else to gain his trust now rebus pulled his chair closer not that lauderdale was going anywhere the reason charters is inside is for fraud and he was put inside by the fraud unit leading the investigation was chief superintendent allan gunner now deputy chief constable it so happens the dcc was the one who fixed me up with this lovely holiday he threatened the farmer with an hmic inspection if i wasnt reined in he should have known better lauderdale paused but hmic is an independent body how could the dcc have control over their decisions it was rebus conceded a good point the people who ran hmic were civil servants rather than police officers well anyway he said thoughtfully it was gunner who applied the pressure im sure it was other officers might have taken the hint john not me now on that initial investigation of charters were at least two officers of my acquaintance yourself and alister flower and flowers been warning me off too which makes for a nice little circle dont you think frank why come to me maybe because youre the only person i can try maybe because despite myself i almost trust you i mean youre a schemer a chancer and youd like the farmers office but at heart youre a copper rebus paused same as me so come on frank tell me about mcanally i cant lauderdale saw the look on rebuss face i cant because theres nothing to tell youre right i did work on the albavise inquiry but thats as far as it goes i know this though if youre crossing not only flower but the likes of the dcc and big jim flett then youd better watch out i think it goes further than that even rebus confided the scottish office maybe even mps or ministers christ john lauderdale whispered rebus stood up so maybe as youre packing your bags to go home theyll be wheeling me in to take your place dont joke about it who said i was joking and dont tell me any more the less i know the better for you or for me lauderdale sat up as best he could let it go he advised for once in your dunderheaded life just walk away rebus put the chair back where hed found it i cant do that frank he pushed his tongue into the hole again the poison hadnt all drained yet take care of yourself he told lauderdale that should probably be my line rebus was halfway down the ward when he heard lauderdale calling for him he walked back to the bed lauderdale had propped himself up and was staring out of the window flower he said not turning to look at rebus what about him frank mcanally was flowers eyes and ears his snitch lauderdale nodded eyes still on the window i appreciate this said rebus turning away again i hope you do john frank lauderdale said quietly there was an envelope lying on the hall carpet the post had already been this had been delivered by hand no stamp just his name in blue ink there was an embossed official crest on the sealed flap the lion and the unicorn holding a shield between them rebus knew it was the scottish office crest he flexed the envelope in his hands it was thin and light yet fairly solid leaving it on the arm of the chair he went to the kitchen and added tapwater to a glass of whisky he found a knife in the drawer and took both glass and knife back through to the chair he took a mouthful of whisky before slitting open the envelope it was a white card an invitation elaborate black embossed script with a gold border sir lain hunter requests the pleasure of your company saturday march ruthie estate twelve noon perthshire rebuss name had been added in blue ink at the top of the card there was no rsvp just an address and no telephone number rebus turned the card over and saw that it bore a printed map showing the location of the estate about halfway between perth and auchterarder saturday was only two days off rebus carried the invitation to his mantelpiece and leaned it against the otherwise bare wall the only estate hed ever been to before was the housing kind he didnt suppose ruthie estate would be very like those at all rebus was still wondering if hed go or not when he set out for his evening session at the ox dr klasser wasnt there hed telephoned to say hed be very late if he made it at all the barman placed rebuss pint in front of him just as salty dougary walked in its bitter out there dougary said but its called eightyshilling in here go on jon pour the man his poison dougary eased himself on to the barstool next to rebus ive got something for you what remember you asked me about mensung yes rebus remembered hed asked rory mcallister too only mcallister had been warned off rebus doubted hed ever hear from him again what about it ive remembered what it was dougary said matteroffactly his drink had appeared and he ordered some crisps so what is it rebus asked salt and vinegar jon dougary told the barman the volume on the tv was being turned up for some sports report dougary turned to rebus it was a company he took a mouthful of beer and a packet of ready salted he told the barman did you say a company eh dougarys attention was already turning towards the tv rebus hauled him off the stool and out of the door into the chill dark street traffic rumbled past on castle street its freezing out here dougary protested just tell me dougary looked longingly towards the pub door tell me here rebus persisted remember when i worked for that semiconductor company it was called mensung it wasnt called any such thing but it had this policy of trying to retrain workers it turfed out so so i was a turfee and there was this agency outplacement sort of thing the agency ran seminars or was supposed to it was supposed to have all these fancy retraining schemes and programmes half of which never materialised that bunch of cowboys was called mensung is it still around dougary shrugged ive been laid off twice since and never come across it again where was it based by the playhouse top of leith walk do you still have any information on it anything in writing dougary stared at him id have to check with my secretary the irony was so heavy you could hear it fall rebus smiled stupid question donny sorry can i go back in now sure is anything wrong how do you mean you called me donny instead of salty its your name isnt it i suppose it is said dougary pushing open the door one of the reasons rebus drank was to put him to sleep he had trouble sleeping when sober hed stare into the darkness willing it to form shapes so that he might better understand it hed try to make sense of life his early disastrous army years his failed marriage his failings as father friend lover and end up in tears and if he did eventually stumble into sober sleep there would be troubled dreams dreams about ageing and dying decay and blight the dark took on shapes in his dreams but he darent look at them hed run blindly instead sometimes bumping into them feeling the darkness mould itself around him drunk his sleep was dreamless or seemed that way on waking he might be drenched in sweat but he wouldnt be shaking so he always tried to have a few drinks last thing at night usually in his chair and since he was already comfortable what was the point of getting up and going through to the bedroom he was in the chair dead to the world when the buzzer sounded he sat up and switched on the lamp then blinked his eyes open to check his watch it was onethirty he staggered into the hall like he was learning to walk and unhooked the intercom hello its patience patience without thinking he buzzed her up then went back into the living room to put on his trousers when he got back to the door she had almost reached his landing she walked slowly with purpose her head was bowed eyes on the steps not looking at him her hair was unbrushed whats happened she stood directly in front of him and he could see how angry she was she was so angry she was preternaturally calm i was lying in bed she said quietly and i dont know what happened i suddenly saw it what you know luckys dead yes im sorry she nodded to herself well thanks for being there for me i appreciate that i was thinking thats pretty coldhearted even for him sammy told me shed told you i wondered why you hadnt been in touch and then i remembered stupid of me to forget you were there on sunday you were sitting right next to the conservatory door her voice grew even quieter you locked lucky out patience i didnt you look its late why dont didnt you christ i dont know all right yes if it makes you feel any better he rubbed a hand over his face yes the racket he was making was driving me mental so i locked the flap and then forgot im sorry she had opened the shoulder bag and was lifting out a smaller plastic bag this is for you and as he put out a hand to take the bag she slapped him hard on the left cheek then she turned and started downstairs patience she didnt even pause she just kept on going he held up the bag then opened it and looked inside it was just some bits and pieces that was all bits and pieces of lucky the cat in the morning he took the bag out to the back garden the garden was actually a shared dryinggreen with a flower border tended by mrs cochrane on the floor below rebus just inside the back door of the tenement was a padlocked walkin cupboard it was communal storage space only rebus didnt have anything he wanted communally stored but he unlocked the door and lifted out the spade which had belonged to dear departed mr cochrane he sat the plastic bag down next to the flower border looked around and up at the windows to see nobody was watching then raised the shovel when it hit soil he felt the collision all the way from his wrists to his spine he tried again and chipped away a sliver of frozen earth he stooped to pick up his prize it was like toffee frozen toffee jesus he said trying again he could see his breath in the air in the tenement across the back someone making breakfast had come to their kitchen window it wasnt daylight yet but rebus knew they could see him clearly enough it was all the exposure he needed to convince him he should give up instead he drove to the cowgate parked the car and carried the bag with him into the city mortuary inspector one of the staff said what can we do for you today rebus handed over the bag said thank you and left hed arranged to meet holmes and clarke in a trendy cafe near the university but the place hadnt opened for the day so they walked along to nicolson street and found a clean welllit coffee shop he asked them how things were at st leonards they reckoned they were still under close scrutiny but they could cope good he said because ive got something else i want you to do for me i want to know about a company it probably no longer exists but it was around in a limited company no idea directors rebus just shrugged about all i can tell you is that it was called mensung clarke and holmes looked at one another the councillors file they said as one it was a retraining company not a very good one apparently it had premises at the top of leith walk next to the playhouse i want you to check companies house any registers you can find any lists of retraining companies in scotland he nodded to the waitress that they were ready to order now dont stint yourselves he told them believe me youre going to earn this meal he checked leith walk himself next to the playhouse was a pub and then a newsagents but between them was a door not quite shut there were a couple of business plaques on the wall outside and spaces where other plaques had been removed rebus pushed open the door noting that it was none too steady on its hinges and entered an unlit hallway smelling worse than many a bars convenience the stone steps up were deeply worn the walls decorated with graffiti on the first floor he was met by two solid doors one with a card pinned to it saying combined knitwear the other with a much olderlooking nameplate j joseph simpson associates rebus climbed to the second floor but the doors here were anonymous and heavily padlocked he went back down to the first floor and knocked on the door of simpson associates then pushed the door open he was in a hallway much like his own flats rooms led off and there was a reception sign pointing into one of them the door was already open so rebus walked in seated behind desk and typewriter an elderly man was on the telephone rebus was not totally surprised to see a male secretary but hed never come across such a superannuated one paperwork slewed across desk chairs and the carpet the man looked startled by rebuss entry and slammed the phone down sorry to interrupt rebus said quite all right quite all right the man made show of gathering up some of the sheets of paper now what can i do for you sir the man reminded rebus of charles laughton he was rotund with several chins and had puffy worried eyes with blotched shiny skin he wore a suit which had been in fashion forty years before including waistcoat and watchchain it struck rebus for a moment that he would pass for sir iain hunters bloated and seedy elder brother rebus showed his id inspector rebus sir im interested in a company that used to have its offices here here in this building about eight years ago were you here then most certainly the company was called mensung curious name the man repeated it silently a few times no he said i cant say ive heard of it are you sure completely sure maybe if i could have a word with your employer the man smiled i am my employer joe simpson at your service im sorry mr simpson you thought i was the secretary simpson looked amused well i suppose i am at that my last secretary left after only two days hopeless these girls the agency sends its all hours with them dont ever try to get them to stay a minute later than five oclock he shook his head you dont know who your secretary was eight years ago mr simpson joe simpson wagged a finger you think her memory might be better than my own but youd be wrong besides ive no idea there have been so many women at this desk he shook his head again so mr simpson eight years ago what companies were there in this building well there was mine of course and then there was capital yarns now combined knitwear the woman who ran capital yarns left in the place was empty the best part of a year then a computer showroom opened that lasted all of three months the place was empty again until mrs burnett arrived shes combined knitwear what about upstairs oh years back those were offices now theyre just stockrooms have been for a decade or more rebus was at a dead end as surely as if hed stayed on the floor above he tried simpson with the name mensung again spelt it for him wrote it down and all the old man did was twitch his head and say definitely and positively no so rebus thanked him and went back out on to the landing resting against the banister these small tenement businesses there were a lot of them in edinburgh small shifting and anonymous he didnt see how they ever made money it struck him that he didnt even know what j joseph simpson associates did but he was willing to bet there were no associates perhaps never had been he was about to leave when the door of combined knitwear opened and two women stepped out they glanced towards him before continuing their conversation one of the women wore a coat and carried two bulging plastic bags which didnt seem heavy wool rebus surmised the other woman wore a knitted twopiece red and black check and a string of pearls a pair of glasses hung by a string around her neck she was petite trim probably rebuss age well thanks again she said to the departing customer then to rebus can i help mrs burnett yes she sounded uneasy inspector rebus again he showed his id is it a breakin those stockrooms could have steel doors theyd still find a way in no its not a breakin oh she looked at him look im about to put the kettle on do you fancy a cup rebus accepted her offer with pleasure combined knitwears premises were laid out like joe simpsons four rooms leading off a narrow hallway one room served as an office mrs burnett was in there at the sink filling a kettle rebus looked into the other rooms wool lots and lots of wool deep shelves had been installed to display the stuff there were boxes of knitting patterns a perspex case filled with pairs of needles the walls and doors were decorated with blownup photos from the fronts of various knitting patterns smiling untroubled men women who looked like models from fifteen or twenty years ago from a series of dowelrods on one wall hung skeins of thick white wool rebus liked the smell of the place it reminded him of his mother and all his aunties and their friends his mother used to tell him off for using her knitting needles as drumsticks he turned and saw that mrs burnett was standing in the doorway you looked very peaceful there for a minute she said i felt it teas about ready do you happen to know what mr simpson next door does she laughed lightly ive been wondering that for years years did he tell you i was a newcomer he doesnt remember me but i used to work here when it was capital yarns it wasnt my business i was staff but when i decided to set up for myself and saw that this place was available well i couldnt help myself she sighed sentiment inspector nostalgia never be swayed by it not too many customers are willing to make the trek from princes street id be better off somewhere more central rebus recalled the story of how ibm had come to set up in greenock nostalgia again but on a grand scale he followed mrs burnett through to the office so were you working here eight years ago around or she poured water into two mugs oh yes was there an outfit here at that time called mensung mensonge he spelt it for her no she said by that time there was just mr simpson and capital yarns youre sure it was this address rebus nodded watching her dip the teabags milk and sugar just milk please she handed him the cup thanks why did you use that pronunciation just now mensonge yes it sounds french it is french it means lie what as in falsehood fib untruth is there something wrong with the tea inspector no nothing at all mrs burnett the teas fine just fine to make absolutely sure rebus asked in the newsagents the owner who had run the place eighteen years shook his head then rebus had a word with the letting agency who confirmed that there was no record of any company called mensung ever renting officespace at the address can you tell me who owns the property rebus asked just out of interest the woman wasnt sure she could rebus stressed again that his inquiries were part of a police investigation and she gave in the owners name she said is a mr j simpson as an individual mr simpson rents space to simpson associates combined knitwear and a mr albert costello costello the newsagent next door the letting agent said nothing so far brian holmes said over a lunchtime drink no record the company ever existed rebus chewed on his last piece of bridie im beginning to think it didnt wheres siobhan by the way at the gym whats a gym brian holmes smiled at that hed put on weight this past year or so and now sported a doughring stomach and the beginnings of beer jowls perks of the job some people said i thought you worked out some lunchtimes he said havent done it for ages but rebus went swimming that afternoon managing twenty thoughtful lengths after which he had to sit in his cubicle for a while that was the problem with exercise it wasnt any fun none of the fit and active people he saw around him seemed any happier than anyone else no point exercising to elongate your life when you werent getting any more out of life than any other poor sod he made up for the swimming by arriving early at the ox waiting to have a word with salty dougary but dougary didnt come and rebus decided to break the rules hed visit dougary at his home dougary was divorced and rented the top floor of a sizeable house not a conversionkick away from murrayfield stadium he couldnt have looked more surprised to see rebus if hed found him servicing his exwife on the doorstep what are you doing here i need a word salty i didnt feel like a drink tonight our boss is driving us like slaves a big order with the deadline approaching and mathieson screaming down the telephone mathieson head honcho at panotech you should see the way our boss salty sorry to bring it up but its freezing out here dougary stepped aside to let rebus in ill warn you he said the place is a midden certainly rebus thought it was no advert for the bachelor life have you run out of binbags or something i never seem to get time to clean up want a beer thanks rebus lifted pizza boxes crisp bags and a couple of empty cans off the sofa and sat down salty came back with a couple of cans and handed one over so whats the emergency rebus sipped froth from the top of the can you said mensung was at the top of leith walk dougary nodded next to a newsagents another nod well i took a look this morning and nobodys heard of them so so are you sure thats where they were that was the address on their letterheading youre sure you wouldnt have any of their letters lying around rebus scanned the room his meaning was clear you seem to hang on to everything else everything got chucked when fiona and me split up i mean everything letters photos i even lost my birth certificate see john i never actually went to see mensung at that address the courses i did they were held at a place on corstorphine road do you remember the number dougary nodded onesixfive corstorphine road see its the date fiona and me got married sixteenfive thats how i remember his face turned wistful two chips soldered together on the motherboard of life rebus tried to remember when he and rhona had married he thought it was probably june or july but that was as much as he could recall first thing next morning he drove along corstorphine road looking for number rebus didnt exactly know what a paperchase was but this was beginning to feel like one the american haldayne had mentioned paper companies and rebus felt he was chasing one now something no more substantial than the sum of its letterheading his visit to corstorphine road seemed to confirm it the present occupants of the office suite told him that back in and the premises had been under a short let sometimes for only days at a time but there were no records of the actual occupants at that time the suites had changed ownership several times since thanks for your help rebus said dead end he thought dead company hed have to get councillor gillespie to talk to him there was no other course left open it was either that or drop it altogether that after all was what everyone wanted but then hed never been a crowd pleaser hed never played to the gallery hed talk to councillor tom gillespie but after the weekend and meantime he had some fast shopping to do new clothes for some reason he wanted new clothes to wear to sir iains three zugzwang two lowbuilt stone pillars marked the start of the long snaking driveway rebus turned off the main road on to the gravel track and stopped the car there were no signs nothing at all to tell him this was the right turning he looked at the map on the back of his invitation and decided it was the very anonymity of the track seemed to fit with sir lain hunter either side of rebus were open fields but these soon gave way to dense woodland drystane dykes overgrown with moss separated the driveway from the trees finally after half a mile he emerged from the shade into a bright expanse of tended lawn with greenhouses and a walled vegetable garden off and directly in front of him stood a grey stone house in the scots baronial style boasting two turrets probably ornamental which started at the level of the first floor and tapered to slatecovered points above the roofline there were three cars a rover jaguar and maserati parked on the clean pink gravel rebus stopped beside them and got out trying not to be impressed in the distance a stream bisected the trim lawn with a narrow humpbacked bridge across it it reminded him of nothing so much as one of the fairways at st andrews its a lovely view isnt it the voice was sir iains he was walking towards rebus leaning lightly on a carved walkingstick at home it would appear the brolly wasnt necessary just thinking i should have brought my three iron ah you play golf only with a three iron hunter laughed and placed a hand on rebuss shoulder find the place all right no trouble good hunter was steering rebus towards the house i thought wed have a drink first then do a spot of shooting and just have a light lunch shooting i take it youve handled a gun inspector ive handled a lot of things i did wonder if we might try for pheasant or winter hare but decided on clay pigeon well it tastes nicer doesnt it sir iain hunter shook his head amused theres no telling what youll say next inspector they entered a capacious hall with white marble floor and paintings on the walls modern art which surprised rebus a lot of the stuff looked ill at ease in a setting of wood panelling and fluted columns a staircase with a wroughtiron balustrade climbed up the middle of the hall and peeled off to left and right in here hunter said let me take your coat rebus slipped off his new raincoat and shrugged himself back into his sports jacket he patted his tie flat and walked into the morning room a servant was dispensing drinks from a series of decanters on a trolley so rebus thought i was important enough to be met by the boss rather than the flunky he stood there not really looking at anyone biding his time until sir lain came back into the room hello john someone said walking towards him hand held out the man held a heavy crystal tumbler in his other hand and looked slightly embarrassed it wasnt until rebus had taken the mans hand that he recognised him it was allan gunner the deputy chief constable do you know everyone gunner said leading rebus to the drinks trolley rebuss first thought after hed recovered from the surprise was at least gunner had the grace to look embarrassed his second thought was ive walked into this fair and square the servant was waiting for rebuss order he was a little stooped from a lifetimes obsequiousness and had a tryingtoplease smile on his thin lips he wore a tight little jacket of blue nylon all its buttons done up it probably helped with the stoop ill take a malt rebus said west highland or strathspey sir strathspey and no water another guest laughed sir lain wont allow water of any form near his whiskies he held his cigar and glass in one hand so he could extend the other towards rebus colin macrae he said sir colin gunner added is scottish office minister for agriculture and the environment john rebus rebus told the man which left only two guests both male both involved in a muted discussion by the french windows but gunner was applying discreet pressure to rebuss arm manoeuvring him away from the drinks trolley where sir colin was ordering a topup they ended up beside a massive stone fireplace gunner spoke in a fierce whisper i dont know what youre doing here me neither but while were in company wed better show a united front especially in front of these characters agreed so firstname terms no formalities fair enough sir the names allan allan ah hunter said entering the room and pointing at them with his stick the same old story everyones got a drink but the host the servant poured without being asked a telephone sounded in the hall and he went to answer it head bowed as he left the room cheers said sir iain he motioned for rebus to join him met everyone the couple from the window were coming back to replenish their glasses rebus nodded towards them robbie sir iain said come and meet detective inspector john rebus john this is robbie mathieson mathieson shook rebuss hand he was tall well built and had thick black hair and a black beard the glasses he wore sported blue tints pleased to meet you his accent was slightly american panotech rebus guessed mathieson nodded a bit put out by the recognition and sir iain looked interested that rebus should know mathieson sir iain turned to allan gunner chief constable is it a wonder the crime rate is falling and the detection rate rising when you can boast men of this calibre he looked back to rebus its almost uncanny a game was being played and rebus didnt know what it was but he knew that his knowing who mathieson was was part of it gunner was correcting sir iain its deputy chief constable a slip of the tongue hunter said with a wink to the general assembly perhaps i was merely looking into the future thats what we civil servants are good at you know dugald your glass needs a topup dugald held out his hand for a refill nobody had introduced him because nobody needed to he was quiet thoughtful or maybe he just didnt waste words hardly surprising when everything he said might be taken down and passed to the media who might use it in evidence against him he couldnt afford to trust those he did not know certainly he didnt know rebus but rebus knew him he was dugald niven the right honourable dugald niven he was secretary of state for scotland lets take our drinks through to the gun room sir iain said and get everyone kitted out rebus poured and drank another half glass before following everyone out of the room it was barely above zero outside bracing and fresh according to sir iain and they were going to have a picnic the provisions would be waiting for them at the claypigeon site to get to the site itself necessitated a walk through the woods in the gun room theyd been fitted with green sportsmens jackets sleeveless and thickly padded with cartridgebelt attached they were handed a shotgun each broken open for safetys sake rebus stayed to the rear of the party and gunner slowed down to join him so what are you doing here gunner asked i thought youd know me youve had me taken off an investigation ive done no such thing ok then you requested i be taken off gunner tucked his shotgun more firmly under his arm whats that got to do with you being here i wish i knew if youre asking me to make an inspired guess go on well ive been brought here so you can work on me what youre going to warn me off again and ill be so impressed by the surroundings and the company ill fall to my knees and plead forgiveness gunner gave him a blazing look thats ridiculous in that case what are you doing here im in the dark first time ive been invited maybe sir iain wants to get to know me hes a canny diplomat as well as being a manipulator gunner paused the chief constable will be retiring soon bit young for that isnt he his wifes ill she needs looking after so youll be promoted i assume so always supposing youre given a clean bill of health what by hmic for example that kind of threat works both ways allan gunner narrowed his eyes what do you mean shug mcanally kills himself i try to find out why turns out hes recently been sharing a cell with a man called charters this despite the fact mcanallys in for a sex attack only none of the other inmates knows that i still dont see what youre getting at yes you do mcanally was alister flowers grass flower worked under you on the case against charters mcanally was put in charters cell to see what he could glean now flower hasnt got the weight to set up something like that itd need someone more senior to have a word with big jim flett someone like yourself sir gunner kept his eyes on the ground and said nothing and now rebus went on ive got the likes of hunter warning me off too gunner looked up at the knot of men ahead they were picking their way over fallen branches and through stunted undergrowth between mature trees i want us to talk he said fine but not here sir iain had stopped and was gesturing come on slowcoaches ive got one good leg and im still beating you he waited for them to join him how much land have you got here sir lain gunner asked suddenly the wellmannered guest a hundred and seventy acres but dont worry were not walking all of it soon they broke out of the woods into a rutted field of stubble by the side of the field was a track just wide enough for the vehicle that sat there a venerable land rover the same olive green as their jackets the servant was at the back of the vehicle unpacking a large wicker hamper there was another man halfway across the field standing beside some apparatus rebus took to be the claypigeon release rebus ended up standing next to the secretary of state the man didnt seem inclined to speak rebus wondered what hed been discussing with robbie mathieson in the morning room rebus turned to mathieson a friend of mine works for one of your suppliers oh mathieson didnt sound particularly interested deltona rebus said mathiesons beard moved in what might have been a smile then i hope he didnt have plans this weekend ive been promised that plant will work all weekend im due a big order from them by midweek i wouldnt want to have to find a new supplier hows the work on labarum progressing mathieson stared at him then fed cartridges into the shotguns double chamber its going pretty well he said can i ask how you know about it rebus shrugged word gets around does it mathieson snapped shut the gun actually i came across a copy of your business plan in a council house in stenhouse what was it doing there mathieson seemed calm enough i havent the faintest idea rebus told him someone had scrawled the word dalgety on it mathieson flinched and dropped a cartridge pull sir iain called a clay disc sprang into the air there was an explosion then another and the disc shattered sir lain broke open his gun damned good shot commented sir colin macrae you know its unusual sir iains saturdays are normally corporate affairs but today weve got two policemen mathieson looked like he wanted rebus to tell him something but rebus didnt know what pull more gunshots filled the air not bad dugald not bad tell me rebus asked mathieson do you know a man called derwood charters i dont think so ive heard he helped finance panotech in the early days mathieson laughed youre misinformed come on allan youre next when robbie mathiesons turn came he missed the target with both barrels not like you robbie sir lain laughed glancing towards rebus he looked uncommonly pleased rebus felt he was being used he still didnt know why or how when his own turn came to shoot he missed with both barrels sir lain insisted he try again straight away youre a tyro he said you need the practice im sure we all missed a few in the beginning this time rebus chipped a bit off the disc with his second shot see said sir iain now youre getting the hang of it maybe he was at that ears still ringing rebus joined the others at the land rover there were flasks of scotch broth sandwiches in silver foil hipflasks of whisky and larger flasks of tea rebuss sandwich was brown bread and smoked salmon the salmon was sliced thick and had been sprinkled with lemon juice and pepper he took a small nip of whisky when the hipflask came round then drank two mugs of strong tea with all the games he felt were going on he wanted to clear his head he wasnt sure if he was a player a counter or the die hed been shown one thing though the game was dangerous at stake his professional career which was everything he lived for practically every man present had it within his power to push rebus off the playingboard and off the force he started to get angry angry with himself for coming angry with sir iain hunter so smug so manipulative for bringing him here rebus knew now that he hadnt just been brought here so he could be warned off he swallowed the anger down and held it in his gut it was hotter than tea stronger than whisky they were almost back at the house when sir iain gripped rebuss elbow and led him towards the greenhouses well catch you up he called to the others then to rebus still holding him by the elbow have a nice chat with robbie mathieson rebus shrugged off sir iains hand and with allan gunner too i noticed why am i here i admire your directness youre here because i want to know if youve decided decided what to stop your investigation are you willing to tell me why youre so interested sir iains gaze hardened im willing to tell you one thing if youre willing to listen they were standing in front of one of the long greenhouses looking through the misted windows rebus could see trestle tables and empty flowerpots and seedtrays but there was nothing growing in there nothing at all im listening he said then ill tell you that scottish jobs are at risk at risk from what from you inspector if you continue stumbling blindly around let it take its course thats what im saying rebus turned to him let what take its course youre not telling me anything how am i supposed to know what to do and what not to do you know what to do hunter said calmly stop your little private investigation if it goes any further hundreds of jobs could disappear do you hear me hundreds you wouldnt want that on your conscience im sure i dont believe you rebus said hunter looked at him with something near pity yes you do inspector he did too it was in hunters voice in the way his frame shivered when he spoke he believed what he was saying believed it with a passion hundreds of jobs sir lain started to walk towards the house rebus followed making sure he never caught up as agreed rebus and gunner left the house separately but met up at a hotel in auchterarder i dont usually drink gunner confided washing down two aspirin with an orange juice they sat in a corner of the quiet lounge bar for a saturday the main street was quiet the shoppers would all be in perth keeping warm in department stores and superstores the tv was showing rio bravo john wayne doing his john wayne walk i dont usually shoot rebus said so now weve both seen how the other half lives gunner put down his glass and took a deep breath lets get down to business whatever you think inspector i wasnt there to scare you off i got my invite in the mail same as you did ive been thinking and my conclusion is that sir lain wanted to play us off against one another or perhaps he thought that my presence would serve to unnerve you rebus nodded agreement one other option he added we were both there to scare someone else mathieson didnt like it that policemen were present what are they so worried about hunter told me it has to do with jobs jobs what kind of jobs rebus shook his head how far could he trust gunner the man was the first person whod tried to take him out of the game are you going to own up about mcanally gunner examined his fingernails youre right in just about every detail i had mcanally moved to saughton and into charters cell then he went and got cancer and wasnt getting any information out of charters so i arranged for his early release and he went straight to councillor gillespie and blew his head off in front of him i dont know why he did that why was mcanally in charters cell to see if he could talk himself into charters confidence i wanted to see what charters was hiding i knew he was hiding something but couldnt think what to do about it until flower suggested mcanally and what is charters hiding exactly money what else i dont mean hes hiding it literally though perhaps he is but back in the mideighties he was coining it and we werent sure where the cash was coming from he had about half a dozen companies legit as far as the fraud unit could tell but they made more money than they should have i thought thats what thatcherism was all about was one of his companies called mensung yes and were all his companies involved in retraining that sort of thing their paperwork was so convoluted positively labyrinthine that even our specialists couldnt find a clear path through it they were all agreed on one thing derry charters had a genius for muddying the water you could track a company of his for months and not get to the bottom of its financial status ive heard he helped finance panotech at one time who told you that is it true i dont think so did one of charters investors tell you rebus nodded probably a story he spun them he could be very persuasive but all this was eight nine years ago yes and since then hes cleaned up his act or had done until he burnt peoples fingers with albavise so why are you still chasing him over a piece of ancient history a couple of reasons one i spent a lot of my time and effort in the fraud unit chasing him without getting a result it represents probably the only blot on my record two our best guess when we investigated him was that he was fiddling millions he had rebuss full attention millions he repeated and for me that makes him worth the chase where did he fiddle these millions from but gunner just shrugged rebus was thoughtful for a moment the bar was filling and the tv had been switched over to show the football scores not that many games were being played the pitches were dangerously hard ive read the case against him on albavise any chance that i can see the other paperwork gunner studied him theres a hell of a lot and its in no particular order you think you can spot something our financial gurus couldnt rebus shrugged just for my peace of mind id like to talk to charters too what his cellmates committed suicide it looks strange if nobodys been near to ask him about mcanallys state of mind prior to release i mean whod know better than him gunner nodded fair point speaking of mcanally how much did you pay him what he was working for you feeding you information im assuming he was paid he didnt give us anything of relevance we gave him a few pounds here and there nothing more rebus was seeing tresa mcanallys flat in his mind new door new decor new tv does it matter it did to wee shug rebus said quietly someone had given him the money money hed passed on to tresa almost like life insurance who did wee shug know with money apart from his cellmate gunner finished his drink i wonder what sir iain will be up to tonight the way he was tucking into the hooch sleeping it off id imagine does he drive to edinburgh and back every day he only uses ruthie at weekends when hes at work he has a flat in the new town whereabouts exactly royal circus i think royal circus thought rebus where haldayne collected some of his parking tickets life was just full of coincidences if you happened to believe as rebus himself did not in coincidence early sunday morning a sleepyeyed detective sergeant from lothian borders police headquarters turned up at rebuss flat youd better give me a hand he said rebus followed him down to where a patrol car idled kerbside he peered in through the passenger side window maybe wed better hire a winch it took them four trips to transfer the boxes from the car to rebuss livingroom rebus put the binbags behind the sofa to make room on the floor sign here the ds said he had a typed chitty receipt of all casenotes boxes concerning derwood char rebus signed date and time too said the ds youll be wanting a tip next rebus muttered if youre offering well heres one for you when lifting bend your knees not your back he phoned siobhan clarke why me she said because brian holmes has a home life that could be construed as discrimination when do you want me there say an hour he tidied the living room a bit depositing the bin bags in the hall and setting the file boxes in a row on the floor then he collected up all the dirty mugs glasses and dishes and took them through to the kitchen he emptied the coffeejar and put it back under the radiator and opened the livingroom window an inch to air the place the sun was out showing that the windows hadnt been cleaned since the autumn rebus decided enough was enough shes coming here to work he told himself not for a candlelit supper they got two breaks both late in the afternoon the first was a clients name quinlon ive come across that name before rebus said it took him a while to place it the civil servant rory mcallister he mentioned someone called quinlon a building contractor thered been some shady business between the sda and him it was one of the things held against the sda when they were deciding its fate rebus flipped back a page in the notes and charters client happened to be a building contractor so so somehow the media got to hear about the sda and quinlon and that story helped sink the sda who was going to gain by the sdas demise charters yes because the financial slate was going to be wiped clean and thered be no possibility of a future investigation into where the sda millions had gone you think charters grassed on his client i wouldnt put anything past him the second break came soon after it was clear from the casenotes that the fraud unit had been focusing on charters when his associates were mentioned they were dismissed as fronts or moneymen nobody thought the directors had anything to do with whatever swindles charters was perpetrating which was why they werent mentioned often and in the case of mensung not at all but then rebus picked up the photocopy of a letter sent by charters to the sda the mensung logo was at the top together with the nonexistent leith walk address referred to as mensung house at the foot of the letter was the companys registration number you couldnt find mensung in companies house right right said clarke i had their archivist take a good look well either they were registered or this is a phony number the records could have been mislaid now wouldnt that be a coincidence the final line of the sheet was blurred rebus peered at the row of names the names of mensungs directors because he knew what he was looking for he could pick out the name charters quite easily the others were more difficult it took real effort to decipher j joseph simpsons name figures rebus said he wanted another word with simpson anyway but this explained why hed lied about mensungs address the company had been dodgy under investigation and simpson had been a director it wasnt the kind of thing you wanted to publicise when you were still in business as for the third and last name can you make that out rebus asked passing the sheet to siobhan clarke starts with an m she suggested murchieson murchieson i dont know maybe matthews something like that rebus took the sheet back from her matthews murchieson mathieson he said staring at the slewed writing could it be mathieson she shrugged as in i met a man yesterday called robbie mathieson he runs panotech silicon glens homegrown success story rebus nodded weve all just been supplied with panotech computers havent we everybody from the chief constable down which meant that allan gunner would have one too who do you suppose would decide something like that like what like which manufacturer was going to supply us it would be the director of corporate services wouldnt it but the dcc would have a say probably is it relevant rebus wondered panotech put the computers together in gyle park west and gyle part west was one of councillor gillespies files mensung was another there was the story that derry charters had something to do with the early financing of panotech and panotechs boss just happened to be at sir iain hunters looking worried about something and allan gunner was there too wheels within wheels he thought scotland was a machine a big machine if you looked at it from the outside but from the inside it assumed a new form small intimate not that many moving parts and all of them interconnected quite intricately rebus knew he was still outside the machine but he knew now that one reason why hed been invited to the shooting party was that sir iain hunter was inviting him in they could make him part of the machine a chip on the motherboard all it took was friends in the right places after that anything could happen they worked solidly till fivethirty i hope im being treated to dinner clarke said stretching her spine whos taking you you are she said rebus shook his head ive other plans tonight sorry well thanks a lot i give up my precious sunday to help you and then you boot me out she narrowed her eyes got a date she was attempting a peculiarly scottish tactic being serious while pretending levity im working rebus said working ive got to talk to someone anyone i know rebus shook his head but dont think i dont appreciate your help he saw her to the door when the bell rang two minutes later he thought she must have forgotten something but it wasnt siobhan clarke standing on his doorstep it was gill templer mind if i come in she said walking past him i was just on my way out this wont take long i tried phoning but it was engaged all afternoon i had it off the hook rebus said following her into the living room she looked at the boxes of documents i see youre really taking your furlough seriously come on gill it was foisted on me you were there remember i remember the chief super had been getting incredible flak in his shoes id have done the same thing this isnt sounding like a social call thats because it isnt one the lord provost is your latest victim he called the chief super and said youd been rude to him did he mention specifics no i didnt think he would the farmer will probably call you in the morning himself id imagine itll be an official reprimand maybe even a suspension she turned to him her eyes blazing how could you do this to me what im your immediate superior im in the post barely a week and already youve caused the most unholy ructions how do you think that makes me look its got nothing to do with you yes it bloody well has its got everything to do with me youre one of my officers how am i supposed to work to get a feel for the job when all the chief super does is fret about what grenade youre going to chuck next rebus nodded his understanding thats what this is about youre pissed off because the farmers not paying you enough attention you want to create a good impression and youre not making any impression at all now youre just twisting my words am i he grabbed her by the arms look me in the face and tell me that tell me im not right she shrugged free of his grip john she said more calmly i came here to warn you tomorrow morning could spell the end of your career you think i care about that he tried to sound casual she took a step towards him yes she said quietly i think you do her green eyes seemed to bore into him i think beneath it all youre scared scared he smiled of course im scared i wouldnt mind if it was some big hard bastard who had me cornered in an alley or if some kind of contract was out on me but this is worse this scares me to death then drop it say youre sorry to a few people and come back to work he smiled again it would be that easy wouldnt it youd do it yes i would well ill think about it she tried to measure his sincerity but it was like measuring haar big jim flett was nowhere to be seen even the big man has to take a few hours off here and there his deputy said leading rebus down one of the corridors inside saughton jail im sure rebus said even though he was sure the governor was avoiding him he had lied to rebus and now rebus knew it derry doesnt get many visitors the deputy said he was a brisk nervous man ruddyfaced and jacketless with his shirtsleeves rolled up you know him then weve had conversations i was told he didnt mix thats true but ive always found him pleasant enough he hasnt tried to sell you anything has he the deputy laughed no not yet hed make a damned good salesman though whats he like quiet for the most part never gives us any trouble they were nearing a metal door beside which stood a warden the warden unlocked the door and swung it open youre sure you dont want me to stay the deputy asked rebus rebus shook his head but with a gracious smile well munro here will take derry back to his cell when youre finished thanks again rebus said the door closed after him the key rattling in its lock rebus was alone with derwood charters charters was pacing the floor arms folded head bowed as if he was pondering some problem do you play chess charters asked without looking up no pity rebus looked around the room there was a table its legs bolted to the floor and two chairs beside it on one wall a blackboard provided the rooms only hint of decoration mind if i sit rebus said make yourself comfortable charters smiled at his little joke he continued to pace the floor and rebus studied him charters was in his midforties tall and broadshouldered he was immaculately groomed his hair parted just so his face shiny and cleanshaven his fingernails looked manicured do you know what zugzwang means sounds german rebus said for the first time charters looked at him of course its german its a chess position its when youve to play only any move you make will spell disaster yet youve got to make a move there was a chess puzzle in todays paper and im damned if i can solve it the solutions easy rebus said charters stopped pacing what take up golf instead charters considered this then smiled he came and sat down opposite rebus folding his hands on the table may i see some identification rebus took out his warrant card charters examined it against the light as though it might represent a particularly brilliant forgery on a sunday night he said handing it back pardon i dont get many visitors let alone on a sunday night and a police officer at that im here to ask you a few questions about wee shug mcanally ah yes hugh mcanally probably hadnt been called hugh by anyone apart from the minister at his christening and the judge who pronounced sentence on him charters seemed to read rebuss mind i respect a persons name inspector its all we bring into this world and its all we take out of it my own name is sometimes abbreviated to derry in here that has earned me the nickname the apprentice boy charters voice quiet atonal had a mesmeric quality and once his eyes had fixed on rebuss they never left them you know he committed suicide mr charters very unfortunate suicides have to be investigated i didnt know that whether you know it or not it happens to be the case tell me did mcanally talk to you much all the time to be frank it annoyed me even when i was trying to read hed be blethering on about nothing of consequence just filling the cell with noise as though there wasnt enough noise in here already at the start i thought hed been allotted my cell as some subtle form of punishment you know psychological torture so what did he talk about im assuming these were fairly onesided affairs they were soliloquys as to the substance he talked about his background his wife interminably about his wife i feel i know her as well as her gynaecologist must he spoke of his affairs with other women which i didnt believe for one second and every time he finished a story hed ask me plead with me to tell him something about myself charters paused what do you make of that inspector i mean hugh was obsessed with himself and yet every now and then hed suddenly stop and ask me something dont you think thats strange rebus ignored the question what was he in for you see youve avoided answering thats what i had to do twenty times a day are you going to answer he told me it was for housebreaking and i believe youre inside for fraud is that correct interesting charters mused patting his fingers against his mouth why would you ask me what hugh was inside for i just wondered rebus improvised if the two of you ever talked about it im trying to build up a picture of him to hazard a guess as to why he killed himself yes well obviously he killed himself because he was dying of cancer did he tell you that charters smiled again im only guessing well youre probably right thats probably why he did kill himself what it doesnt explain is the manner you mean why would he pick on a city councillor to witness his last rites rebus nodded have you tried asking the councillor yes and what did he say charters was trying to sound casually curious rebus stared at him do you know the councillor he asked never met him thats not what i asked charters sat back and folded his arms now youre learning subtlety inspector our contest can only improve its not a game of chess mr charters charters looked penitent of course not im sorry do you know the councillor rebus repeated i read newspapers inspector i keep up with events so to a certain extent yes i know councillor gillespie and does he know you why should he it was rebuss turn to smile charters had used the word subtlety rebus was learning that he must needs be oblique you ran a company called mensung didnt you a long time ago yes rebus noticed that though he was outwardly well groomed charters teeth were the colour of dead fish i like these tangents inspector your mind moves in mysterious ways difficult to zugzwang someone who plays so erratically why are you interested in a company i wound up seven years ago i told a friend of mine i was coming to speak to you he said he attended some retraining seminars held by mensung on corstorphine road the response seemed to satisfy charters which company did he work for he didnt say he still works in electronics for one of panotechs subcontractors then maybe the seminars did him some good rebus nodded i heard a story that you helped finance panotech when the company was in its infancy charters raised an eyebrow stories tend to become confused over time youd nothing to do with it then charters shook his head by the way why did mensung go bust it didnt go bust i wound it up i was bored with it and couldnt find anyone to buy me out he shrugged im easily bored he got up and started pacing the room again you know inspector you told me you were here to ask a few questions about hugh weve strayed a long way from that particular topic wouldnt you say rebus stood up going so soon youre enjoying yourself too much derry this isnt supposed to be fun a mans dead charters stopped pacing a man who was dying anyway a man who chose his own route out luckier than most of us id wager if the doctors told me i had only a few agonising months to live i think id go find myself a gun too but the world would look so unfair to my eyes all those people so alive and vibrant around me all those ill people being cured in hospitals maybe id want a witness to the injustice of it all someone representing authority in my eyes and the eyes of those around me maybe id want him to see my agony to share in my horror it would have to be an easy target though and a councillor is such an easy target accessible public approachable id be making a point to the world i would refuse to die in silence the silence after charters had finished was resonant he had worked himself up to a pitch and now calmed only slowly there had been anger in his voice and fervour and conviction his eyes were on rebuss hed make a damned good salesman i dont buy it rebus said going to the door inspector rebus paused you called me derry that was a cheap shot apart from that you did pretty well he paced the floor again hugh didnt really talk about his wife that often there was another woman he described her so accurately i could probably paint her for you even now her name was maisie he talked about her all the time i think he loved her more than anyone in the world perhaps you should talk to her i already have mr charters rebus left the cell feeling that charters had given a name to his own feelings about the investigation willie and dixie and life in general the word was zugzwang it was four am when his phone rang he came awake but left it to ring four am news just had to be bad the caller persisted and at last rebus picked up the receiver mr rebus a young voice insolent a bit drunk loud music and voices in the background a party yes its paul paul duggan paul nice of you to call is it late i dont have my watch on it sounds like a great party paul give me the address and ill drop by with a few uniforms dont be like that mr rebus i bring glad tidings ive found her kirstie kennedy aye is she all right not bad for a junkie can i speak to her listen shes adamant shes not going home she says her stepmums a lunatic id like to see her theres no question of her having to go home i dont know duggan sounded doubtful paul dont hang up listen would she talk to me if i paid her look ill have a word with her no promises but ill have a word see what she says just do me a favour phone in daylight next time if youre lucky i might even phone when im sober it was eight am when his phone next rang yes he croaked trying to find some saliva in his mouth john it was the farmers voice here it comes thought rebus morning sir whats it to be reprimand suspension or dismissal damn you john i had a hell of a weekend because of you im sorry sir i never meant to get you into trouble thats your problem inspector youre selfish no other word for it i think you know damned well that these obsessions of yours end up damaging everyone around you friend foe and civilians alike yes sir but it doesnt bother you does it rebus didnt answer the farmer had obviously been preparing his speech for a while as long as your own personal morality is satisfied thats all that counts sod everybody else isnt that right it feels that way sometimes sir rebus said quietly well maybe you should consider that morality of yours because its no code id want to live with you dont have to live with it sir i do well you lead a charmed existence thats all i can say rebus frowned how do you mean ive discussed things with the dcc he said hed apologise to the lord provost on your behalf he also said he thought hmic would be investigating f troop instead of us f troop meaning f division livingston what are you saying sir im saying i want you back here the holidays over report to my office this morning ive a dentists appointment well this afternoon then yes sir look john have you and the dcc had any contact ive been on holiday sir yes but all the same well maybe i did bump into him by the pool it was another grim day no snow or ice but a freezing wind and gusts of rain the sky oppressively weighted with cloud it was like the city was in a box and someone had pushed the lid on too tightly rebuss second visit to dr keene wasnt so traumatic you could get used to anything the tooth had drained nicely and keene did the root canal while rebus concentrated on the photograph on the ceiling he plotted paul duggans property portfolio maybe duggan had a point nobody was suggesting he was overcharging his tenants he was making a profit out of each house and flat but nothing outrageous and meantime he was putting roofs over heads rebus knew there might needs be a tradeoff if he wanted to see kirstie duggan might want rebus to put in a good word come trial time always supposing it came to trial the district council was about to be replaced with another body who knew what would be written off suddenly something clicked in rebuss brain he saw something he should have seen before he was so busy thinking that he didnt hear dr keene say that while rebus was there he might as well start on the fillings there were no cheers no banners or bunting as rebus walked back into st leonards and poured himself a cup of coffee a word to the wise siobhan clarke said what youre pouring coffee down your tie it was true with his mouth still numb he was dribbling he went to the toilets and pulled out a clump of paper towels soaked them in water and dabbed at his tie here he is said flower pushing open the door the proverbial bad penny dont be so hard on yourself rebus retorted flower came to the sink and checked his hair in the mirror i see you managed to start a fire then take credit for putting it out flower chuckled word gets around eh speaking of words that get around i had a chat with someone about your snitch which one shug mcanally we could all have been spared some grief if youd told me at the start he was working for you its not the sort of thing you can publicise i mean flower looked around planting a snitch in somebodys cell you dont mind telling me now though has the dcc had a word he said youd been asking flower looked unnaturally pleased with himself rebus could guess why you think youre quidsin with the dcc dont you well if it ever came out about mcanally the dcc could get into trouble flower winked he needs to keep me sweet what you mean is youve got him either way if the plan succeeded itd be because of you if it went badly it would need covering up which would take your help gunner would still owe you thats why youve been blocking me you didnt want me getting to the dcc hes your little investment flower chuckled again and tucked a stray hair back behind his ear there was a sound of flushing from one of the two cubicles flowers head jerked around his mouth open as the cubicle door opened and the farmer came out this came as no surprise to rebus hed seen the farmer enter the toilets just before him morning sir he said flower didnt say anything the farmer pointed at him my office inspector flower now then he opened the door and was gone flower turned on rebus you knew you bloody well knew rebus tossed the ball of sodden paper into the bin onenil someone was at the front desk asking for him that was the message but when rebus got there there was nobody about then he saw a figure outside motioning to him it was paul duggan he was wearing his long black coat again but it had a small tear in the sleeve and a white smudge on one shoulder nothing personal like he said when rebus joined him outside but i hate police stations theres a cafe across duggan was shaking his head shes waiting for us kirstie duggan nodded where have you got a car they went to rebuss car duggan directed him down the pleasance and right on holyrood road this was a dispiriting part of town all empty sites and disused warehouses the younger universe was under construction and was going to make everything all right again if you believed the publicity rebus hoped it would succeed he liked the symbolism the usa had disneyland and scotland gets a theme park built by a brewery the theme park would be a neighbour to holyrood palace the monarchs edinburgh residence this too rebus liked where are we going just park by the palace gates it was easy to park this time of year in warmer seasons the place was a logjam of tourist coaches a kid was at the locked gates peering through them at the palace beyond toot your horn duggan ordered rebus did so to no effect shes on another planet duggan wound down his window hiy kirstie slowly the kid turned and rebus saw a face older than the frame which supported it nobody had said kirstie kennedy would be so scrawny so tiny but as she walked towards the car her face was set like cement lipstick eyeshadow and panstick provided her with a mask she wore tight black jeans accentuating her matchstick legs and a long shapeless black jumper whose arms stretched down past her hands her hair was greasy shoulderlength tied back with a band a spiky fringe dyed bloodred fell into her eyes she was chewing gum she pulled open the back door and climbed in hello kirstie rebus said where do you want to go i want ice cream rebus thought of lucas but it was too far tollcross he suggested tollcross would do her they sat in the icecream parlour and she ordered the biggest concoction on the menu plus a giant coke the place was quiet an old couple smoking and drinking frothy coffee a harassed mother hissing at her two children who were arguing over bowls of garish ice cream rebus had ordered coffee duggan orange juice and some apple pie with cream rebus remembered that he used to bring sammy in here when she was a kid he looked at the lord provosts daughter and tried to remember she was seventeen paul says you want a word her voice was polite in a way no attitude could hide rebus knew that her street diction her lowclass language had been only recently learned how long have you been on the bob hope kirstie you mean the merry duggan looked at rebus merry mac crack he explained long enough kirstie answered long enough to be tired of it long enough to know you never get tired of it her ice cream arrived three different flavours with chocolate sauce nuts tinned peaches and wafers the sight of it made rebuss teeth crackle your dads been worried he said so what and your mum her sudden convulsion almost sent a mouthful of ice cream on to the table my mum died when i was five what you mean is that woman who lives with my dad ok have you met her no shes off her trolley praise the lord so you dont get on with her is that why you ran away does there have to be a reason rebus shrugged only most teenagers i know who run away they go a bit further you mean london i didnt like it my pals are all up here you mean pals like willie and dixie she put the spoon back on her plate and started on the coke i liked willie dixie was a nutter you never knew what hed do next but willie was all right you heard what they did she nodded you left that wreath for them on the bridge didnt you another nod she dipped her finger into the chocolate sauce she was trying not to care but there was still a core of sentiment buried in her brain a precious nugget of guilt was it your idea kirstie she looked up at him it was wasnt it she got to her feet i have to go to the toilet rebus snatched her wrist why did you do it kirstie just for the money why did you take the labarum plans from your fathers office she shook free of his grip let me go she stumbled away from the table and ran to the toilets rebus sat back and started to light a cigarette no smoking the waitress told him can i get a beer were not licensed rebus nicked his cigarette and put it back in the packet he looked across the table at paul duggan you like her dont you rebus said duggan said nothing he was making circles in the cream with his spoon remember i told you shed left something in willies bedroom it was some papers stolen from her father do you have any idea why she took them duggan shook his head slowly but determinedly shes go easy on her ok or what or shell run duggan paused again eventually the toilet door opened and she walked back to the table arms hanging in a lazy slouch rebus looked into her eyes and saw pupils shrunk to pinheads that was stupid so what she said starting back into her ice cream after two mouthfuls she pushed the plate away the kidnap rebus said the ransom demand it was all your idea wasnt it yes to get back at your stepmother my dad to get back at your dad she nodded and everything he represents the old bastard she was much more together now more confident she didnt care what she told him you know you committed an offence rebus asked id deny it in court id deny it everywhere wheres the proof that it wasnt just two wee boys with a daft scheme in their heads theres corroboration rebus glanced towards duggan you think paul would grass on me she leaned into duggans shoulder and stroked his face he wouldnt do that not even if i offered him a deal on his slum landlord scam kirstie shook her head paul wouldnt hurt me his mum likes me too much well maybe i dont need paul maybe all i need is that labarum document it links you to willie he paused did you write dalgety on the last page she nodded why its something i heard my dad say on the phone when i was listening in dalgety sounded important someone he was worried about dalgetys a person then yes kirstie why did you steal the labarum plan her face creased in a sneer its my dad dont you see if you look closely enough at it if you read all the small print and between the lines all youll find there is my dads face smiling smugly back at you why is he smug because its going to make him a hero and its all crooked i heard him on the phone they were talking about how to cover it all up the whole fucking thing is just a lot of a lot of its all just so much skit i cant have language like that the waitress warned there are children in here well fuck them kirstie screeched jumping to her feet because theyre all fucked anyway just like everybody else ill have to ask you to leave rebus and duggan were on their feet too come on kirstie that girls on drugs or something i know it rebus threw money down on the table kirstie kennedys legs had buckled and duggan was holding her upright lets get her into the car rebus said knowing he should take her straight to st leonards angry with himself because he knew thats the last thing he was going to do instead duggan gave him directions back to where she was staying it was a flat in leith in the maze of narrow roads behind great junction street one of yours is it rebus asked duggan but duggan was busy stroking kirsties forehead even though she was asleep they walked her up the stairs one on either side arms around her back her arms over their shoulders rebus could feel the swell of a small breast and the thin ribcage beneath you did say you wanted to see her duggan was saying exculpating himself and ill want to see her again he knew there was more she could tell him more he needed to hear from her he was trying to figure out who or what was responsible for the deaths of willie and dixie this weightless creature he carried the lads themselves the police for giving chase the lord provost for agreeing to it all maybe even the stepmother for driving kirstie away except that it hadnt just been the stepmother it had been some realisation about the lord provost himself maybe it was the system that same system sammy so passionately attacked a system that had failed willie and dixie as surely as it nurtured people like sir lain hunter and robbie mathieson in nature there had to be balance as some rose others fell or were pushed or made the leap for themselves or maybe just maybe it had been rebus himself for crawling from the wreckage still with the need to confront them standing there in front of them forcing them to choose my obsession he thought my private morality maybe the farmer was right will you stay with her he asked duggan when they reached the top of the stairs duggan nodded rebus knew shed be all right she had someone whod look after her what about you duggan asked what are you going to do but rebus had released his hold on the body and was heading back downstairs he went into a dive he knew near the foot of leith walk it had a burgundy linoleum floor and matching coloured walls and was like staring into somebodys throat whisky rebus said a double and when the whisky came he drank it down in two gulps know something he said to the closest drinker a couple of days ago i was eating wild smoked salmon and shooting claypigeons better that than the other way round son the elderly drinker said adjusting the cap on his head that night mrs cochrane came upstairs to tell him there was a small dark patch on her livingroom ceiling rebus had forgotten to empty the coffeejar water had soaked the bare floorboard beneath wait till its dried out he said by way of apology and ill touch up the paintwork hed been asleep in his chair but now felt wide awake it was half past eleven too late to do anything then the telephone rang and he picked it up im not interested he said youll be interested in this rebus recognised the voice of dc robert burns dont tell me west end needs my help were not that desperate i just thought id do you a favour looks like weve got a murder rebuss grip tightened on the receiver anyone i know identification near the body suggests the names thomas gillespie councillor gillespie i havent told you the best part yet he was found in a lane connecting dundee street to dalry road rebus tried to fix the geography next to the cemetery yes the lanes called coffin walk coffin walk climbed quite steeply from dalry road it had the busy western approach road on one side dalry cemetery on the other it was a narrow alley well lit but long if someone stopped you halfway burns told rebus leading him down the lane thered be no escape but youd see an attacker wouldnt you theres no place to hide burns nodded at the cemetery wall you could stand behind there listen for someone coming then jump over when they got close its the perfect site for an ambush you think thats what this was burns shrugged they were close to the body now police officers with torches were in the cemetery looking for footprints and the murder weapon the lane had been sealed off at both ends and though there was a knot of policemen near the body the only person actually next to it was the pathologist professor gates gates was telling the photographer what to do and di davidson was talking to the undertaker even in mufti padded jacket and jeans rather than the black suit an undertaker was recognisable so what happened rebus asked burns somebody came out of the diggers walked up angle park terrace looked down here and saw the body they thought it was a tramp sleeping rough well theres a night shelter on gorgie road so the guy came down here to say so like a good citizen he saw the blood knew fine well what had happened and called us rebus pointed to a wallet which lay a couple of feet from the body that was lying there yep drivers licence blood donor card but no cash or credit cards cleaned out and nobody saw the attack my guess is he hoofed it back over the wall professor gates had finished his initial examination we can wrap this one up he said but rebus wanted a look first tom gillespie lay in a protective foetal position he hadnt been dead when he dropped hed curled himself around the pain in his gut stab wound professor gates said the shock probably killed him has his widow been notified are you volunteering john davidson said this isnt my patch remember no but you knew the deceased anything you want to tell us rebus shook his head i will ask a question though what was he doing here he lives in marchmont chances are hed never even heard of coffin walk god knows i hadnt so why was he here where was he headed maybe the diggers the diggers was actually the athletic arms pub but got its nickname from the gravediggers whod used it in the past not much of a shortcut is it not much davidson agreed lots of questions john i know the way your mind works davidson you think its a simple mugging gone wrong assailant unknown motive robbery so lets hear your theory rebus smiled his head was full of theories maybe too many for his own good give me a cigarette he said not at the locus john davidson warned rebus looked at the body again it was being bagged a trip to the mortuary first and then the funeral parlour your last journeys in the world as predictable as your first i asked if you had a theory davidson said ok ok rebus put his hands up in surrender take me back to your nice warm police station give me a cigarette and ill tell you a story just dont blame me if it doesnt make sense he would tell davidson what he knew which wasnt half as much as he suspected which itself wasnt half as much as he feared next morning when di davidson went to the widows house rebus went with him the curtains were closed reminding rebus of the day of mcanallys funeral inside tresas flat the door was answered not by mrs gillespie but by helena profitt dressed in circumspect black skirt tights and shoes and a plain white blouse i came as soon as i heard she said leading them inside she looked surprised to see rebus we must he thought stop meeting like this two policemen to see you audrey miss profitt said opening the livingroom door it was a big light room with prominence given to the floortoceiling bookcases which lined two walls the tv didnt look much used and though there was a video machine rebus couldnt see more than half a dozen tapes at one end of the room was a huge desk covered in paperwork and a small table supporting a telephone and fax machine the room it seemed to him was little more than an extension of the office at the front of the house making rebus wonder about gillespies family life or more pertinently the lack of it his widow sat on the sofa legs tucked beneath her shed started to rise but davidson had waved her back down she looked as if she hadnt slept there was an empty mug on the floor and next to it a tiny brown bottle of tablets despite the central heating audrey gillespie was trembling shall i make some tea helena profitt asked not for us thanks davidson said well ill leave you to it shall i pop back later audrey only if its not too much trouble of course not her eyes were redrimmed from crying rebus saw through her act saw she was as broken up as anyone he followed her out of the room could you wait in the kitchen id like a quick word she nodded hesitantly rebus went back into the living room and sat down next to davidson remember me mrs gillespie davidson was saying we met last night davidson was good better than a lot of coppers it was a skill handling other peoples grief gauging what to say and how to say it knowing how much they could take audrey gillespie nodded then looked at rebus and i know you too dont i i came to talk to your husband once rebus strived for the same tone davidson had used has the doctor seen you mrs gillespie davidson asked he gave me pills to help me sleep ridiculous to think i could sleep but youre all right im she sought the words expected of her im coping thank you do you feel up to answering a few more questions she nodded and davidson relaxed a little he brought out his notebook and consulted it now he said you said last night that your husband had gone out to visit a constituent that was what he told you yes but he didnt say where he was meeting this constituent no or the constituents name no or what they were going to discuss she shrugged remembering we ate dinner at eight as usual id done chicken casserole toms favourite he had two helpings after that i thought hed either work in his office he always has work to do or else read the paper instead he said he had to go out youre surprised he ended up in dalry very we dont know anyone in that part of town why would he lie to me well rebus put in he was hiding things from you wasnt he what do you mean davidson gave rebus a warning look and rebus softened his voice a little i mean the day i came here you were busy shredding documents sackfuls of them in a shredder your husband hired specially yes i remember tom said he was running out of space in the office they were ancient history as you can see its pretty cramped with all the paperwork she waved a hand around the room mrs gillespie rebus persisted your husband headed the industrial planning committee did the documents have anything to do with that ive no idea if they were ancient history why bother to shred them why not just chuck them out audrey gillespie got up and walked to the fireplace davidson gave rebus an angry look tom said they could fall into the wrong hands journalists people like that he said it was to do with confidentiality did you look at the files at all i i dont remember she was frantic now her wet eyes everywhere but on the two policemen you werent curious look i dont see what any of this has to do with anything rebus walked over to her and took her hands in his it might have everything to do with your husbands murder mrs gillespie now john davidson complained we dont know but audrey gillespie looked into rebuss eyes and saw something there she could trust she blinked away the tears he was very secretive she said quietly forcing herself to be calm i mean about whatever it was hed been working on hed been at it for months for the best part of a year actually i used to curse the hours he put in he told me it would be worth it he said we should always focus on the long view by that he meant he would one day be an mp it was what he lived for youve no inkling what this project of his was she shook her head it was something hed discovered while serving on the committee and i know it was to do with accounting i could work that much out from the kinds of things he was reading balance sheets profitandloss accounts i trained as an accountant something tom sometimes forgot i run a string of shops now but i still handle the books i could have helped him but he always had to do everything for himself she paused you know the only reason he really needed me was my money im sorry if that sounds heartless not at all davidson said were these company accounts mrs gillespie rebus persisted i think they must have been the numbers involved hundreds of millions of pounds hundreds of millions so it wasnt just mensung or even charters empire it was much bigger rebus thought of panotech and then recalled that someone else had used the phrase hundreds of millions rory mcallister or someone like him mrs gillespie could these figures have been to do with the sda i dont know she slumped back on to the sofa ok john davidson said youve had your say but davidson might as well not have been there you see mrs gillespie rebus said sitting down beside her the thing is someone tried to scare your husband and it worked they paid a man called mcanally to put the fear of god into him i dont know if they knew how far mcanally would go mcanally confronted your husband and i think gave him a message a warning of some kind then mcanally killed himself just to force the warning home he was dying anyway and hed been paid handsomely your husband got scared rightly so and rented that shredder so he could destroy everything hed been working on all the evidence evidence of what she asked of something very big now mcanally slipped up he died too spectacularly and that got me curious i dont think ive discovered even half what your husband knew but thats not the point the point is these people suspect either that your husband was helping me maybe hed given me his notes or that he would talk to me eventually either way they decided he was beyond scaring they had to go a bit further what youre saying is that if youd left well alone tom might still be alive rebus bowed his head i accept what youre saying but i didnt kill your husband he paused id like to find out who did what can i do to help rebus glanced towards davidson you can start by telling us anything you think might help and you could go through your husbands papers there might be some clue there she thought for a moment will i be in danger too rebus laid a hand on hers not at all mrs gillespie look is there no one tom might have confided in she started to shake her head no wait there is someone then she got up and left the room davidson was staring grimly at rebus see rebus told him youre great with the hearts and flowers but weakness is there to be exploited davidson didnt say a word audrey gillespie carried a desk diary into the room this is last years she said sitting down next to rebus tom began all this cloakanddagger stuff back in may but it only really took off in october and november she flipped to the pages for those months each day had its fill of meetings and engagements see mrs gillespie said pointing to a page these meetings here two this week she flipped a couple of pages two the next two more pages then three more the meetings were just a series of times plus the same two letters ck cameron kennedy rebus said yes who davidson asked hed come over to the sofa to look at the diary the lord provost mrs gillespie explained they kept meeting for lunch i remember because tom had to have his suits dry cleaned he had to look his smartest for the lord provost he didnt tell you why they were meeting so often rebus had taken the diary from her and was flipping through it there were no meetings with ck until october after which they took place once a week at least tom hinted there might be a good job in it come reorganisation hes in the same political party as the lord provost this is interesting rebus said sitting back the better to peruse the diary davidson had some questions to ask the usual ones so rebus excused himself he found helena profitt seated at the kitchen table tugging at a lace handkerchief terrible thing she said yes said rebus sitting down opposite her he thought of charters subtlety and the way davidson had confronted the widow and still he couldnt find an easy way to ask what he wanted to ask miss profitt this may not be the time she looked at him but i was wondering if you knew that is if you had any suspicion that mrs gillespie and her husband you mean she said softly what was their marriage like yes her face turned stony thats despicable this is a murder inquiry miss profitt im sorry if ive disturbed your sensibilities but questions must be asked the sooner i ask them the sooner we may catch the killer she thought that over youre right i suppose but its still despicable was mrs gillespie having an affair helena profitt didnt say anything she rose from the table and buttoned her coat all right rebus said what about the lord provost did councillor gillespie tell you why they kept meeting tom told me he had to brief him what about he didnt say something to do with the industry committee i expect is that all inspector rebus nodded and helena profitt walked out of the kitchen he heard the front door open and close i handled that beautifully he thought he got back to the living room just as davidson was closing his notebook and thanking audrey gillespie for her time not at all the widow replied polite to the last rebus and davidson sat in the car outside talking things over they were pulling away when rebus saw another car cruising the street seeking a parking space it was a sporty toyota the colour of ashes stop for a second rebus said he adjusted the rearview mirror so he could watch the toyota manoeuvre into a space its door opened and rory mcallister got out looking anxious he locked the car tidied his hair and sidestepped puddles on his way to audrey gillespies front door rebus took davidson to arden street and up the two flights to his flat got something for you he said pointing to the binbags in the hall davidson stared in amazement the shredded documents rebus nodded i wont ask how you came by them mrs gillespie isnt going to kick up a fuss especially if they help us find the killer im thinking what a defence lawyer could do with them i can think up a story between now and then so what am i supposed to do with them youre heading a murder investigation davidson the identities of whoever planned gillespies murder are in there so take them back to torphichen place and get a team working on reassembling the pages i cant see my boss going for it were shorthanded as it is cant you take them to st leonards rebus shook his head know why i dont know who i can trust and the last thing i want is for these bags to be conveniently mislaid so you tell no one what all this paper is and you tell no one where you got it when youve put together the jigsaw ill bet youll have names and motives come on ill help you load your car generous to a fault said davidson picking up one of the bags they drove to the mortuary to talk with professor gates but he was eating lunch in the university staff club so they climbed up from the cowgate to chambers street rebus had been in the staff club before and knew that if you looked like you belonged you could breeze in but the porter came out to stop them so maybe they didnt look the academic type rebus showed his id and that made everything all right again gates was dining alone a newspaper folded on the table beside his plate a halfbottle of wine and a bottle of water stood in front of him what brings you here he said as they sat down youre not eating no thanks davidson said a drink maybe rebus prompted i can recommend the water gates said protecting his wine they decided on beer which the waitress would bring from the bar what can i do for you the pathologist asked dissecting a last floury potato just wondered if youd anything for us on last nights stabbing give me a chance will you have you located the murder weapon no davidson admitted we didnt find any footprints either the ground in the cemetery was frozen well it was a longbladed knife serrated by the look of the skin around the wound and thats about as much as i can say for now the victim had tried to protect himself there were defence nicks on the hands plus hed been eating something greasy there was grease on his fingers rebus looked at davidson did you find any wrappings near the body nothing fresh whats your point gillespie ate a big meal at eight chicken casserole two helpings do you think he ate it with his fingers probably not so how come less than three hours later he decides to visit a chip shop rebus turned to the pathologist when you look at stomach contents im willing to bet you wont find anything but chicken casserole i did think the pathologist said that it was odd i mean most people would wipe their fingers afterwards but this grease or lard it was quite solid which told rebus everything he needed to know it was still lunchtime when rebus walked into the chip shop on easter road and two men in jackets and ties queued behind a teenager in a thin parka with the stuffing bursting from its seams rebus waited at the back of the queue and smiled and waved towards the server who didnt return the greeting finally it was rebuss turn hello gerry gerry dip wiped the work surface where some sauce had spilt remember me what do you want rebus leaned over the counter i want to know where you were last night between the hours of nine pm and eleven and it better be the alibi to end them all what for gerry dip said rebus just smiled come on lets go for a ride i cant im here on my own then switch everything off and well lock the door after us maybe put up a sign saying other fish to fry gerry dip bent down as if reaching for a switch and then flicked something across the counter at rebus it was a battered fish straight out of the fat rebus ducked and it flew over his head fat spattering him gerry dip was on the move shouldering open the door to the kitchen rebus ran around the counter and followed in the kitchen dip had hauled a sack of potatoes on to its side and was already halfway out the back door rebus stumbled over the potatoes dived and just missed dips ankles he clambered to his feet and ran outside finding himself in an alley to his left was a dead end to his right gerry dip running for it the white apron flapping around his knees stop him rebus yelled davidson didnt need telling twice he was waiting at the mouth of the alley hands in pockets like a casual onlooker but as dip ran past he flung out an arm and caught him in the throat dip flew back like he was attached by elastic to the ground his hands went to his throat and he started gagging you could have crushed his windpipe rebus said but not in a nasty sort of way at four pm with gerry dip still maintaining his vow of silence in the interview room rebus went for a drive gerry was an old hand he knew how to play the game called helping police with their inquiries hed keep quiet with or without a solicitor all hed said so far was that this was harassment and that he wanted to talk to someone from sweep it would take more than rebuss gut feeling to convict him of murder there must needs be evidence rebus had explained to davidson the complex series of connections which had brought gerry dip to mind now it was up to davidson to convince his superiors that there was due cause for the granting of a search warrant for gerry dips digs and the chip shop itself the chip shops owner had already explained that gerry hadnt had a shift the previous night rebus saw it all clearly a meeting arranged gillespie turning up gerry dip surprising him gillespie trying to defend himself from the attack grabbing at dips greasy shirt or jacket one thing nagged gerry dip alone couldnt have lured gillespie into the trap there must have been someone else someone he trusted someone he wanted to meet the right honourable cameron mcleod kennedy jp had a detached bungalow in what would have tried calling itself corstorphine had south gyle not taken off the houses were descendants of the boxy bungalows on queensferry road there werent many cars parked roadside most of the bungalows boasted a garage or at the very least a carport rebus parked outside the lord provosts home the door was open before he had reached the garden gate the lord provost stood in the doorway his wife a little behind him you were so mysterious on the phone kennedy said shaking rebuss hand is there any news the lord will do as he sees fit his wife burst out the voice booming from her heavy frame the lord provost ushered her back indoors and led rebus to the front sitting room ive seen her rebus said where is she mrs kennedy snapped rebus studied her she had wide unblinking eyes and small pudgy hands which shed rolled into fists her hair had been coaxed into an untidy bun and her cheeks blazed rebus guessed at west highland stock it wasnt a wild stab in the dark to say shed had a religious upbringing for zeal some of the wee frees could beat any muslim fundamentalists shes safe mrs kennedy i know that ive prayed for her of course shes safe ive been praying for her soul beth please ive prayed harder than ive ever prayed in my life rebus looked around the room the furniture had been positioned with exact precision on the carpet and the ornaments looked like the distances between them had been calibrated by a professional net curtains covered the two small windows there were photos of young children but none of anyone aged twelve or over hard to imagine a teenager passing her evenings here inspector cameron kennedy said i havent asked you if youd like something to drink rebus guessed that alcohol would not be on the list no thanks weve ginger cordial left from new year mrs kennedy barked thanks but no the thing is sir im not here primarily about your daughter id like to talk to you about tom gillespie terrible business the lord provost said may the good lord take his soul unto him in heaven his wife added i wonder rebus said pointedly if we might have a word in private kennedy looked to his wife who didnt look like moving finally with a sniff she turned and left rebus heard a radio come on through the wall a terrible business the lord provost repeated sitting down and gesturing for rebus to do the same but it didnt come altogether as a surprise did it the lord provost looked up of course it did you knew the councillor was playing with fire did i thered already been that one attempt to scare him off rebus smiled i know what gillespie was on to and i know he approached you with the information and made frequent progress reports thereafter thats not true your little lunchtime meetings weve records of them he knew youd be interested for one thing youre the lord provost for another his findings related directly to gyle park west which is in your ward i dont know what gillespies idea was if i were being charitable id say he was working in the public interest and would eventually have gone public with his findings but really i think he was trying to pressure you into helping further his career it could be that his findings would never have come to light but somebody couldnt be sure of that somebody tried scaring him then decided to murder him instead the lord provost sprang to his feet you surely dont think i killed him im pretty sure i could convince my colleagues that youre a prime suspect youd have to explain the secret meetings and everything else the lord provosts eyes narrowed his eyebrows meeting in the middle what is it you want i want you to tell me all about it you say you already know but ive yet to hear anyone say the words the lord provost considered then shook his head does that mean rebus said that your ward is more important than your own reputation i cant say anything because panotechs involved kennedys face contracted as if hed been punched its got nothing to do with panotech that company is one of the largest employers in lothian we need it inspector if it has nothing to do with panotech does it still have to do with robbie mathieson i cant say anything whos dalgety why does he scare you so much kirstie told me she heard you talking about him with someone and when you saw shed written his name on the labarum plan you suddenly didnt want her found ive told you im saying nothing in that case rebus said i wont trouble you any further he stood up im sure youve got plenty to keep you busy such as writing your speech of resignation he walked to the door inspector rebus turned about kirstie as she all right rebus walked back into the room would you like to see her the lord provost seemed in two minds weakness was there to be exploited i could bring her here but it would have to be a trade you dont trade with an innocent life not so innocent sir i could think up half a dozen charges against your daughter and between you and me id be failing in my duty if i didnt apprehend her and put her in a cell the lord provost turned away and walked to the window you know inspector im no virgin believe me you want dirty tricks underhand tactics theres a lot you can learn from politics even at district level especially at district level kennedy paused you say you can bring her here i think so then do it and well have a little chat you and me youll tell me what i want to know the lord provost turned to face him ill tell you he said his face ashen they shook hands on it and the lord provost saw him to the door somewhere behind them in the bungalow mrs kennedy was singing a hymn so all rebus had to do now was persuade kirstie kennedy that east or west home was still the best rebus went to her flat first but there was no one home he tried a couple of the dropin centres including the one behind waverley no joy then started on the burger bars on princes street before driving back to leith and visiting three pubs where pushers and users were known to meet nothing he took a breather in a bar where he was less likely to get himself stabbed then went to have a word with the few chilled prostitutes plying their trade near the inner harbour one of them thought she recognised the description but she could have been lying it was warmer in his car than outside then rebus remembered something kirstie had said about how pauls mum liked her so he drove to pauls parents address duggan was embarrassed to see him but his mother a tiny kindly woman invited rebus in no night to be yacking on the doorstep it was a tidy little flat just off abbeyhill duggan gave rebus a warning look as he led him at his mothers insistence into the living room duggans dad was there smoking a pipe and reading the paper he stood up to shake rebuss hand he was small like his wife so here was the arch criminal paul duggan in his lair pauls not in any trouble i hope the father asked teeth grinning around the stem of his pipe not at all mr duggan im just looking for a friend of pauls well paul will help if he can wont you paul aye sure paul duggan mumbled its kirstie rebus said kirstie mr duggan said that names familiar maybe pauls brought her back here once or twice mr duggan well inspector he does sometimes bring a girlfriend back but not for hankypanky mind you he winked we keep an eye on him the two men shared a laugh paul duggan was shrinking almost visibly bowed over on the sofa hands between his legs the years were peeling off him like paper from a damp wall i havent seen her he told rebus since when since the time we took her home any idea where she could be mr duggan removed the pipe from his mouth im sure paul would tell you if he could inspector have you tried the flat paul asked rebus nodded shes not in your bedroom is she paul duggan twitched and his father sat forward in the chair now inspector he said trying for another grin trying too hard wheres your wife mr duggan rebus got up and walked into the hall mrs duggan was about to sneak kirstie kennedy out the front door bring her through here instead mrs duggan rebus said so they all sat in the living room and the duggans explained everything see we know who kirstie is mrs duggan said and shes told us why she ran away and i cant say i blame her the lord provosts daughter sat next to her on the sofa staring into the fire and mrs duggan ran her hand through kirsties hair kirsties got a problem with drugs she accepts that and so do we we thought if she was going to fight it she better move in here for a wee while get right away from all the from the people who live that sort of life is that right kirstie are you kicking it she nodded suppressing a shiver mrs duggan put an arm around her sweats and shivers she said mr leitch told us to expect them she turned to rebus he works at the waverley dropin rebus nodded he told us all about cold turkey she turned her attention back to the girl cold turkey kirstie like on boxing day eh kirstie snuggled deeper into mrs duggans side like she was a child again and mrs duggan her mother yes thought rebus the mother shes been denied and here was a willing substitute see mr duggan said were afraid youve come to take her away she doesnt want to go home she doesnt have to go home mr duggan the drugs apart shes done nothing wrong paul and kirstie looked at him and saw he wasnt going to mention the hoax kidnap but the thing is rebus said his eyes holding kirsties i need a favour ive seen your stepmother and i dont blame you for not wanting to see her but what about your father would it hurt you to talk to him for five minutes just to let him see youre all right there was a long silence mrs duggan whispered something in kirsties ear i dont suppose so kirstie said at last just now tonight rebus shook his head tomorrow will be fine i might be worse tomorrow ill take that chance just one other thing last time we met you were telling me why you took that document from your dads office she nodded i heard him talking on the telephone he was talking about covering something up some scandal i heard him mention labarum hed always told me i had to follow his example but he turned out to be just like all the others a liar a cheat a coward she was bursting into tears he let me down again so i grabbed that whatever it was i saw it was about labarum she took a deep breath maybe i just wanted him to know i knew its all rotten all of it mrs duggan was still trying to quiet her as rebus left the flat back home rebus got the feeling the phone had just stopped ringing two minutes later with the stones softly on the hifi it rang again hed been sitting with the whisky bottle in his lap wondering if he could resist wondering why he bothered yes its davidson still at the station that i am gerrys still not talking have you offered him a deal not yet were holding him on a charge of assault naming you as the injured party ill never get the grease off that jacket what about the search warrant we got it im just waiting for burns to get back hold on here he comes davidson put his hand over the mouthpiece rebus unscrewed the bottle with his free hand but couldnt find a glass davidson came back on the line its a result two credit cards access and visa in the name of thomas gillespie hidden under the mattress so now will you go for a deal ill talk to his solicitor we dont just want dip remember we want whoever ordered the hit sure john there wasnt what rebus would call fervour in davidsons voice now the bad news listen im serious we want the paymaster and im serious about it being bad news rebus quietened ok what is it you told me to check if charters had had any visitors since you saw him sunday night well he had one the next morning and then again today shes a regular apparently yes her names samantha rebus now john it may be nothing at all i mean shes visited other prisoners too and we know she works for sweep it could just be that she but john rebus was already on his way i dont see what the big deal is sammy said what i dont see whats the big deal hed been so steamed up hed rung patiences doorbell twice before remembering the unpleasantness surrounding his last visit but sammy opened the door grab your coat he hissed tell patience its a friend and youre going out theyd gone to a hotel just around the corner from the flat the bar was almost deserted just the barmaid and one regular at the corner of the bar the hatch open so there was no barrier between them rebus and sammy took their drinks to the furthest corner the big deal is he said you smuggled something out of jail for him just a letter she calmly sipped her tequila and orange fathers and daughters rebus thought he pictured the lord provost and kirstie you knew they had to make choices and nobody in life made the right choices all the time daughters never grew up in their fathers eyes all they did was become women ive done it before sammy was saying you know the warders read all the mail before it goes out they censor it and leer over it and and i think its revolting she paused they can get very sniffy about gay love letters charters told you he was gay he hinted at it a very special friend he said rebus shook his head gerry dips special all right hes absolutely choice did you take the note to his flat the only address derwood had was the chip shop and did you read the note of course not a sealed envelope she nodded quite a fat envelope she thought about it yes she said thats because it was full of money what have i done her face was reddening her voice rising broken some lousy prison rule thats all i wish it were rebus said quietly she quietened what then he couldnt tell her he couldnt do that to her but it would all come out eventually wouldnt it sammy he said i think charters paid gerry dip to kill a man that envelope you delivered contained instructions and payment her face lost all its lovely colour what the way she said it turned rebuss gut liquid she tried picking up her drink but spilt it then retched into her cupped hands rebus got a handerkerchief out of his pocket and handed it over youre trying to scare me she said thats all you dont like my job and youre trying to scare me off sammy please she got to her feet spilling the rest of her drink over his trousers he followed her to the door watched by barmaid and customer and called after her but she was running down the steps on to the pavement and then along to the corner and around it back into oxford terrace sammy he watched her run watched her until shed disappeared shite a drunk walking past wished him a belated happy new year rebus told the man where he could stick it as arranged rebus drove to south gyle next morning he parked his car around the corner from the lord provosts house then went and rang the doorbell the lord provost himself opened the door and looked to left and right as if expecting her to be there well have to go for a little drive rebus informed him then a figure came storming along the passage behind cameron kennedy and brushed him aside where is she mrs kennedys voice trembled with emotion her nostrils flaring wheres the lost lamb she turned to her husband you said hed bring her the lord provost looked at rebus who said nothing i have to go with inspector rebus beth ill fetch my coat mrs kennedy said no beth the lord provost laid a hand on her arm best i go alone an argument started rebus turned and walked back towards the gate the lord provost came after him dont you want a coat rebus asked ill be fine his wife was calling to them from the door thy will be blyther in heiven owre ae sinner at repents nor owre ninetienine saunts at need nae repentance shes learned the new testament in scots the lord provost explained she knows it backwards it didnt sound like a boast kirstie was sitting in the back seat of rebuss car beside her was paul duggan shed had a bath and her hair had been washed and rearranged she was wearing clothes mrs duggan had bought for her styles parents thought teenagers liked youd take her for a normal sulky shoulderbechipped teenager nothing more if it wasnt for the vomiting fits and the muscle spasms the bolts of lightning through her bones kennedy gasped when he saw her i said id bring her rebus told him now get in the lord provosts face was like chiselled stone as they drove towards the forth bridges the same route rebus had taken that night with lauderdale he told himself hed chosen the meeting place because it was nearby open and private but he thought maybe he had a deeper motive they came off the a and went threequarters round the roundabout then headed towards the moat house hotel whose huge desolate car park overlooked the forth at this time of day this time of year the car park was deserted save for a ford capri which looked as if it had been abandoned after a joyride rebus stopped the car and turned off the ignition this is where we get out he told paul duggan duggan squeezed kirsties hand will you be all right he asked her ill be fine she said coolly watching her father in the rearview mirror just as he was watching her so rebus and duggan got out rebus walked across the tarmac and stood at the furthest edge you got a great view of both bridges and of the fife coast beyond you also took a beating from the wind which blew from all directions rebus rode with it swaying a little from the ankles with his head tucked into his overcoat he managed to light a cigarette at the sixth attempt the smell of butane caused momentary nausea paul duggan was a little way off resting one arm on a dull metal payview telescope rebus left him alone and just stared at the scenery the clouds crawled past looking as if theyd been hurt in too many bar room brawls beneath them fife was a slab of greygreen pavement paul duggan had finally arrived beside him thinking about willie and dixie he suggested rebus glanced at him but said nothing im not just a pretty face inspector i was thinking that they got me into this their suicide they got me thinking about things asking myself questions when mcanally killed himself i was interested enough to want to know why he smiled you dont know what im talking about duggan just shrugged im listening though there was silence between them for a while duggan scuffed his toes against the kerb see this trouble im in with the police and council and that you think i can help i dont know it was strange that kirstie should have run away from one smothering household only to end up in another but rebus thought he knew the reason why after the deaths of willie and dixie shed disintegrated to her they had represented real life a life well away from her father and his political conspiracies willie and dixie had been the other side of the coin a side shed come to like maybe even admire and shed killed them after which shed spiralled downwards until she realised she needed shelter and comfort or she too might die paul duggan had been there for her and so had his parents you know rebus said thinking aloud i think i know why she scrawled dalgety on that document if her father had paid the ransom maybe even if he hadnt she was planning to send the labarum plan back to him it was a warning a message that she knew something and that he should leave her alone if he didnt want her to reveal it to the world never mind kirstie for the moment what about me everybodys got to pay paul rebus said not looking at him thats the way it works aye right duggan said dismissively and if i was some rich bastard that had been to fettes id have to pay too is that right id be treated the same as an oxgangs dropout come on inspector kirsties told me the way it works the whole system he turned and shuffled away he had a point one rebus would happily concede only he had other things to think about right now the wind had finished his cigarette in doublequick time so he lit another duggan was over at the abandoned car peering in he tried a door opened it and got in shelter accomplished some people said the weather made the scots long drear periods punctuated by short bursts of enlightenment and cheer there was almost certainly something to the theory it was hard to believe this winter would end yet he knew that it would knew but almost didnt believe a matter of faith as the old priest would say or maybe the reverse of faith rebus hadnt been to church in a while and missed his conversations with father leary but he didnt miss the church or even the church leary would have no problem with suicide in either concept or practice it was a great sin full stop assisted suicide too was a sin every bit as heinous but when rebuss mother had been ill that last time shed begged his father for release and one day young john had walked in and had seen his father on the edge of her bed she was asleep her chest making awful liquid sounds and his father sat there with a pillow in his hands looking at that pillow then up at his son asking to be told what to do rebus knew if he hadnt walked in his father might have done it might have put her out of her misery instead of which she lingered for weeks he turned away from the forth and found his vision blurred he angled his head upwards swallowing back the tears and walked over to the abandoned car inside paul duggan was crying they were my friends too he bawled and her stupid plan killed them and yet i cant hate her for it cant even get angry with her rebus put a hand on duggans shoulder nobody killed them he said quietly they chose for themselves the two of them sat there for a while out of the wind in shelter that wasnt theirs afterwards rebus drove them back into town the teenagers in the back were both pinkeyed from crying the two men in the front were not he didnt feel proud of the fact he drove past the turnoff to kennedys estate and the lord provost still said nothing eventually rebus pulled the car on to the kerb outside duggans abbeyhill home where are we kennedy asked kirsties staying with some nice people rebus explained the lord provost turned to his daughter youre not coming home not yet she said as if each word was costing her something you said youd bring her back i didnt say shed stay rebus said kirsties got to decide if and when she was already getting out of the car as was duggan on the pavement she doubled over and dryheaved spitting up foamy saliva somethings wrong with her kennedy said he made to open his door but rebus pulled the car abruptly off the kerb and into traffic you know whats wrong with her he said now shes coming off and i think shell be all right you infer kennedy said coldly that she wouldnt be all right at home what do you think rebus said and he left it at that where are we going one good thing about edinburgh lord provost theres always a quiet spot nearby you and me are going to have a talk at least youll be talking ill be listening he directed them around the base of salisbury crags and up to a car park near the summit of arthurs seat there were a few cars already there parents and children out braving the gale they would probably call it blowing away the cobwebs but rebus and the lord provost stayed in the car and the lord provost did the talking that had been their bargain after all and afterwards with the silence between them like an extra seat rebus drove the lord provost home there was a man at the top of the hill he was mending a wall rebus followed the line of the drystane dyke climbing slowly he was between edinburgh and carlops in the foothills of the pentland range there was no escape from the wind and the cold up here but rebus was sweating as he neared the top the man saw him coming but didnt stop working he had three piles of stones close to him varying in sizes and shapes he would pick one up feel it study it then either put it back in the pile or else add it to the wall and with a fresh stone placed in the wall a new challenge presented itself and he had to study his mounds of stones all over again rebus stopped to catch his breath and watched the man it was the most painstaking work imaginable and at the end of it the wall would be held together by nothing more than the artful arrangement of its constituent parts it must be a dying craft rebus said having gained the summit why do you say that the man seemed amused rebus shrugged electric fences barbed wire not many farmers depend on drystane dykes he paused or drystane dykers come to that the man turned to look at him he was ruddycheeked with a thick red beard and fair hair turning grey at the temples he wore a baggy aran sweater and green combat jacket cord trousers and black boots he wasnt wearing gloves and kept blowing on his hands i need to keep them bare he explained i feel the stones better that way is your name dalgety aidan dalgety at your service mr dalgety im detective inspector rebus is that right you dont sound surprised in a job like this you dont get many visitors thats one of the things i like about it but since i started this wall its been like a main thoroughfare rather than a deserted hillside i know councillor gillespie visited you several times hes dead i know and thats why youre not surprised to see a detective dalgety smiled to himself and judged another stone turning it in his hand weighing it in his palm feeling for its centre of gravity he placed it on the wall then thought better of it and moved it to another spot the process took a couple of minutes rebus looked back the way hed come following the wall down to the byroad where hed parked his car tell me how many stones go into a wall like this tens of thousands dalgety said you could spend years counting them men took years building them its a far cry from computers do you think so maybe it is but then again maybe theres some connection i understand you were robbie mathiesons partner back in the early days of panotech it wasnt called panotech in my day the name belongs to robbie but the early designs the early work was yours maybe it was dalgety tossed a stone from one pile to another thats what i hear he ran the company but you designed the circuits your ideas made the company work dalgety didnt say anything and then he bought you out and then he bought me out dalgety echoed is that the way it happened it happened just the way i told it to the councillor i had a id been working too hard for too long i had a breakdown and when i came out of it the company wasnt mine any longer robbie had kissed me goodbye and all the designs were his too the whole company was his dalmat we were called dalgety and mathieson that was the first thing he changed dalgety was weighing another stone how did he find the money to buy you out i take it you were bought out oh yes it was all above board he had some money invested somewhere it paid a handsome profit and he used it to buy my share he paused thats what the lawyers told me afterwards i didnt remember any of it discussions signing the papers none of it you must have been bitter dalgety laughted i had another breakdown they put me in a private nursing home that took care of a lot of the payoff money when i came out i didnt want anything to do with the industry or any industry like it end of story panotechs grown since robbie mathieson is good at what he does do you know about him rebus shook his head his family moved to the states when robbie was eighteen he joined one of the big boys ibm or hewlett packard someone like that the company had operations in europe and robbie was posted here he liked scotland i was working on my own at the time designing stuff messing about with ideas most of them impractical we met got to like one another and he told me he was resigning and starting up his own computer business right here he persuaded me along with him we had a couple of good years dalgety seemed to have forgotten about the stone he was holding the wind was hurting rebuss ears but he didnt let it show im not telling you the whole truth aidan dalgety said at last i was an alcoholic or at least i was on the verge of becoming one i think thats why robbie wanted rid of me seemed to me afterwards that he must have been planning it for a while i signed away the rights to a couple of components which went on to make panotech a lot of money he took a deep breath but that was then and this is now this money mathieson used to buy you out where did it come from again there was a man called derwood charters he got to know robbie early on i think he wanted to become company secretary something like that he had a lot of moneymaking schemes or should i say scams robbie told me about a couple of them charters would set up paper companies and then screw grants from all over the place local authority sda european community he had a genius for that sort of thing i think he must have wangled development money for panotech somewhere down the line the company grew so fast so quickly and youve never said anything about any of this why should i good luck to them but mathieson practically robbed you and now he keeps a lot of people in employment im not such a high price to pay for an outcome like that rebus sat down on the cold earth his back against the wall and ran his hands over his head you know dalgety said i still take an interest in the industry i dont mean to but i do thirtyfive per cent of all the pcs manufactured in europe are manufactured here twentyfour per cent of all semiconductors two million computers a year come out of ibms greenock plant that includes their world supply of screens and every ibm computer sold in europe he was laughing fifty thousand people in the industry and its growing the japanese come here because productivitys so high can you believe that he stopped laughing abruptly but the root systems shallow inspector were big in hardware but we need software too and we need to start sourcing we source only fifteen per cent of all our components were an assembly line maybe panotech can change that he shrugged good luck to them so why did you talk to gillespie maybe to get it off my chest he examined the stone in his hand a final time then threw it far into the distance maybe because nothing i say can make any difference no investigation of panotech is going to get very far the councillor found that out aidan dalgety looked at him but said nothing youre not scared no dalgety used both hands to lift a larger rock on to the wall im not scared at all this wall will be here after im gone whether i live to be a hundred or drop dead tomorrow he patted the wall with his hands i know what lasts rebus got to his feet well thanks for talking to me no problem i get bored sometimes just talking to the wall he was laughing again as rebus headed downhill you know that old saying about walls having ears it was a day for open spaces in the late afternoon rebus walked in the botanic gardens with sir lain hunter i like this place sir lain said striding gamely with his rolled umbrella across the grass towards inverleith house of course its lost something since they moved the gallery of modern art what do you think i think youre stalling sir lain smiled ive conducted meetings here before inspector its my openair office i choose the botanies for some meetings precisely because they are so open no chance of being overheard he stopped looking around the city centre was a panorama before them marvellous view he said nobodys listening in on us if thats what youre worried about well the thought had crossed my mind nowhere is safe in this age of electronic eavesdropping i dont need to bug conversations rebus said ive got gillespies files poor councillor gillespie yes poor councillor gillespie lured to an alley and then stabbed in the guts by an excon hired by derwood charters just as charters paid mcanally to put a scare into gillespie i dont suppose he knew how far wee shug would go what hed do he went too far and brought you scurrying to the scene inspector yes perhaps that was a mistake well im going to trust you im going to assume youre not recording this little teteatete sir lain tucked his cashmere scarf a little tighter around his neck now why did you want to meet because youre at the centre of it all can you prove that like i say ive got yes yes youve got gillespies files but what do they prove you should know the lord provost told you everything gillespie told him they prove that charters various companies existed only as shells for the most part the front company was legit but the others well if anyone decided to check charters would rent shortterm office space pay someone to take in mail addressed to mensung house that sort of thing and im assuming he had someone at the scottish office tipping him off about any forthcoming investigations he couldnt have run his scams so well for so long without help how am i doing so far sir lain was admiring the view wild inaccuracies compounded by conjecture charters had sleeping partners see once the fake companies were running he could apply for grants and other incentives but to get the companies going in the first place required cash working capital and thats where the sleeping partners came in he could guarantee a huge return on investment provided the grant money came through he was a wizard at playing the system running rings around it he made quick money for a lot of people including robbie mathieson im sure mathieson wouldnt want anyone to know that the early money for panotech came from ripping off sda and european community schemes then theres haldayne at the us consulate hed met charters socially and was keen to make money as an aside id guess that once he was involved you were able to pressure haldayne into helping persuade american companies to move here same goes for robbie mathieson he had us connections in the computer industry thats slanderous sir lain remarked his smile unimpeachable well haldaynes been to your royal circus piedaterre plenty of times weve got the parking tickets you must have had something to talk about charters couldnt have got away with it not to the same extent without a network of friends and people he bribed civil servants predominantly ive been asking around sir lain eight years ago you werent nearly so high up the pecking order but then you started a string of successes bringing new business into scotland and you started your ascent and ruthie estate must have cost a bit i wonder did you buy that in the past eight years the whole thing worked brilliantly for a long time companies came and went and sometimes their registration documents disappeared with them then the sda became scottish enterprise accounting procedures changed and nobody was going to be looking back at old projects financed by a dead organisation but charters couldnt stop and one time he got sloppy and was caught early on he pled guilty protecting his friends and making sure nothing would come out at a trial and then gillespie caught a glimpse of something and it got him wondering he started digging and word got back to charters rebus paused you told me once that you liked a bit of intrigue how am i doing sir lain just shrugged looking bemused well said rebus im just getting to the best bit now who passed the word back to charters because whoever did is partly to blame for gillespies eventual murder gillespie had told his story to the lord provost only natural that hed tell somebody but he never guessed the lord provost would go straight to mathieson and tell him but what else was he going to do mathieson is the biggest employer in his ward the lord provost thought hed warn him what was coming you think mathieson told charters possibly it could have been any of you us youre in it up to your cashmere scarf careful what you say inspector be very careful why so i dont get a knife in the guts hunters cheeks coloured that was he swallowed back the rest charters doing rebus guessed well someone had to tell charters in the first place and they did so knowing hed do something about it something they were scared to do themselves sir iains eyes were watering but it was from the breeze not contrition what are you going to do inspector im going to nail as many of you as i can finally hunter turned to him do you recall what i said to you that day on my estate jobs are at risk lives are at risk he sounded grotesquely sincere its all just policy to you isnt it rebus said no right and wrong legal and illegal no fair and corrupt just politics listen to yourself man sir lain hunter spat who are you some old testament prophet what gives you the right to hold the scales he dug the tip of his umbrella into the ground and waited for his breathing to ease if youd look into your heart youd see were not on opposite sides but we are rebus said determinedly if this ever became public thered be more than a scandal thered be a crisis trust would be lost overseas investors and corporations would turn away from scotland dont tell me you want that rebus thought of aidan dalgety busying himself with an endless wall his only answer to frustration and anger none of its worth a single human life he said quietly i think it is hunter said i really do think it is rebus turned to walk away inspector id like you to talk with some people it was the invitation rebus had been waiting for when tonight if at all possible ill phone you with the details ill be at st leonards till six rebus said leaving the old man to his view but rebus couldnt face the police station so went home instead and found slowly but with growing confidence that his flat had been broken into in his absence it was a clean meticulous job there were no signs of forced entry nothing had been taken almost nothing looked out of place but his books had been moved he had them in what looked like unplanned towers but were actually the order in which hed bought them and intended to read them one of the towers had been knocked over and put back up again out of order his drawers had been closed too though he always left them open and his record collection had been rifled as if he could hide sacks of shredded paper inside album sleeves he sat down with a glass of whisky and tried not to think any thoughts if he thought he might not act he might drop out like dalgety and let them get on with it he loathed sir lain hunter for the way he used people but then paul duggan used people too if it came down to it kirstie too had used and abused her friends everybody used someone the difference was sir iain and his kind had everything heart soul silver and gold only nobody knew it never even gave it a thought what was more probably nobody cared his phone rang at seven i did try st leonards sir iain said they told me youd not been back this afternoon dont worry your friends had left before i got back i beg your pardon nothing forget it but hear this gillespies files are in a safe place and i mean safe youre not making much sense inspector is that for the benefit of anyone listening in i only called to remind you of our meeting nine tonight would that suit let me just check my social calendar you know gyle park west i know it the panotech factory youll be expected at nine panotech had won awards for the design of its gyle park west factory with its automated shopfloor delivery system a series of robot forklifts on a network of rails and its bulbous shape with optimised interior light the reception area was chrome and grey metal with a black rubberised floor there was a security guard on the desk but rebus was expected as he walked through the automatic doors an automatic voice telling him he was entering a positively no smoking zone he saw sir iain hunter standing by a display case there was a sheet over the case but sir iain had lifted it the better to inspect the model beneath the new labarum building he explained theyll start construction in the spring he turned to rebus new jobs inspector and another feather in your cap whatll it be this time lord hunter of ruthie sir iains smile evaporated theyre waiting for us in the boardroom they took a bright elevator to the third and top floor and emerged into a compact hallway with three doors off sir lain pressed four numbers on a wall console and pushed open one of the doors inside three men were waiting standing by the window a light airplane was taking off from turnhouse so close you could almost see the exhausted executives inside rebus looked at haldayne first then at j joseph simpson and finally at robbie mathieson the gangs all here he commented thats a cheap shot mathieson came forward to take rebuss hand he was wearing an expensive suit but showed hed put aside the days cares by having shed his tie and undone the top button of his shirt good of you to come he told rebus with what some people would have taken for sincerity good of you to ask me rebus said playing the game mathieson waved a hand around the room it had cream walls some blownup photos of computer chips and a dozen framed awards for export industry and achievement there was a large oval table placed centrally black like the floor i have this place swept for bugs once a week inspector industrial espionage is a constant threat unfortunately this meeting was arranged at short notice so so i dont have any of the relevant devices to hand how can i be sure youre not bugged what do you want me to do mathieson tried to look embarrassed it was just an act id like you to remove your clothes nobody said it was going to be that sort of party mathieson smiled but angled his head expecting compliance anyone want to join me rebus said removing his jacket sir iain hunter laughed rebus studied the four men as he stripped simpson looked the most ill at ease probably because he was the least of the group haldayne had seated himself at the table and was toying with a fat chrome pen as if already bored with proceedings mathieson stood by the window averting his eyes from the disrobing but sir iain stood fast and watched rebus got down to underpants and socks thank you mathieson said please get dressed again and i apologise for putting you through that he was using his business voice deep and confident the american burr touched with scots inflexions lets all sit down simpson hadnt even reached his chair before he started blurting out that he didnt know what he was doing here it was all such a long time ago youre here joe mathieson reminded him firmly because you broke the law of the land we all did then he turned to rebus inspector a long time ago almost in another age we all profited from enterprises set up and run by derwood charters now the question in court would be did we know at the time that those profits were being made by fraudulent means he shrugged thats a question for the lawyers and you know how lawyers can be especially with questions of corporate law they might take years and several million pounds to come to their conclusions a lot of time a lot of money he opened his palms wide a showman with his spiel and for what the fact of the matter is some of those profits illicitly gained went to build this very factory bringing jobs to hundreds with spinoff benefits creating and sustaining hundreds maybe thousands more including as you told me yourself a friend of yours now in law none of this would count for anything quite rightly so the law is a stern mistress thats what they say a little smile but the law i would argue isnt everything there are considerations of a moral ethical and economic order he raised a finger to stress the point then touched it to his lips moral law inspector is something else again if bad money is used to good purpose can it really be called bad money if a child stole some apples then went on to be a lifesaving surgeon would any court convict him of the original theft mathieson had prepared his lines well rebus tried not to listen but his ears were working too well mathieson seemed to sense a change in him and got up to walk around the table now inspector if you want to drag up ancient history you must do so but the consequences will rest on your conscience they sure as hell wont be on mine rebus wondered if it was possible that mathieson had compiled a dossier on him had people watch him talk to acquaintances no those methods would not have told the essential truths they wouldnt have revealed the man to whom mathieson was appealing so subtly and cleverly it had to be more than that it had to be instinct a murder has been committed rebus said mathieson had been expecting this argument not with the knowledge of anyone in this room he said youre saying it was charters alone mathieson nodded stroking his beard rebus wondered if hed grown it in memory of aidan dalgety derwood has most to lose he was explaining hes been in prison all these years and if you make public what you know hell stay there but gillespie was set up by someone he knew he wouldnt have been in that alley otherwise why not because he was scared then who was it mathieson asked i would guess sir iain rebus said four pairs of eyes fixed the permanent secretary maybe charters himself will tell us as you say hes got most to lose he might be all too willing to bargain down any extension to his sentence this is preposterous hunter said thumping the floor with his cane is it rebus said you like guns sir lain youve got a whole room full of shotguns what if i checked them against the records would they all be there or would one be missing the one you passed on to shug mcanally rebus turned to mathieson i want him i want him tonight the rest of you maybe later hold on haldayne interrupted what evidence do you have weve told you we dont know any save your defence mr haldayne i know sir iains been controlling you all these years mathieson was shaking his head slowly it would be very unfortunate indeed if any of this leaked out if you arrest sir iain youll precipitate a media circus as well as political questions why cant you just charge charters because then youd all be getting away with it mathieson looked frustrated inspector understand one thing i dont care about sir lain i dont care about anyone here tonight including myself if it comes down to it his voice was rising the way it must have at other boardroom meetings propelling him towards victory what i care about more deeply than you would ever understand or believe is panotech now the voice fell away labarum will be a major expansion inspector a new factory new r and d unit meaning more suppliers contractors a huge injection of hard cash and confidence into the local economy but more than that labarum will be europes microsoft scotland will be producing its own software to install in the computers it manufactures no wonder everyone wants you kept sweet and youre going to put all that in jeopardy over something that happened eight years ago and hurt no one at the time no one but the taxpayer who wouldnt have known anyway how his or her money was being spent a few million was a drop in the ocean hardly even a ripple do you have any idea the scale of fraud being perpetrated in mainland europe a nonexistent training scheme for airline pilots in naples netted seventeen million pounds farm products and animals are shipped to and fro across borders netting a subsidy every time the ec has paid a billion pounds to have vineyards destroyed yet there are more vines every year the greeks lop a branch off a vine and stick it in the ground so theyll be paid for two i repeat a few million hurt no one it hurt aidan dalgety aidan hurt himself you didnt know him then he was becoming so erratic he could have dragged the company down with him its hurt other people since rebus thought of kirstie finding out her father was no icon he thought of her plan a plan they all thought they could get away with because her father wasnt going to get his daughter back theyd been bartering for the labarum document and for kirsties knowledge of the whole affair and willie and dixie had died i accept mathieson was saying that a man died derwoods gone crazy thats what it comes down to theres one other consideration said sir iain whod had time to recover as mr haldayne will acknowledge two more us companies have seen the benefits of locating their european operations in lothian if my name or mr haldaynes were to be bandied about hunter gave a modest shrug well rebus said this is turning into a harder sell than a costa del sol timeshare he turned to simpson what about you joe simpson nearly slid from his chair what about me do you have any properties to bargain with in this little game of moral monopoly or have you just picked up the gotojail card i cant go to jail all i did was provide an accommodation address its not illegal then why are you here rebus looked to mathieson whose lips twitched an offering he said hear that joe simpson had heard he rose trembling to his feet you could always testify against them rebus told him with what haldayne said mr haldayne has a point inspector mathieson was sitting down again in his big chief executive chair at the end of the table tables without corners were supposed to make everyone equal but mathiesons chair was a leather throne he looked and sounded completely unruffled by events thus far while rebus felt as if his head would explode hundreds of jobs spinoffs happy smiling faces people like salty dougary pride restored given another chance did rebus have the gall to think he could pronounce sentence on the future of people like that people who wouldnt care who got away with what so long as they had a paycheque at the end of the month gillespie had died but rebus knew these men hadnt killed him not directly at the same time he hated them hated their confidence and their indifference hated their certainty that what they did was for the good they knew the way the world worked they knew who or rather what was in charge it wasnt the police or the politicians it wasnt anyone stupid enough to place themselves in the front line it was secret quiet men who got on with their work the world over bribing where necessary breaking the rules but quietly in the name of progress in the name of the system shug mcanally was dead but no one was grieving tresa was spending his money and having a good time with maisie finch audrey gillespie too might start enjoying life for the first time in years maybe with her lover a man had died cruelly and in terror but he was all there was on rebuss side of the balance sheet and on the other was everything else well inspector mathieson could see something in rebuss eyes a red light that had changed to amber he rose from the throne lets have a drink rebus hadnt noticed that the far wall was a series of recessed cupboards their doors flush and handleless mathieson pushed the edge of one door and it opened automatically i hope malt whiskys all right for everyone mathieson said as lightly as if theyd just finished a few rubbers of bridge you dont have a drop of gin joe simpson squawked youre right joe i dont then ill take whisky yes joe you will inspector haldayne said in reasoned tones were in your hands its your decision now let the man have a drink first mathieson chided sir lain was staring levelly at rebus his mouth a moral pout there was a line from a song stuck in rebuss head just when he least needed it you cant always get what you want but if you try some time youll find you get what you need i need a drink he thought and robbie mathieson caring smiling brought him one youre all right anyway rebus told haldayne youll have diplomatic immunity the getoutofjailfree card haldayne snorted his porcine laugh im also the only one here who lost five grand to derwood charters over albavise and you should have stayed out of it sir iain snarled hey haldayne said light glinting from his glasses it worked in the past didnt it you know inspector mathieson said rising above all this any other policeman any other public official i might have been tempted to try offering a financial incentive they all shut up to listen rebus sipped from his crystal tumbler but with you mathieson went on i think that might have the opposite effect from the one intended and how much cash would i be worth to you mr mathieson to me nothing but if it were a question of saving panotech well it wouldnt be a matter of actual cash of course cash is messy and you wouldnt want any problems with the inland revenue perish the thought but a new house with its own grounds a trust fund for a daughter shares in a company which is going to do extraordinarily well in the next few years and then there are less tangible rewards but no less valuable for that friends in the right places help when needed a word in the right ear come promotion time mathiesons voice died away as he handed out the final drink a very mean whisky for joe simpson and took one for himself he stood behind his throne a plane droning in the night sky behind him a little bit of bribery eh rebus commented sir iain hunter sat forward he looked like he was losing patience fast he tapped his stick on the floor as he spoke is it wrong he said to bribe rich foreign companies to come to a depressed region id say inspector that morally speaking anyone who did that would be in the right blackmails blackmail rebus said i disagree and tell me is nobody lining their own pockets sir lain savoured his whisky there must needs be incentives he said drily rebus laughed he felt a little looser after the drink exactly and all this love of country and duty to the workers stuff is just so much shite tell me why did you bring the dcc and me together that day sir lain twisted in his chair i saw how dangerous charters had become i wanted him stopped but my position would not allow me to i felt it best to point you in the right direction rather than leading you there rebus laughed again you old fraud we were there to put the wind up mathieson to stop him even thinking about talking he turned to mathieson you were sweating like a pig in the killing pen then back to sir lain you used us the same way charters used mcanally and youve blackmailed haldayne into helping bring firms here what is it is corruption part of the job description hunter said nothing he was too angry to speak answer me this charters had a client called quinlon a building contractor whod made money illicitly through a deal with someone in the sda charters shopped quinlon to the authorities so theyd think more seriously about closing down the sda now you all knew charters back then didnt you you all knew that if the sda disappeared all accounts would be closed and the various frauds would remain undiscovered so did you know about quinlon he looked at sir iain did charters maybe come to you with the story and leave you to see that the right people heard about it this is sheer paranoia sir iain said i refuse to discuss it ok lets try this charters made a couple of million through his paper companies enough to make a stint in jail worth while thats why he pled guilty and when he gets out the moneys waiting for him you all know that and youre not going to do a thing about it you know hes a murderer too but youve kept quiet about that as well inspector haldayne said were not leeches i know that leeches are medicinal you know something he was talking to all of them now tom gillespie said something to me he told me i was making a mistake at the time i took it as a threat but it wasnt it was the literal truth i thought because he had something to hide it must be something illicit i was wrong about him all down the line all he was was scared he was terrified those last days of his life all he felt was fear and dear god rebus knew what that felt like nobodys mourning him sir iain snapped rebus turned to him now how do you know that what hes got a widow you dont think shes in mourning sir lain studied the handle of his cane i forgot he said no you didnt rebus said quietly so whats it to be inspector mathieson himself was beginning to look impatient he knew he had won the argument but might still lose the fight he had his glass half raised ready for a toast if rebus gave the right answer the answer everybody wanted just remember if you want it theres a place for you rebus was still staring at sir iain hunter he finished his whisky in one go and put the glass down with his hands on the table he pushed himself upright out of the chair heres my answer mr mathieson he said he walked out without saying another word because he hadnt decided his pride wouldnt let him kowtow to people like hunter and mathieson they were men not gods and he hated people putting one over on him which was exactly what would be happening if he gave in but but he kept seeing those hundreds of faceless workers driving to work in their new cars or signing on in a sweltering dole office one mans life against thousands it wasnt fair it shouldnt be down to him to decide well what was stopping him taking it elsewhere he drove into town along corstorphine road past the office suite used by mensung and decided to drop into torphichen place davidson probably wouldnt be there at this hour but he could find out what was happening with gillespies files the duty desk officer let him through the door rebus walked along the silent hall and up the stairs the only person in the cid room was rab burns hiya john what brings you here the urbane conversation the ersatz coffee bags of rubbish to be precise eh so rebus explained and burns shook his head i dont know anything about them maybe they were locked away at close of play theyd be in the cupboard hold on ill fetch the key but there was nothing in the cupboard you dont suppose they could have been thrown out by mistake a shiver went across rebuss shoulders mind if i use your phone he punched in davidsons number and waited until the detective answered its me where are the files john i was going to call you where are the files orders john what they were requisitioned i was going to tell you in the morning who was it davidson was a long time answering the dccs office rebus slammed down the receiver allan bloody gunner any idea of the dccs home number rab oh aye were close friends like rebuss look shut him up they found the number on the emergency roster rebus rang and waited and waited a woman picked up the receiver there was laughter in the background a party maybe a dinner party mr gunner please who shall i say walt disney pardon rebus was shaking with anger just get him a full minute later gunner lifted the receiver who is this its rebus what the fuck are you playing at how dare you speak to me like that the words were hissed gunner not wanting his guests in the other room to hear all right then with respect sir what the fuck are you playing at what do you mean the gillespie files where are they in the incinerator and gunner cut the connection rebus tried again but the line was busy the receiver had been left off the hook rebus grabbed the emergency roster from burns and looked down it for gunners address you can borrow my computer if you like burns said what for to write your letter of resignation rab rebus said to him you stole that line from me rebus gave the bell a good long ring gunner didnt look surprised as he unlocked the door come into the study he said angrily as rebus followed him he heard the sounds of the dinner party instead of following gunner into the study he walked to a closed door and opened it evening he said sorry to drag the host away well only be a minute then he smiled at the guests closed the door again and went into the study around the table had been seated the lord provost and his wife the chief constable and his wife and gunners wife there were two other place settings one for gunner himself sir lain couldnt make it then rebus guessed gunner closed the study door hell be joining us for coffee cosy look rebus i had a little think on the way here and something occurred to me here it is mcanally wasnt in charters cell to get to the bottom of anything he was there so you could be sure charters was keeping his mouth shut and you got proof of that because charters paid mcanally to scare off the councillor it was a coverup from the beginning whether flower knew thats how you were playing it or not you wanted the whole thing kept hidden and now that youve burnt those papers thats the way itll stay thats up to you rebus shook his head no im worthless its up to people like you and youre not going to do a damned thing youre going to remain hunters puppet all the way to chief constable the doorbell rang again and gunner walked out returning with sir iain hunter well inspector hunter said removing his topcoat you do seem to pop up everywhere he slipped a hand into his pocket and pulled out a cassette its all there he said handing it to gunner rebus felt the floor move beneath him you were bugged he said hunter smiled thank god he didnt make us all strip rebus nodded i begin to get it sir iain gunner said has been gathering evidence of an embarrassing scandal a scandal rebus added that will conveniently lack one important name i shouldve known the scottish office was involved from the start i cant see a prison governor especially one like big jim flett covering up mcanallys record on the sayso of the police alone but the dcc backed up by the permanent secretary well that would be a different story after all the scottish office pulls the pursestrings his eyes fixed on hunter and a lot of other strings besides inspector rebus hunter said coolly it is a fact of life that you simply cant have the permanent secretary mixed up in anything unsavoury for the good of the country he must be protected even if hes in it up to his eyeballs even then this stinks rebus said whats the tape an insurance policy im preparing a file gunner said unofficially and to be kept under lock and key and if anything should happen to leak out in future the file will show said hunter that charters and others acted unlawfully to the extent of murder hunter nodded what about mathieson will he be implicated rebus smiled sorry daft question of course he will youd sell everything to the court to save your own neck you hypocrite hunter suggested hypocrisy is acceptable if it is for the public good you know gunner added i could have you booted off the force id fight you all the way gunner smiled i know you would hunter touched gunners arm weve kept your guests waiting long enough allan gunners eyes were still on rebus under normal circumstances youd be welcome to join us i wouldnt join you if you were coming apart at the seams the stories i hear gunner said its you thats been coming apart at the seams bear something in mind inspector hunter said examining his cane you were at that meeting too youre on the tape listening to men confess their part in illegal acts i didnt hear you caution them i didnt hear you do anything much if questions should ever be asked theyll be asked of you along with everyone else ill see you to the door the chief constableinwaiting told rebus john rebus did what he had to do went on a fortyeighthour bender it wasnt difficult in edinburgh even in winter without the benefit of extended summer opening hours if you paced things right you could drink round the clock it was all down to permutations of latelicence restaurants casinos and earlyopening bars you could always drink at home of course but that wasnt what a bender was about you could hardly do your bender justice when the only person around to listen to your stories was your own sour self rebus didnt worry about missing work hed been on benders before after losing cases hed tried desperately to win always he did it with the blessing of his superiors who might even chip in towards expenses he thought maybe hed phoned the farmer from some pub along the way and maybe the farmer had said something about allan gunner having okayed things hard to tell though hard to remember still harder to forget hed grab an hours sleep then be awake a couple of minutes at most before the knot was in his guts reminding him of things hed far rather forget towards the close of the first day he was in a bar on lothian road and noticed maisie and tresa there having a good time to themselves they were at a table and rebus was at the bar pairs of men kept accosting them to no avail then maisie saw rebus and got up weaving towards him i see the period of mournings over rebus said she smiled ach wee shug was all right why dont you tell me about it her eyes were only half open heavylidded see she began it wasnt him i wanted it was tresa she lit a cigarette for herself using the onyx and gold lighter he came to see me the day he topped himself told me what he was going to do he gave me this lighter maybe he was looking for sympathy or someone to talk him out of it daft bastard he was doing just what i wanted i wanted tresa i love her really i do rebus remembered something shed told him before about wee shug he deserved what he got he realised now that she hadnt meant it vindictively shed meant he deserved whatever he was paid shed stuck him in prison and hed still come back to her telling his story was it rape rebus asked she shrugged not really he sucked on his cigarette did you scream now she laughed the neighbours thought i did they wanted to have heard it otherwise thered be no guilt we scots need a bit of guilt dont we it gets us through the day then she planted a kiss on his cheek and stood back to gaze at him before making her way back to where tresa mcanally sat waiting for her she was right about the guilt he thought but there was more to it the neighbours hadnt done anything at the time and that was typically edinburgh people would rather not know even if there was nothing there they didnt want to be told that their body or their country was rotten with cancer but nor did they want to be told that it wasnt and in the end they just sat there zugzwanged while the likes of charters and sir lain hunter got on with another game entirely in the middle of the second day in the same rancid clothes as the day before wreathed in a fug of nicotine and whisky and in possession of a hangover he was trying to drink away he met kirstie kennedy maybe it was halfway down leith walk or at the top of easter road she was shorter than him and wanted to whisper in his ear she didnt need to stand on tiptoe to do it he stooped under the weight of his skull and shoulders you should get straight she told him killing yourselfs no answer he recalled her words later when more or less seated on a bench in what purported to be a bar on dalry road it had the dimensions and atmosphere of a bonded warehouse he had just been speaking to the old thin man the one who liked american history rebus had started to give him a history lesson which didnt have much to do with hopalong cassidy and the man shuffled off to another part of the bar where tartan shoelaces stood protectively close to his erring wife morag rebus had stood them all a couple of drinks when hed come in some young turks were playing pool and rebus tried to concentrate on their game but found himself yawning noisily not keeping you up are we pal one of the players snarled cut it out the barmaid called to them hes polis hes guttered thats what he is plain mortal and then kirsties words came back to him you should get straight killing yourselfs no answer well it depended what the question was get straight straight as in even someone sat down next to him he tried turning his head to look at them found you at last sammy i got a phone call from somebody called kirstie she said she was worried im fine nothing wrong with me youre a mess whats happened the system thats whats happened you were right sammy and i knew you were right all the time i was saying you were wrong she smiled at him well you were right too i shouldnt have smuggled that note out for derwood charters dont worry about it gerry dip isnt talking well pin him for the credit cards if nothing else therell be no mention of charters at the trial you wont be involved but i am involved rebus shook his head just keep your mouth quiet thats what everyone else is doing nothings going to happen is that what this is about rebus straightened his back he didnt like sammy seeing him like this that thought had only just struck him look he said whether you can put this behind you or not is down to you and your conscience thats what im saying he got to his feet im going to clean up he made it to the toilets he didnt want the pool players coming in for a dairy discussion so wedged the door shut with paper towels while he stuck his head under the cold tap he dried himself off then was copiously sick into the bowl unjamming the door he walked back into the bar feeling better sammy asked him ninetyfive per cent to go rebus told her taking her hand in his who could he go to the lord advocate hardly he was probably on pheasantshooting terms with hunter he was the establishment and the establishment would be protected at all costs the chief constable but he was retiring and wouldnt want anything to tarnish his last few months in office the media perhaps mairie henderson it was the story of the year except there was no proof it would be the word of an embittered policeman against well everybody hed spent time steeping in the bath at home then showering sammy had made him drink a couple of litres of orange juice and about a packet of resolve i cant forget what i did she told him quietly maybe you got my guilt complex along with my genes he told her after sammy had gone back to patiences rebus had called gill templer he needed advice he told her they arranged to meet at her health club she had a sauna and massage booked they could talk in the bar after that there was a view from the bars firstfloor window down on to a quiet new town street all around rebus sat healthy people tanned and smiling with good teeth and trim confidence he knew he fitted in like a paedophile in a classroom he had trashed his bender clothes just trashed them and was wearing the gear hed bought for the trip to sir iains gill came in and nodded towards him then went to the bar and bought herself something nonalcoholic her skin glowed as she came over to his table you look rough she said you should have seen me earlier you could have sanded doors with me she picked a sliver of orange out of her glass and sucked on it so whats the big mystery he told her the whole story she started to look uncomfortable halfway through the look changing by degrees to simple bemusement ill take another orange juice if youre buying she said when hed finished she needed time to think so rebus didnt hurry the barman but when he came back to the table she still didnt have anything to say see gill what i need is the nod on a search warrant so i can go into gunners house and seize the file and the tape we could get one from a jp there are enough councillors left to choose from her face darkened why me she said why not how good do you think id come out of this do you think anyone would forget that i was the one whod helped you for christs sake gill her voice softened she stared into her drink sorry im letting you down john they could crucify me if they wanted to she stared at him they dont want to you dont know do you you really dont know know what youre going to be promoted to chief inspector theres an opening in galashiels it came down to the chief super from the dcc she smiled youre trying to arrange a search warrant for his house and hes busy giving you a hike up hows that going to look in court its true chief superintendent watson confirmed rebus was in the farmers office but not sitting he couldnt sit couldnt even stand at ease i dont want it i wont accept it thats allowed isnt it the farmer made a pained face if you refuse its a snub no one will forget you might never get a second chance i dont mind snubbing allan gunner john gunner didnt recommend you for promotion i did what several months back you did yes well its a damned coincidence gunners held off making a decision until now whose idea was galashiels it happens to be an opening it happens to be in the middle of nowhere i can see theyd need a chief inspector down there what with the farming vendettas and the saturday night punchup for once in your life john go easy on yourself do yourself a favour stop beating yourself up like youre the salvation army drum just the farmer shrugged drums dont beat themselves rebus said he was staring at the farmers computer not listening any more and then he started to smile and looked at the farmer ok he said tell gunner ill take it good but the farmer wasnt as pleased as hed expected hed be there was something going on some motive he couldnt fathom it was so bloody typical of rebus to make him feel like a win was a draw a draw a defeat and john he said standing up stretching out his hand congratulations rebus stared at the hand but didnt take it i didnt say i was accepting the promotion sir i just said to tell gunner i was and with that he left the farmers office flower was on nightshift again rebus didnt know why or how flower got so many nightshifts maybe because at night he was more likely to see a spot of trouble rebus looked like trouble as he strode towards his adversarys desk dragging a chair over and sitting astride it done any good fireraising lately flower just sneered some good it did you rebus went on what i dont mean setting the bin on fire i mean letting the dcc use your man mcanally like that whose idea was it to put him in charters cell whats it to you humour me rebus offered flower a cigarette flower took it warily and even then laid it to one side all right he said it was the dccs thats what i figured and you went along with it i mean who wouldnt it meant the dcc owed you a favour very handy that but it didnt work out youve lost me i mean the dcc had a hidden agenda he wanted to use your man to make sure charters wasnt talking because some people on the outside were getting sweaty charters was protecting certain people people like the head of panotech and the permanent secretary at the scottish office but a local councillor had started sniffing eventually he would have talked to charters maybe he already had that worried people they needed to know how safe they were as it turned out charters knew about the councillor and paid mcanally to give him a fright shite is it well no matter rebus sucked on his cigarette hed got flower thinking but that process might take weeks tell me he said your friend the dcc he didnt even get you lauderdales job didnt that make you think it was too soon it would have looked suspicious rebus laughed further discomfiting flower is that what he told you never you mind well bonny lad ive got news for you the dccs just offered me promotion to chief inspector away to hell rebus just shrugged flower picked up the cigarette hed been given and lit it then he called the farmer at home they had a bruising conversation during which flower brought up everything from his years in the force three more than rebus to his charitable works when he finally put the phone down he was shaking know who you should phone now rebus suggested your pal allan gunner ask him why me instead of you know what hell say well he might not say it but its the truth hes promoting me because im dangerous to him im too dangerous for the usual demotion so instead hes offering a bribe and youre being left behind because he can afford to ignore you thats a simple fact why are you telling me this flower hissed believe me its not just for the thrill of seeing you squirm why then rebus leaned forward how he asked confidentially would you like my promotion flower just sneered it hurt rebus to say what he was saying but he tried not to let that show he would sacrifice this and much more for a single risky shot at his quarry above all though he wouldnt tell flower about the move to galashiels that went along with it i mean it he said flower saw with deep amazement that he did what do i have to do winter mornings could sap you of good intentions and foolhardy schemes rebus and flower wanted to be in their separate beds tucked beneath a nice heavy woman but instead were sitting in rebuss car across the street from allan gunners house it was still dark a milk van passed and a bread van and a few bleak souls on their way to catch the first bus of the day so this is morning flower said not a pretty sight is it you think this will work have faith rebus looked towards the house hes up flower peered out through the windscreen a light had come on upstairs in the gunner household well give him five minutes said rebus but only two minutes later the downstairs lights came on could be the wife flower suggested cooking a hearty breakfast for her deserving husband have you ever heard the phrase new man its a shop isnt it what do you reckon a couple more minutes let him get his feet under the breakfast table my legs are blocks of ice rebus said opening the car door lets do it now they rang the doorbell and heard gunners voice calling ill get it then the door opened revealing the deputy chief constable in shirt but not yet necktie or cufflinks a mug of coffee in his hand he took a step back into the hall what the hell are you doing here canvassing for the natural law party rebus said stepping into the centrally heated house gunner ran upstairs to have a word with his wife and rebus and flower walked uninvited into the kitchen smoke was pouring from the electric grill flower lifted the grillpan out and blew on the cremated bread new man eh rebus switched the kettle back on and lifted two mugs from the drainingboard he was unscrewing the lid from the coffeejar when gunner returned gunner snatched the jar from him christ youve got some gall he switched the kettle off why are you here he checked his watch saw he hadnt put it on yet and glanced instead at the wallclock half a minute then youre on your way we want the file youve compiled rebus said and the tape sir lain made i think thatll do for now gunner looked to flower hes roped you in eh you must be mad i could have you both up before the chief constable wed like nothing better flower said he threw the remains of the toast into the bin you lied to me if we dont get the file and the tape rebus said we take it further anyway were going to kick up such a stink youll think your drains have backed up itll be everywhere believe me there wont be enough clothespegs to go round you are mad im not going to give you anything well start with the chief constable and the newspapers gunner folded his arms be my guests youve just dug yourselves a very deep hole holes have their uses rebus said when the bullets start to fly get out gunner snarled they got out think we were too obliging flower muttered as they walked back down the path we could have been harder on him it went fine its down to him now is he watching flower glanced back bedroom window right they walked to rebuss car got in and drove off a hundred yards along the road rebus stopped long enough to let flower out flowers own car was parked there and he got into it quickly rebus checked in his rearview but gunner hadnt come out of the house to check their departure not on a morning like this he drove on went around the block and ended up on the other side of gunners house they darent trust to police frequencies so had borrowed a couple of online cellular phones from a dealer whod owed rebus a favour rebuss phone rang and he picked it up any sign of him flower said not yet maybe hes on the marktwo toast i dont think hell have much of an appetite it was five minutes more before rebus heard a door bang shut then gunners gate opened his rover was directly outside and he unlocked it got in and started the engine bingo said rebus has he anything with him a briefcase well heres hoping rebus had parked away from the streetlighting and was careful not to start his engine until gunner was already on the move smoke billowed from his exhaust hanging in the subzero air gunners back windscreen was frosted over and he hadnt taken time to scrape it fall in behind me rebus told flower just before passing his stationary car soon they joined a slowmoving stream of commuter traffic heading into town the rovers rear demister had taken care of the frost when they came to a section of dual carriageway flower overtook rebus wheres he headed not to work rebus said not this way theyd discussed routes he might take places he might go princes street hadnt figured in their calculations there was light in the sky now a deep bruise hanging over the castle and the old town rebuss heater wasnt working properly it only did that in the summer and he curled his toes inside his shoes hes signalling flower said turning left on to waverley bridge maybe hes got a train to catch rebus thought he knew no but hes headed for the station a long line of black taxis crept up from the subterranean concourse of waverley station waiting their turn to take the commuters to business appointments and power breakfasts they headed past the taxis down the steep slope until they were underground gunner drove past the pickupdropoff point and looked for a moment as if he was going to head up the exit ramp and back on to waverley bridge but he took a left instead and found a parking bay towards the back of the station find yourself a space rebus told flower and follow on foot what if he sees me get on to the platform walk down it what if he goes on to the platform he hasnt come here for the trains hey and take your phone with you rebus parked and headed round the other side of the concourse anticlockwise to gunners clockwise he managed a light jog as if he was fighting a tight schedule he walked down a platform towards the rear of the station the telephone up to his face as much for camouflage as anything oh yes flower said and then rebus was in position in the distance he could see flower and halfway between them allan gunner he was where rebus had guessed hed be at the left luggage counter rebus stood halfhidden by a billboard advertising industrial space to let the irony wasnt lost on him as he watched gunner hand over the briefcase and accept a ticket when gunner headed back the way hed come rebus came from around the advertising hoarding and walked briskly towards left luggage just in time to see the employee place the case on a rack right at the front well flower said let him go is it there sweet as a nut flower sweet as a nut rico briggs took some persuading between them in their many and various ways rebus and flower were expert at the art of persuasion well hadnt they panicked persuaded gunner into getting rid of the evidence if hed had time to think if it hadnt been early morning he might have thought of a better hiding place left luggage was a stopgap he just didnt want the stuff in his house rebus had read him just right and in fact a left luggage office wasnt bad not as a stopgap rebus and flower took turns keeping the office under surveillance surveillance was easy in a railway station there were so many people just hanging around they didnt want gunner coming back and lifting the case without them knowing though rebuss guess was that it would stay there overnight gunner would work the day like any other then go home and think about it maybe make a few telephone calls calls he wouldnt want to make from his own office with the briefcase and its contents out of the way hed feel more confident hed want to use that time to think things through so the briefcase would be there overnight rebus called rico and got him to come down to the station they met in the bar rebus had already consumed too much coffee and junk food and the smell of stale alcohol in the bar almost did for him the bar smelt the way bars always did at the start of a new days business of the previous day of accumulation too much smoke and spilt beer pint of lager rico told the barman the barman tried not to stare too hard at his customers tattooed cheeks rico gave them a brisk rub while his drink was poured when he saw there was a gaming machine in the bar he walked over to it and fed in some coins rebus paid for the drink and carried it over to rico he had his cellphone in his free hand i look like a businessman on the way down he thought maybe he was at that rebus explained the situation to rico while rico played the machine when rico ran out of coins rebus gave him more then his cellphone beeped what does he say flower asked so far he says no let me talk to him so rebus relieved flower he let twenty minutes pass then phoned the bar well hes just about cleaned me out of money flower reported and in the end it was the gaming machine that was the real persuader it persuaded rico to borrow money from flower real money and suddenly rico owed the policeman twenty pounds for the promise of more money and a clean slate on his debt rico said hed meet them at one in the morning which was only thirteen hours away rebus and flower spent the rest of the day watching left luggage reading newspapers and magazines purchased from the station stall eating overpriced sandwiches drinking weak coffee and generally learning a lot about the life of a mainline railway station the security cameras bothered rebus so he paid a visit to scotrails security office and spoke to the staff on the pretext of alerting them to a gang of pickpockets just up from newcastle it was warm in the security chiefs office and the man was excid friendly they traded stories rebus asked for a tour which was how he saw everything would be all right the camera trained on left luggage was hazy distant theyd see anyone going in but they wouldnt get a good description this was very much to ricos advantage besides no one watched after midnight the camera would record but that was all the station was locked overnight but still open at one oclock there were weird night trains to deal with freighthaulers a sleeper bound for london rebus thought hed probably caught something he kept shivering at his core he didnt think it could just be nerves true to his word but ten minutes late rico turned up i brought some balaclavas he said we wont need them rebus explained about the cameras theyd taken their cars into cockburn street parked them there they had a quick discussion as they walked down platform one towards left luggage rico had checked the office out earlier and now carried the tools he needed tiny picklocks which reminded rebus of dental instruments instinctively his tongue sought the hole but there was no hole there dr keene had seen to that it took rico a very long minute but at last they were in with the shutters down the place was in utter darkness but rebus had a couple of torches and handed one to flower keep listening at the door rico he ordered then they went to work there wasnt much luggage to choose from and the briefcase was just where rebus knew it would be locked but that didnt matter he lifted it up and walked to the door here rico see what you can do with this he stood with his torch pointed at the case while rico brought out his picklocks flower meantime was moving luggage around switching tags what the hell are you doing rebus hissed maximising confusion well stop it put everything back we dont want anyone knowing weve been in here rico made a clucking sound with his tongue they switched the torches off and stood very still in the darkness listening slow footsteps coming nearer a whistled pop tune rico rested his weight against the door someone tried the door pushing it a couple of times then the shutters jumped a quarterinch and fell back then jumped again if someone shone a torch through the crack theyd see flower standing not three feet from them like the last dummy in the shop window the shutters clattered down again the footsteps moved away rebus started breathing again im glad i thought to wear my brown underwear rico whispered rebus shone the light back down on to the briefcase and rico tried the locks they flipped open against his fingers rebus lifted the lid of the case inside was a single fat document file and an audio cassette rebus lifted both out and instructed rico to lock the case again is that it flower said it took rebus half a paragraph to be sure then he smiled and nodded he placed the evidence in a carrierbag put the case back on its shelf and wiped it clean with the sleeve of his jacket rico was looking around at the other bags and cases no way rebus said coming to wipe the door where rico had held it shut and dont even think of coming back here on your own understand they relocked the door behind them and walked up the slope just before the gates were closed for the night rebus couldnt sleep he sat in his chair smoking a cigarette reading the file the dcc had prepared maybe crafted was a better word hed done a good job of making it look so thorough while leaving so much out he played part of the tape using headphones so he could turn the volume up sir iain was right about one thing any lawyer listening to the tape would think that the police officer present hadnt done very much rebus found that his hand was shaking he hadnt had a drink all day and didnt especially want one now he was just a bit scared that was all he wasnt sure he had enough even now especially now then he thought of something something hed almost persuaded himself to forget and reached for the phonebook finding the page running his finger down the names then along to a particular address a flat on dublin street it was past three oclock when rebus got there the streets dead not even any taxis rippling over the setts rebus pressed the buzzer and waited then pressed it again then a third time keeping his finger on it this time the intercom crackled into life what what mr mcallister rebus inquired as if it was the middle of the day yes its inspector rebus if youre alone id like to come up for a word rory mcallister was half dressed and less than half awake he was on his own rebus walked around the spacious living room admiring the ornaments and books while mcallister made them both a cup of coffee then they sat down opposite one another mcallister rubbed at his eyes and yawned so what is it inspector rebus put his mug down on the polished wooden floor well its just this sir that day we met for lunch you were well how can i put it it struck me afterwards that you were too enthusiastic too willing to talk then i saw you going to see audrey gillespie and well i started thinking mcallister tried to hide behind his steaming mug about what you dont deny you went to see mrs gillespie not at all i know her of course i met her husband several times professionally and socially mrs gillespie accompanied her husband on those social occasions rebus nodded and the other occasions theres interaction between the district council and the scottish office of course and both councillor gillespie and myself worked on an industry remit mmm rebus said and did the councillor know you were seeing his wife behind his back now hang on let me finish you see mr mcallister all this stuff tom gillespie found out is it possible he could have gleaned so much unaided someone had to be passing him the information perhaps anonymously youve lost me never mind youll catch up i think you found out about mensung and panotech and charters other scams sir iain trusted you had you pegged as a possible successor maybe he had you go into mensung to make sure there was nothing that could come to light rebus stood up now heres where it gets interesting because you either passed the information on so you could scupper sir iain in other words for the public good or you did it to keep gillespie busy and out of the way while you enjoyed a fling with his wife which might be called the private good either way i think you did it and you were generous enough to drag me out of bed in the middle of the night to let me know your suspicions mcallister sat back in his chair hands pressed to his chin as if in prayer i came here rebus said because if you did it only to smooth your affair with audrey gillespie then im sunk whereas if you really did want to get at sir iain then we could be of use to one another mcallister looked up and frowned how so rebus sat down again and told him it was sir iain he wanted hed cancelled out all the other numbers in the equation except charters and sir iain and sir iain was one possible route to derry charters rebus wanted him he wanted him because people like sir iain hunter were always in the right even when they were wrong sir lain lived and worked by the same ground rules a lot of villains swore by he was selfish without appearing to be full of arguments and selfjustifications he espoused the public good but lined his pockets with the publics money he wasnt so very different from the likes of paul duggan if rebus tried hard enough he found he could blame sir lain for the fates of willie coyle and dixie taylor kirstie had run away from home because her father had been shown the citys corrupt heart and wasnt going to do anything about it but the heart was artificial and sir lain hunter was working the bellows when rebus climbed the stairs to his flat he found someone huddled in his doorway it was sammy his hand on her shoulder woke her up and she sprang to her feet whats happened he asked ive been phoning you all day i was worried about you there were dried tearstains down both her cheeks i thought id wait for you here he let her in she looked around the living room and saw the duvet on the chair is this where you sleep some nights rebus said lighting the fire you cant get much rest there its all right do you want anything to drink she shook her head are you all right she asked he puffed out his cheeks then exhaled i think so just about he sank into his chair im a bit scared thats all im going to do something tomorrow it may not turn out the way i want one reason i wanted to see you she began i cant get it out of my mind that note and what happened i thought maybe if you could tell me the story it would help rebus smiled its not exactly a bedtime story his daughter had curled up in front of the fire and held a cushion against her chest tell me anyway she said so rebus told her leaving nothing out it was no less than she deserved and afterwards she fell asleep still clutching the cushion rebus placed the duvet over her turned the fire down low and sat down in his chair again tears falling so softly that he knew he wouldnt wake her he was wearing his best suit flower had phoned first thing to say he wasnt going he didnt explain didnt need to rebus didnt need any more from him flower was thinking tactically if it all went wrong as it well might flower would be in the foxhole he still had rebuss promise chief inspector if it all worked out sammy had helped him with his grooming he hadnt had much sleep but he didnt look too bad considering and the suit definitely helped patience chose it for me he told his daughter she has good taste sammy agreed he phoned first stressing secrecy and urgency there were problems but finally he was given fifteen minutes in the midmorning fifteen precious minutes he had a bit of time to kill so paced the flat emptied the jar and put it back under the radiator found his dental appointment card and tore it up sammy gave him a good luck kiss as he left the flat were not so very different she told him like father and daughter he said returning the kiss he parked at the front of st andrews house and a guard came out and told him he couldnt do that rebus showed his warrant card but the guard was adamant and directed him to the visitors parking tell me rebus said if i was sir iain hunter would i still have to move the car no said the guard that would be different and rebus smiled feeling a little of the tension leaving him the man was right that would be different he walked up the steps to the building close up it didnt look so much like a power station or the reichstag he was signed in at the desk and given a visitors pass security had to check the contents of his bag just some papers and a cassette someone came down to escort him upstairs where he was passed on to someone else who took him to a secretarys office on the way in a short narrow corridor his escort nearly bumped into sir iain hunter she apologised but sir lain wasnt paying her any attention rebus winked at him and smiled as he passed he didnt look back but he could feel the eyes boring into him right between the shoulderblades this he thought is for willie and dixie and for tom gillespie and for everyone who doesnt know the way the system works the way it makes room for lying and cheating and stealing but he knew above all that he was doing it for himself there was no secretary in the secretarys office just rory mcallister looking very illatease but there as hed promised rebus found another wink to spare then the secretary came in and ushered them into an antechamber she knocked on the door in front of them and opened it hed joked with the security man about the contents of his bag id hardly be carrying a bomb in a spar carrierbag but now he walked into the room with the boobytrap tucked under his arm good of you to find time to see us sir he meant it too dugald niven secretary of state for scotland had a busy schedule rebus was sure it would go ahead as usual no matter what the end
