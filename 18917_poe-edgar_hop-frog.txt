hopfrog by edgar allan poe i never knew anyone so keenly alive to a joke as the king was he seemed to live only for joking to tell a good story of the joke kind and to tell it well was the surest road to his favor thus it happened that his seven ministers were all noted for their accomplishments as jokers they all took after the king too in being large corpulent oily men as well as inimitable jokers whether people grow fat by joking or whether there is something in fat itself which predisposes to a joke i have never been quite able to determine but certain it is that a lean joker is a rara avis in terris about the refinements or as he called them the ghost of wit the king troubled himself very little he had an especial admiration for breadth in a jest and would often put up with length for the sake of it overniceties wearied him he would have preferred rabelais gargantua to the zadig of voltaire and upon the whole practical jokes suited his taste far better than verbal ones at the date of my narrative professing jesters had not altogether gone out of fashion at court several of the great continental powers still retain their fools who wore motley with caps and bells and who were expected to be always ready with sharp witticisms at a moments notice in consideration of the crumbs that fell from the royal table our king as a matter of course retained his fool the fact is he required something in the way of follyif only to counterbalance the heavy wisdom of the seven wise men who were his ministersnot to mention himself his fool or professional jester was not only a fool however his value was trebled in the eyes of the king by the fact of his being also a dwarf and a cripple dwarfs were as common at court in those days as fools and many monarchs would have found it difficult to get through their days days are rather longer at court than elsewhere without both a jester to laugh with and a dwarf to laugh at but as i have already observed your jesters in ninetynine cases out of a hundred are fat round and unwieldyso that it was no small source of selfgratulation with our king that in hopfrog this was the fools name he possessed a triplicate treasure in one person i believe the name hopfrog was not that given to the dwarf by his sponsors at baptism but it was conferred upon him by general consent of the several ministers on account of his inability to walk as other men do in fact hopfrog could only get along by a sort of interjectional gaitsomething between a leap and a wrigglea movement that afforded illimitable amusement and of course consolation to the king for notwithstanding the protuberance of his stomach and a constitutional swelling of the head the king by his whole court was accounted a capital figure but although hopfrog through the distortion of his legs could move only with great pain and difficulty along a road or floor the prodigious muscular power which nature seemed to have bestowed upon his arms by way of compensation for deficiency in the lower limbs enabled him to perform many feats of wonderful dexterity where trees or ropes were in question or any thing else to climb at such exercises he certainly much more resembled a squirrel or a small monkey than a frog i am not able to say with precision from what country hopfrog originally came it was from some barbarous region however that no person ever heard ofa vast distance from the court of our king hopfrog and a young girl very little less dwarfish than himself although of exquisite proportions and a marvellous dancer had been forcibly carried off from their respective homes in adjoining provinces and sent as presents to the king by one of his evervictorious generals under these circumstances it is not to be wondered at that a close intimacy arose between the two little captives indeed they soon became sworn friends hopfrog who although he made a great deal of sport was by no means popular had it not in his power to render trippetta many services but she on account of her grace and exquisite beauty although a dwarf was universally admired and petted so she possessed much influence and never failed to use it whenever she could for the benefit of hopfrog on some grand state occasioni forgot whatthe king determined to have a masquerade and whenever a masquerade or any thing of that kind occurred at our court then the talents both of hopfrog and trippetta were sure to be called into play hopfrog in especial was so inventive in the way of getting up pageants suggesting novel characters and arranging costumes for masked balls that nothing could be done it seems without his assistance the night appointed for the fete had arrived a gorgeous hall had been fitted up under trippettas eye with every kind of device which could possibly give eclat to a masquerade the whole court was in a fever of expectation as for costumes and characters it might well be supposed that everybody had come to a decision on such points many had made up their minds as to what roles they should assume a week or even a month in advance and in fact there was not a particle of indecision anywhereexcept in the case of the king and his seven minsters why they hesitated i never could tell unless they did it by way of a joke more probably they found it difficult on account of being so fat to make up their minds at all events time flew and as a last resort they sent for trippetta and hopfrog when the two little friends obeyed the summons of the king they found him sitting at his wine with the seven members of his cabinet council but the monarch appeared to be in a very ill humor he knew that hopfrog was not fond of wine for it excited the poor cripple almost to madness and madness is no comfortable feeling but the king loved his practical jokes and took pleasure in forcing hopfrog to drink and as the king called it to be merry come here hopfrog said he as the jester and his friend entered the room swallow this bumper to the health of your absent friends here hopfrog sighed and then let us have the benefit of your invention we want characterscharacters mansomething novelout of the way we are wearied with this everlasting sameness come drink the wine will brighten your wits hopfrog endeavored as usual to get up a jest in reply to these advances from the king but the effort was too much it happened to be the poor dwarfs birthday and the command to drink to his absent friends forced the tears to his eyes many large bitter drops fell into the goblet as he took it humbly from the hand of the tyrant ah ha ha roared the latter as the dwarf reluctantly drained the beakersee what a glass of good wine can do why your eyes are shining already poor fellow his large eyes gleamed rather than shone for the effect of wine on his excitable brain was not more powerful than instantaneous he placed the goblet nervously on the table and looked round upon the company with a halfinsane stare they all seemed highly amused at the success of the kings joke and now to business said the prime minister a very fat man yes said the king come lend us your assistance characters my fine fellow we stand in need of charactersall of usha ha ha and as this was seriously meant for a joke his laugh was chorused by the seven hopfrog also laughed although feebly and somewhat vacantly come come said the king impatiently have you nothing to suggest i am endeavoring to think of something novel replied the dwarf abstractedly for he was quite bewildered by the wine endeavoring cried the tyrant fiercely what do you mean by that ah i perceive you are sulky and want more wine here drink this and he poured out another goblet full and offered it to the cripple who merely gazed at it gasping for breath drink i say shouted the monster or by the fiends the dwarf hesitated the king grew purple with rage the courtiers smirked trippetta pale as a corpse advanced to the monarchs seat and falling on her knees before him implored him to spare her friend the tyrant regarded her for some moments in evident wonder at her audacity he seemed quite at a loss what to do or sayhow most becomingly to express his indignation at last without uttering a syllable he pushed her violently from him and threw the contents of the brimming goblet in her face the poor girl got up the best she could and not daring even to sigh resumed her position at the foot of the table there was a dead silence for about half a minute during which the falling of a leaf or of a feather might have been heard it was interrupted by a low but harsh and protracted grating sound which seemed to come at once from every corner of the room whatwhatwhat are you making that noise for demanded the king turning furiously to the dwarf the latter seemed to have recovered in great measure from his intoxication and looking fixedly but quietly into the tyrants face merely ejaculated ii how could it have been me the sound appeared to come from without observed one of the courtiers i fancy it was the parrot at the window whetting his bill upon his cagewires true replied the monarch as if much relieved by the suggestion but on the honor of a knight i could have sworn that it was the gritting of this vagabonds teeth hereupon the dwarf laughed the king was too confirmed a joker to object to any ones laughing and displayed a set of large powerful and very repulsive teeth moreover he avowed his perfect willingness to swallow as much wine as desired the monarch was pacified and having drained another bumper with no very perceptible ill effect hopfrog entered at once and with spirit into the plans for the masquerade i cannot tell what was the association of idea observed he very tranquilly and as if he had never tasted wine in his life but just after your majesty had struck the girl and thrown the wine in her facejust after your majesty had done this and while the parrot was making that odd noise outside the window there came into my mind a capital diversionone of my own country frolicsoften enacted among us at our masquerades but here it will be new altogether unfortunately however it requires a company of eight persons and here we are cried the king laughing at his acute discovery of the coincidence eight to a fractioni and my seven ministers come what is the diversion we call it replied the cripple the eight chained ourangoutangs and it really is excellent sport if well enacted we will enact it remarked the king drawing himself up and lowering his eyelids the beauty of the game continued hopfrog lies in the fright it occasions among the women capital roared in chorus the monarch and his ministry i will equip you as ourangoutangs proceeded the dwarf leave all that to me the resemblance shall be so striking that the company of masqueraders will take you for real beastsand of course they will be as much terrified as astonished oh this is exquisite exclaimed the king hopfrog i will make a man of you the chains are for the purpose of increasing the confusion by their jangling you are supposed to have escaped en masse from your keepers your majesty cannot conceive the effect produced at a masquerade by eight chained ourangoutangs imagined to be real ones by most of the company and rushing in with savage cries among the crowd of delicately and gorgeously habited men and women the contrast is inimitable it must be said the king and the council arose hurriedly as it was growing late to put in execution the scheme of hopfrog his mode of equipping the party as ourangoutangs was very simple but effective enough for his purposes the animals in question had at the epoch of my story very rarely been seen in any part of the civilized world and as the imitations made by the dwarf were sufficiently beastlike and more than sufficiently hideous their truthfulness to nature was thus thought to be secured the king and his ministers were first encased in tightfitting stockinet shirts and drawers they were then saturated with tar at this stage of the process some one of the party suggested feathers but the suggestion was at once overruled by the dwarf who soon convinced the eight by ocular demonstration that the hair of such a brute as the ourangoutang was much more efficiently represented by flu a thick coating of the latter was accordingly plastered upon the coating of tar a long chain was now procured first it was passed about the waist of the king and tied then about another of the party and also tied then about all successively in the same manner when this chaining arrangement was complete and the party stood as far apart from each other as possible they formed a circle and to make all things appear natural hopfrog passed the residue of the chain in two diameters at right angles across the circle after the fashion adopted at the present day by those who capture chimpanzees or other large apes in borneo the grand saloon in which the masquerade was to take place was a circular room very lofty and receiving the light of the sun only through a single window at top at night the season for which the apartment was especially designed it was illuminated principally by a large chandelier depending by a chain from the centre of the skylight and lowered or elevated by means of a counterbalance as usual but in order not to look unsightly this latter passed outside the cupola and over the roof the arrangements of the room had been left to trippettas superintendence but in some particulars it seems she had been guided by the calmer judgment of her friend the dwarf at his suggestion it was that on this occasion the chandelier was removed its waxen drippings which in weather so warm it was quite impossible to prevent would have been seriously detrimental to the rich dresses of the guests who on account of the crowded state of the saloon could not all be expected to keep from out its centre that is to say from under the chandelier additional sconces were set in various parts of the hall out of the way and a flambeau emitting sweet odor was placed in the right hand of each of the caryatides that stood against the wallsome fifty or sixty altogether the eight ourangoutangs taking hopfrogs advice waited patiently until midnight when the room was thoroughly filled with masqueraders before making their appearance no sooner had the clock ceased striking however than they rushed or rather rolled in all togetherfor the impediments of their chains caused most of the party to fall and all to stumble as they entered the excitement among the masqueraders was prodigious and filled the heart of the king with glee as had been anticipated there were not a few of the guests who supposed the ferociouslooking creatures to be beasts of some kind in reality if not precisely ourangoutangs many of the women swooned with affright and had not the king taken the precaution to exclude all weapons from the saloon his party might soon have expiated their frolic in their blood as it was a general rush was made for the doors but the king had ordered them to be locked immediately upon his entrance and at the dwarfs suggestion the keys had been deposited with him while the tumult was at its height and each masquerader attentive only to his own safety for in fact there was much real danger from the pressure of the excited crowd the chain by which the chandelier ordinarily hung and which had been drawn up on its removal might have been seen very gradually to descend until its hooked extremity came within three feet of the floor soon after this the king and his seven friends having reeled about the hall in all directions found themselves at length in its centre and of course in immediate contact with the chain while they were thus situated the dwarf who had followed noiselessly at their heels inciting them to keep up the commotion took hold of their own chain at the intersection of the two portions which crossed the circle diametrically and at right angles here with the rapidity of thought he inserted the hook from which the chandelier had been wont to depend and in an instant by some unseen agency the chandelierchain was drawn so far upward as to take the hook out of reach and as an inevitable consequence to drag the ourangoutangs together in close connection and face to face the masqueraders by this time had recovered in some measure from their alarm and beginning to regard the whole matter as a wellcontrived pleasantry set up a loud shout of laughter at the predicament of the apes leave them to me now screamed hopfrog his shrill voice making itself easily heard through all the din leave them to me i fancy i know them if i can only get a good look at them i can soon tell who they are here scrambling over the heads of the crowd he managed to get to the wall when seizing a flambeau from one of the caryatides he returned as he went to the centre of the roomleaping with the agility of a monkey upon the kings head and thence clambered a few feet up the chain holding down the torch to examine the group of ourangoutangs and still screaming i shall soon find out who they are and now while the whole assembly the apes included were convulsed with laughter the jester suddenly uttered a shrill whistle when the chain flew violently up for about thirty feetdragging with it the dismayed and struggling ourangoutangs and leaving them suspended in midair between the skylight and the floor hopfrog clinging to the chain as it rose still maintained his relative position in respect to the eight maskers and still as if nothing were the matter continued to thrust his torch down toward them as though endeavoring to discover who they were so thoroughly astonished was the whole company at this ascent that a dead silence of about a minutes duration ensued it was broken by just such a low harsh grating sound as had before attracted the attention of the king and his councillors when the former threw the wine in the face of trippetta but on the present occasion there could be no question as to whence the sound issued it came from the fanglike teeth of the dwarf who ground them and gnashed them as he foamed at the mouth and glared with an expression of maniacal rage into the upturned countenances of the king and his seven companions ah ha said at length the infuriated jester ah ha i begin to see who these people are now here pretending to scrutinize the king more closely he held the flambeau to the flaxen coat which enveloped him and which instantly burst into a sheet of vivid flame in less than half a minute the whole eight ourangoutangs were blazing fiercely amid the shrieks of the multitude who gazed at them from below horrorstricken and without the power to render them the slightest assistance at length the flames suddenly increasing in virulence forced the jester to climb higher up the chain to be out of their reach and as he made this movement the crowd again sank for a brief instant into silence the dwarf seized his opportunity and once more spoke i now see distinctly he said what manner of people these maskers are they are a great king and his seven privycouncillorsa king who does not scruple to strike a defenceless girl and his seven councillors who abet him in the outrage as for myself i am simply hopfrog the jesterand this is my last jest owing to the high combustibility of both the flax and the tar to which it adhered the dwarf had scarcely made an end of his brief speech before the work of vengeance was complete the eight corpses swung in their chains a fetid blackened hideous and indistinguishable mass the cripple hurled his torch at them clambered leisurely to the ceiling and disappeared through the skylight it is supposed that trippetta stationed on the roof of the saloon had been the accomplice of her friend in his fiery revenge and that together they effected their escape to their own country for neither was seen again
