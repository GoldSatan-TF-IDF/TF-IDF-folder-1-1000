julian a christmas story by robert charles wilson this is a story about julian comstock better known as julian the agnostic or after his uncle julian conqueror but it is not about his conquests such as they were or his betrayals or about the war in labrador or julians quarrels with the church of the dominion i witnessed many of those eventsand will no doubt write about them ultimatelybut this narrative concerns julian when he was young and i was young and neither of us was famous in late october of an election yearjulian and i along with his mentor sam godwin rode to the tip east of the town of williams ford where i came to possess a book and julian tutored me in one of his heresies it was a brisk sunny day there was a certain resolute promptness to the seasons in that part of athabaska in those days our summers were long languid and hot spring and fall were brief mere custodial functions between the extremes of weather winters were short but biting snow set in around the end of december and the river pine generally thawed by late march today might be the best we would get of autumn it was a day we should have spent under sam godwins tutelage perhaps sparring or targetshooting or reading chapters from the dominion history of the union but sam was not a heartless overseer and the kindness of the weather had suggested the possibility of an outing and so we had gone to the stables where my father worked and drawn horses and ridden out of the estate with lunches of black bread and salt ham in our backsatchels we rode east away from the hills and the town julian and i rode ahead sam rode behind a watchful presence his pittsburgh rifle ready in the saddle holster at his side there was no immediate threat of trouble but sam godwin believed in perpetual preparedness if he had a gospel it was be prepared also shoot first and probably damn the consequences sam who was old nearly fifty wore a dense brown beard stippled with wiry white hairs and was dressed in what remained presentable of his tanandgreen army of the californias uniform and a cloak to keep the wind off he was like a father to julian julians own true father having performed a gallows dance some years before lately he had been more vigilant than ever for reasons he had not discussed at least with me julian was my age seventeen and we were approximately the same height but there the resemblance ended julian had been born an aristo my family was of the leasing class his skin was clear and pale where mine was dark and lunar i was marked by the same pox that took my sister flaxie to her grave in his hair was long and almost femininely clean mine was black and wiry cut to stubble by my mother with her sewing scissors and i washed it once a week or somore often in summer when the brook behind the cottage ran clean and cool his clothes were linen and in places silk brassbuttoned cut to fit my shirt and pants were course hempen cloth sewn to a good approximation but obviously not the work of a new york tailor and yet we were friends and had been friends for three years since we met by chance in the forested hills west of the duncan and crowley estate where we had gone to hunt julian with his fine porter earle cassette rifle and me with a simple muzzleloader we both loved books especially the boys books written in those days by an author named charles curtis easton whom i would meet when he was sixty years old and i was a newcomer to the book tradebut thats another story i had been carrying a copy of eastons against the brazilians illicitly borrowed from the estate library julian had recognized the title but refrained from ratting on me since he loved the book as much as i did and longed to discuss it with a fellow enthusiast of which there were precious few among his aristo relationsin short he did me an unbegged favor and we became fast friends despite our differences in those early days i had not known how fond he was of blasphemy but i had learned since and it had not deterred me much we had not set out with the specific aim of visiting the tip but at the nearest crossroad julian turned west riding past cornfields and gourdfields already harvested and sunwhitened splitrail fences on which dense blackberry gnarls had grown up the air was cool but the sun was fiercely bright julian and sam wore broadbrimmed hats to protect their faces i wore a plain linen pakool hat sweatstained rolled about my ears before long we passed the last rude shacks of the indentured laborers whose nearnaked children gawked at us from the roadside and it became obvious we were going to the tip because where else on this road was there to gounless we continued east for many hours all the way to the ruins of the old towns from the days of the false tribulation the tip was located far from williams ford to prevent poaching and disorder there was a strict pecking order to the tip this is how it worked professional scavengers hired by the estate brought their pickings from the ruined places to the tip which was a pinefenced enclosure a sort of stockade in a patch of grassland and prairie flowers there the newlyarrived goods were roughly sorted and riders were dispatched to the estate to make the highborn aware of the latest acquisitions and various aristos or their trusted servants would ride out to claim the prime gleanings the next day the leasing class would be allowed to sort through what was left after that if anything remained indentured laborers could rummage among it if they calculated it worthwhile to make the journey every prosperous town had a tip though in the east it was sometimes called a till a dump or an eebay today we were fortunate several wagonloads of scrounge had lately arrived and riders had not yet been sent to notify the estate the gate was manned by a home guard who looked at us suspiciously until sam announced the name of julian comstock then the guard briskly stepped aside and we went inside the enclosure many of the wagons were still unloading and a chubby tipman eager to show off his bounty hurried toward us as we dismounted and moored our horses happy coincidence he cried gentlemen addressing mostly sam by this remark with a cautious smile for julian and a disdainful sidelong glance at me anything in particular youre looking for books julian said promptly before sam or i could answer books ordinarily i set aside books for the dominion conservator the boy is a comstock sam said i dont suppose you mean to balk him the tipman reddened no not at all in fact we came across something in our digging a sort of library in miniature ill show you if you like this was intriguing especially to julian who beamed as if he had been invited to a christmas party we followed the stout tipman to a freshlyarrived canvasback wagon from which a laborer was tossing bundled piles into a stack beside a tent these twinewrapped bales were books old tattered and wholly free of the dominion stamp of approval they must have been more than a century old for although they were faded they had obviously once been colorful and expensively printed not made of stiff brown paper like the charles curtis easton books of modern times they had not even rotted much their smell under the cleansing athabaska sunlight was inoffensive sam julian whispered he had already drawn his knife and was slicing through the twine calm down suggested sam who was not an enthusiast like julian oh butsam we should have brought a cart we cant carry away armloads julian nor would we ever have been allowed to the dominion scholars will have all this though perhaps you can get away with a volume or two the tipman said these are from lundsford lundsford was the name of a ruined town thirty or so miles to the southeast the tipman leaned toward sam godwin who was his own age and said we thought lundsford had been mined out a decade ago but even a dry well may freshen one of my workers spotted a low place off the main excavationsa sort of sinkhole the recent rain had cut it through once a basement or warehouse of some kind oh sir we found good china there and glasswork and many more books than this most were mildewed but some had been protected under a kind of stiff oilcoth and were lodged beneath a partiallycollapsed ceiling there had been a fire but they survived it good work tipman sam godwin said thank you sir perhaps you could remember me to the great men of the estate and he gave his name which i have forgotten julian had fallen to his knees amidst the compacted clay and rubble of the tip lifting up each book in turn and examining it with wide eyes i joined him in his exploration i had never much liked the tip it had always seemed to me a haunted place and of course it was haunted that was its purpose to house the revenants of the past ghosts of the false tribulation startled out of their centurylong slumber here was evidence of the best and worst of the people who had inhabited the years of vice and profligacy their fine things were very fine their glassware especially and it was a straitened aristo indeed who did not possess antique tablesettings rescued from some ruin or other sometimes one might find silver utensils in boxes or useful tools or coins the coins were too plentiful to be worth much individually but they could be worked into buttons or other adornments one of the highborn back at the estate owned a saddle studded with copper pennies all from the year i had occasionally been enlisted to polish it but here also was the trash and inexplicable detritus plastic gone brittle with sunlight or soft with the juices of the earth bits of metal blooming with rust electronic devices blackened by time and imbued with the sad inutility of a tensionless spring engine parts corroded copper wire rotten with verdigris aluminum cans and steel barrels eaten through by the poisonous fluids they had once containedand so on almost ad infinitum here too were the inbetween things the curiosities the ugly or pretty baubles as intriguing and as useless as seashells put down that rusty trumpet adam youll cut your lip and poison your bloodmy mother when we had gone to the tip many years before i met julian there had been no music in the trumpet anyway its bell was bent and corroded through more than that though there was the uneasy knowledge that these things fine or corrupt had survived their makershad proved more imperishable than flesh or spirit for the souls of the secular ancients were almost certainly not first in line for the resurrection and yet these books they tempted they proclaimed their seductions boldly some were decorated with impossibly beautiful women in various degrees of undress i had already sacrificed my personal claim to virtue with certain young women at the estate whom i had recklessly kissed at the age of seventeen i considered myself a jade or something like one but these images were so frank and impudent they made me blush and look away julian simply ignored them as he had always been invulnerable to the charms of women he preferred the larger and more denselywritten materialhe had already set aside a textbook of biology spotted and discolored but largely intact he found another volume almost as large and handed it to me saying here adam try thisyou might find it enlightening i inspected it skeptically the book was called a history of mankind in space the moon again i said read it for yourself tissue of lies im sure with photographs photographs prove nothing those people could do anything with photographs well read it anyway julian said in truth the idea excited me we had had this argument many times julian and i especially on autumn nights when the moon hung low and ponderous on the horizon people have walked there he would say the first time he made this claim i laughed the second time i said yes certainly i once climbed there myself on a greased rainbow but he had been serious oh i had heard these stories before who hadnt men on the moon what surprised me was that someone as welleducated as julian would believe them just take the book he insisted what to keep certainly to keep believe i will i muttered and i stuck the object in my backsatchel and felt both proud and guilty what would my father say if he knew i was reading literature without a dominion stamp what would my mother make of it of course i would not tell them at this point i backed off and found a grassy patch a little away from the rubble where i could sit and eat some of the lunch i had packed and watch julian who continued to sort through the detritus with a kind of scholarly intensity sam godwin came and joined me brushing a spot on an old timber so he could recline without soiling his uniform such as it was he sure loves those old books i said making conversation sam was often taciturnthe very picture of an old veteranbut he nodded and spoke familiarly hes learned to love them i helped teach him i wonder if that was wise maybe he loves them too much it might be theyll kill him one of these days how sam by the apostasy of them julians too smart for his own good he debates with the dominion clergy just last week i found him arguing with ben kreel our local representative of the council of the dominion in effect the mayor of the town about god history and such abstractions which is precisely what he must not do if he wants to survive the next few years why what threatens him the jealousy of the powerful sam said but he would say no more on the subject only sat and stroked his graying beard and glanced occasionally and uneasily to the east the day went on and eventually julian had to drag himself from his nest of books with only a pair of prizes the introduction to biology and another volume called geography of north america time to go sam insisted better to be back at the estate by supper in any case riders had been sent ahead and the official pickers and dominion curators would soon be here to cull what we had left but i have said that julian tutored me in one of his apostasies here is how it happened we stopped at the drowsy end of the afternoon at the height of a ridge overlooking the town of williams ford the grand estate upstream of it and the river pine as it cut through the valley on its way from the mountains of the west from this vantage we could see the steeple of the dominion hall and the revolving wheels of the grist mill and the lumber mill and so on blue in the long light and hazy with woodsmoke colored here and there with what remained of the autumn foliage far to the south a railway bridge crossed the gorge of the pine like a suspended thread go inside the weather seemed to proclaim its fair but it wont be fair for long bolt the window stoke the fire boil the apples winters due we rested our horses on the windy hilltop and julian found a blackberry bramble where the berries were still plump and dark and we plucked some of these and ate them this was the world i had been born into it was an autumn like every autumn i could remember but i could not help thinking of the tip and its ghosts maybe those people the people who had lived through the efflorescence of oil and the false tribulation had felt about their homes and neighborhoods as i felt about williams ford they were ghosts to me but they must have seemed real enough to themselvesmust have been real had not realized they were ghosts and did that i mean i was also a ghost a revenant to haunt some future generation julian saw my expression and asked me what was the matter i told him my thoughts now youre thinking like a philosopher he said grinning no wonder theyre such a miserable brigade then unfair adamyouve never seen a philosopher in your life julian believed in philosophers and claimed to have met one or two well i imagine theyre miserable if they go around thinking of themselves as ghosts and such its the condition of all things julian said this blackberry for example he plucked one and held it in the pale palm of his hand has it always looked like this obviously not i said impatiently once it was a tiny green bud of a thing and before that it was part of the substance of the bramble which before that was a seed inside a blackberry and round and round for all eternity but no adam thats the point the bramble and that tree over there and the gourds in the field and the crow circling over themtheyre all descended from ancestors that didnt quite resemble them a blackberry or a crow is a form and forms change over time the way clouds change shape as they travel across the sky forms of what of dna julian said earnestly the biology he had picked out of the tip was not the first biology he had read julian sam warned i once promised this boys parents you wouldnt corrupt him i said ive heard of dna its the life force of the secular ancients and its a myth like men walking on the moon exactly and whos your authority on this ben kreel the dominion history of the union nothing is changeless except dna thats a peculiar argument even from you julian it would be if i were making it but dna isnt changeless it struggles to remember itself but it never remembers itself perfectly remembering a fish it imagines a lizard remembering a horse it imagines a hippopotamus remembering an ape it imagines a man julian sam was insistent now thats quite enough you sound like a darwinist i said yes julian admitted smiling in spite of his unorthodoxy the autumn sun turning his face the color of penny copper i suppose i do that night i lay in bed until i was reasonably certain both my parents were asleep then i rose lit a lamp and took the new or rather very old history of mankind in space from where i had hidden it behind my oaken dresser i leafed through the brittle pages i didnt read the book i would read it but tonight i was too weary to pay close attention and in any case i wanted to savor the words lies and fictions though they might be not rush through them tonight i wanted only to sample the book in other words to look at the pictures there were dozens of photographs and each one captured my attention with fresh marvels and implausibilities one of them showedor purported to showmen standing on the surface of the moon just as julian had described the men in the picture were evidently americans they wore flags stitched to the shoulders of their moon clothing an archaic version of our own flag with something less than the customary sixty stars their clothing was white and ridiculously bulky like the winter clothes of the inuit and they wore helmets with golden visors that disguised their faces i supposed it must be very cold on the moon if explorers required such cumbersome protection they must have arrived in winter however there was no ice or snow in the neighborhood the moon seemed to be little more than a desert dry as a stick and dusty as a tipmans wardrobe i cannot say how long i stared at this picture puzzling over it it might have been an hour or more nor can i accurately describe how it made me feel larger than myself but lonely as if i had grown as tall as the stars and lost sight of everything familiar by the time i closed the book the moon had risen outside my windowthe real moon i mean a harvest moon fat and orange halfhidden behind drifting evolving clouds i found myself wondering whether it was truly possible that men had visited that celestial body whether as the pictures implied they had ridden there on rockets rockets a thousand times larger than the familiar independence day fireworks but if men had visited the moon why hadnt they stayed there was it so inhospitable a place that no one wished to remain or perhaps they had stayed and were living there still if the moon was such a cold place i reasoned people residing on its surface would be forced to build fires to keep warm there seemed to be no wood on the moon judging by the photographs so they must have resorted to coal or peat i went to the window and examined the moon minutely for any sign of campfires pit mining or other lunar industry but i could see none it was only the moon mottled and changeless i blushed at my own gullibility replaced the book in its hiding place chased these heresies from my mind with a prayer or a hasty facsimile of one and eventually fell asleep it falls to me to explain something of williams ford and my familys place in itand juliansbefore i describe the threat sam godwin feared which materialized in our village not long before christmas i beg the readers patience if i detail matters that seem wellknown i indulge the possibility of a foreign audience or a posterity to whom our present arrangements are not selfevident situated at the head of the valley was the font of our prosperity the duncan and crowley estate it was a country estate obviously since we were in athabaska far from the eastern seats of power owned by two influential new york mercantile families who maintained their villa not only as a source of income but as a kind of resort safely distant several days journey by train from the intrigues and pestilences of city life it was inhabitedruled i might saynot only by the duncan and crowley patriarchs but by a whole legion of cousins nephews relations by marriage highborn friends and distinguished guests in search of clean air and rural views our corner of athabaska was blessed with a benign climate and pleasant scenery according to the season and these things attract idle aristos the way strong butter attracts flies it remains unrecorded whether the town existed before the estate or vice versa but certainly the town depended on the estate for its prosperity in williams ford there were essentially three classes the owners or aristos below them the leasing class who worked as smiths carpenters coopers overseers gardeners beekeepers etc and whose leases were repaid in service and finally the indentured laborers who worked as field hands inhabited rude shacks along the west bank of the pine and received no compensation beyond bad food and worse lodging my family occupied an ambivalent place in this hierarchy my mother was a seamstress she worked at the estate as had her parents before her my father however had arrived in williams ford as a transient and his marriage to my mother had been controversial he had married a lease as the saying has it and had been taken on as a stable hand at the estate in lieu of a dowry the law allowed such unions but popular opinion frowned on it we had few friends of our own class my mothers blood relations had since died perhaps of embarrassment and as a child i was often mocked and derided for my fathers low origins on top of that was the issue of our religion we werebecause my father waschurch of signs in those days every christian church in america was required to have the formal approval of the board of registrars of the dominion of jesus christ on earth in popular parlance the church of the dominion but this was a misnomer since every church is a dominion church if it is recognized by the board dominion episcopal dominion presbyterian dominion baptisteven the catholic church of america since it renounced its fealty to the roman pope in all are included under the dominionist umbrella since the purpose of the dominion is not to be a church but to certify churches in america we are entitled by the constitution to worship at any church we please as long as it is a genuine christian congregation and not some fraudulent or satanistic sect the board exists to make that distinction also to collect fees and tithes to further its important work we were as i said church of signs which was a marginal denomination shunned by the leasing class recognized but not fully endorsed by the dominion and popular mostly with illiterate indentured workers among whom my father had been raised our faith took for its master text that passage in mark which proclaims in my name they will cast out devils and speak in new tongues they will handle serpents and if they drink poison they will not be sickened by it we were snakehandlers in other words and famous beyond our modest numbers for it our congregation consisted of a dozen farmhands mostly transients lately arrived from the southern states my father was its deacon though we did not use that name and we kept snakes for ritual purposes in wire cages on our back acre next to the outbuilding this practice contributed very little to our social standing that had been the situation of our family when julian comstock arrived as a guest of the duncan and crowley families along with his mentor sam godwin and when julian and i met by coincidence while hunting at that time i had been apprenticed to my father who had risen to the rank of an overseer at the estates lavish and extensive stables my father loved animals especially horses unfortunately i was not made in the same mold and my relations with the stables equine inhabitants rarely extended beyond a brisk mutual tolerance i did not love my jobwhich consisted largely of sweeping straw shoveling ordure and doing in general those chores the older stablehands felt to be beneath their dignityso i was pleased when it became customary for a household amanuensis or even sam godwin in person to arrive and summon me away from my work at julians request since the request emanated from a comstock it couldnt be overruled no matter how fiercely the grooms and saddlers gnashed their teeth to see me escape their autocracy at first we met to read and discuss books or hunt together later sam godwin invited me to audit julians lessons for he had been charged with julians education as well as his general welfare i had been taught the rudiments of reading and writing at the dominion school and refined these skills under the tutelage of my mother who believed in the power of literacy as an improving force my father could neither read nor write and it was not more than a year after our first acquaintance that sam presented himself one evening at my parents cottage with an extraordinary proposal mr and mrs hazzard sam had said putting his hand up to touch his cap which he had removed when he entered the cottage so that the gesture looked like a salute you know of course about the friendship between your son and julian comstock yes my mother said and worry over it often enoughmatters at the estate being what they are my mother was a small woman plump but forceful with ideas of her own my father who spoke seldom on this occasion spoke not at all only sat in his chair holding a laurelroot pipe which he did not light matters at the estate are exactly the crux of the issue sam godwin said im not sure how much adam has told you about our situation there julians father general bryce comstock who was my friend as well as my commanding officer shortly before his death charged me with julians care and wellbeing before his death my mother pointed out at the gallows for treason sam winced true mrs hazzard i cant deny it but i assert my belief that the trial was rigged and the verdict indefensible defensible or not however it doesnt alter my obligation as far as the son is concerned i promised to care for the boy mrs hazzard and i mean to keep my promise a christian sentiment her skepticism was not entirely disguised as for your implication about the estate and the practices of the young heirs and heiresses there i couldnt agree more which is why i approved and encouraged julians friendship with your son apart from adam julian has no true friends the estate is such a den of venomous snakesno offense he added remembering our religious affiliation and making the common but mistaken assumption that congregants of the church of signs necessarily like snakes or feel some kinship with themno offense but i would sooner allow julian to associate with uh scorpions striking for a more palatable simile than abandon him to the sneers machinations ruses and ruinous habits of his peers that makes me not only his teacher but his constant companion but im almost three times his age mrs hazzard and he needs a reliable friend more nearly of his own growth what do you propose exactly mr godwin what i propose is that i take on adam as a second student fulltime and to the ultimate benefit of both boys sam was usually a man of few wordseven as a teacherand he seemed as exhausted by this oration as if he had lifted some great weight as a student but a student of what mr godwin mechanics history grammar and composition martial skills adam already knows how to fire a rifle pistolwork sabrework fistfightingbut thats only a fraction of it sam added hastily julians father asked me to cultivate the boys mind as well as his reflexes my mother had more to say on the subject chiefly about how my work at the stables helped offset the familys leases and how difficult it would be to do without those extra vouchers at the estate store but sam had anticipated the point he had been entrusted by julians motherthat is to say the sisterinlaw of the presidentwith a discretionary fund for julians education which could be tapped to compensate for my absence from the stables and at a handsome rate he quoted a number and the objections from my parents grew considerably less strenuous and were finally whittled away to nothing i observed all this from a room away through a gap in the door which is not to say no misgivings remained before i set off for the estate the next day this time to visit one of the great houses rather than the stables my mother warned me not to tangle myself too tightly with the affairs of the highborn i promised her i would cling to my christian virtues a hasty promise less easily kept than i imagined julians somewhat feminine nature had won him a reputation among the other young aristos as a sodomite that they could believe this of him without evidence is testimony to the tenor of their thoughts as a class but it had occasionally redounded to my benefit on more than one occasion his female acquaintancessophisticated girls of my own age or oldermade the assumption that i was julians intimate companion in a physical sense whereupon they undertook to cure me of my deviant habits in the most direct fashion i was happy to cooperate with these cures and they were successful every time it may not be your morals that are at risk she said the highborn conduct themselves by different standards than we use adam the games they play have mortal stakes you do know that julians father was hung julian never spoke of it but it was a matter of public record i repeated sams assertion that bryce comstock had been innocent he may well have been thats the point there has been a comstock in the presidency for the past thirty years and the current comstock is said to be jealous of his power the only real threat to the reign of julians uncle was the ascendancy of his brother who made himself dangerously popular in the war with the brazilians i suspect mr godwin is correct that bryce comstock was hanged not because he was a bad general but because he was a successful one no doubt such scandals were possiblei had heard stories about life in new york city where the president resided that would curl a cynics hair but what could these things possibly have to do with me or even julian we were only boys such was my naiveté the days had grown short and thanksgiving had come and gone and so had november and snow was in the airthe tang of it anywaywhen fifty cavalrymen of the athabaska reserve rode into williams ford escorting an equal number of campaigners and polltakers many people despised the athabaskan winter i was not one of them i didnt mind the cold and the darkness not so long as there was a hardcoal heater a spirit lamp to read by on long nights and the chance of wheat cakes or headcheese for breakfast and christmas was coming up fastone of the four universal christian holidays recognized by the dominion the others being easter independence day and thanksgiving my favorite of these had always been christmas it was not so much the gifts which were generally meagerthough last year i had received from my parents the lease of a muzzleloading rifle of which i was exceptionally proudnor was it entirely the spiritual substance of the holiday which i am ashamed to say seldom entered my mind except when it was thrust upon me at religious services what i loved was the combined effect of brisk air frostwhitened mornings pine and holly wreaths pinned to doorways cranberryred banners draped above the main street to flap cheerfully in the cold wind carols and hymns chanted or sungthe whole breathless confrontation with winter half defiance and half submission i liked the clockwork regularity of these rituals as if a particular cog on the wheel of time had engaged with neat precision it soothed it spoke of eternity but this was an illomened season the reserve troops rode into town on the fifteenth of december ostensibly they were here to conduct the presidential election national elections were a formality in williams ford by the time our citizens were polled the outcome was usually a foregone conclusion already decided in the populous eastern statesthat is when there was more than one candidate which was seldom for the last six electoral years no individual or party had contested the election and we had been ruled by one comstock or another for three decades election had become indistinguishable from acclamation but that was all right because an election was still a momentous event almost a kind of circus involving the arrival of polltakers and campaigners who always had a fine show to put on and this yearthe rumor emanated from high chambers of the estate and had been whispered everywherethere was to be a movie shown in the dominion hall i had never seen any movies though julian had described them to me he had seen them often in new york when he was younger and whenever he grew nostalgiclife in williams ford was sometimes a little sedate for julians tasteit was the movies he was provoked to mention and so when the showing of a movie was announced as part of the electoral process both of us were excited and we agreed to meet behind the dominion hall at he appointed hour neither of us had any legitimate reason to be there i was too young to vote and julian would have been conspicuous and perhaps unwelcome as the only aristo at a gathering of the leasing class the highborn had been polled independently at the estate and had already voted proxies for their indentured labor so i let my parents leave for the hall early in the evening and i followed surreptitiously and arrived just before the event was scheduled to begin i waited behind the meeting hall where a dozen horses were tethered until julian arrived on an animal borrowed from the estate stables he was dressed in his best approximation of a leasers clothing hempen shirt and trousers of a dark color and a black felt hat with its brim pulled low to disguise his face he dismounted looking troubled and i asked him what was wrong julian shook his head nothing adamor nothing yetbut sam says theres trouble brewing and here he regarded me with an expression verging on pity war he said theres always war a new offensive well what of it labradors a million miles away obviously your sense of geography hasnt been much improved by sams classes and we might be physically a long distance from the front but were operationally far too close for comfort i didnt know what that meant and so i dismissed it we can worry about that after the movie julian he forced a grin and said yes i suppose so as well after as before so we entered the dominion hall just as the lamps were being dimmed and slouched into the last row of crowded pews and waited for the show to start there was a broad stage at the front of the hall from which all religious appurtenances had been removed and a square white screen had been erected in place of the usual pulpit or dais on each side of the screen was a kind of tent in which the two players sat with their scripts and dramatic gear speakinghorns bells blocks a drum a pennywhistle et alia this was julian said a strippeddown edition of what one might find in a fashionable new york movie theater in the city the screen and thus the images projected on it would be larger the players would be more professional since scriptreading and noisemaking were considered fashionable arts and the city players competed with one another for roles and there might be a third player stationed behind the screen for dramatic narration or additional sound effects there might even be an orchestra with thematic music written for each individual production movies were devised in such a way that two main characters male and female could be voiced by the players with the male actor photographed so that he appeared on the left during dialogue scenes and the female actor on the right the players would observe the movie by a system of mirrors and could follow scripts illuminated by a kind of binnacle lamp so as not to cast a distracting light and they spoke their lines as the photographed actors spoke so that their voices seemed to emanate from the screen likewise their drumming and bellringing and such corresponded to events within the movie the illusion was quite striking when the players were professional but their lapses could be equally astonishing julian once recounted to me a new york movie production of wm shakespeares hamlet in which a player had come to the theater inebriated causing the unhappy denmark to seem to exclaim sea of troublesan unprintable oathi have troubles of my own with more obscenities and much inappropriate bellringing and vulgar whistling until an understudy could be hurried out to replace him of course they did it better in the secular era julian whispered and i prayed no one had overheard this indelicate comment by all reports movies had indeed been spectacular during the efflorescence of oilwith recorded sound natural color rather than blackandgray etc but they were also by the same reports hideously impious blasphemous to the extreme and routinely pornographic fortunately or unfortunately from julians point of view no examples have survived the media on which they were recorded was ephemeral the film stock has long since rotted and digital copies are degraded and wholly undecodable these movies belonged to the twentieth and early twentyfirst centuriesthat period of great unsustainable and hedonistic prosperity driven by the burning of earths reserves of perishable oil which culminated in the false tribulation and the wars and the plagues and the painful dwindling of inflated populations to more reasonable numbers our truest and best american antiquity as the dominion history of the union insisted was the nineteenth century whose household virtues and modest industries we have been forced by circumstance to imperfectly restore whose skills were practical and whose literature was often useful and improving but i have to confess that some of julians apostasy had infected me i was troubled by unhappy thoughts even as the torchieres were extinguished and ben kreel our dominion representative standing in front of the movie screen delivered a brief lecture on nation piety and duty war julian had said implying not just the everlasting war in labrador but a new phase of it one that might reach its skeletal hand right into williams fordand then what of me and what of my family we are here to cast our ballots ben kreel said in summation a sacred duty at once to our country and our faith a country so successfully and benevolently stewarded by its leader president deklan comstock whose campaigners i see by the motions of their hands are anxious to get on with the events of the night and so without further adieu etc please direct your attention to the presentation of their moving picture first under heaven which they have prepared for our enjoyment the necessary gear had been hauled into williams ford under a canvastop wagon a projection apparatus and a portable swiss dynamo probably captured from the dutch forces in labrador powered by distilled spirits installed in a sort of trench or redoubt freshly dug behind the church to muffle its sound which nevertheless penetrated through the plank floors like the growl of a huge dog this vibration only added to the sense of moment as the last illuminating flame was extinguished and the electric bulb within the huge black mechanical projector flared up the movie began as it was the first i had ever seen my astonishment was complete i was so entranced by the illusion of photographs come to life that the substance of the scenes almost escaped me but i remember an ornate title and scenes of the second battle of quebec recreated by actors but utterly real to me accompanied by drumbanging and shrill penny whistling to represent the reports of shot and shell those at the front of the auditorium flinched instinctively several of the villages prominent women came near to fainting and clasped the hands or arms of their male companions who might be as bruised come morning as if they had participated in the battle itself soon enough however the dutchmen under their crossandlaurel flag began to retreat from the american forces and an actor representing the young deklan comstock came to the fore reciting his vows of inauguration a bit prematurely but history was here truncated for the purposes of artthats the one in which he mentions both the continental imperative and the debt to the past he was voiced of course by one of the players a basso profundo whose tones emerged from his speakingbell with ponderous gravity which was also a slight revision of the truth for the genuine deklan comstock possessed a highpitched voice and was prone to petulance the movie then proceeded to more decorous episodes and scenic views representing the glories of the reign of deklan conqueror as he was known to the army of the laurentians which had marched him to his ascendancy in new york city here was the reconstruction of washington dc a project never completed always in progress hindered by a swampy climate and insectborne diseases here was the illumination of manhattan whereby electric streetlights were powered by a hydroelectric dynamo four hours every day between and pm here was the military shipyard at boston harbor the coal mines and foundries and weapons factories of pennsylvania the newest and shiniest steam engines to pull the newest and shiniest trains etc etc i had to wonder at julians reaction to all this this entire show after all was concocted to extoll the virtues of the man who had contrived the death by hanging of his father i could not forgetand julian must be constantly awarethat the current president was a fratricidal tyrant but julians eyes were riveted on the screen this reflected i later learned not his opinion of contemporary politics but his fascination with what he preferred to call cinema this making of illusions in two dimensions was never far from his mindit was perhaps his true calling and would culminate in the creation of julians suppressed cinematic masterwork the life and adventures of the great naturalist charles darwin but that tale remains for another telling the present movie went on to mention the successful forays against the brazilians at panama during deklan conquerors reign which may have struck closer to home for i saw julian wince once or twice as for me i tried to lose myself in the moment but my attention was woefully truant perhaps it was the strangeness of the campaign event so close to christmas perhaps it was the history of mankind in space which i had been reading in bed a page or two at a time almost every night since our journey to the tip whatever the cause i was beset by a sudden anxiety and sense of melancholy here i was in the midst of everything that seemed familiar and ought to be comfortingthe crowd of the leasing class the enclosing benevolence of the dominion hall the banners and tokens of the christmas seasonand it all felt suddenly ephemeral as if the world were a bucket from which the bottom had dropped out perhaps this was what julian had called the philosophers perspective if so i wondered how the philosophers endured it i had learned a little from sam godwinand more from julian who read books of which even sam disapprovedabout the discredited ideas of the secular era i thought of einstein and his insistence that no particular point of view of was more privileged than any other in other words his general relativity and its claim that the answer to the question what is real begins with the question where are you standing was that all i was here in the cocoon of williams forda point of view or was i an incarnation of a molecule of dna imperfectly remembering as julian had said an ape a fish and an amoeba maybe even the nation that ben kreel had praised so extravagantly was only an example of this trend in naturean imperfect memory of another century which had itself been an imperfect memory of all the centuries before it and so back to the dawn of man in eden or africa as julian believed perhaps this was just my growing disenchantment with the town where i had been raisedor a presentiment that it was about to be stolen away from me the movie ended with a stirring scene of an american flag its thirteen stripes and sixty stars rippling in sunlightbetokening the narrator insisted another four years of the prosperity and benevolence engendered by the rule of deklan conqueror for whom the audiences votes were solicited not that there was any competing candidate known or rumored the film flapped against its reel the electric bulb was extinguished then the deacons of the dominion began to reignite the wall lights several of the men in the audience had lit pipes during the cinematic display and their smoke mingled with the smudge of the torchieres a bluegray thundercloud hovering under the high arches of the ceiling julian seemed distracted and slumped in his pew with his hat pulled low adam he whispered we have to find a way out of here i believe i see one i said its called the doorbut whats the hurry look at the door more closely two men of the reserve have been posted there i looked and what he had said was true but isnt that just to protect the balloting for ben kreel had retaken the stage and was preparing to ask for a formal show of hands tom shearney the barber with a bladder complaint just tried to leave to use the jakes he was turned back indeed tom shearney was seated less than a yard away from us squirming unhappily and casting resentful glances at the reserve men but after the balloting this isnt about balloting this is about conscription conscription hush julian said hastily shaking his hair out of his pale face youll start a stampede i didnt think it would begin so soon but weve had certain telegrams from new york about setbacks in labrador and the callup of new divisions once the balloting is finished the campaigners will probably announce a recruitment drive and take the names of everyone present and survey them for the names and ages of their children were too young to be drafted i said for we were both just seventeen not according to what ive heard the rules have been changed oh you can probably find a way to hide out when the culling beginsand get away with it considering how far we are from anywhere else but my presence here is wellknown i dont have a mob or family to melt away into in fact its probably not a coincidence that so many reserves have been sent to such a little village as williams ford what do you mean not a coincidence my uncle has never been happy about my existence he has no children of his own no heirs he sees me as a possible competitor for the executive but thats absurd you dont want to be presidentdo you i would sooner shoot myself but uncle deklan has a jealous bent and he distrusts the motives of my mother in protecting me how does a draft help him the entire draft is not aimed at me but im sure he finds it a useful tool if im drafted no one can complain that hes excepting his own family from the general conscription and when he has me in the infantry he can be sure i find myself on the front lines in labradorperforming some noble but suicidal trench attack butjulian cant sam protect you sam is a retired soldier he has no power except what arises from the patronage of my mother which isnt worth much in the coin of the present realm adam is there another way out of this building only the door unless you mean to break a pane of that colored glass that fills the windows somewhere to hide then i thought about it maybe i said theres a room behind the stage where the religious equipment is stored you can enter it from the wings we could hide there but it has no door of its own itll have to do if we can get there without attracting attention but that was not too difficult for the torchieres had not all been relit much of the hall was still in shadow and the audience was milling about a bit and stretching while the campaigners prepared to record the vote that was to followthey were meticulous accountants even though the final tally was a foregone conclusion and the ballrooms were already booked for deklan conquerors latest inauguration julian and i shuffled from one shadow to another giving no appearance of haste until we were close to the foot of the stage there we paused at an entrance to the storage room until a goonish reserve man who had been eyeing us was called away by a superior officer to help dismantle the projecting equipment we ducked through the curtained door into nearabsolute darkness julian stumbled over some obstruction a piece of the churchs tack piano which had been disassembled for cleaning in by a traveling pianomechanic who had died of a stroke before finishing the job the result being a woody clang that seemed loud enough to alert the whole occupancy of the church but evidently didnt what little light there was came through a high glazed window that was hinged so that it could be opened in summer for purposes of ventilation it was a weak sort of illumination for the night was cloudy and only the torches along the main street were shining but it registered as our eyes adjusted to the dimness perhaps we can get out that way julian said not without a ladder although what speak up adam if you have an idea this is where they store the risersthe long wooden blocks the choir stands on when theyre racked up for a performance perhaps those but he was already examining the shadowy contents of the storage room as intently as he had surveyed the tip for ancient books we found the likely suspects and managed to stack them to a useful height without causing too much noise in the church hall the campaigners had already registered a unanimous vote for deklan comstock and had begun to break the news about the conscription drive some few voices were raised in futile objection ben kreel was calling loudly for calmno one heard us rearranging the unused furniture the window was at least ten feet high and almost too narrow to crawl through and when we emerged on the other side we had to hang by our fingertips before dropping to the ground i bent my right ankle awkwardly as i landed though no lasting harm was done the night already cold had turned colder we were near the hitching posts and the horses whinnied at our surprising arrival and blew steam from their gaping nostrils a fine gritty snow had begun to fall there was not much wind however and christmas banners hung limply in the frigid air julian made straight for his horse and loosed its reins from the post what are we going to do i asked you adam will do nothing but protect your own existence as best you know how while i but he balked at pronouncing his plans and a shadow of anxiety passed over his face events were moving rapidly in the realm of the aristos events i could barely comprehend we can wait them out i said a little desperately the reserves cant stay in williams ford forever no unfortunately neither can i for deklan conqueror knows where to find me and has made up his mind to remove me from the game of politics like a captured chesspiece but where will you go and what he put a finger to his mouth there was a noise from the front of the dominion church hall as of the doors being thrown open and voices of congregants arguing or wailing over the news of the conscription drive ride with me julian said quick now we did not follow the main street but caught a path that turned behind the blacksmiths barn and through the wooded border of the river pine north in the general direction of the estate the night was dark and the horses stepped slowly but they knew the path almost by instinct and some light from the town still filtered through the thinly falling snow which touched my face like a hundred small cold fingers it was never possible that i could stay at williams ford forever julian said you ought to have known that adam truly i should have it was julians constant theme after all the impermanence of things i had always put this down to the circumstances of his childhood the death of his father the separation from his mother the kind but aloof tutelage of sam godwin but i could not help thinking once more of the history of mankind in space and the photographs in itnot of the first men on the moon who were americans but of the last visitors to that celestial sphere who had been chinamen and whose space suits had been firecrackerred like the americans they had planted their flag in expectation of more visitations to come but the end of oil and the false tribulation had put paid to those plans and i thought of the even lonelier plains of mars photographed by machines or so the book alleged but never touched by human feet the universe it seemed was full to brimming with lonesome places somehow i had stumbled into one the snow squall ended the uninhabited moon came through the clouds and the winter fields of williams ford glowed with an unearthly luminescence if you must leave i said let me come with you no julian said promptly he had pulled his hat down around his ears to protect himself from the cold and i couldnt see much of his face but his eyes shone when he glanced in my direction thank you adam i wish it were possible but it isnt you must stay here and dodge the draft if possible and polish your literary skills and one day write books like mr charles curtis easton that was my ambition which had grown over the last year nourished by our mutual love of books and by sam godwins exercises in english composition for which i had discovered an unexpected talent not a talent that was born fullyformed i should add only two years previously i had presented to sam godwin my first finished story which i had called a western boy his adventures in enemy europe sam had praised its style and ambition but called attention to a number of flaws elephants for instance were not native to brussels and were generally too massive to be wrestled to the ground by american lads a journey from london to rome could not be accomplished in a matter of hours even on a very fast horseand sam might have continued in this vein had i not fled the room in a condition of acute auctorial embarrassment at the moment it seemed a petty dream evanescent like all dreams like life itself none of that matters i said thats where youre wrong julian said you must not make the mistake of thinking that because nothing lasts nothing matters isnt that the philosophers point of view not if the philosopher knows what hes talking about julian reined up his horse and turned to face me something of the imperiousness of his famous family entering into his mien listen adam there is something important you can do for meat some personal risk are you willing yes i said immediately then listen closely before long the reserves will be watching the roads out of williams ford if they arent already i have to leave and i have to leave tonight i wont be missed until morning and then at least at first only by sam what i want you to do is this go homeyour parents will be worried about the conscription and you can try to calm them downbut dont allude to any of what happened tonightand first thing in the morning make your way as inconspicuously as possible into the estate and find sam tell him what happened at the church hall and tell him to ride out of town as soon as he can do so without being caught tell him he can find me at lundsford thats the message lundsford theres nothing at lundsford precisely nothing important enough that the reserves would think to look for us there you remember what the tipman said in the fall about the place he found those books a low place near the main excavations sam can look for me there ill tell him i promised blinking against the cold wind which irritated my eyes thank you adam he said gravely for everything then he forced a smile and for a moment was just julian the friend with whom i had hunted squirrels and spun tales merry christmas he said happy new year and wheeled his horse about and rode away there is a dominion cemetery in williams ford and i passed it on the ride back homecarved stones sepulchral in the moonlightbut my sister flaxie was not buried there as i have said the church of signs was tolerated but not endorsed by the dominion we were not entitled to plots in the dominion yard flaxie had a place in the acreage behind our cottage marked by a modest wooden cross but the cemetery put me in mind of flaxie nonetheless and after i returned the horse to the barn i stopped by flaxies grave despite the shivery cold and tipped my hat to her the way i had always tipped my hat to her in life flaxie had been a bright impudent mischievous small thingas goldenhaired as her nickname implied her given name was dolores but she was always flaxie to me the pox had taken her quite suddenly and as these things go mercifully i didnt remember her death i had been down with the same pox though i had survived it what i remembered was waking up from my fever into a house gone strangely quiet no one had wanted to tell me about flaxie but i had seen my mothers tormented eyes and i knew the truth without having to be told death had played lottery with us and flaxie had drawn the short straw it is i think for the likes of flaxie that we maintain a belief in heaven i have met very few adults outside the enthusiasts of the established church who genuinely believe in heaven and heaven was scant consolation for my grieving mother but flaxie who was five had believed in it ferventlyimagined it was something like a meadow with wildflowers blooming and a perpetual summer picnic underwayand if that childish belief soothed her in her extremity then it served a purpose more noble than truth tonight the cottage was almost as quiet as it had been during the mourning that followed flaxies death i came through the door to find my mother dabbing her eyes with a handkerchief and my father frowning over his pipe which uncharacteristically he had filled and lit the draft he said yes i said i heard about it my mother was too distraught to speak my father said well do what we can to protect you adam but im not afraid to serve my country i said thats a praiseworthy attitude my father said glumly and my mother wept even harder but we dont yet know what might be necessary maybe the situation in labrador isnt as bad as it seems scant of words though my father was i had often enough relied on him for advice which he had freely given he was fully aware for instance of my distaste for snakesfor which reason abetted by my mother i had been allowed to avoid the sacraments of our faith and the venomous swellings and occasional amputations occasionally inflicted upon other parishionersand while this disappointed him he had nevertheless taught me the practical aspects of snakehandling including how to grasp a serpent in such a way as to avoid its bite and how to kill one should the necessity arise grasp it where its neck ought to be behind the head ignore the tail however it may thrash and crack its skull hard and often enough to subdue it i had recounted these instructions to julian whose horror of serpents far exceeded my own oh i could never do such a thing he had exclaimed this surfeit of timidity may surprise readers who have followed his later career he was a practical man despite his unusual beliefs but he had no advice to offer me tonight he looked like a hunted man who has come to the end of a culdesac and can neither go forward nor turn back i went to my bedroom although i doubted i would be able to sleep insteadwithout any real plan in mindi bundled a few of my possessions for easy carrying my squirrelgun chiefly and some notes and writing and the history of mankind in space and i thought i should add some salted pork or something of that nature but i resolved to wait until later so my mother wouldnt see me packing before dawn i put on several layers of clothing and a heavy pakool hat rolled down so the wool covered my ears i opened the window of my room and clambered over the sill and closed the glass behind me after i had retrieved my rifle and gear then i crept across the open yard to the barn and saddled up a horse the gelding named rapture who was the fastest though this would leave my fathers rig an animal shy and rode out under a sky that had just begun to show first light last nights brief snowfall still covered the ground i was not the first up this winter morning and the cold air already smelled of christmas the bakery in williams ford was busy making nativity cakes and cinnamon buns the sweet yeasty smell filled the northwest end of town like an intoxicating fog for there was no wind to carry it away the day was dawning blue and still signs of christmas were everywhereas they ought to be for today was the eve of that universal holidaybut so was evidence of the conscription drive the reservists were already awake passing like shadows in their scruffy uniforms and a crowd of them had gathered by the hardware store they had hung out a faded flag and posted a sign which i could not read because i was determined to keep a distance between myself and the soldiers but i knew a recruitingpost when i saw one i did not doubt that the main ways in and out of town had been put under close observation i took a back way to the estate the same riverside road julian and i had traveled the night before because of the lack of wind our tracks were undisturbed we were the only ones who had recently passed this way rapture was revisiting his own hoofprints close to the estate but still within a concealing grove of pines i lashed the horse to a sapling and proceeded on foot the duncancrowley estate was not fenced for there was no real demarcation of its boundaries under the leasing system everything in williams ford was owned in the legal sense by the two great families i approached from the western side which was halfwooded and used by the aristos for casual riding and hunting this morning the copse was not inhabited and i saw no one until i had passed the snowmounded hedges which marked the beginning of the formal gardens here in summer apple and cherry trees blossomed and produced fruit flowerbeds gave forth symphonies of color and scent bees nursed in languid ecstasies but now it was barren the paths quilted with snow and there was no one visible but the senior groundskeeper sweeping the wooden portico of the nearest of the estates several great houses the houses were dressed for christmas christmas was a grander event at the estate than in the town proper as might be expected the winter population of the duncancrowley estate was not as large as its summer population but there was still a number of both families plus whatever cousins and hangerson had elected to hibernate over the cold season sam godwin as julians tutor was not permitted to sleep in either of the two most luxurious buildings but bunked among the elite staff in a whitepillared house that would have passed for a mansion anywhere but here this was where he had conducted classes for julian and me and i knew the building intimately it too was dressed for christmas a holly wreath hung on the door pine boughs were suspended over the lintels a banner of the cross dangled from the eaves the door was not locked and i let myself in quietly it was still early in the morning at least as the aristos and their elite helpers calculated time the tiled entranceway was empty and still i went straight for the rooms where sam godwin slept and conducted his classes down an oaken corridor lit only by the dawn filtering through a window at the long end the floor was carpeted and gave no sound though my shoes left damp footprints behind me at sams particular door i was confronted with a dilemma i could not knock for fear of alerting others my mission as i saw it was to deliver julians message as discreetly as possible but neither could i walk in on a sleeping mancould i i tried the handle of the door it moved freely i opened the door a fraction of an inch meaning to whisper samand give him some warning but i could hear sams voice low and muttering as if he were talking to himself i listened more closely the words seemed strange he was speaking in a guttural language not english perhaps he wasnt alone it was too late to back away however so i decided to brazen it out i opened the door entirely and stepped inside saying sam its me adam i have a message from julian i stopped short alarmed by what i saw sam godwinthe same gruff but familiar sam who had taught me the rudiments of history and geographywas practicing black magic or some other form of witchcraft on christmas eve he wore a striped cowl about his shoulders and leather lacings on his arm and a boxlike implement strapped to his forehead and his hands were upraised over an arrangement of nine candles mounted in a brass holder that appeared to have been scavenged from some ancient tip the invocation he had been murmuring seemed to echo through the room bah rooka tahatten eyehello heynoo my jaw dropped adam sam said almost as startled as i was and he quickly pulled the shawl from his back and began to unlace his various unholy riggings this was so irregular i could barely comprehend it then i was afraid i did comprehend it often enough in dominion school i had heard ben kreel speak about the vices and wickedness of the secular era some of which still lingered he said in the cities of the eastirreverence irreligiosity skepticism occultism depravity and i thought of the ideas i had so casually imbibed from julian and indirectly from sam some of which i had even begun to believe einsteinism darwinism space travel had i been seduced by the outrunners of some new yorkish paganism had i been duped by philosophy a message sam said concealing his heathenish gear what message where is julian but i could not stay i fled the room sam barreled out of the house after me i was fast but he was longlegged and conditioned by his military career strong for all his fortyodd years and he caught me in the winter gardenstackled me from behind i kicked and tried to pull away but he pinned my shoulders adam for gods sake settle down cried he that was impudent i thought invoking god himbut then he said dont you understand what you saw i am a jew a jew of course i had heard of jews they lived in the bible and in new york city their equivocal relationship with our savior had won them opprobrium down the ages and they were not approved of by the dominion but i had never seen a living jew in the fleshto my knowledgeand i was astonished by the idea that sam had been one all along invisibly so to speak you deceived everyone then i said i never claimed to be a christian i never spoke of it at all but what does it matter you said you had a message from juliangive it to me damn you where is he i wondered what i should say or who i might betray if i said it the world had turned upsidedown all ben kreels lectures on patriotism and fidelity came back to me in one great flood of guilt and shame had i been a party to treason as well as atheism but i felt i owed this last favor to julian who would surely have wanted me to deliver his intelligence whether sam was a jew or a mohammedan there are soldiers on all the roads out of town i said sullenly julian went for lundsford last night he says hell meet you there now get off of me sam did so sitting back on his heels deep anxiety inscribed upon his face has it begun so soon i thought they would wait for the new year i dont know what has begun i dont think i know anything at all and so saying i leapt to my feet and ran out of the lifeless garden back to rapture who was still tied to the tree where i had left him nosing unproductively in the undisturbed snow i had ridden perhaps an eighth of a mile back toward williams ford when another rider came up on my right flank from behind it was ben kreel himself and he touched his cap and smiled and said do you mind if i ride along with you a ways adam hazzard i could hardly say no ben kreel was not a pastorwe had plenty of those in williams ford each catering to his own denominationbut he was the head of the local council of the dominion of jesus christ on earth almost as powerful in his way as the men who owned the estate and if he was not a pastor he was at least a sort of shepherd to the townspeople he had been born right here in williams ford son of a saddler had been educated at the estates expense at one of the dominion colleges in colorado springs and for the last twenty years he had taught elementary school five days a week and general christianity on sundays i had marked my first letters on a slate board under ben kreels tutelage every independence day he addressed the townsfolk and reminded them of the symbolism and significance of the thirteen stripes and the sixty stars every christmas he led the ecumenical services at the dominion hall he was stout and graying at the temples cleanshaven he wore a woolen jacket tall deer hide boots and a pakool hat not much grander than my own but he carried himself with an immense dignity as much in the saddle as on foot the expression on his face was kindly it was always kindly youre out early adam hazzard he said what are you doing abroad at this hour nothing i said and blushed is there any other word that so spectacularly represents everything it wants to deny under the circumstances nothing amounted to a confession of bad intent couldnt sleep i added hastily thought i might shoot a squirrel or so that would explain the rifle strapped to my saddle and it was at least remotely plausible the squirrels were still active doing the last of their scrounging before settling in for the cold months on christmas eve ben kreel asked and in the copse on the grounds of the estate i hope the duncans and crowleys dont hear about it theyre jealous of their trees and im sure gunfire would disturb them at this hour wealthy men and easterners prefer to sleep past dawn as a rule i didnt fire i muttered i thought better of it well good wisdom prevails youre headed back to town i gather yes sir let me keep you company then please do i could hardly say otherwise no matter how i longed to be alone with my thoughts our horses moved slowlythe snow made for awkward footingand ben kreel was silent for a long while then he said you neednt conceal your fears adam i know whats troubling you for a moment i had the terrible idea that ben kreel had been behind me in the hallway at the estate and that he had seen sam godwin wrapped in his old testament paraphernalia wouldnt that create a scandal and then i thought that it was exactly such a scandal sam must have feared all his life it was worse even than being church of signs for in some states a jew can be fined or even imprisoned for practicing his faith i didnt know where athabaska stood on the issue but i feared the worst but ben kreel was talking about conscription not about sam ive already discussed this with some of the boys in town he said youre not alone adam if youre wondering what it all means this military movement and what might happen as a result of it and i admit youre something of a special case ive been keeping an eye on you from a distance as it were here stop a moment we had come to a rise in the road on a bluff above the river pine looking south toward williams ford from a little height gaze at that ben kreel said contemplatively he stretched his arm out in an arc as if to include not just the cluster of buildings that was the town but the empty fields as well and the murky flow of the river and the wheels of the mills and even the shacks of the indentured laborers down in the low country the valley seemed at once a living thing inhaling the crisp atmosphere of the season and breathing out its steams and a portrait static in the still blue winter air as deeply rooted as an oak as fragile as a ball of nativity glass gaze at that ben kreel repeated look at williams ford laid out pretty there what is it adam more than a place i think its a way of life its the sum of all our labors its what our fathers have given us and its what we give our sons its where we bury our mothers and where our daughters will be buried here was more philosophy then and after the turmoil of the morning i wasnt sure i wanted any but ben kreels voice ran on like the soothing syrup my mother used to administer whenever flaxie or i came down with a cough every boy in williams fordevery boy old enough to submit himself for national serviceis just now discovering how reluctant he is to leave the place he knows best even you i suspect im no more or less willing than anyone else im not questioning your courage or your loyalty its just that i know youve had a little taste of what life might be like elsewheregiven how closely you associated yourself with julian comstock now im sure julians a fine young man and an excellent christian he could hardly be otherwise could he as the nephew of the man who holds this nation in his palm but his experience has been very different from yours hes accustomed to citiesto movies like the one we saw at the hall last night and i glimpsed you there didnt i sitting in the back pewsto books and ideas that might strike a youth of your background as exciting and well different am i wrong i could hardly say you are sir and much of what julian may have described to you is no doubt true ive traveled some myself you know ive seen colorado springs pittsburgh even new york city our eastern cities are great proud metropolisessome of the biggest and most productive in the worldand theyre worth defending which is one reason were trying so hard to drive the dutch out of labrador surely youre right im glad you agree because there is a trap certain young people fall into ive seen it before sometimes a boy decides that one of those great cities might be a place he can run away toa place where he can escape all the duties obligations and moral lessons he learned at his mothers knee simple things like faith and patriotism can begin to seem to a young man like burdens which might be shrugged off when they become too weighty im not like that sir of course not but there is yet another element in the calculation you may have to leave williams ford because of the conscription and the thought that runs through many boys minds is if i must leave then perhaps i ought to leave on my own hook and find my destiny on a citys streets rather than in a battalion of the athabaska brigade and youre good to deny it adam but you wouldnt be human if such ideas didnt cross your mind no sir i muttered and i must admit i felt a dawning guilt for i had in fact been a little seduced by julians tales of city life and sams dubious lessons and the history of mankind in spaceperhaps i had forgotten something of my obligations to the village that lay so still and so inviting in the blue near distance i know ben kreel said that things havent always been easy for your family your fathers faith in particular has been a trial and we havent always been good neighborsspeaking on behalf of the village as a whole perhaps youve been left out of some activities other boys enjoy as a matter of course church activities picnics common friendships well even williams ford isnt perfect but i promise you adam if you find yourself in the brigades especially if you find yourself tested in time of war youll discover that the same boys who shunned you in the dusty streets of your home town become your best friends and bravest defenders and you theirs for our common heritage ties us together in ways that may seem obscure but become obvious under the harsh light of combat i had spent so much time smarting under the remarks of other boys that my father raised vipers the way other folks raise chickens for example that i could hardly credit ben kreels assertion but i knew little of modern warfare except what i had read in the novels of mr charles curtis easton so it might be true and the prospect as was intended made me feel even more shamefaced there ben kreel said do you hear that adam i did i could hardly avoid it the bell was ringing in the dominion church calling together one of the early ecumenical services it was a silvery sound on the winter air at once lonesome and consoling and i wanted almost to run toward itto shelter in it as if i were a child again theyll want me soon ben kreel said will you excuse me if i ride ahead no sir please dont mind about me as long as we understand each other adam dont look so downcast the future may be brighter than you expect thank you for saying so sir i stayed a while longer on the low bluff watching as ben kreels horse carried him toward town even in the sunlight it was cold and i shivered some perhaps more because of the conflict in my mind than because of the weather the dominion man had made me ashamed of myself and had put into perspective my loose ways of the last few years and pointed up how many of my native beliefs i had abandoned before the seductive philosophy of an agnostic young aristo and an aging jew then i sighed and urged rapture back along the path toward williams ford meaning to explain to my parents where i had been and reassure them that i would not suffer too much in the coming conscription to which i would willingly submit i was so disheartened by the mornings events that my eyes drifted toward the ground even as rapture retraced his steps as i have said the snows of the night before lay largely undisturbed on this back trail between the town and the estate i could see where i had passed this morning where raptures hoofprints were as clearly written as figures in a book ben kreel must have spent the night at the estate and when he left me on the bluff he would have taken the more direct route toward town only rapture had passed this way then i reached the place where julian and i had parted the night before there were more hoofprints here in fact a crowd of them and i saw something else written in effect on the snowy groundsomething which alarmed me i reined up at once i looked south toward williams ford i looked east the way julian had gone the previous night then i took a bracing inhalation of icy air and followed the trail that seemed to me most urgent the eastwest road through williams ford is not heavily traveled especially in winter the southern roadalso called the wire road because the telegraph line runs alongside itconnects williams ford to the railhead at connaught and thus sustains a great deal of traffic but the eastwest road goes essentially nowhere it is a remnant of a road of the secular ancients traversed mainly by tipmen and freelance antiquarians and then only in the warmer months i suppose if you followed the old road as far is it would take you you might reach the great lakes or somewhere farther east in that direction and the opposite way you could get yourself lost among washouts and landfalls in the rocky mountains but the railroadand a parallel turnpike farther southhad obviated the need for all that trouble nevertheless the eastwest road was closely watched where it left the outskirts of williams ford the reserves had posted a man on a hill overlooking it the same hill where julian and sam and i had paused for blackberries on our way from the tip last october but it is a fact that the reserve troops were held in reserve and not sent to the front lines mainly because of some disabling flaw of body or mind some were wounded veterans missing a hand or an arm some were too simple or sullen to function in a disciplined body of soldiers i cannot say anything for certain about the man posted as lookout on the hill but if he was not a fool he was at least utterly unconcerned about concealment for his silhouette and that of his rifle stood etched against the bright eastern sky for all to see but maybe that was the intent to let prospective fugitives know their way was barred not every way was barred however not for someone who had grown up in williams ford and hunted everywhere on its perimeter instead of following julian directly i rode north a distance and then through the crowded lanes of an encampment of indentured laborers whose ragged children gaped at me from the glassless windows of their shanties and whose softcoal fires made a smoky gauze of the motionless air this route connected with lanes cut through the wheat fields for the transportation of harvests and fieldhandslanes that had been deepened by years of use so that i rode behind a berm of earth and snake rail fences hidden from the distant sentinel when i was safely east i came down a cattletrail that reconnected me with the eastwest road on which i was able to read the same signs that had alerted me back at williams ford thanks to the fine layer of snow still undisturbed by any wind julian had come this way he had done as he had intended and ridden toward lundsford before midnight the snow had stopped soon thereafter leaving his horses hoofprints clearly visible though softened and halfcovered but his were not the only tracks there was a second set more crisply defined and hence more recent probably set down during the night and this was what i had seen at the crossroads in williams ford evidence of pursuit someone had followed julian without julians knowledge this had dire implications the only redeeming circumstance being the fact of a single pursuer rather than a company of men if the powerful people of the estate had known that it was julian comstock who had fled they would surely have sent an entire brigade to bring him back i supposed julian had been mistaken for a simple miscreant a labor refugee or a youngster fleeing the conscription and that he had been followed by some ambitious reservist otherwise that whole imagined battalion might be right behind me or perhaps soon would be since julians absence must have been noted by now i rode east adding my own track to these two before long it was past noon and i began to have second thoughts as the sun began to angle toward an early rendezvous with the southwestern horizon what exactly did i hope to accomplish to warn julian if so i was a little late off the mark though i hoped that at some point julian had covered his tracks or otherwise misled his pursuer who did not have the advantage i had of knowing where julian meant to stay until sam godwin could arrive failing that i halfimagined rescuing julian from capture even though i had but a squirrel rifle and a few rounds of ammunition plus a knife and my own wits both feeble enough weapons against whatever a reservist might carry in any case these were more wishes and anxieties than calculations or plans i had no fullyformed plan beyond riding to julians aid and telling him that i had delivered my message to sam who would along as soon as he could discreetly leave the estate and then what it was a question i dared not ask myselfnot out on this lonely road well past the tip now farther than i had ever been from williams ford not out here where the flatlands stretched on each side of the path like the frosty plains of mars and the wind which had been absent all morning began to pluck at the fringes of my coat and my shadow elongated in front of me like a scarecrow gone riding it was cold and getting colder and soon the winter moon would be aloft and me with only a few ounces of salt pork in my saddlebag and a few matches to make a fire if i was able to secure any kindling by nightfall i began to wonder if i had gone quite insane at several points i thought i could go back perhaps i hadnt yet been missed perhaps it wasnt too late to sit down to a christmas eve dinner with my parents raise a glass of cider to flaxie and to christmases past and wake in time to hear the ringingin of the holiday and smell the goodness of baked bread and nativity apples drenched in cinnamon and brown sugar i mused on it repeatedly sometimes with tears in my eyes but i let rapture continue carrying me toward the darkest part of the horizon then after what seemed endless hours of dusk with only a brief pause when both rapture and i drank from a creek which had a skin of ice on it i began to come among the ruins of the secular ancients not that there was anything spectacular about them fanciful drawings often portray the ruins of the last century as tall buildings ragged and hollow as broken teeth forming vineencrusted canyons and shadowy culdesacs or culsdesac my french is rudimentary no doubt such places existmost of them in the uninhabitable southwest however where famine sits enthroned and waves his scepter over a dominion expressly made for him which would rule out vines and such tropical items though old miami or orlando might begin to fit the billbut most ruins were like the ones i now passed mere irregularities or more precisely regularities in the landscape which indicated the former presence of foundations these terrains were treacherous often concealing deep basements that could open like hungry mouths on an unwary traveler and only tipmen loved them i was careful to keep to the path though i began to wonder whether julian would be as easy to find as i had imaginedlundsford was a big locality and the wind had already begun to scour away the hoofprints i had relied on for navigation i was haunted too by thoughts of the false tribulation of the last century it was not unusual to come across desiccated human remains in localities like this millions had died in the worst dislocations of the end of oil of disease of internecine strife but mostly of starvation the age of oil had allowed a fierce intensity of fertilization and irrigation of the land which had fed more people than a humbler agriculture could support i had seen photographs of americans from that blighted age thin as sticks their children with distended bellies crowded into relief camps that would soon enough be transformed into communal graves when the imagined relief failed to materialize no wonder then that our ancestors had mistaken those decades for the tribulation of prophecy what was astonishing was how many of our current institutionsthe church the army the federal governmenthad survived more or less intact there was a passage in the dominion bible that ben kreel had read whenever the subject of the false tribulation arose in school and which i had committed to memory the field is wasted the landmourns for the corn is shriveled the wine has dried the oil languishes be ashamed farmershowl vinekeepers howl for the wheat and the barley for the harvest of the field has perished it had made me shiver then and it made me shiver now in these barrens which had been stripped of all their utility by a century of scavenging where in this rubble was julian and where was his pursuer it was by his fire i found him but i was not the first to arrive the sun was altogether down and a hint of the aurora borealis played about the northern sky dimmed by moonlight when i came to the most recently excavated section of lundsford the temporary dwellings of the tipmenrude huts of scavenged timberhad been abandoned here for the season and corduroy ramps led down into the empty digs here the remnants of last nights snow had been blown into windrows and small dunes and all evidence of hoofprints had been erased but i rode slowly knowing i was close to my destination i was buoyed by the observation that julians pursuer whoever he was had not returned this way from his mission had not that is taken julian captive or at least had not gone back to williams ford with his prisoner in tow perhaps the pursuit had been suspended for the night it was not longthough it seemed an eternity as rapture shortstepped down the frozen road avoiding snowhidden pitfallsbefore i heard the whickering of another horse and saw a plume of smoke rising into the moonbright sky quickly i turned rapture off the road and tied his reins to the low remnants of a concrete pillar from which rustsavaged iron rods protruded like skeletal fingers i took my squirrel rifle from the saddle holster and moved toward the source of the smoke on foot until i was able to discern that the fumes emerged from a deep declivity in the landscape perhaps the very dig from which the tipmen had extracted the history of mankind in space surely this was where julian had gone to wait for sams arrival and indeed here was julians horse one of the finer riding horses from the estate worth more im sure in the eyes of its owner than a hundred julian comstocks moored to an outcrop and alarmingly here was another horse as well not far away this second horse was a stranger to me it was slatribbed and elderlylooking but it wore a military bridle and the sort of cloth bibblue with a red star in the middle of itthat marked a mount belonging to the reserves i studied the situation from behind the moonshadow of a broken abutment the smoke suggested that julian had gone beneath ground down into the hollow of the tipmens dig to shelter from the cold and bank his fire for the night the presence of the second horse suggested that he had been discovered and that his pursuer must already have confronted him more than that i could not divine it remained only to approach the contested grounds as secretively as possible and see what more i could learn i crept closer the dig was revealed by moonlight as a deep but narrow excavation covered in part with boards with a sloping entrance at one end the glow of the fire within was just visible as was the chimneyhole that had been cut through the planking some yards farther down there was as far as i could discern only one way in or out i determined to proceed as far as i could without being seen and to that end i lowered myself down the slope inching forward on the seat of my pants over ground that was as cold it seemed to me as the wastelands of the arctic north i was slow i was cautious and i was quiet but i was not slow cautious or quiet enough for i had just progressed far enough to glimpse an excavated chamber in which the firelight cast a kaleidoscopic flux of shadows when i felt a pressure behind my earthe barrel of a gunand a voice said keep moving mister and join your friend below i kept silent until i could comprehend more of the situation i had fallen into my captor marched me down into the low part of the dig the air if damp was noticeably warmer here and we were screened from the increasing wind though not from the accumulated odors of the fire and the stagnant must of what had once been a basement or cellar in some commercial establishment of the secular ancients the tipmen had not left much behind only a rubble of broken bits of things indistinguishable under layers of dust and dirt the far wall was of concrete and the fire had been banked against it under a chimneyhole that must have been cut by the scavengers during their labors a circle of stones hedged the fire and the damp planks and splinters in it crackled with a deceptive cheerfulness deeper parts part of the excavation with ceilings lower than a man standing erect opened in several directions julian sat near the fire his back to the wall and his knees drawn up under his chin his clothes had been made filthy by the grime of the place he was frowning and when he saw me his frown deepened into a scowl go over there and get beside him my captor said but give me that little bird rifle first i surrendered my weapon modest as it was and joined julian thus i was able to get my first clear look at the man who had captured me he appeared not much older than myself but he was dressed in the blue and yellow uniform of the reserves his reserve cap was pulled low over his eyes which twitched left and right as though he were in constant fear of an ambush in short he seemed both inexperienced and nervousand maybe a little dim for his jaw was slack and he was evidently unaware of the dribble of mucous that escaped his nostrils as a result of the cold weather but as i have said before this was not untypical of the members of the reserve who were kept out of active duty for a reason his weapon however was very much in earnest and not to be trifled with it was a pittsburgh rifle manufactured by the porter earl works which loaded at the breech from a sort of cassette and could fire five rounds in succession without any more attention from its owner than a twitch of the index finger julian had carried a similar weapon but had been disarmed of it it rested against a stack of small staved barrels well out of reach and the reservist put my squirrel rifle beside it i began to feel sorry for myself and to think what a poor way of spending christmas eve i had chosen i did not resent the action of the reservist nearly as much as i resented my own stupidity and lapse of judgment i dont know who you are the reservist said and i dont careone draftdodger is as good as the next in my opinionbut i was given the job of collecting runaways and my bag is getting full i hope youll both keep till morning when i can ride you back into williams ford anyhow none of us shall sleep tonight i wont in any case so you might as well resign yourself to your captivity if youre hungry theres a little meat i was never less hungry in my life and i began to say so but julian interrupted its true adam he said were fairly caught i wish you hadnt come after me im beginning to feel the same way i said he gave me a meaningful look and said in a lower voice is sam no whispering there our captor said at once but i divined the intent of the question and nodded to indicate that i had delivered julians message though that was by no means a guarantee of our deliverance not only were the exits from williams ford under close watch but sam could not slip away as inconspicuously as i had and if julians absence had been noted there would have been a redoubling of the guard and perhaps an expedition sent out to hunt us the man who had captured julian was evidently an outrider assigned to patrol the roads for runaways and he had been diligent in his work he was somewhat less diligent now that he had us in his control however for he took a wooden pipe from his pocket and proceeded to fill it as he made himself as comfortable as possible on a wooden crate his gestures were still nervous and i supposed the pipe was meant to relax him for it was not tobacco he put into it the reservist might have been a kentuckian for i understand the less respectable people of that state often form the habit of smoking the silk of the female hemp plant which is cultivated prodigiously there kentucky hemp is grown for cordage and cloth and paper and as a drug is less intoxicating than the indian hemp of lore but its mild smoke is said to be pleasant for those who indulge in it though too much can result in sleepiness and great thirst julian evidently thought these symptoms would be welcome distractions in our captor and he gestured to me to remain silent so as not to interrupt the reservist in his vice the reservist packed the pipes bowl with dried vegetable matter from an oilcloth envelope he carried in his pocket and soon the substance was alight and a slightly more fragrant smoke joined the effluvia of the campfire as it swirled toward the rent in the ceiling clearly the night would be a long one and i tried to be patient in my captivity and not think too much of christmas matters or the yellow light of my parents cottage on dark winter mornings or the soft bed where i might have been sleeping if i had not been rash in my deliberations i began by saying this was a story about julian comstock and i fear i lied for it has turned out mainly to be a story about myself but there is a reason for this beyond the obvious temptations of vanity and selfregard i did not at the time know julian nearly as well as i thought i did our friendship was essentially a boys friendship i could not help reviewing as we sat in silent captivity in the ruins of lundsford the things we had done together reading books hunting in the wooded foothills west of williams ford arguing amiably over everything from philosophy and moonvisiting to the best way to bait a hook or cinch a bridle it had been too easy during our time together to forget that julian was an aristo with close connections to men of power or that his father had been famous both as a hero and as a traitor or that his uncle deklan comstock the president might not have julians best interests at heart all that seemed far away and distant from the nature of julians true spirit which was gentle and inquisitivea naturalists disposition not a politicians or a generals when i pictured julian as an adult i imagined him contentedly pursuing some scholarly or artistic adventure digging the bones of prenoachian monsters out of the athabaska shale perhaps or making an improved kind of movie he was not a warlike person and the thoughts of the great men of the day seemed almost exclusively concerned with war so i had let myself forget that he was also everything he had been before he came to williams ford he was the heir of a brave determined and ultimately betrayed father who had conquered an army of brazilians but had been crushed by the millstone of political intrigue he was the son of a powerful woman born to a powerful family of her ownnot powerful enough to save bryce comstock from the gallows but powerful enough to protect julian at least temporarily from the mad calculations of his uncle he was both a pawn and a player in the great games of the aristos and while i had forgotten all this julian had notthese were the people who had made him and if he chose not to speak of them they nevertheless must have haunted his thoughts he was it is true often frightened of small thingsi still remember his disquiet when i described the rituals of the church of signs to him and he would sometimes shriek at the distress of animals when our hunting failed to result in a clean kill but tonight here in the ruins i was the one who halfdozed in a morose funk fighting tears while it was julian who sat intently still gazing with resolve from beneath the strands of dusty hair that straggled over his brows as coolly calculating as a bank clerk when we hunted he often gave me the rifle to fire the last lethal shot distrusting his own resolve tonighthad the opportunity presented itselfi would have given the rifle to him i halfdozed as i said and from time to time woke to see the reservist still sitting in guard his eyelids were at halfmast but i put that down to the effect of the hemp flowers he had smoked periodically he would start as if at a sound inaudible to others then settle back into place he had boiled a copious amount of coffee in a tin pan and he warmed it whenever he renewed the fire and drank sufficiently to keep him from falling asleep of necessity this meant he must once in a while retreat to a distant part of the dig and attend to physical necessities in relative privacy this did not give us any advantage however since he carried his pittsburgh rifle with him but it allowed a moment or two in which julian could whisper without being overheard this man is no mental giant julian said we may yet get out of here with our freedom its not his brains so much as his artillery thats stopping us said i perhaps we can separate the one from the other look there adam beyond the fireback in the rubble i looked there was motion in the shadows which i began to recognize the distraction may suit our purposes julian said unless it becomes fatal and i saw the sweat that had begun to stand out on his forehead the terror barely hidden in his eyes but i need your help i have said that i did not partake of the particular rites of my fathers church and that snakes were not my favorite creatures this is true as much as i have heard about surrendering ones volition to godand i had seen my father with a massassauga rattler in each hand trembling with devotion speaking in a tongue not only foreign but utterly unknown though it favored long vowels and stuttered consonants much like the sounds he made when he burned his fingers on the coal stovei could never entirely assure myself that i would be protected by divine will from the serpents bite some in the congregation obviously had not been there was sarah prestley for instance whose right arm had swollen up black with venom and had to be amputated by williams fords physician but i will not dwell on that the point is that while i disliked snakes i was not especially afraid of them as julian was and i could not help admiring his restraint for what was writhing in the shadows nearby was a nest of snakes that had been aroused by the heat of the fire i should add that it was not uncommon for these collapsed ruins to be infested with snakes mice spiders and poisonous insects death by bite or sting was one of the hazards routinely faced by tipmen including concussion blood poisoning and accidental burial the snakes after the tipmen ceased work for the winter must have crept into this chasm anticipating an undisturbed hibernation of which we and the reservist had unfortunately deprived them the reservistwho came back a little unsteadily from his necessarieshad not yet noticed these prior tenants he seated himself on his crate scowled at us and studiously refilled his pipe if he discharges all five shots from his rifle julian whispered then we have a chance of overcoming him or of recovering our own weapons but adam no talking there the reservist mumbled you must remember your fathers advice julian finished i said keep quiet julian cleared his throat and addressed the reservist directly since the time for action had obviously arrived sir i have to draw your attention to something what would that be my little draft dodger im afraid were not alone in this terrible place not alone the reservist said casting his eyes about him nervously then he recovered and squinted at julian i dont see any other persons i dont mean persons but vipers said julian vipers in other wordssnakes at this the reservist started again his mind perhaps still slightly confused by the effects of the hemp smoke then he sneered and said go on you cant pull that one on me im sorry if you think im joking for there are at least a dozen snakes advancing from the shadows and one of them julians sense of timing was exquisite perhaps as a result of his theatrical inclinations is about to achieve intimacy with your right boot hah the reservist said but he could not help glancing in the indicated direction where one of the serpentsa fat and lengthy examplehad indeed lifted its head and was sampling the air above his bootlace the effect was immediate and left no more time for planning the reservist leapt from his seat on the wooden crate uttering oaths and danced backward at the same time attempting to bring his rifle to his shoulder and confront the threat he discovered to his dismay that it was not a question of one snake but of dozens and he compressed the trigger of the weapon reflexively the resulting shot went wild the bullet impacted near the main nest of the creatures causing them to scatter with astonishing speed like a box of loaded springsunfortunately for the hapless reservist who was directly in their path he cursed vigorously and fired four more times some of the shots careened harmlessly at least one obliterated the midsection of the lead serpent which knotted around its own wound like a bloody rope now adam julian shouted and i stood up thinking my fathers advice my father was a taciturn man and most of his advice had involved the practical matter of running the estates stables i hesitated a moment in confusion while julian advanced toward the captive rifles dancing among the surviving snakes like a dervish the reservist recovering somewhat raced in the same direction and then i recalled the only advice of my fathers that i had ever shared with julian grasp it where its neck ought to be behind the head ignore the tail however it may thrashand crack its skull hard and often enough to subdue it and so i did just thatuntil the threat was neutralized julian meanwhile recovered the weapons and came away from the infested area of the dig he looked with some astonishment at the reservist who was slumped at my feet bleeding from his scalp which i had cracked hard and often adam he said when i spoke of your fathers advicei meant the snakes the snakes several of them still twined about the dig but i reminded myself that julian knew very little about the nature and variety of reptiles theyre only corn snakes i explained once confined to the southeast corn snakes have spread north with the warming climate i have read that certain of the secular ancients used to keep them as petsyet another instance of our ancestors willful perversity theyre big but theyre not venomous julian his eyes gone large absorbed this information then he looked at the crumpled form of the reservist again have you killed him well i hope not i said we made a new camp in a less populated part of the ruins and kept a watch on the road and at dawn we saw a single horse and rider approaching from the west it was sam godwin julian hailed him waving his arms sam came closer and looked with some relief at julian and then speculatively at me i blushed thinking of how i had interrupted him at his prayers however unorthodox those prayers might have been from a purely christian perspective and how poorly i had reacted to my discovery of his true religion but i said nothing and sam said nothing and relations between us seemed to have been regularized since i had demonstrated my loyalty or foolishness by riding to julians aid it was christmas morning i supposed that did not mean anything in particular to julian or sam but i was poignantly aware of the date the sky was blue again but a squall had passed during the dark hours of the morning and the snow lay round about deep and crisp and even even the ruins of lundsford were transformed into something softedged and oddly beautiful i was amazed at how simple it was for nature to cloak corruption in the garb of purity and make it peaceful but it would not be peaceful for long and sam said so there are troops behind me as we speak word came by wire from new york not to let julian escape we cant linger here more than a moment where will we go julian asked its impossible to ride much farther east theres no forage for the animals and precious little water sooner or later well have to turn south and make a connection with the railroad or the turnpike its going to be short rations and hard riding for a while im afraid and if we do make good our escape well have to assume new identities well be little better than draft dodgers or labor refugees and i expect well have to pass some time among that hard crew at least until we reach new york city we can find friends in new york it was a plan but it was a large and lonesome one and my heart sank at the prospect we have a prisoner julian told his mentor and he took sam back into the excavated ruins to explain how we had spent the night the reservist was there hands tied behind his back a little groggy from the punishment i had inflicted on him but well enough to open his eyes and scowl julian and sam spent a little time debating how to deal with this encumbrance we could not of course take him with us the question was how to return him to his superiors without endangering ourselves unnecessarily it was a debate to which i could contribute nothing so i took a little slip of paper from my backsatchel and a pencil and wrote a letter it was addressed to my mother since my father was without the art of literacy you will no doubt have noticed my absence i wrote it saddens me to be away from homeespecially at this time i write on christmas day but i hope you will be consoled with the knowledge that i am all right and not in any immediate danger this was a lie depending on how you define immediate but a kindly one i reasoned in any case i would not have been able to remain in williams ford since i could not have escaped the draft for long even if i postponed my military service for some few more months the conscription drive is in earnest the war in labrador must be going badly it was inevitable that we should be separated as much as i mourn for my home and all its comforts and it was all i could do not to decorate the page with a vagrant tear please accept my best wishes and my gratitude for everything you and father have done for me i will write again as soon as it is practicable which may not be immediately trust in the knowledge that i will pursue my destiny faithfully and with every christian virtue you have taught me god bless you in the coming and every year that was not enough to say but there wasnt time for more julian and sam were calling for me i signed my name and added as a postscript please tell father that i value his advice and that it has already served me usefully yrs etc once again adam youve written a letter sam observed as he came to rush me to my horse but have you given any thought to how you might mail it i confessed that i had not the reservist can carry it said julian who had already mounted his horse the reservist was also mounted but with his hands tied behind him as it was sams final conclusion that we should set him loose with the horse headed west where he would encounter more troops before very long he was awake but as i have said sullen and he barked im nobodys damned mailman i addressed the message and julian took it and tucked it into the reservists saddlebag despite his youth and despite the slightly dilapidated condition of his hair and clothing julian sat tall in the saddle i had never thought of him as highborn until that moment when an aspect of command seemed to enter his body and his voice he said to the reservist we treated you kindly the reservist uttered an oath be quiet you were injured in the conflict but we took you prisoner and weve treated you in a more gentlemanly fashion than we were when the conditions were reversed i am a comstockat least for the momentand i wont be spoken to crudely by an infantryman at any price youll deliver this boys message and youll do it gratefully the reservist was clearly awed by the assertion that julian was a comstockhe had been laboring under the assumption that we were mere village runawaysbut he screwed up his courage and said why should i because its the christian thing to do julian said and if this argument with my uncle is ever settled the power to remove your head from your shoulders may well reside in my hands does that make sense to you soldier the reservist allowed that it did and so we rode out that christmas morning from the ruins in which the tipmen had discovered the history of mankind in space which still resided in my backsatchel vagrant memory of a halfforgotten past my mind was a confusion of ideas and anxieties but i found myself recalling what julian had said long ago it now seemed about dna and how it aspired to perfect replication but progressed by remembering itself imperfectly it might be true i thought because our lives were like thattime itself was like that every moment dying and pregnant with its own distorted reflection today was christmas which julian claimed had once been a pagan holiday dedicated to sol invictus or some other roman god but which had evolved into the familiar celebration of the present and was no less dear because of it i imagined i could hear the christmas bells ringing from the dominion hall at wiliams ford though that was impossible for we were miles away and not even the sound of a cannon shot could carry so far across the prairie it was only memory speaking and maybe this logic was true of people too maybe i was already becoming an inexact echo of what i had been just days before maybe the same was true of julian already something hard and uncompromising had begun to emerge from his gentle featuresthe first manifestation of a new julian a freshly evolved julian called forth by his violent departure from williams ford or slouching toward new york to be born but that was all philosophy and not much use and i kept quiet about it as we spurred our horses in the direction of the railroad toward the rude and squalling

assumption that i was julians intimate companion in a physical sense whereupon they undertook to cure me of my deviant habits in the most direct fashion i was happy to cooperate with these cures and they were successful every time the illusion was quite striking when the players were professional but their lapses could be equally astonishing julian once recounted to me a new york movie production of wm shakespeares hamlet in which a player had come to the theater inebriated causing the unhappy denmark to seem to exclaim sea of troublesan unprintable oathi have troubles of my own with more obscenities and much inappropriate bellringing and vulgar whistling until an understudy could be hurried out to replace him not a talent that was born fullyformed i should add only two years
