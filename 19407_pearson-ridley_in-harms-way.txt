ridley pearson in harms way the fourth book in the walt fleming series for louise marsh acknowledgments special thanks to sheriff walt femling his wife jenny and their family and to the residents of the wood river valley glancing out the windshield and beyond the fourlane concrete bridge fiona spotted a log with flailing arms human arms a childs arms struggling up through the rivers rushing water held down by a tangle of branches fiona instinctively reached out to block her passenger from hitting the dash while simultaneously slamming on the brakes her subaru skidded drifting into the breakdown lane just past the bridge she set the emergency brake and released her seat belt in a single motion her feet already on the asphalt she crossed four lanes of busy traffic amid a flurry of horns and the highpitched cries of biting rubber over it all she heard her passenger kira calling out her name and she glanced back to see kira hoisting her camera bag high in the air fiona gestured her back but kira ignored it and pressed forward darting through gaps in the traffic more tire squeals a man crudely cursed from his black pickup as he avoided kira by inches careening off the roadway and onto the dirt shoulder throwing up twin rooster tails fiona ignored him scampering down the bank and waded into the shallow painfully cold water at the rivers edge the fistsized slippery round stones of the river bottom made her look drunk as she charged into the more swiftly moving kneedeep water she glanced left timing the approach of the floating logs preparing to dive the limbs of the first of four logs struck her knocking her off balance and she fell they scraped across her back tearing her shirt and dragging her down under she struggled out of the grasp of the tangled branches and gasped for air as she resurfaced finding her balance she dodged the next log and the next barreling toward her came the final tree the one with the human arms shed seen upstream it bore down on her a tongue of torn wood aimed like a lance she no longer saw the arms thrashing for an instant she wondered if shed seen them at all the approaching tree was well over a foot thick and likely weighed hundreds of pounds driven by the force of june runoff it would hit her like a battering ram kira now at rivers edge again screamed fiona no from the same direction fiona heard a splashthe driver of the pickup now thundering out toward her the wide spread of pine boughs seemed aimed to sweep her off her feet once again distracted shed lost her chance to move out of the way she counted down in her head ten yards five yards she drew a lungful of air and dove the four feet to the river bottom reached out and whiteknuckled a mossy large flat rock keeping herself down the limbs broomed over her snagging her hair and yanking her head up and back a chunk of hair tore loose she screamed bubbles most of her shirt was torn off she onehanded the rock protecting her face as the remaining limbs scraped raw the flesh of her forearm in her blurred vision appeared a childs pale bare foot fiona let go of the rock grabbed the ankle with both hands and followed up the leg to the childs waist planting her feet in the maze of rocks on the river bottom and propelling herself up out of the water and into the snarl of tree branches the tree limbs whipped and dug into her arms and face demanding she release the child but she would not let go at last the tree passed and fiona opened her eyes to see a little girls terrified eyes gazing back at her the girl blinked and coughed and fiona felt tears spring to her eyes alive the driver of the pickup appeared lunging through the coursing water and extending an arm to fiona who held on to the crying child like life itself a smattering of applause arose from a small gathering of onlookers camera phones extended all of whom had pulled to the side of the road to help behind them towered the greening mountains that surrounded ketchum and sun valley above them the azure sky that had helped name this place fiona held the child high in an effort to screen her own face hoping to keep herself out of sight of the cameras the girls crying was steady nowa joyous sound as fiona briefly lost her balance to the uneven river bottom the girl clutched her with an unexpected force i wont let go fiona promised in the distance a siren wailed an ambulance from st lukes hospital less than a mile away someone had called more applause as the pickup driver led her to dry ground and fiona dropped to her knees never relaxing her embrace of the child who in turn pressed herself closer to her rescuer youre okay youre okay fiona whispered into the matted hair as a dozen people rushed down the embankment and the pickup driver called out to give them room more cameras fired off shots including her own currently in kiras hands too many cameras to ever control she could imagine the images already being sent over the internet one moment anonymous in a sleepy idaho town the next out there helpless to do anything about it she understood that this moment represented the saving of one life and quite possibly the loss of another her own walt fleming entered st lukes emergency room to the stares his sheriffs uniform typically provoked reaction was never neutral and it affected him to varying degrees people were both afraid of and impressed by police everyone was guilty of some infraction no matter how minor it came down to how much of it they wore on their sleeves kenshaw he barked at the nurse behind the registration desk never slowing a step despite his concern for the wellbeing of the child fished from the big wood river he was impatient and tense about the condition of the childs rescuer observation two the nurse called down the hall after him the walls were beige the ceiling lighting intense the complex aromamedicinal disinfectant bitter coffeevaguely nauseating he ran did not walk to observation he yanked back the privacy curtain not waiting for permission oh damn he barked out unintentionally upon seeing her he stepped inside and drew the curtain closed behind him a nurse tending to an iv bag turned and was about to let loose on the intruder when sight of the uniform stopped her leave us a minute walt told the nurse as he met eyes with fiona im fine fiona said yeah i can see that she looked horrible the nurse gave walt the onceover on her way out she clearly had some choice words to offer but contained herself fiona wore a blue and white hospital gowna loosely woven yellow blanket covered her from the waist down her face and arms were badly scratched both carrying some butterfly bandages her scalp had been shaved in a spot about the size of a quarter over her left ear and was dressed with a small bandage on her upper left shoulder he saw the glow of a bruise forming they took some xrays she said against my better judgment i really am fine its nothing i realize i must look like hell and you have no right to be you look good he said hed rarely paid her any kind of compliment about her looks it hung in the air uncomfortably alive is good he added fiona would never win any beauty contests but in his opinion shed turn heads decades into the future her kind of tomboyish looks didnt need a surgeons knife to remain interesting she changed her looks frequently using ball caps or haircuts it was impossible to pin down her age but she was over twentyeight and under thirtyfive if he was any judge she took a lot of sun from her hours as a fishing guide but she wore it well not leathery the way some of the ketchum women aged in a strange way her wounds added to her attractiveness as if mystery were all shed ever lacked given the options whatd you do fight a bear to get to her a fir tree i think it was lots of nasty branches that kind of goes hand in hand where trees are concernedthe branches thing i heard the kids fine so im told youre a hero i may need your help with that she said sit walt drew a rolling stool up to the side of the bed and rested his hands on the beds stainless steel frame hed been reaching for her hand but stopped himself she took his hand in hers stretching the iv to do so is this what you wanted yeah he absentmindedly glanced toward the pulled curtain she let go of his hand its all right she said sensing his reluctance and misinterpreting it as embarrassment he regretted losing her touch regretted having looked behind him regretted that he couldnt see a few seconds ahead to know when to keep from doing something stupid the iv she said following his eyes is nothing but a precaution they have to charge you for something the departments insurance will cover it nonsense she said i wasnt on the job youre always on the job im a civilian employeepart time at thatwho serves at the pleasure of the sheriff that doesnt come with benefits last i looked well you didnt look carefully enough you serve at my pleasure and its my pleasure that our policy will cover it have you ever seen the bill from an emergency room visit ill withhold my objections until i know what were talking about thats better so the oh damn was that for my face general condition he said the hospital gown lying there like that your face i like your face no complaints the doctor said it wont scar some will heal faster than others but theyre nothing to worry about you saved a life he said i need you to go to bat for me regarding pam pam was fionas other boss the editorowner of the mountain express ketchumsun valleys weekly because there were a lot of people taking pictures heroic moments tend to get that i dont want my picture to run i doubt youll have any say in the matter for once your modesty the way you stalk about is going to lose out to the needs of the masses pam will run it on the front page i would think she cant fiona said defiantly but she will no matter how much you object its a giveaway the front page hardly matters a good front page the more copies you give away the more you can charge for your ads next time whose side are you on i need you walt its false modesty you saved a life my picture cannot run in that paper her tone and demeanor had changed the physical pain and shock behind her eyes had given way to anger o k a y maybe we should talk about this i cant thats not going to happen i just need you to speak with her to convince her and you need me to do this because because im her employee im your employee employer to employer i need you to talk to her and make up anything you want any reason you want just make sure no photo runs if you were trying to win my curiosity youve succeeded he said what the hell is going on she seemed ready to tell him something but couldnt bring herself to do it talk to me he said his own voice now sharing her concern he caught a glimpse of himself in one of the stainless steel fixtures he had a wide face slightly boyish with kind eyes his hair was short and graying prematurely his exwife had once advised him to use product on his hair but hed resisted he was suddenly revisiting that idea i need you to convince her not to run any photos im a civilian employee of your officepart timeand you want to protect my privacy make up anything you like theres a little thing called freedom of the press which is why it cant come from me from you it carries a lot more weight my office cant make that kind of request without being able to back it up ive never made such a request and there have been plenty of times i didnt want a photo to run weve blacked out eyes a few times i could ask her for thatbut id have to have a reason thatll just cause more of a sensation fiona said thats worse than just running a picture youre not giving me a lot of options here cant i get a favor with no strings attached please ask her not to run my picture something had been nagging at walt that now made a world of sense again he voiced it without taking proper time to think through the consequences this paranoia of yours it doesnt happen to have anything to do with your always being on the other end of the camera does it her eyes grew intense if what hed seen a few seconds before was anger this was now rage you take the pictures to make sure no one takes them of you is that it could that be any more insidious please stop she said the nurse knocked on the frame im coming in there she announced ill talk to her about it walt said amazed by the relief that washed over fionas wounded face and the warmth of her hand as she once again touched his beatrice walts threeyearold irish spaniel drooled onto fionas face on the front page of the mountain express and then turned to lick walt who remained trapped behind the wheel of the jeep walt pushed her into the backseat and told her to stay he brushed the drool off the newspaper but too late fiona carrying the halfdrowned child from the river now had a teardrop beard that ran to her waist he pulled the jeep cherokee into the driveway behind his deputys cruiser the call of a bear attack had come in thirty minutes earlier the property owners insurance would want the police to sign off on the cause of the damageit wasnt the first time for walt garbage cans or vehicles with windows down were the most common targets of a wayward bear rarely did the bear actually break into a kitchen and shred the place this walt had to see fionas subaru was parked beneath a portable basketball backboard shed been called in to document the damage sprinklers ran in the front yard creating a haze behind which the densely green mountains rose magnificently every view here was worthy of a postcard the berkholder residence a squarefoot stucco home occupied the back corner of a fiveacre parcel at the end of a quartermile semiprivate drive their only neighborsthe engletonslived a half mile away fiona who served as the engletons caretaker lived in their guesthouse meaning she could have walked over here he tossed the mountain express onto the car floor annoyed by the reminder of his own failed attempt to keep fionas picture from appearing in it he feared there would be hell to pay he cracked a window for beatrice told her to stay and climbed out in no great hurry to reach the front door thankfully his phone rang stopping him alongside the chick chick chick of the sprinkler guns he instantly recognized the callers number dad you dont have to sound so surprised pleasantly surprised is more like it its been a while is all has it i suppose it has honestly i dont remember thats the point to what do i owe walt said ive been approached as an intermediary i suppose you could say a detective with crimes against persons over here in seattle the guy knew i was your father and got hold of me through a mutual friend brent staffer a bureau buddy of mine okay jerry never failed to remind his son hed been a special agent for the fbi and that walt had missed his own chance to serve a higher calling he was also fond of reminding his son that he read the local ketchum paper tracked the stories involving walts department and liked to rub it in when those jobs involved clearing a band of sheep from the highway or serving motorcade duty for a rock star on a weekend ski trip hes trying to keep things low profile very low profile because of the personalities involved doesnt want so much as the record of a phone call you get the point i do walt dealt with plenty of the rich and famousmore than his father knew he could call you on your cell number or maybe your home hed rather not call the shop i mentioned that i knew you used that internet thing skype thats the one said he could do it that way if you wanted did he say what its about its a homicide hes a homicide dick boldt weve talked about him before we have walt said in the world of homicide lou boldt was a living legendable to leap tall buildings in a single bound he had a career clearance rate of eighty percent when the nearest competition was in the midsixties hed not only caught the cross killer but the serial killers copycat just the idea of speaking with lou boldt excited himbeing involved with a case of boldts would be rare air id be happy to speak with him walt said thought that was how youd feel but didnt want to put words into your mouth thats a first im pretty sure i know the homicide jerry fleming said just guessing but theres one been in the intelligencer off and on for a week now makes sense that boldt would have caught it woman assaulted beaten to death nothing sexualat least not thats been reported reason it stays in the papers is both because of the beating she tookit was really bad waltand because she had a history of dating people in professional sports a call girl thats almost how it reads but no i dont think so im sure boldt can tell you dating as in living with a guy for a few months basketball football didnt seem to matter she liked em big and strong liked the cameras and nightclubs papers rumored an affair with one of the team owners but backed off it pretty quickly she obviously got around and then she gets herself pulverized and of course everyones thinking its one of the jocks that kind of testosteronecharged hammering those bucks can deliver but me walt asked i dont know i was asked if youd take the call if youd keep it quiet and i told him how i was sure you would but id ask absolutely walt said thats all i needed how are you walt asked ill give him the green light and you can take it from there maybe this skype thing keeps it the quietest he can call me tonight ill leave it up but how are you dad hows it going hes an important man over here you know that right i know that walt said he wasnt going to ask again his father knew as much let me know if i can help out with it jerry said the line clicked dad walt looked at the face of his phone disconnected no kidding he was thinking as he pocketed the phone walt knocked and let himself in through the front door a cameras flash caught his eye and he moved in that direction through a living room atop a spongy carpet the asian furniture contrasted with big canvases of contemporary art he headed toward the strobing light with his fathers description of the assault in his mind halfexpecting to see a bloodied body beaten to a pulp on the kitchen floor though his conscious mind knew betterit had been called in as a bear attack he was there to sign off on that assessment for the sake of any future insurance inquiry springtime brought the brown bears out of hibernation they came down to the valley floor looking for water and were typically seduced by the aroma of garbage cans once in a great while one would find its way into a garage or even more rarely a kitchen like this one and shred the place walt whistled seeing the extent of the damage fiona glanced in his direction but her eyes hardened and she went right back to her photography he wanted to sort out their problems but kept to business heading over to deputy tommy brandon who was on the phone brandon hung up immediately he wore xxl everything a tenhour beard that would have taken walt six days to grow and a smugness that came with being the goto guy his whole life walt wasnt sure when brandons affair with his wife had begun only that because of it brandon owed him something beyond the apology hed never gotten gail owed him attorneys fees by his way of thinking but hed never see anything she owed their twin elevenyearold daughters much more but that would have to wait until the girls were older and realized the depth and degree of their mothers selfishness for now business as usual so he asked brandon picnic time at the berkholders brandon answered the kitchen cabinets hung open their contents strewn across the countertops cookies coffee grounds tea bags crackers broken jars tomato sauce jams picklesan extraordinary mess the refrigerator hung partially open with a slushy pile of leftovers vegetables and meats at its feet as if it had vomited its contents onto the reclaimed barn wood flooring the freezer oozed frozen lemonade orange juice and ice cream in a colorful creamy waterfall that caught each glass shelf walt was no stranger to bear raids his father ridiculed him for his responding to them as part of his job did you get the claw marks on yes fiona snapped still refusing to look directly at him on the cabinets and the butcher block both the spill beneath the fridge got it she answered just for the record walt said i lobbied her hard i thought id made not hard enough fiona said bewildered by the exchange brandon tried to slip away but walt caught him access walt asked his deputy brandon led walt down a short hallway to a fourcar garage musta been left open though the owner claims otherwise looks like the thing checked out the dog doorthe frame of the dog door had imploded into the hallwayand maybe the door came open in the process we found it like this walt studied the door jamb especially its metal hardware and then did the same on the broken dog door he looked into the whistleclean garageabout the size of the first floor of his houseand its shipdeckgray paint he descended the three steps and went down on one knee getting the light right if she hasnt done so already he said have fiona get shots of the door hardware and some angles of the garage floor will do but why does the insurance care about the garage floor brandon asked you ever been to one of these before walt said sure open your eyes and use your head brandon finished for him quoting a waltism exactly brandon studied the door hardware and didnt have the courage to ask what he was supposed to be looking for fur walt said without looking back as he kept to the very edge of the garage floor animal hair a tight space like that dog door we should have seen some caught in the screws or hinges he worked steadily toward the garage doors yeah okay he sounded confused when was the last time you saw a bear pass over strawberry jam broken glass jar or not ah and since when doesnt a bear claw a door trying to get it open it claws the cabinetin the middle of the cabinetbut not the door but there are claw marks brandon protested check out the size of them walt said a bear that big doesnt tiptoe through a door and he doesnt go through all the food and get back out without leaving tracks walt indicated the clean garage floor a flying bear maybe okay brandon sounded unconvinced lets work the evidence walt said chances are this was a twolegged bear a what and id like to know why he went to all this trouble with his suit jacket waiting for him on the back of a chair inside the house and a seattle seahawks apron protecting his shirt and tie walt pulled the barbecued pork loin off the grill beatrice drooling at his feet it had been a long poisonously quiet week he expected to see fiona later that night i dont want dead pig emily said her arms crossed her elevenyearolds face locked in determination dont do this walt said collecting his wares onto the cutting board this is your dinner you like bacon dont you yeah bacon is pork same as this then why cant i have bacon its the same thing sister nikki said because this is what i cooked for dinner walt answered i thought youd like it its your favorite is not i like it nikki said you dont have to eat it em but no ice cream with lisa if you dont eat your dinner thats not fair nikki rolled her eyes she didnt understand her sister any more than walt did it is what it is no dinner no ice cream i had planned for the three of you to bike over to fifteen flavors if youd rather not he managed to kick open the door while carrying the board beatrice emily and nikki followed in that order lisa charged through the front door apologizing for being late walt conferred with her about the evenings rules including bedtime and the ice cream trip all unnecessary since lisa knew more about the girls routine than he did you look fancy she said as he got the apron off and the jacket on my one and only suit it suits you ha ha its the advocates dinner very swishy he hugged his daughters good night getting barely anything out of emily and heaved a sigh as he closed the front door behind him an early summer evening was a piece of heaven in hailey and this one was no exception the sun tracked surprisingly high in the sky for seven pm skirting the tops of the valleys western mountains its golden light taking on a magical ethereal quality neighborhood lawn mowers ticked the smell of burning charcoal hung in the air some kids rode by in a pack of speeding bicycles as he drove north walt composed something to say to fiona something to try to break the ice shed sent him an email with photographs of the bear damageno message hed called twice on the pretense of a followup but shed failed to call back it wasnt the first time fiona had gone offgridshe occasionally disappeared for days at a time unreachable unpredictablebut this time it felt personal sun valleys limelight room located in the sun valley inn was a fourstar convention hall that had recently undergone a multimilliondollar renovation it was filled with lavishly appointed tables for three hundred dinner guests a low stage and a lectern two projection screens displayed powerpoint slide shows of women at work mixed with bullet lists of the accomplishments of the nonprofit established to support the battered and abused each table of ten had a sponsor walt was the guest of a retired general who thankfully had picked up the tab for the entire table fiona sat to walts left with kira tulivich next to fiona twentyoneyearold kira adorable and gorgeous in a summer dress had been the victim of a savage assault two years earlier and an important witness for walt scheduled to give one of the evenings two keynote addresses kira looked both nervous and out of sorts as she studied the cutlery and tried to decide which fork to use walt elbowed fiona in the ribs and gestured for her to rescue her charge fiona directed kira to the outside fork and relief washed over the young womans face thank you fiona whispered nice to hear your voice walt said between bites we can discuss this later she said but we wont will we because you wont return my calls later i fought hard for you not hard enough i knowyou told me thatbut as hard as i dared as sheriff i explained my delicate relationship with the paper he ate some more salad and watched her move hers around the plate you never did tell me why it mattered so much the way youve treated me i assume it was more than just modesty or vanity but for the life of me i cant figure it out for the life of you no she said but if it was so important whats done is done she said cutting him off doesnt feel that way no it doesnt does it why so angry am i i dont mean to be seriously its not with you of course it is not meant to be i dont believe that he said he looked up every face at the table was looking at them listening to them the others immediately returned to their food and they faked conversation but walt realized theyd all heard every word given the other guests at the table it meant that most of the valley would know word for word everything said it was the blessing and the curse of the wood river valley and something that all residents willingly suffered as a tradeoff to the lifestyle during the entrée fiona coached kira on her talk and finally the moment arrived when kira was introduced we are so grateful to have with us tonight the evenings host began a young woman of extraordinary courage poise and intelligence kira tulivich turned to advocates following an ordeal that not only tested her own will to live but resulted in the apprehension of domestic terrorists by our own sheriff walt fleming and put an end to a terrorist cell operating within our state hers is a story of strength determination and recovery and we are honored to hear from her tonight wont you please join me in welcoming her formal introduction was overpowered by the thunderous applause as the guests spontaneously rose to their feet kiras story was already well known this was her first public appearance since the incident and the applause carried her from the table to the lectern some of the women openly weeping it took her three tries to quiet the crowd finally people sat kira cleared her throat with a sip of water and began her short and emotional speech halfway through the speech walt felt fingernails scratching at his fist beneath the skirt of the tablecloth as fionas hand found its way into his he looked over at her but she never took her watery eyes off the stage he missed the rest of the talk his mind racing and unable to light on any single thought except that life brought unexpected pleasures and made it worth getting up in the morning for the first time at such an event he hoped the keynote speech would go on for hours fiona withdrew her hand from his and grabbed her mobile phone vibrating from within her purse as she went to stop it he saw her eyes light upon the screen and consternation grip her face she slipped the phone back into her purse but their connection was gone she didnt even seem to be hearing kiras speech you okay he whispered she looked at him attempting but failing to wipe the crease from her brow she nodded kira said from the lectern i think the main thing i want to say is thanks to the advocates the physical healing was the easy part as it turned out but the she stopped abruptly locked in a stare walt turned back following her line of sight to one of the halls two center doors just closing his sheriffs instinct was to jump up and hurry into the hallway to see who was out there but he kept to his seat kira then searched and her eyes found fiona who nodded back at her reassuringly some heads turned in the direction of their table kiras eyes finally fell back to her notes and she continued speaking but the emotional healing the real healing she continued well it really does take a village walt turned and reached out to both reassure and congratulate fiona for her mentoring of the girl but the chair stood empty fiona gone eyes darting around the room assuming fiona had gone up to greet kira as she left the stage he found his vision blocked as an appreciative audience rose to its feet walt stood tempted to climb up onto his chair cursing his fivefootseven frame instead he seized the moment ducking out into the hallway moving toward the restroomsthinking fiona might have gone therebut then upon seeing a pair of bellmen outside approached them a woman walt inquired creamcolored top black purse maybe left just now didnt see her dont i know you the other bellman asked walt ignored it wondering if the kid had been in trouble or just knew his picture from the local paper how about a guy walt said big guy yeah said the first bellman a couple came outthe exodus was under wayand the guest handed the second boy his valet claim stub the kid took off at a run yes the big guy walt said trying to hold the other boys attention the rush of people wanting their cars was suffocating walt presented his sheriffs shield held down low the boy caught sight of it the big guy he repeated came and went wasnt inside more than like two minutes how big solid snake said the kid you know metal gear sons of liberty reading walts bewilderment he added psp gaming uhh huge stupid huge ridiculous a valet stub stabbed at the kid and he accepted it sorry he said to walt he took off walt fought upcurrent against the departing guests and reentered the halfempty conference hall he located his host and thanked him he made his way toward the stage and awaited his turn with kira you seen fiona kira asked him immediately guests broke in congratulating her she shook hands with several of them walt wanted a private moment with her but wasnt going to get it restroom he said it was the only explanation that made any sense fiona wasnt leaving kira in the lurch you paused he said you were looking toward the doors she shook her head as if by doing so she might convince him it hadnt happened please he said roy coats she said lowering her voice and naming the man who had raped her a man walt had watched die just a flashback they still happen why it had to be right then but i suppose it was because i was talking about it i dont talk about it much did he look like coats walt asked no kira answered it was him ms tulivich kira a woman wearing too much perfume pushed in front of walt and he lost his moment he turned and looked back toward the center doors imagining how it must have felt for her to see an image of roy coats listening in on her recovery speech he lived with his own demons memories of bloody murder scenes he couldnt shake traffic accidents his killing a man in the backcountry an incident with his father when hed been nine years old things he didnt talk about he envied her ability to talk to counselors to free the demons to break the silence of those terrors people milled around him and for a moment it was almost as if he wasnt there he might have been a table or chair they were dodging hed internalized hed sunk beneath the surface and was kicking like mad to reach the air above fiona wasnt returning he knew it without checking for her he couldnt imagine what would have taken her out of the room at that of all moments she had practically adopted kira had installed her into the engletons main house as her associate caretaker abandoning her in the last few lines of her talk seemed impossible unthinkable or he wondered had fiona also seen whoever had been at the back of the room he reached for his phone and called her it jumped straight to voice mailthe phone was turned off he had a vision of her reacting to whatever message shed read on her phone had the messagesome kind of personal emergencycaused her to leave should he stop by her place on his way home or was that overstepping his bounds given that shed shut off her phone he slowed the jeep at the highway entrance to the private road leading to the engleton and berkholder properties he didnt need an excuse to check up on her but she was also a woman who appreciated her space and in the end he gave it to her reluctantly tie loosened his suit coat slung over the back of a diningroom chair walt enabled the skype software as he had for each of the past eight evenings and then checked on the girls he found lisa asleep atop nikkis bed covers a book in her lap in her late thirties lisa still had the look of a woman much younger and the energy to go with it catching her in a catnap was a rarity he gently shook her awake the intimacy of the moment not escaping him he hadnt felt the warmth of a sleeping woman in a very long time walt nearly gave nikki a goodnight kiss but decided against it as she was such a light sleeper he turned around and instead planted a kiss onto emilys cheek she could sleep through an earthquake lisa hopped up and adjusted the blinds and shut the door as they left together any problems walt asked smooth as silk did nikki say anything about gail didnt mention her not to me that was a first nikki was obsessed with using their marriage separation as an excuse then you should be around more often he said realizing too late a man didnt say that to a happily married woman it takes time theyll never get over it nikki she may not even get past it sure she will maybe ems hiding it all but she doesnt seem affected shes moved on i think nikkis the one to watch for sure whats the schedule this week theres a city council thing on wednesday he said and a search and rescue exercise on thursday a chamber event on friday night that im hoping to duck wednesday and thursday are no problem and ill keep friday open just in case she paused listen walt i have a favor to ask name it he said its a big favor she cautioned let me be the judge of that he said my neighbors daughter shes fifteen eight weeks pregnant shes blaming it or attributing it or whatever to her boyfriend i dont know the boy but ive seen him and he looks like a decent kid it happens do you want to make sure he steps up walt offered he wasnt familiar with the look on her face shed been helping with the girls since just after their birth well before the separation shed learned to read his moods knew when to keep her distance when to try to get him talking hed learned that nothing ruffled lisa that she was one of those people who moved from good to better and back to good she didnt complain she didnt back down but somehow she kept herself and everyone around her on an even keel her current expression of perplexity concern and fear was something new to him or maybe not he said when she failed to speak i think its the stepfathers she wouldnt meet his eyes her vision locked onto his neck oh damn lisa nodded gravely we have cats she said as if that explained something one of them this is a long time ago last summer sometime wouldnt come in one night and i spotted her next door and went over to get her it was very late well past midnight i heard the girl her voice for sure not her mothers engaged is that how you put it in the act and not happy about it my kitty was under that window as if she as if that voice that girls voice wouldnt let her leave i didnt mean to stay i wanted to pick up clawsy and get out of there but something wouldnt let me leave not voyeuristic i dont mean that but a need to help he covered her cries tried to keep her voice down dont look at me like that a woman knows the difference believe me i couldnt see in the window and the curtain was pulled but in between her sobsrhythmic sobsa hand smacked up onto the glass a big hand a mans hand a hand wearing a wedding ring it was not the hand of an eighteenyearold boy the look had not left her face but her eyes had teared up and presently she pursed her lips and dried her eyes on her shoulders and shes blaming the boyfriend he said so two lives go down the drain and the one that should walks away theres a nineyearold sister and a fiveyearold after her hes got them lined up walt hes got himself taken care of for a long time a paternity test would do it he said as if hed ever allow that to happen there are ways walt said i havent wanted to ask you but theres a point where dont be ridiculous it would be criminal not to act thats eventually what i came around to write down the names for me ill see what i can do he led her toward the dining room from where an unfamiliar chirping noise was coming youre getting a call lisa said skype we have an account too she hurried to the room and pointed out a window on his computer screen you want to answer it please he said she clicked the mouse scribbled down two names and waved goodbye as she let herself out the back door the window on the computers screen showed a big face severe and intense with wide eyes and a s flattop haircut going gray the face reminded walt of a home plate umpire lou boldt the voice was not as gruff as walt expected from such a face low but softspoken walt fleming good to meet you thanks for letting me give you a shout no problem i have a situation here my father gave me the cliffs notes the deceaseds name is caroline vetta twentynine boldt ran through what he knew of the homicide and the deceaseds connection to prominent seattle sports figures how can i help this girl was beat up badly a person can make the case that its a crime of passion thats why the lid is on it because she was friendly with some very high rollers and no one wants any false accusations made tricky for you yes it is hard to get an interview with these guys without nine lawyers involved the media gets hold of it and its going to look like weve got a suspect and we dont need that would you like me to interview someone is that it someone over here walt sensed boldt wasnt going to ask him outright walt was going to have to offer is there a connection to my county two connections boldt said and to answer your question no i wouldnt dump that on you the first guy is marty boatwright walt took a deep breath oh he said owned the seahawks until the sale eight years ago met caroline when she was twentytwo some say that acquaintance continued until a few months ago dont know him personally have worked with his people some hes generous in the community over here throws the kind of parties that sheiks and kings attend can you get to him maybe i know his head of security the second is vince wynn the sports agent he has a place here i thought everyone had a place there boldt said when he laughed it was a big laugh and the webcam shook his image danced on the screen what is that nickname for sun valley glitter gulch walt said thats the one wynn cant spend much time here didnt he just sign that pitcher to the mets four years a hundred mil and wynn gets a pile of that for a few phone calls and dinners id take it and he got a piece of caroline walt asked he was here in seattle the night it went down he entertained some clients at a club she dated onemaybe more than oneof his football clients supposedly thats how they met and maybe she worked her way up the food chain this woman my guess is were going to find out there was commerce involved a courier a call girl i dont know yet but the way she moved around between these people its complicated its not normal even in these circles as to what the nature of this call is boldt said im thinking my brass is thinking that we could do this i could do this a lot quieter if it was done over there it being your jurisdiction i didnt want to wander in uninvited and they dont want me making the first contact because weve got a leak here in my department we cant seem to find much less plug so i make the contact and set up an interview and you do it over here walt said over a weekend maybe downtime we have three tv news crews on us basically twentyfourseven and a half dozen from radio and both papers last i knew all you had over there was a weekly i could pretty much come and go as i please which is not the case here works for me walt said i dont want to make trouble for you open invitation walt said i can make the inquiries the point being that these individuals would want this done as quietly as we do it wouldnt even be low profile its no profile if theyre willing they should be all over that thats what were thinking consider it done i owe you one not yet you dont thanks just the same leave this thing on in the evenings when i know something ill ring you back freaking amazing technology you ask me boldt said i thought slide rules were impressive he moved even closer to the webcam distorting his face while trying to work the keyboard thanks again no problem the window went black walt tipped back in the chair his father had condemned him for years for accepting the sheriffs office of a small idaho county had teased him unmercifully that his cases were about bears tipping over garbage cans while real law enforcement solved real crimes and here he was one week past what had the appearance of a bear raiding a kitchen and a few minutes past a phone call with a legendary homicide cop dealing with a major crime he hadnt realized how sweet vindication could taste fiona picked a piece of popcorn off the leg of her pajamas and popped it into her mouth her feet tucked to the side she occupied the right side of the couch next to kira who wore an afghan over her shoulders the engletons highdefinition projector threw a sixbysixfoot image onto a screen that came down from the ceiling making meryl streeps head about four feet tall ive seen this at least three times fiona said between bites i love the last scene when shes in the car and her eyes and her smile tell you everything thats going on and then she tells the driver to go the best and anne hathaways outfits absolutely and stanley tucci at the luncheon makes me want to cry kira said we should do this more often no argument from me fiona awaited the scene where meryl streep dumps jacket after jacket onto anne hathaways desk knowing there was no dialogue i thought we should get away she said that sounds interesting a weekend trip where to maybe a week or two yellowstone glacier and back or maybe backpacking in the sawtooths i thought this is like the peak of the fly fishing season isnt this when you rake in the bucks im tired of fishing since when kira took her eyes off the movie for the first time fiona reached down and paused the film on a freeze frame of anne hathaway looking befuddled and we need to bearproof this place before we go michael and leslie would want me to do everything possible youre sick of fishing then why were you out until eleven oclock last night and the night before why did you tell me how incredible it was whoever you are what have you done with fiona give her back please summer lasts what eight weeks max and i havent taken five minutes for myself for the past two summers and youre using me as an excuse yes im using you as an excuse in which case youll hate me in september when you realize how broke you are in eight weeks you make about eight months of income if you want to go you should go without me without you no not going to happen i dont need a babysitter she placed the bowl onto the coffee table in front of them i didnt mean that the way it sounded i can take it i appreciate everything youve done everything youre doing for me but you feel im overprotecting you no i dont i didnt mean it to come out that way she studied fiona is it the bear youre worried about the bear he attacks the garbage not the housesitter you said so yourself it might be better to just get out of here until they catch it what is going on i just need to get out of here then go really ill be fine you should go you do nothing but work you hold down three jobs i dont know how you do it take the time off i can handle things here i promise i wont hide in the garbage cans at night it would have to be both of us fiona said but thats impossible really i started what seven weeks ago its peak season as if id get a twoweek vacation and no you cant make a call for me everyone has been so nice to me but i cant use it as an excuse forever right isnt that what ive been told over and over that i have to get beyond it well i think i am im not going to accept special treatment i want to be treated like everyone else im sick of everyone treating me like im damaged goods it happened its over and i want to get over it good stuff fiona said unable herself to lose the sordid images of kiras abduction and sexual abuse that had been captured on video indelible inexcusable even knowing the monster whod done it was dead did little to help seriously i mean it kira said so well stay i think you should go if you want to im good whats going on i dont get you what if it wasnt a bear excuse me the sheriff has put together a pretty convincing casecircumstantial but convincingthat the berkholders kitchen attacker was not a bear my photography played into that bears are dirty creatures they leave tracks none were found the sheriff thinks some guy made it look like a beareven brought a bear claw along with himbut that it was just a guy trying to steal food a guy maybe living in the woods around here now youre creeping me out she stared at fiona long and hard thats why the pajama party isnt it thats why you want to bearproof the place bearproof or creepproof i think wed both be smarter to stick together and just get away from here why would you lie to me i didnt lie i just didnt want to get you all worked up about something thats probably nothing and now you are the woods thats what he thinks this time of yearsummerpeople move into the national forest vagrants outlaws people who cant afford to have or dont want an address the sheriffs office puts the number into the hundreds hundreds totally off the radar just out there camping somewhere and stealing food from peoples houses cheaper than buying every summer fiona nodded sadly you dont scare that easily kira wore her suspicion openly they were sisters now fiona wasnt supposed to hide anything fiona averted her eyes dont go there where please well bearproof it kira said maybe the handgun course comes in handy now you know how i felt about that once my father gets a bug up his butt so you said the whole purpose of the course was to teach you to know what youre shooting at before you so much as finger the trigger i still dont like it i sleep better knowing its there but i dont and think about it its not right fiona said a gun shouldnt have that kind of power but it does and if theres a prowler you me both of us we dont need this not ever again why would we elect to stay here come with me we kill some time while waltthe sheriffsweeps the woods its safe again and we return i wont give him that power some faceless dude whos stealing pancake batter we talked about this you convinced me once a victim never again a victim im not giving some phantom the power to make me leave and if its not a phantom fiona asked the two exchanged looks for a moment it appeared kira was about to ask a question but she censored herself he hit a house a half mile from here she said who would be dumb enough to hit the nextdoor neighbor these guys are not rocket scientists youre not telling me something i can see it and dont try to convince me otherwise if you stay i stay fiona said thats bullshit ill be fine what about moving back in with your par no way not even for a week im done there you know how i feel about that but one week i love them but im not living with them my fathers look is tragic he cant help himself its like it happened to him its like secondhand smoke or something fiona reached for the dvds remote control kira leaned forward and placed her hand onto fionas thank you she said i know youre trying to protect me i know how awful youd feel if anything happened but nothings going to happen im in charge of my life now i have a life now you made that happen you the advocates my parents this whole valley but im not running from some dude stealing soup cans once a victim never again a victim she repeated but theres also bs is bs being smart is being safe im staying kira said unless youre kicking me out yeah right fiona said she touched the remote and the movie continued kira settled back into the couch and pulled the bowl of popcorn into her lap i love it when they go to paris she said but not yellowstone fiona was about to say she didnt with beatrice leading the way walt fiona tommy brandon and guillermo menquez followed a game path through a dark forest of fir white pine and aspen on a northfacing slope beatrice was not actually leading but following a scent from a can of evaporated milk found by fish and game deputy ranger menquez a hundred yards from the berkholders stucco home that the can carried a scent and that that scent led them deeper into the woods encouraged walt that they were onto something no bear tracks that ive seen menquez said he was a stocky man with a thick mustache and an oily face no scat walt said agreeing no fur caught in the shrubs or on the stumps of old branches showoff fiona said walt ignored it no evidence that any of the food in the kitchen had been consumed he expected beatrice to lead them to a camper a squatter and menquez a bear expert was along in case they encountered oneor if walts theory proved right the bear required a translator the hispanic population had exploded in the valley over the past decade increasingly his office and fish and game dealt with mexicans squatting in the national forest while moving from one menial job to another with the collapse of the economy had come whole settlements of twenty forty sixty day laborers in illegal campsites fiona was along to record whatever was found and because for the past several days shed come out of her cocoon to repeatedly badger walt about finding and removing whateverwhoeverwas living in the woods near the engletons walt extended his arm stopping the others and dropped to one knee focusing on the brown pine straw that covered the barely discernible trail brandon a stick he said reaching back with an open palm tommy brandon found a fallen limb cracked off a dry branch and delivered it to walt like a nurse to a surgeon walt reduced it further photo please fiona sneaked forward and made several pictures of the area in front of walt it might help she said if i knew what i was photographing right here he said using the tip of the stick to gently lift the edge of a fallen leaf he pushed the leaf away pinched it and tossed it behind him another photo he said what is that she asked she zoomed in on the pine straw and for the first time saw through the lens that half a dozen of the brown needles were cracked and broken you couldnt have seen that she mumbled here he said using the stick to point out a small frown of discoloration its a toe impression he said a boot or vibram solesomething stiff and inflexible not a running shoe he looked down at his own boot size ten or eleven were lucky it hasnt rained in the past couple of weeks he looked up the trail and whistled for beatrice to stop once the dog was looking at him walt made a hand gesture and she sat on the side of the trail we dont want her disturbing things its a man he looked behind him then he took hold of fionas hiking boot and lifted it up and moved it hes over a hundred and he sized up fiona twenty pounds and less than oneeighty jesus she gasped amazed he nailed her weight six feet or a little more fiona glanced back at brandon who nodded as if to reassure her that the sheriff was for real beatrice fiona stated you saw a change in beatrice as she passed by here very good ms kenshaw walt said her nose her tail what both walt answered shes my geiger counter shes the one in charge at the moment and she knows it look at her up there the dog sat proudly on the side of the trail with an expression that seemed to ask what was keeping them you ever seen anything cuter than that walt said shes impatient with us truthfully im a little freaked out fiona said its what i do walt said what bea and i do no big deal unless you happen to see it in action fiona said the height how do you get that brandon answered shoe size combined with weight big feet not very heavy tall and thin not hispanic menquez said not very likely if hes over six feet no gilly walt said how do you feel about going off trail point the way menquez said brandon reading a topo map said theres a halfacre bench ahead maybe two hundred yards water source walt said an intermittent stream spring fed on the backside of the bench walt looked up into the trees running northwest to southeast he said exactly brandon answered you are showing off arent you fiona said to walt youve been here before doubtful said brandon before walt could answer walt silenced her with a look we go in silent he said addressing them all brandon youll go upstream from this side he pointed gilly well give you a headstart youre to the north and i want you to come up over the lip and onto the bench the same time as i do well use channel six ill give you two clicks if youre in position youll return with two if you need another minute three clicks two minutes four menquez nodded and took off into the woods without anything more said he moved as silently as a cat you walt said to fiona will stop when i motion for you to stop i want you behind a tree in case any shots are fired youre not to move until i call for you the best way you can help me right now is not to think just follow orders i know that runs against your grainagainst your brainbut no problem i get it okay good he addressed brandon lets go walt received three clicks from menquez kept an eye on his watch and sent the twoclick signal a minute later as two clicks were returned walt pushed up the final incline and popped out through the forest into the gleaming sunshine the effect on his eyes was as if hed left twilight and stepped into the glare of spotlights he slipped on his aviators picking up menquez in his peripheral vision brandon whod beaten them both to the site stepped out from behind a tree near the trickling stream fifty yards to walts left at the back side of the small clearing near the stream and against the hill in a copse of aspens was a fire ring of stones producing steam some litter a leanto and a small stack of sticks and firewood the men came at it from three sides an adrenalinecharged spring to their steps walt dropped to a knee placed his hand first on the firestones then into the steam and charred wood at its center he held up five fingers on his right hand five minutes he silently signaled brandon directing him up the hill brandon took off walt turned around and motioned at the woods and beatrice came running toward him at full speed he dropped her into a sit with a second hand signal recharged her nose with the can of evaporated milk and pointed into the woods find it he whispered the dog hurried off in the same direction as brandon had gone walt stirred the litter with a stick looking for an expiration date but found nothing our boy menquez asked studying the inside of the open leanto someone two people bedded down here recent enough that the wind hasnt disturbed it walt joined him like last night he said be my guess two that doesnt fit he was reaching for the handheld radio as brandon spoke i see two individuals he said harshly keeping his voice low bea had a dead reckoning its a couple theyre on a trail maybe a half mile ahead traversing to the south up and over into greenhorn you want me to pursue stop them if you can walt said were on our way he called to fiona and a moment later they were off at a run the couple were in their late twenties the granola set he wore a red bandana over his hair she carried a camelbak and backpack they had a bitch labrador that got along well with beatrice the dogs chased each other around the woods throwing pine straw and growling just the one night he answered we got off late this morning she said were going to circle around the end of greenhorn and head out that trail and in what condition did you find the campsite the litter wasnt ours the man said we burned what we could and i packed out some the girl added but there was just too much of it the young man complained can i see the trash you packed out the sheriff asked the woman surrendered a plastic bag and walt dumped it and rummaged through it she stared long and hard at fiona brandon said have you seen anyone in the last day or so single male no the man answered wildlife menquez asked nothing bigger than a squirrel the woman said whats this about when you arrived to the campsite brandon said what condition did you find it in did you get any sense for how long it had been abandoned not long walt said holding up a singleserve soy milk box on the end of a stick i packed that out because its lined with some kind of foil and doesnt burn well she said we found a bunch of that melted stuff in the fire ring fiona ran off a series of photographs at walts request walt had pushed the melted globs into their own pile very conscientious of you menquez said wish more campers had your sense of responsibility expiration date walt said is november juice is usually six months fiona said no one questioned her it would have sold in late may or june but not july iffy she said its possible but thats a popular brand i doubt it stays on the shelves that long you could check the berkholders walt said speculating soy milks irradiated could be a pantry item fiona said why not whats going on the woman camper repeated are you looking for someone she met eyes with her partner who appeared anxious we could use some help brandon said hey the woman said addressing fiona i know where i know you arent you didnt you save that kid that drowning kid anything you can tell us fiona saidwalt making note of her choice of pronounswill be kept strictly confidential and could really help us this is important this is the county sheriff hes out here personally just to give you some idea think about that the woman checked with the man again he shook his head nearly imperceptibly but fiona caught it what fiona asked please help us i was the woman said the man shook his head more vehemently cutting her off were all grownups here she clarified i was sunbathing no shirt you know she said to fiona it was a glorious afternoon one thing led to another jimmy and i we enjoyed the fresh air together out there in the middle of the clearing on a thermarest i may have gotten a little vocal i think she blushed the point being that both of us we both thought we heard something up the hill we were still and i you know i didnt want to stop said jimmy the woman laughed nervously and shrugged but we both heard him jimmy said it was probably just a deer she said was not said jimmy and you know it this is yesterday afternoon walt said clarifying four oclock maybe the woman said the sun was still very hot he was returning to the campsite walt proposed to his team maybe hes rotating between two or three menquez said we see a lot of that with the fiveday limit they stay clear of us by moving every five days not much we can do about it him walt asked the man she wont admit it now jimmy said but she was the one who said it felt like someone was watching the woman looked a little sheepish she looked at fiona sometimes you just get this sixth sense you know that someone has their eye on you you know what im talking about and it always gives me the creeps or nearly always i felt it yesterday and to be honest i dont know maybe its just where we were the setting and all but it kind of turned me on jesus jimmy groaned kind of why dont you just describe every detail thats why we didnt stop she said i didnt exactly feel like stopping can we stop now jimmy asked please my deputy will take down your statement youve been very helpful fiona said i know thats not easy is there some creep out here jimmy asked is that what youre telling us honestly if i were you walt said i might try the pioneers or the boulders someplace north you see he said to the woman blaming her for all their trouble he called for their dog and started off down the trail the woman stayed behind and gave brandon their names and phone numbers sorry about that brandon said oh well she said hell get over it i can sit on this campsite menquez offered maybe we get lucky and he comes back observation only walt said no action these guys a guy like this gilly yes i understand sheriff if hes the one breaking into peoples houses i would want backup dont worry couldnt you sweep the area fiona asked the other campsites could i suppose but theres just too many walt said it would take too much manpower too many resources for just petty theft and vandalism but what if he knows that she complained what if hes counting on that then hes right walt said he whistled for bea the dog arrived with a deer bone in her mouth with the woman down the trail the four stared at the pale white bone in the dogs mouth it represented a violent death no one spoke what was on their mind if anything but walt looked down the trail toward the hiker hoping that she and jimmy would heed his advice fiona waved her finger through the gauzy column of steam rising from the teacup alongside her computer breaking apart and swirling into separate coils she considered trying to photograph the image to capture it to stop it in time this was the part of photography that fascinated her the stoppage of time owning a particular moment forever leave composition and color to others she thought of herself as an archivist she dragged a shot of the berkholders vandalized refrigerator to her bestof folder admiring how it offered something new to the collection as she clicked the computer mouse she heard a synchronous thud against the cottages outside wall at first she allowed herself to believe it was the aspen tree on the southwest corner the tree grew incredibly close to the wall often banging against it when the wind blew but theres no wind tonight she thought and though the woods were full of such soundsunexplainable creaks and cracksshed come to discern a difference between the sounds of nature and the sounds of animals in nature the sound hadnt resulted from a tree limb falling or a pine tree splitting it had sounded more like something slapping the cottages clapboard siding bear she spun in her chair her elbow bumping the mug and sloshing some tea onto the table she jumped up somethingsomeonemoved off quickly through the woods snapping twigs and swooshing branches she lunged forward killing the interior lights and switching on the outside floods the computer monitor cast a glow into the room as she raced to the wall and peered out a window but too late if there had been anything out there it was long gone amid the harsh shadows knitting in the woods it cant be a deer or elk antler making contact with the wallthat made sense but the escape into the woods had sounded like something big and fast which brought her back to a bear the bear except that walt had now convinced her that the destruction at the berkholders had not been the work of a bear but instead an itinerant whod vandalized the place and had worked hard to make it look like the work of a bear it cant be her chest was tight her throat constricted heat flooded through her immediately followed by a penetrating cold a man out there creeping around her cottage not possible she glanced to the front door and then threw herself across the room to the phone stabbing the intercom button kira pick up pick up yeah kira said over the main residences speakerphone a television played in the background lock the doors pull the blinds and leave the phone on while youre doing it whats going on just do it right now theres a bear she said i think there was a bear outside my window just now no way kira now okay okay she heard the girl moving through the rooms pulling drapes and dropping blinds then footfalls returned toward the phone i dont see how pulling blinds is going to make any difference to a bear kira said are the doors locked yes okay you sound so freaked out do i sorry it just scared me was all it cant be not again i think its cool i wouldnt mind seeing a bear for real do not go near the doors or windows jeez chill you have the baseball bat p le ase kira said drawing the word out dramatically im coming over get the bat and stand by the front door and get ready to unlock it for me what seriously why you dont need to do that fiona im fine i dont need a babysitter i know you dont fiona said she paused looking near the front door for her running shoes but i think i do the young man wasnt prepared for the formality of the interview room just as walt had hoped he was accompanied by his father who was fit and ruggedly handsome and his attorney terry for whom walt had a great deal of respect the boy shared his fathers good looks broad shoulders and deep voice though the combination belied his boyish naïve eyes terry hogue a sizable welldressed man with a commanding presence displayed the calmness of an academic as to the nature of the inquiry sheriff id like to restate that my client mr donaldson is here of his own volition that is voluntarily and has not been charged with any crime thats correct terry that mr donaldson is willing to cooperate with your investigation if any and that nothing said here today is being recorded and may not be used against him agreed that said hogue continued ive asked my client to clear his answers with me before responding so he may seek my advice which im here to give we apologize in advance for any delays that may cause understood its all yours hogue said mr donaldson may i call you brian brian are you in a relationship with dionne fancelli of eighteen alturas drive the nervous boy looked to hogue who nodded his assent yeah me and di are boyfriend girlfriend and were all aware of ms fancellis medical condition walt said that is that shes pregnant with child the boy nodded regretfully without checking with hogue the father fidgeted in his chair sheriff hogue said lets be clear that acknowledging the young womans medical condition by no means implies my clients role in that matter which is why were here terry right were here as a result of your invitation hogue clarified have you had sexual intercourse with ms fancelli walt asked the boy the boy looked to hogue who spoke for him my client will not comment on the physical nature of his and ms fancellis friendship i assume were all aware that ms fancelli is claiming the child is your clients walt said to the attorney since hogue was the one answering were aware of the claim hogue said but again we are making no statement about the physical or sexual nature of their relationship were also all aware that ms fancelli is fifteen silence i will assume mr hogue has briefed you on the quirky nature of idaho law walt said to the boy idaho accepts sexual relationships between adolescents of similar ages but you must be at least eighteen years old in idaho to have consensual sex with an adult that is a person eighteen or over you are over eighteen brian and therefore if you have penetrated ms fancelli orally vaginally or anally you are in violation of state law hogue seemed on the verge of stepping in but resigned himself to allow walt to continue apparently wanting to see where this was going with the girls claim of penetration the state can therefore charge you in this matter leaving it for the courts to decide there is no physical proof required although you may or may not be aware that ms fancelli has retained electronic correspondenceemails and textsin which she discusses your sexual relations with her and your replies to those emails contain no denials to the contrary in fact where are we going with this walt wed like to take a swab absolutely not hogue said show us a court order and my client will oblige walt met eyes with hogue im requesting your client provide a swab voluntarily and that he aids this office in obtaining a hair or some other sample from ms fancelli that contains the young womans dna perhaps he is already in possession of something along these lines this is ridiculous the father said nearly coming out of his chair they havent got anything no way this is happening hogue without breaking eye contact with walt motioned for the man to remain in his chair and implicitly to remain quiet i dont get it brian said the father couldnt help himself he wants you to do his work for him lets get out of here hogue turned on the father you may leave the room or you can remain and be quiet but thats the last were going to hear from you right now the father huffed but stayed in his seat let me get this straight hogue said youre requesting my clients participation and cooperation in certain aspects of your evidence collection and in keeping with the confidentiality of the current interview youre implying any evidence acquired as a result of this cooperation is therefore off the books walt said not that were keeping any books not at the moment a puzzled hogue looked him over still maintaining eye contact youll leave the room please both of you me said the father yes said hogue the two got up and left the room once the door was firmly shut hogue spoke you have another suspect i need the boys cooperation walt said youre aware that if and when you come back for any physical evidence from my client i will fight any reference to my case against your client at that point would be dicey at best i would have prejudiced the evidence id probably lose the possibility of a court case against him no probably about it what a pity walt said hogue sat back rubbed his big hand against his maw and chuckled never a dull moment with you walt walt showed no expression the girls dna hogue said he mulled it over you suspect the father never a dull moment with you terry how certain are you certain of what counselor i dont believe weve discussed any other suspects if you want the girls dna and my clients as well then you must have or have access to the fetuss dna how is it that you have the childs dna but not the mothers again he was thinking aloud walts lack of expression remained implacable if you burn me on this walt youve always played fair with me cant teach an old dog new tricks wed be taking a big risk a risk that i would prejudice my evidence that your client would skate i need a hair from her a cigarette butt a love stain he needs to volunteer it to me and i repeat youre implying you can get what amnio fluid but not the girls dna hows that happen he took a moment you have a witness you possess the means to obtain a court order to collect the amnio fluid but are less confident you can win the dna of a minor you dont need to trouble yourself counselor with what i do or do not have what i need is your clients cooperation and youll have it i thought it might work out that way a knock on the door interrupted them sorry to interrupt a female deputy said leaning her head in the door weve got shots fired out lake creek walt immediately stood extending his hand to hogue do what you can he said youll be hearing from me hogue answered shes not answering deputy linda chalmers reported try again walt said ive already why do we need photography anyway its a couple of shells in the grass walt answered that with a glare yes sir he was in a fix hed requested fiona be called onto the scene more out of a personal want and now saw no way to back out of the request without making his original intentions obvious he marched to the back of the cherokee as if put out to do this himself took his camera from an emergency backpack he kept there and walked back into the darkened lawn he shot off a series of photos of the spent shell casings adding his pen into the grass for scale chalmers was first officer having responded to a dispatch the result of an emergency centers receipt of a neighbors call chalmers shadowed walt to the jeep and back to the lawn warning shots walt said no sir thats the thing he made no apologies said he was firing right at him him the intruder he said him yes sir in the direction of the neighbors thats correct any reports of the shots landing no sir judging by his breath that doesnt surprise me theres the suggestion of alcohol the name again vincent wynn chalmers said walt froze wynn was on boldts short list of potential interviews the vince wynn some kind of big shot acts like it at least i think he thought i should know who he is and honestly sir i dont have a clue most of the celebrities up here they dont want you to know who they are howre you supposed to pretend you dont know tom hanks i love tom hanks i would violate my marriage vows for tom hanks but this nincompoop im sorry no clue it was more words out of deputy chalmers than walt had ever heard she was clearly nervous and concerned he might slight her for not knowing wynn hes a sports agent bigtime sports agent that would explain it in that world his world hes tom hanks not with that face he isnt you dont mind me saying so i dont mind walt said can i stop calling ms kenshaw sir now that youve taken the pictures yourself you may why dont you get me everything you can on mr wynn any past grievances filed by neighbors traffic violations parking tickets run him done she said hurrying off walt knocked on the patio door frame since the door was open to the night no screen door mosquitoes lasted about ten days in late june then the cold nights stopped their cycle a moth or two might wander inside but vince wynn didnt seem too worried he was on his mobile phone his hand wrapped around a heavy cocktail glass filled halfway with a dark liquid okay gotta go he said pocketing the phone vince wynn he introduced himself switching the drink to his left hand and shaking hands with walt im a fan of some of your players walt said believing he could loosen up wynn before the liquor suganuma sakatura to the mariners one of the alltime great trades thank you and that fourway with the braves and phillies you follow baseball i see play a little softball leagues you know let me guess he sized up walt catcher or outfield im going with catcher walt shook his head you are a pro its what i do and me walt said i chase down complaints when neighbors hear a gun being shot in their backyard my own backyard but point taken im not going to argue with you walt said still trying his best to sound awestruck you nearly talked steinbrenner out of arod im supposed to argue with that i wasnt close that got all blown out of proportion and tonight walt said how close were you tonight excuse me there are laws about the discharge of firearms within a prescribed distance of a residence it was a prowler so you said the guy was on my property sneaking around out there he threw the drink forward to point and sloshed the contents of the glass onto his hand let me guess walt said the call just now your lawyer wynn licked the booze off his wrist yeah my lawyer but its not him i was shooting at it was martel gale wynn said you follow football not so much ive never heard of

to fear gale he eats em for breakfast treats em like his personal punching bags did gale know her wouldnt surprise me he attracted the lookers like flies to shit but if she was on the server it didnt do her any good did it the alert came two weeks late you believe that shit theres a seattle detective a sergeant boldt would like a word with you in private about caroline vetta hes suggesting you meet over here not in seattle in order to avoid the press wynn coughed a laugh shit you guys are all a piece of work youre telling me ive got to get back on the horn with my lawyer if you want to involve your lawyer walt said i think that might be agreeable the idea is to keep it out of the press not to pull an end run on you as if the cops care this one does apparently he can do it in front of all the cameras if youd prefer he looked up from the drink i dont see why we cant do something let me make a call and get back to you works for me the man drank the liquor like it was water do you have reason to believe martel gale is in sun valley you already asked me that and you said you shot at him not that you knew he was here listen several women could have testified against him for all i know right and why not caroline she could have been one of the girls maybe he paid her back the way he looked up over the rim of the glass sent a charge through walt he needed to make sure boldt talked to this one the sooner you can let me know about meeting with the detective the better hes going to fly over specially for this am i supposed to be honored let him do what hes got to do id like to inspect your weapon walt said pity its in the bedroom safe and hell if i didnt forget the combination thats what i was on the phone to my lawyer about i knew you fellas would probably want to see it and i didnt want to piss anyone off but its in there locked up and i wont have the combination until tomorrow sometime when my office is open about the time your lawyers plane lands walt asked cynicism from a county sheriff why make it more difficult than it has to be so the lawyers earn their money i guess you cant go firing a gun in your backyard so you said gale was out there i wasnt taking any chances walt heard the mans name and thought of his wife it was gail out there hed never be fully free of her which was the hardest part to adjust tolike one of those stomach microbes from mexico if he had a killer loose in the valley he needed to know about it could have been a hiker walt said could have been a neighbor gale did caroline wynn said i was next on the list trust me a guy like that settles scores football players hell they remember the smallest shit from the previous season and they make the player pay the next time they face him across a scrimmage line its the way the games played its who they are in which case youve either wounded him or escalated the terms and your guns locked in your safe walt said and you forgot the combination wynn glanced into the house and back at walt that is problematic he said maybe you could leave that smokin hot deputy at my front door all night deputy chalmers is married with five kids her husband runs a martial arts school in hailey her eldest is eighteen and has his black belt wynn didnt seem to hear walt had lost part of him back at the mention of boldt a second weapons violation will result in felony charges neither of us wants or needs that forgetting the combination to the safe may be a good thing i see someone out there and ill shoot first ask questions later take my chances the judge is a sports fan he wasnt threatening just stating fact a guy like that comes after you you dont get a second chance ask caroline ask the other women he sent to the emergency room his nickname in the league was gale force guy handed out concussions like business cards ask trent green kurt warner we call those guys a snake bite all it takes is one hit to kill you gail force walt wiped the smirk off his face wondering why hed never thought of that one himself no more guns how about a machete or a baseball bat try the phone next time thats why were here to protect and serve right sheriff right so protect me try the yellow pages find gale youll do us all a favor let me know about setting up the thing with boldt the sooner the better twoeighty wynn said as walt turned to leave the comment spun him around your batting average youre a switch hitter he said calluses he indicated walts hands walt looked down at his palms maybe im a gardener he said yeah i can see that wynn said sarcastically twoeighty he repeated confidently two eightyfive walt answered impressed but trying not to show it the temptation proved too great and walt made the turn at the split rail fence at the side of state highway he drove through the overbuilt log gate and turned left up the hill toward a stand of fir he approached the engleton guesthouse thinking up an excuse for the visit he stopped and returned to the cherokee to retrieve his camera movement caught his eye and he looked toward the main house in time to see a womans silhouette standing in a downstairs window it was kira she held something in her hand across her chesta baseball bat he realized fiona opened the cottages door wearing a tshirt navy blue sweatpants and rubber flipflops her hair was held off her face by a pair of plastic clips problems she asked you werent answering calls he said no she replied we had a situation a guy throwing shots in his backyard believing a client of his was coming after him i needed some pictures took them myself no big deal a broker i wouldnt want to be a money manager in this town right now i cant imagine the amounts people must have lost no not a money guy a sports agent thought some exfootball jock was creeping around his backyard and decided it was safer to shoot him than to say hello he offered her his camera making it clear it was a professional not personal visit wasnt sure why he felt that so important she staggered back a step off balance he caught her by the elbow and held on youre saying he saw this football guy she said no the whiskey might have done the seeing i think it was more likely a neighbor come in she said accepting the camera want me to print these for you please he stepped inside coffee she asked yes please sit she said its a nice place he said have you never been here no how pathetic of me i cant believe its your first time it was done up as an english cottage leslie engleton had great taste and deep pockets i was worried about you he said blurting it out me thats nice of you but im fine just quiet you know me she filled the kettle i do that now and then she got the stove lit under the kettle and sat down in front of a laptop at the breakfast table she fished around in a box of wires at her feet and connected his camera to the computer yours he asked admiring a photo of a black woman on a porch holding a small terrified child yes just after katrina powerful thanks so who was this guy with the gun this sports guy believe me you dont care just another guy with a gun who shouldnt have been drinking i gave him a warning she seemed about to say something but didnt no prowlers i take it he asked for the record i tried to get kira to take a trip with me and that was before the campsite and the hikers id just as soon not be here for her sake not mine she added emphaticallya little too emphatically he thought she doesnt need any more scares he recalled seeing kira with the bat and made sense of it gillys a good tracker walt said i think well catch this guy youd get no complaint from me but seriously did he know it was this football guy how weird is that the water was beginning to boil she returned to the stove he has a history with this guy what kind of history money youre certainly the curious one tonight he said i like staying up on your cases knowing what youre doing since when he asked since i dont know i just do particularly this prowler at the berkholders or now at this other guys could have been the same guy i suppose though thats a long way to travel not so very far that and the berkholders home was empty at the time with so many homes empty in this community why hit one where theres a chance of running into someone better stocked fresh food so youre the detective now he waited hey that was a joke ha ha listen gilly and i found a spot with the grass beaten down outside the berkholders this guy scouted the place and timed it so no one was home you dont have anything to worry about here which is why you parked the jeep at the top of the hill where you cant miss it you noticed that he said earth to walt i have a photographers eye i dont miss much no you dont do you his photographs had downloaded she worked the laptop walt stood and looked over her shoulder impressed with how she modified each one thats amazing he said you can do anything to a picture you know that you can not me is it typical of squatters she asked scouting a place like that probably not no i didnt think so keeping all the lights on is good he said hell stay away if he hasnt left the area already he paused why do we make everything about the office i didnt come here to give you my camera i thought about that at the last moment then why did you come here he barely hesitated all the time spent thinking about this moment the right situation and it came down to no thought at all he bent down and kissed her on the lips her eyes expressed her surprise but her lips warm and sweet with wine pressed to his more tightly and then her eyes shut and her hands came around his head and her body shook as if caught in guttural laughter he pulled back and she held on to him saying dont dont you dare stop kissing him hungrily her chair went over backward walt throwing his arms around her and saving her from the fall the weight and warmth of her pressed to him as he eased her to the floor her hair spread like a fan on the throw rug she was laughing in fact like a child opening an unexpected yet long anticipated gift their bodies touching hands beginning to explore and delight she worked her fingers past his ears holding his face an inch away from her own and managed to growl why so long walt answered with smiling eyes his fingers trapping a tear as it spilled down her cheek do we dare do this he whispered youre damn right we do she answered breathlessly tugging the shirttail from his waistband and running her hands up his back delivering chills time arrested all thought walt fell away from himself from his planning and predetermining they knocked a vase off the coffee table she laughed harder and slapped his hand as he reached to right it grabbing and guiding his fingers lower on her scared and elated both present and absent he felt her respond to his touch her legs parting her warmth overwhelming the scent of her sacred and mysterious engulfed him intoxicating dizzy with her overwhelmed underprepared and fearing inexperience he fell victim to her suddenly finding himself past any point of reason or thought driven by human hunger and a forceful need to join her when it was over when the flush beneath her collarbone flared and her bare flesh rippled with gooseflesh she opened her eyes to the ceiling and smiled devilishly chortling to herself oh my god she said she took him by the hair and tugged and laughed privately again and said more softly oh my god he answered not with wordscouldnt find any theyd all deserted himbut with a squeeze of her hand and by lying next to her and hooking his ankle over hers so that their feet embraced as their bodies just had they stared at the ceiling together you must promise me she said that youll never pretend that didnt happen its all i ask promise five minutes passed into ten she offered little touches as if making sure he was still there beside her as if reassuring herself there are moments you never forget she said this is one of them agreed im not saying it has to happen again im not saying it wont im just saying it had to happen now and it did and we cant have any regrets no none not from me he said you dont have to court me but you mustnt ignore me never not possible and i promise to keep it professional in public i know that cant be easy for you i dont want you worrying about that im not even thinking right now im certainly not worrying about anything except disappointing you because i never want to i dont intend to if i could wrap up all the happiness in the world into a package if i could give you that i would whatever the word means to you whatever it is you wanti would give you that then youd wrap up yourself she said her fingers absentmindedly finding his face and the tips of her fingers searching his expression like a blind persons finding a grin they pulled away satisfied i know you cant stay she said but i want you to youre welcome to as long as you can id like to fall asleep in your arms id like to never wake up id like to take a shower with you he said to soap you all over now why not later he could hear the water still bubbling in the kettle the chorus of night creaturescrickets frogs and things that go chirp in the dark beneath it all he heard the steady comforting sound of a cat purring and his eye finally lighted on the tabby balled up by a pillow on the loveseat so still hed not seen it whats its name he asked her she said angel he nodded it never hurts to have an angel around she said she wore a terrycloth robe pulled tightly around her slim waist as she fixed them both tea and brought him a cup he wore his uniform again its shoulders damp from his wet hair she sat crosslegged on the couch he stared at her the cat got up and climbed into her lap i like this about you he said the silence umm me too she hesitated you were like an eighteenyearold tonight had a few have you she threw her spoon at him and hit him in the chest he caught it as it fell and placed it on the coffee table dont overthink this she said its tempting he said but no i dont plan to youre welcome here anytime standing invitation standing as in the shower dont get fresh please she laughed ive heard you laugh more tonight than in two years of knowing you maybe you havent known me maybe not he admitted although in the biblical sense shut up if i had another spoon to throw i would he passed her the spoon her eyes shone brightly as she teased a second throw and she set it down he sighed contentedly they stared i want you to know she said im serious about this but it doesnt mean you have to be this is your free pass out of jail tonight right now no harm no foul but if you dont take the pass if you stay in jail and decide to roll the dice thats something else entirely understood he said he didnt want a pass he wanted to sleep here he wanted to tell her hed dreamed of this fantasized about it and that it had exceeded all hed imagined because one couldnt imagine how at ease he felt with her he felt transformed if not for the kids hed run away with her if shed have him and it struck him that she would have him that shed have agreed and he nearly laughed go home she said are you always this bossy only when im afraid of losing something not going to happen he placed down the cold teacup crossed to kiss her on the cheek but she offered him her lips and they kissed until the cat climbed off her lap in disgust walt received wynns handgun the following afternoon and spent thirty minutes with the mans attorney arranging the terms for a boldt interview he impounded the handgun pending wynns voluntary completion of a oneday weapons course the following week he reached boldt by skype that night explaining hed heard back from nfl owner marty boatwright and that both interviews were now arranged boldt said hed make travel plans and get back to him he watched the disney channel with his daughters read with them at bedtime and caught up with emails while beatrice licked herself at his feet it was the first normal evening hed had in a while and he promised himself to make more of them hed quickly come to see that fiona was right about his intolerance of silence though dared not test it he kept himself busy with simple tasks until utterly fatigued and fell asleep in a bed hed once shared with gail beatrice snored before he did he slept without any recollection of dreaming the following day a tuesday in july terry hogue was announced from the front desk he complimented walt on the decorated rolling block remington rifle hung in a glass box on the wall they discussed firearms for ten minutes walt feeling no need to push the attorney finally hogue withdrew a sealed plastic bag and pushed it across walts desk inside was a pair of black lace underwear they belong to dionne fancelli not exactly what id expected walt said hogue slid a signed and notarized document to walt his statement as to how this undergarment came into his possession and that it was passed directly to you walt read the letter carefully a love souvenir their second and last time hogue said i questioned the boy repeatedly walt theyve had sexual intercourse twice other stuff along the way sure but only twice the last time eight months ago hes willing to cooperate fully its not him i happen to believe him in case you care i care i thought you might what i told you beforethat was straight im not after him hogue produced a second plastic bag this one contained a cotton swab so that completes our end of the deal hogue said i guess i should wish you good luck my client would welcome the dismissal of him as a person of interest has she said anything to him about problems at home he knew there were problems hogue said the two times they attempted sexual intercourse failed miserably and it wasnt him it was her she became so overwhelmed emotionally that he withdrew despite protection and they didnt try after that no and they didnt talk about it he brought it up only once she blew up at him they didnt speak for days he doesnt know enough to have spotted the warning signs he just thought she was too young and that he was stupid for having tried he was right indeed okay walt said accepting a second letter pertaining to the swab if we can help you get the bastard walt thank you my guess is you already have walt had the two bags packaged and shipped to the meridian lab knowing it would be several weeks if he was lucky before getting the reports the prenatal sample from the mother would have to be done in the next few weeksbetween the tenth and thirteenth weekand would be more problematic past the fourteenth week an amniocentesis was the only option a procedure that would put the fetus at some degree of risk and one he therefore wouldnt push for he had to work quickly with the courts he attended a rotary club lunch met with his two investigating deputies to review cases and answered a dozen emails before heading home to lisa and the girls he was in the cherokee when he overheard a radio call from his dispatcher a prowler had been reported at the roger hillabrand residence hillabrand a defense contractor continued to hold an interest in fiona and had for a time been a suspect in another of walts cases more important he lived within a mileas the crow fliesof the engleton ranch less than a mile from the wilderness campground guillermo menquez was keeping an eye on deputy chalmers responded to the dispatchers call and a moment later walt announced that he would oversee the complaint chalmers would respond asap bypassing the gate to keep it closed and climbing the twomile driveway on foot alert for the intruder if she reached the house before walt she was to inform hillabrand walt was en route he called lisa and let her know he was going to be late nikki took the phone why do our faces look backwards in the mirror she asked its bedtime sweetheart i can try to explain it in the morning but how come it has to do with the way light reflects like when the doctor hits your knee no thats reflex but thats what you said spelled different different word sounds the same yes it does like hear and hereones listening ones a place reflects is a place ill explain tomorrow promise there it was that word that had impacted his life more than any other bobby gail his badge his father he heard his own breathing through the phones earpiece he said good night a lump forming in his throat for reasons unknown was this the silence about which fiona had warned from which he ran was he supposed to call her ten minutes later he reached the reinforced entry gate at the base of the hillabrand estatetwo hundred acres of private property contiguous with the cold springs run of the sun valley ski mountain perched atop an foothigh mountaintop two miles up a gravel road stood hillabrands squarefoot log cabin a monument to a bachelor with too much money and just enough sense to hire a tasteful architect its my fault hillabrand said he wore a crisply pressed skyblue polo shirt creased blue jeans and forest green keens with his leathery tan blue eyes and wry smile he had to fight off comparisons to robert redford i got absorbed with work id left all the lights off so the place was dark as a graveyardan open invitation im afraid i heard something and had a look he led walt down a confusing set of hallways and reached a hotelsized kitchen he pulled back a curtain on the kitchens dutch split door hed been working on this door tried to jimmy it he opened the door and showed walt where a crude tool had been used in an attempt to open the door i switched on the outside light got a quick look six feet broad shoulders no face only his back jeans dark sweatshirt he was gone in a flash very fast hair color walt was taking notes no ball cap i guess you must have a weapon in this place walt said hillabrand was a former army general whod retired into an ngo he employed a security detail of service vets fiercely loyal to him of course did i pursue him into the woods come on sheriff give me some credit you called your own people first i take it you really take a dim view of me dont you he leaned back no i called nineoneone and reported the intruder i dont keep a posse around me you know is that what you think i have staff of course i do but they keep regular hours deputy chalmers will remain with you preferably in a windowless rooma secondstory room will do you have to be kidding me hillabrand said a man of your position sir our first job is your protection walt contrasted this with his response to the similar situation at vince wynns residence hed assumed any gunshots had driven the intruder away in wynns case but he realized hed made it personal as well and that was a bad development you think this was nonsense i thought the berkholder thing and that may be all it is but this is the way were going to do it chalmers stood at the ready hillabrand motioned for her to follow him and they left walt went out the kitchen door his flashlight on trained onto the dewy grass tracking wasnt a hobby for him and it wasnt a professional requirement it was a study a science a passion he held the maglites bluish halogen bulb close to the lawn and watched as a million pearls of dew lit up and sparkled in their midst like a string of lakes were lightless oval shapes each a footprint of the intruder he stayed to the side following them down the curve of the lawn to the edge of the forest and from there into the ever darker woods alert for displaced leaves freshly broken twigs and the bent shafts of plants and wildflowers lower and lower down the hill he went hunched and attentive excited by the puzzle solving there were stretches where he lost all signs of the man wishing hed brought beatrice along with him instead of leaving her in the cherokee tempted to go back and get her he doubted shed pick up a scent from the ground alone and couldnt trouble himself to return five minutes stretched to twenty it was a steady descent the intruder avoiding and crossing the occasional game trail it felt as if he knew where he was going that this was scouted terrain and as the invisible path that walt followed stopped descending and began to traverse the northfacing hill finally swinging higher and beginning to climb now he was aimed for the ridge that dropped down into the drainage where the berkholders and engletons lived the drainage where on the opposing northfacing slope the campground had been discovered a jolt of deepening concern rattled him fiona lived over there as he crested the ridge and briefly glimpsed the lights below the engleton ranch called out as a destination due to terrain and without going down to the highway it was impossible to get from where walt stood to the other side of the drainage without crossing the engleton property halfway between hillabrands house and the engletons he debated his options favoring returning to the cherokee where he had a shotgun and an emergency backpack with a bigger flashlight batteries the satellite phone and warm clothing it might take him an extra five to ten minutes because of the climb and then the drive off hillabrands mountain but it seemed worth it his legs aching from the descent and climb carried him well he charged back up the mountain zigzagging in order to set a sustainable pace and picking up the first game trail he encountered wild animals for the most part made sensible if sometimes meandering routes through forest and across wilderness walt followed this trail for two hundred yards and then cut back through the trees quickly gaining elevation minutes later he reached hillabrands out of breath he radioed chalmers and told her to allow hillabrand to move around his house but to stay with him for the time being i picked up his trail and believe he may be heading into the next drainage im headed for the engleton place he called for backup on the way his closest patrol was nearly twenty minutes away he directed them to approach without siren or lights expecting to have completed the first part of his rounds by the time they arrived beatrice knew when walt was excited she shot between the seats her paws on the center console and licked walt below the ear back off walt shouted the dog whimpered and backed up but the thumping of her tail against the backseat in concert with the pounding of walts heartbeat in his ears gave away her enthusiasm hillabrands twomile driveway was crushed stone and steep with a halfdozen hairpin switchbacks as fast as walt drove it wasnt fast enough he onehanded his phone to dial fionas number from his contact list wondering why he hadnt programmed a speed dial number for her it made perfect sense that he should have her number set as a speed dial and yet it seemed too personal at the same time and he wondered if he was afraid to be seen dialing her via the shortcut and if so what caused such fear in him his sense of fiona and him of gail and brandon could get so tangled up that it seemed impossible to unknot he couldnt risk exposing himself to another person the way he had with gail it had left him raw and vulnerable in a way he hadnt felt since adolescence and that was too many years behind him to offer any guidance as a teen he had stumbled and crashed his way through his early relationships not understanding himself enough to have much to offer by adulthood in his twenties his focus had been on building a career for himself with little time or energy to devote to the otherworldly nature of getting inside gails skin theyd made love theyd had laughs they ate meals together and attended parties but never with too much talking never fully explaining themselves to the other the way he expected relationships were supposed to function that his only fully invested relationship had collapsed unexpectedly on his part left him with the sinking feeling it could happen again far too easily the phone rang in his ear he urged her to pick up then the click of the voice mail and his cursing into the car and beatrice whimpering again he skidded to a stop before hillabrands reinforced gate and waited for its electronic eye to detect the cherokees motion and open the steel bar climbed and walt threw a rooster tail behind as he sped out and into a dirtspewing fishtail turn and down the canyon road his thumb finding the green button on his cell phone and redialing her number hed never figured out how a few minutes could stretch into hours but that was how it felt the short drive took too long the cherokee climbed up the engleton driveway and walt jammed the brakes he hesitated then shut the engine off and climbed out running for fionas front door he pulled up just short of the door his chest tight despite the fact that there were no signs of any problems here he knocked lightly and when she failed to answer knocked louder no answer he called out fiona its me a ringing in his ears the chorus of a summer evening insects and frogs how far to press this he stepped around to the side of the cottage as a light breeze stirred the trees the woodslat venetian blinds were pulled but he pressed an eye to the edge it was the sitting area he flashed back to the two of them on the floor her legs hooked in his the back of her head pressed against the leg of the coffee table and thumping softlythat chortle of hers both satisfied and amused as she arched her back her nails digging into him for a moment he didnt breathe given the angle he could barely make out the couch but he thought he saw her curled up on it he rapped softly on the window shed invited him back anytime he wanted to see her he wanted the door opened she didnt move maybe it was nothing but a blanket and pillows he thought he went to the next window but couldnt get a decent angle there either his knuckle hovered next to the glass he withdrew it and returned to the front door and knocked lightly one last time no answer he faced a choice of kicking in the door or checking the area and leaving the temptation to bust it down was overwhelmingbut was it to satisfy his need or hers why the hell wouldnt she answer him had she reconsidered was that even her on the couch he stepped away and walked the perimeter of the cottage then circled the main house also dark he knocked on the front door and the back but was not answered from the back patio he looked down over the small pond its surface gently stirred by the light breeze he looked up the hill to the general area where hed been standing only twenty minutes earlier hillabrands intruder would have passed through the property without going out of his way to circle well around he studied the steep incline of the mountain recalling the campsite it seemed a plausible destination he called dispatch on his radio find gilly menquez for me fast he provided a radio channel number for menquez to use to reach him and then switched his handheld to that channel he returned to the cherokee not quite able to put the vehicle in gear and leave the engleton property he called fionas cell phone for a third time voice mail again he fought the temptation to kick in her door she took her privacy seriously ardently savored her downtime if she was staying on the couch and not coming to the door then all his shouting in the world wouldnt make her admit him to violate that might create an insurmountable wall between them along with this came the realization his decision was not professional but personal he disliked himself for it he was supposed to know better he cranked the engine put the cherokee in gear and backed up his headlights suddenly illuminated a young womankira tulivichhiding behind a tree just beyond the cottage a baseball bat firmly in hand she stood within striking distance of where walt had had his face pressed to the cottage window he felt a shiver what the hell he slammed on the brakes but a voice called out over the police band radio sheriff weve been unable to raise ranger menquez i called his home his wife hasnt heard from him hes late and shes worried when walt looked up again kira was gone he accelerated and arrived at the end of the engleton driveway instead of turning right toward the highway he swung the wheel left pointing the cherokee up the hill in the general direction of the abandoned campsite tell backup theyll find my cherokee up the old mining road across from red top and to catch up to me on the trail channel six he said beatrice beat her tail against the backseat furiously again somehow understanding they were going for a hike an evening thunderstorm had moved through an hour earlier leaving raindrops like strung crystal beads on the cottage windows moonlight now peeked out from behind fastmoving clouds throwing shadows into the woods like light from behind a slowly moving fan fiona saw men in those shadows she couldnt tear herself away from the window had been unable to do so for days now she stared out over the back of the couch for hours at a time like a cat or dog her imagination running wild shed been here before nearly in this same situation forcing her to question how it was that she might face such a thing twice in one lifetime when some womenmost womennever experienced it even once did she invite it upon herself as some had suggested did she ask for it subconsciously want it if so what kind of twisted individual did that make her how could she not know her own self she fell into a trance of selfhatred and confusion her eyes glazed over for minutes at a time not seeing not hearing yet unable to tear herself away she thought this must be the same sick attraction that people had to horror films morbid curiosity she had projects to complete phone calls to return she needed a shower some food but there she sat legs tucked up into her chest chin on the back of the couch the terror shed experienced a few nights before had been the anomaly she rarely felt such things anymore theyd been burned out of her as if her body had developed an immunity to fear it was not that she felt bravefar from it numb more aptly described her resolved for all the work all the socalled progress the countless hours poured into not seeing herself as a victim she had little to show for it an email along with one thud on a wall and shed recoiled reverted regressed shed failed to find her way out knowing with absolute certainty what this was about whom this was about that was why when the sound of a car came up the driveway when its engine idled a long thirty seconds before shutting off she knew in a moment of clarity what was coming and yet felt helpless to prevent it she didnt believe in fate destiny was to an extent something one could control there were external forces and powers certainly and these were things to be reckoned with but there was also determination and hard work and from somewhere in the distant reaches of her mind this idea of faith for all the times shed told herself to fight back if ever given this chance she now felt more inclined to accept the inevitable monsters were real she knew this firsthand a knock on the door she held her legs more tightly noises in the bushes when walts face pressed to the glass sliced into stripes by the blinds staring into the darkened room she suppressed a laugh covering her mouth and slumping down to where she hoped he might not see her the gap between what shed anticipated and seeing walt was too enormous too much for her to bridge at a moments notice instead she froze hoping he might go away and then by the time shed come to her senses and wanted to see him longing for his company she was far too embarrassed to move how could she possibly explain herself when her one great wish in life the sum of all her effort was to never have to explain herself to anyone to be accepted for who she was not who shed been he tapped on the glass she willed him to go away and this particular time her will proved the stronger she thought she heard the door to the main house close but didnt get up to look she knew she owed him if not an explanation at least an excuse but didnt pick up the phone the motor came back to life and the cherokees backup lights shone brightly against the blinds slats of light flooded the room as she hung her head cursing herself for squandering such a chance the sound of the motor mixed with the hum of the refrigerator and the rush of blood across her eardrums and finally faded completely for the next twenty minutes she sobbed beneath a blanket entirely alone as the low rumble of a vehicle broke the silence she knew it had to be him and she mentally thanked him for giving her a second chance she hurried to a mirror and worked on her face wondering if it could be salvaged a car door thumped shut she did the best she could some tissue to the eyes some lipstick and she headed to the door to greet him walt and beatrice ascended the hill trail the dog working ahead of him swinging left and right in unpredictable patterns her nose to the ground the only discernible sounds were her huffing and snorting as she vacuumed the pine straw he would never understand how the seemingly random nature of a dogs scenting could produce results but hed witnessed it too many times to doubt its success the only command hed given her had been find it a birding command that had been honed and modified by trainers to have her search out a human scent dead or alive she could do so with laser precision given her current agitated state she had not yet locked onto any scent of importance a fact that had walt looking over his shoulder back at the lights of the engleton place and up the slope toward the ridge that led to hillabrands without gillys silence the more intelligent strategy would have been to work beatrice up that ridge attempting to pick up the intruders scent but gillys wellbeing trumped any such notion he pushed himself more quickly up the hill burdened by the added weight and encumbrance of the emergency backpack and by carrying the shotgun in his right hand his radio called himbackup was just arriving to the cherokee fifteen to twenty minutes behind him beatrice stopped abruptly and lifted her head walt paused as well watching her she scented the air looked back at him her eyes iridescent in the glare of his headlamp and then continued on false alarm a quarter mile later he broke off trail and beatrice extended her search area ensuring they werent leaving a scent behind soon she was working ahead of him again her paws crunching her nose sucking and snorting she would disappear for a few minutes and then circle back to measure his pace and reestablish herself he would cluck for her letting her know hed seen her it was too dark and he was in too big a hurry to do any tracking he left all the work up to her his thoughts wandered back to fiona and a series of mental photographs in his minds eye the dark shape of her huddled on the couch the chair misplaced in the center of the room the absolute dark of the placeboth the cottage and the main house without a single light inside but the motionsensing exterior lights working the calm of the pond the night sounds all around him had he seen her car he thought it had been there but couldnt remember its exact location why had kira been hiding behind that tree with a baseball bat beatrice circled back from the dark and nudged his hand shed found something how long had she been gone one or two minutes walt picked up his pace and in her excitement she rushed ahead of him and out of the glare of his headlamp thirty seconds later she reappeared and returned to nudge his hand her tail beating furiously good girl find it find it he was jogging now the backpack bouncing the funnel of light in front of him setting everything in the forest in motion as shadows stretched and danced his boots crunched on the trail his breathing was raspy and heightened he recognized his location he was just below the level ground of the illegal campsite bea had led him around to the northern edge there ahead of him was the unmistakable shape of a human form its back to a tree unmoving he whistled bea awayimagining it as a crime scene before he reached the corpse she jerked as if a rope had been attached returning to his side and heeling he reached down and patted her head gilly menquez came into the beam of the headlamp something in his hand at his side a gun a bottle of wine empty walt came to a stop in front of the man menquez was snoring passed out walt nudged him with the toe of his boot menquez snorted but didnt awaken walts eyes drifted back into the dark forest imagining the lights of the engleton place the black pearl of the small pond cut into the hill anger welled up in him he staggered back and slumped against a tree his radio already in hand fiona came awake to the rough sensation of angel licking her hand the bird songs told her it was early morning as she blinked repeatedly to clear her eyes as her fingers uncurled and absentmindedly stroked angel she became acutely aware of a hangover headache dry mouth and blurred vision she tried to sit up but the pain in her head cautioned her to take her time she reached back and felt a long horizontal knot along the base of her skull then looked up to see the edge of her kitchen counter directly above and connected the two to her left the collapsible footstool was overturned and this too fit into the picture angel took the opportunity to climb onto her chest and settle into a deep and satisfied purr and fiona continued to scratch her behind the ears she tried to think back to solve the mystery of finding herself lying on the floor with a lump on her head but nothing came to her only silence where an image should have been from that silence came the sound of a car but that had turned out to be waltor was that even the right night had there been a second car that same night had it been an altogether different night she lifted angel off and eased her to the floor and tried again to sit up this time managing to wedge her elbows under her her vision woozy she felt nauseated on the verge of throwing up and though the pain drummed intensely at the back of her skull radiating down through her and provoking the urge to retch she identified the vertigo and the unexplained silence as the source of her fear for the fear overcame her like a wave and drowned her as she vomited she hoped the purge might clear her head and help her to reorient herselfto remember something anything but it was as if someone had placed her there on the floor had played some awful trick on her abandoning her with no hints or clues about the cause of her condition that she was the object of a joke gone horribly awry the smell of the vomit disgusted her and made her move she sat up pushed away from it and struggled forward onto hands and knees if she hadnt felt the bump she would have sworn she was severely hungover and wouldnt have been surprised to find a nearempty bottle on the coffee table a few times in her life shed drunk herself into blackouts although not since college she couldnt imagine shed done this to herself but at that point she would have welcomed any explanation anything would have been better than the mental silence that stretched as an empty bridge between her present condition and whatever had come before she struggled to her feet and keeping a hand out on the back of a stool a wall and a doorknob found her way into the bathroom where she undressed and showered the blurriness of her vision came and went and when she threw up for a second time she told herself to get to the hospital not trusting her own ability to drive she called over to the main house hoping for kira but she never picked up with the hospital less than a mile away she moved slowly toward her subaru only to realize she was wearing only her bathrobe she turned and admired her cottage as if seeing it for the first time the driveway of mexican pavers formed a kind of courtyard between the main house and her cottage and there was something there something that connected everything again she tried to fill the void of what had come before the fallfor having found no bottle or evidence of drink she assumed shed tripped over the footstool her brain was functioning enough to tell her that the only viable explanation for the knot on her head was that shed been walking backward at the time away from something and that it must have been something compelling to keep her attention off the footstool behind her but as she drove off the property even these thoughts became difficult to recall she couldnt firmly place where shed been when she woke up she touched her hair and found it wet but didnt remember having taken a shower she clutched the wheel more tightly whiteknuckled focusing on the car and road like when shed driven solo for the first time that was her only glimmer of hope she could recall the moment with absolute claritysixteen years old and terrified her father in the passenger seat she convinced herself she wasnt going out of her mindonly that shed just lost a very important piece of it a piece she hoped like hell to reclaim looking out his back window at the sway of the aspens in a light breeze walt recalled a time when his two girls had played just as they were now but with another woman by their sides he was grateful for lisas help her tireless patience her willingness to both discipline and comfort the girls but he would have preferred gail despite all her failings as a mother the night before he and the girls had watched a dvd that had landed on his office desk a documentary about a mongolian camel who wanted nothing to do with her offspring the story had had a happy ending a prayer a reunion of mother and child and a weeping camel there would be no happy ending for his family for his daughters from now on the girls would be shuttled between two lives two very different households and no matter how hard he tried to explain it it would be up to them to sort it all out to make sense of the fractures they would encounter for years to come he hoped to be the glue to hold it all together to mend the fractures or at least keep them from widening he could keep the daytoday routine working he knew routine respected its importance but watching lisa laugh and play with themon their levelhe couldnt help but see fiona out thereall four of them out there laughing and teasing and rebuilding something it was absurd to make such a jump but now that hed crossed one line the other wasnt so hard the distance not so great hed clear a day soon and take the girls campingalthough theyd probably prefer the shopping malls in boise or maybe shopping and a movie and a motel with a pool you okay it was lisa he hadnt seen her approaching yeah good real good he said you looked a little zoned i think i just came to an important realization he said ive been laboring under this notion that the girls and i need to suffer because gails gone you showed me something out there just now me fun is fun he said were going to start having fun around here i like the sound of that lisa said and i know the girls will too thank you he said to her making sure she felt his sincerity youve practically been living here for far too long thats going to change no problem she said she turned to call the girls walt caught himself glancing at the wall phone and thinking of fiona two nights had passed since the hillabrand intruder and still nothing but a few voice mails back and forth shed been pleasant enough but not gushing and hed expected gushing she wasnt feeling well but didnt want him visiting he tried to take it in stride it wasnt easy he debated leaving her yet another message but couldnt imagine a more adolescent move he returned to the office and sat at his desk unable to keep his eye off the phone and email he read over a proposal currently in front of the county commissioners to privately host the dalai lama in sun valley an outdoor event expected to draw an audience of between twenty and fifty thousand with at least ten thousand coming from out of town there was no way his small office could manage the traffic and simultaneously guarantee the dalai lamas safety no way he was going to turn over that responsibility to a private security firm as was being proposed he nearly began drafting an email but changed his mind it could wait he reviewed other paperwork instead a man held in their drunk tank had suffered convulsions and was attempting to sue the county a suspected rapist needed transfer to ada county he signed some paperwork sent a few emails and made several calls but each time he reached for the phone he thought of her and debated driving out to her place again nancy his assistant stood in his doorway a bodys been found mile marker one twentyfive some kids an adoptahighway crew discovered it tommy brandon responded and called it in says it isnt pretty walt checked the clock he was scheduled to pick up the seattle detective boldt at the airport okay tell him im on my way walt said and have someone meet that flight and get the sergeant settled will you please no problem typically news of any death ran a feeling of dread through him as he always thought first of his late brother but that wasnt the case he was instead unusually grateful to be called away from his desk to be rid of the monotony on the way out the door he took one last look at his desk phone longing and call kenshaw he added trying to make it sound like an afterthought he appreciated the excuse to contact her tell her to bring her gear and meet us same with the coroner and barge levy and youd better check with meridian to test their availability the state crime lab would be involved if there was a determination of foul play on his way to the jeep cherokee he identified a lightness to his step and tried to suppress it several cars and trucks lined the breakdown lanes on both sides of state highway fionas subaru was not among them parked on the shoulder behind brandons cruiser were two pickup trucks one with six boy scouts in the truck bed all armed with pokers and dayglo garbage bags he felt bad that theyd discovered the body and urged brandon to release them and get them the hell away from here brandon had cobbled together a police tape barrier using a real estate sign a lug wrench and a broken ski pole as fence posts walt spotted the body at the epicenter of the confined area he ordered beatrice to stay in the jeep she smeared her nose against the glass drawing chinese characters desperate to join him the lower third of the thousandfoot mountain a scree field of broken red rock terminated thirty yards from the highway where it joined a field of brown sunbaked weeds and buffalo grass the open eyes of the dead body had there been any would have looked up at the red of the rock the full saturation of the evergreens and an impossibly blue sky that was the hallmark of high mountain living some kind of facelift walt said approaching the body it had been severely preyed upon i havent messed with him brandon said wanted to wait for you but its pretty obvious we wont be matching that face with any missing person reports walt neared the haphazardly installed police tape theres a set of tire tracks so tread lightly brandon said i see em walt dodged the tire treads and kneeled its a truck a pickup maybe he studied the lay of the grass three no four kids and an adult approached the body that is if you came in from over there he pointed i did walt parted some grass and used a stick to lift some of the matted weeds the predators were a family of fox and a dog the size of a labrador the dog was running might have been after the fox not our john doe the body appeared to have been tossed into a tangle of twigs and weeds that ran along the base of the scree field which was piled four feet high in places and stretched out sixty yards or more instead of eyes two bloodblack holes stared up a piece of the nose was missing hed been a big mansixfour or five twoseventy fit wide shoulders huge thighs in what had to be customtailored jeans walt declined to move the body until he had some decent photos as if on cue fionas subaru pulled up she climbed out waved at walt and went around back to collect her gear he remembered her saying that their moment together wouldnt interfere with their professional work but there was something wrong about her not answering any of his calls or emails and now showing up all sunny and bright in fact he resented it and had brandon not been there he would have rushed over to her and demanded some answers it was then he realized he was going to be the one to have a hard time keeping this professional as walt stood there his mind reeling brandon had the good sense to direct her around the side of the ropedoff area and to help her over the security tape she looked tired but determined to appear otherwise hi there she said as if they were neighbors running into each other in the supermarket uhhh walt said good god she staggered back as she spotted the body among the sticks and debris she glanced sharply at walt back to the body over at brandon back to the body she looked afraid and confused and as if she might be sick dear god she took another step back kneeled and retched when she looked up she had tears in her eyes he took one quick step toward her wanting to comfort her but caught himself like a runner coming off the blocks before the gun you okay should have warned you sorry about that you dont have to do this he said brandon looked at him like he was crazy walt never excused anyone from a crime scene especially not the photographer someones got to take the pictures brandon said speaking what he was thinking brandon lacked the social filter that came on standard model human beings he tended to say whatever entered his head im okay she said i can do it you dont look okay walt said you get used to it brandon said trying for sympathetic but sounding brutish her tears hit walt the hardest hed forgotten how horribly a dead body could impact the uninitiated she busied herself keeping her attention on the contents of her camera bag as she switched lenses and checked filters her hands shook to where she dropped a lens she scrambled to recover it blowing onto and fogging its glass and inspecting it but all with the exaggerated movements of someone who knew she was being watched walt heard a car door shut and turning in that direction felt the hair rise on the nape of his neck as a silhouette of a massive figure stood on the pavements edge behind the man a sheriffs cruiser had joined the breakdown lane and now the commanding silhouette made sense and walt raised a hand toward sergeant lou boldt he experienced both exhilaration and dread the teacher had walked in on his unfinished science project torn between wanting to comfort fiona and welcoming the sergeant walt moved toward the highway boldt came down the embankment he was broadshouldered somewhere in his late forties his graying closecropped haircut a throwback to the s his head appeared oversized a condition emphasized by his short neck a pair of reading glasses hung around that neck bouncing off a red tie and crisp white shirt framed by a brown sport coat threadbare at the sleeves as he drew closer to walt a warmth filled his pale gray eyes he reminded walt of a husky or wolf they shook hands vigorously like longlost friends boldt towering over walt his voice was deep but surprisingly gentle for such a big man i hope im not intruding walt thought how much more impressive the man was in person compared to a chat window on a computer monitor not at all walt said both men knew he was lying never been one to sit around a motel room i know the feeling you mind he asked nodding toward the crime scene walt waved him forward and glanced at fiona wondering how she was doing wondering if shed give him some look some sign that she was indeed the same woman whod freelyhungrilyshared herself with him only a few days before but she maintained her professional demeanor her head in her gearor maybe she was still too overcome by the sight of the body to look up boldt accepted introductions and then went silent almost reverent as he approached the body he didnt comment on the amateur job of the tape barrier he didnt make small talk with fiona or brandon instead he looked left and right studied the ground as walt had done took in the tangle of branches and brambles that partly concealed the body dont let me get in the way he finally said to walt happy to have you walt lied wishing hed had a few minutes more alone with the body before boldt had arrived boldt stepped closer moving slowly and deliberately i hate outdoor scenes he said give me a nice small apartment any time a lot of variables walt said far too many the mans precaution impressed walt the tentativeness of each step the scrutiny of his surroundings brandon caught walts eye and raised an eyebrow also impressed coyotes boldt asked a family of fox and a goodsized dog walt answered did that hawk have a role in it boldt asked hed caught walt by surprise a situation that brought a flush to his face boldt pointed out a matted mess of reddish feathers and bloodstained down ten yards south at the edge of the tangle of avalanche debris redtail walt said identifying it immediately looks fresh youre right he instructed brandon to bag the dead bird and brandon looked anything but thrilled you think he was thrown in there walt asked kind of looks it boldt said are those tire tracks from a pickup truck well need to pull a tape to confirm it but id say so hes a big boy boldt said hell of a throw from that distance got that right odd place to dump a body if thats what were looking at boldt said one eye cast toward the highway all the open country youve got around here and a person chooses the side of the highway he could have been hiking could have come down the side of the mountain but there are no real trails along this stretch and if hed been bushwhacking his socks where theyre exposed would be covered in cheat grass and be carrying good old idaho dust the socks are way too clean hes a messdont get me wrong but he wasnt hiking i like the way you think boldt said a guy like boldt would never see the accident first he would look for foul play invent it from a dozen different scenarios and then slowly and willingly backtrack to settle on accidental death or natural causes but only much later maybe walt said someone did him in the vehicle panicked and dumped him here more an act of passion works for me he didnt sound at all convinced and walt wondered why hed thrown that out there better to keep his lips zipped around boldt as boldt moved to his right dropped to a knee and then stood back up walts resentment over the intrusion gave way to admiration it was like watching a bigleague hitter at batting practice listen boldt said do what it is you do dont let me interfere we would normally wait for fionams kenshawto give us the goahead walt replied when shes through with him in this position wed roll him and look for id and go inch by inch for evidence im making you uncomfortable boldt said dead bodies make me uncomfortable not visiting detectives fiona relaxed the camera im done until i can get closer gloves walt asked boldt producing a pair of surgical gloves and offering them to his guest but boldt waved him off and reaching into the pocket of his sport coat withdrew a pair im going to play up the significance of the tire tracks and try to work them into the story so for now fiona give me whatever you can of the tracks and stay well clear of them if possible brandon youll help me roll the body well go after it from the other side fiona make sure to get closeups of the sticks and all this stuff around him whats all this rock and debris from landslide boldt asked snow slides walt explained each winter we see slides all along here a number of deer and elk are found as it melts each spring lovely the slides shove all the years deadfall the smaller live trees you name it down ahead of them rock scree and everything else piles up here at the bottom looks like a bomb hit boldt said pretty close to that boldt processed what hed been told filing it away you could see the guy thinking over his entire career walt had investigated a dozen suspicious or criminal deaths boldt probably handled that many per month in a bad month and had been doing so for a quarter century brandon established a route up through the detritus and led the way for fiona who climbed tentatively walt could tell by the way she moved that she still wasnt herself she should have taken his offer to walk away from this one he could have faked his way through some pictures you noticed the redtail walt said the hawk he clarified anything else ive missed fiona was down on one knee taking pictures partially obscured by the upended branches head down she was either adjusting a setting on the camera or struggling for composure could it be an accidental death boldt asked this location absolutely but the boots and clothes dont look exactly right boldt said searching for what walt had been getting at theyd stop me from making too hasty a ruling if thats what youre asking it is for the first time in several minutes boldt stepped closer to the pile of bramble and sticks i might bag his head and hands and feet boldt allowed clearly reluctant to say anything paper bags prior to rolling him moving a person that size moving him out of there is going to be an adventure bound to shake a few leaves off the tree tommy walt called out paper bags brandon said got it back of my cherokee if you dont have them left side in the backpack im on it fiona met eyes with walt through the tangle of twigs still looking slightly pale and definitely disoriented he wished there were something he could do for her he wanted to dismiss her and allow her to get away from looking closeup through a lens at the man with the missing eyes her own eyes were distant and unfocused he wasnt sure she even saw him maybe thats enough he said to her we can take it from here she shook her head im good she said a big guy like this doesnt go down easy boldt said no the head wound right at the scalp line theres not enough blood postmortem maybe occurred when they tossed him they is the operative word a guy that size it would take two might have been robbery said brandon returning with the paper bags and tape check out the tan line on his left wrist yes i saw that too boldt said not just a missing watch but a big watcha very big watch a tag heuer maybe something like that you tell him about the breakins brandon asked walt dressed down his deputy with a single look he had no intention of running down every active case hes referring to a pair of bandes in the area made to look like bears probably some itinerants we get a lot of that in summers more so this year because of the economy but doubtful he was out hiking boldt said repeating what hed been told boldt looked up the inhospitable scree face of the mountain low cumulus clouds moved swiftly north to south against the static edge of the mountain peak it was disorienting for a moment it appeared the mountain was moving not the clouds walt wasnt buying the hiking theory there were no established trails up there where the trees met the scree field he didnt expect a city cop to understand it but he wasnt going to repeat himself he could invent a story to explain the tire tracks the driver could have veered off road to avoid hitting a deer the tracks having nothing to do with the body or a driver might have spotted the body and not knowing what it was driven over for a closer look and then taken off or the pickup might have dumped the body get the name of the boy scout leader the guy driving those kids and lets get them out of here walt instructed brandon we dont want them seeing us rolling him this is bad enough already maybe the medical examiner would be able to tell a better story bruising might fill in some of this walt said true enough he and boldt moved through the thicket of tumbled debris and approached the body from uphill brandon walt shouted get a tarp back of the cherokee brandon waved more cars slowed he saw people using their cell phones to take pictures boldt saw it too as they waited for the tarp he pointed out a dirt track that led to a nursery south of their position well canvass the area and put something out on the radio walt said this is the one and only road up and down the valley we could easily have a witness to the truck running off the shoulder when brandon returned with the tarp the three men positioned it and then rolled the body the back of the skull was staved the blunt force had been delivered by something fairly wide long and solid well theres our cause of death boldt said those jeans are worth a weeks pay brandon said spotting the leather tag on the belt loop and those boots are van gorkoms custom made mountain trekkers fifteen hundred a pop ouch boldt said so the guy was a clotheshorse apparently not the only one walt said ive never heard of van gorkoms hes wearing what size fifteen brandon said guys like him and me we cant buy stuff off the rack but you dont wear van gorkoms boldt said me a saddlemaker in shoshone makes my hiking boots theyre okay but they dont last and they give me blisters when im breaking them in i dont think the detective actually cares tommy a fade line on the back pocket of the blue jeans suggested a wallet but as walt searched for it he came up emptyhanded missing billfold missing watch boldt said walt shook his head a carjacking gone bad boldt suggested probably the best explanation were going to get on what weve got walt said hating to admit it it was his vehicle youre saying brandon sounded impressed a hitchhiker maybe or someone fakes a breakdown and gets this guy to pull over guy gets out to help and gets a tire iron on the back of the skull for being the good samaritan they get a wallet a watch and an suv and the whole things over in three minutes they hit him a little hard and dump the body as quickly as possible boldt said the sleeves of the dead mans shirt were both torn and walt reached to open the one on the left arm wider revealing a sloppy tattoo it looked like two initials kk he tore the shirt slightly wider another poorly delineated tattoo of a fatcheeked cherub beneath a storm cloud blowing up a storm walt thought he heard fiona gasp as she took several more shots of the overturned body drawn by the sound walt looked over at her but she wouldnt come out from behind the camera her hands were shaking too much for the shots to be any good he shouldnt have asked her for the closeups hed been thoughtless and cruel and he wished it was just the two of them so he could apologize thats enough pictures he saidtoo little too late he wanted her out of here you can wrap it up if you can have them to me sometime tomorrow morning no problem sheriff if brandon caught her use of his title instead of his christian name he did a good job of hiding it though walt heard how wrong it sounded coming from her mouth walt didnt want brandon having anything on him and wondered if hed already fallen behind in the count fiona replaced the lens cap and negotiated her way back toward her car going the long way around to avoid the cordonedoff area that sure looks like a prison tat boldt said suggests his prints will id him i know who it is walt declared as it added up for him he looks familiar to me too brandon said believing walt meant to name a local man but i cant place him new orleans saints walt said he knew brandon was a football fan goddamn youre right the gale force marvin gale linebacker martel walt said not marvin he and boldt had previously discussed vincent wynns accusations surrounding the paroled linebacker thats him boldt said sounding gravely disappointed he nodded assessing the size of the man and adding in the crudely drawn tattoos of course i think we can rule out a carjacking walt said he felt her before he took her in fiona standing on the shoulder of the highway by her subaru the wind tossing her hair arms at her sides shoulders sagged in resignation overcome by the sight of death no doubt saddened but she also seemed to be waiting for him he wondered he hoped he ached to go to her to leave this to say something she climbed into the car and drove away walt and boldt approached the nursery on foot down a dirt track a quarter mile south of the body the sun shone brightly sparking off the plastic tarps of the six footlong hothouses curved over the garden beds like small quonset huts a beatup green pickup truck was parked at the end where the track widened into a bulb a miniature backhoe sat outside a barn shed big enough for two vehicles next to the shed stood an old halfsized airstream trailer with dirty windows and an open padlock hanging from a rusted hasp walt pounded on the door as boldt wandered over and looked inside the nearest hothouse heck of an operation boldt said nothing much grows here without a lot of help and a little luck walt said twenty below in the winter high nineties in the summer dry as a bone the door was answered by a sleepyeyed woman in her midthirties whod seen too much sun and too little of the hairdresser her forest green golf shirt carried a logo of a tree beneath which was stitched golden eagle nursery help you sheriff hope so walt said she descended the rough wooden steps shorter than walt sinewy and lean maggie sharp she said shaking his hand walt introduced boldt as a colleague from seattle just visiting boldt said whats up whats with all the cars up there were wondering if any time in the past couple of days you saw a pickup truck go off the west shoulder of the highway up there i dont know no anything you can tell us would help walt said sensing the womans hesitation you wont be involved personally wasnt my truck she said as boldt walked over to the vehicle no walt said wider tires than your chevy boldt looked over silently impressed walt had already scouted the truck theres no law against driving off the road walt said forcing a smile wasnt me she said her tone unnecessarily defensive i think weve already established that so youre the closest to the area maybe you saw some people up there somethinganythinggoing on at night perhaps boldt said having joined them i dont work nights here who said i work nights boldt and walt met eyes boldt said a neighbor of yours someone in golden eagle thought they saw a pickup on the left side of the road but seeing how this road of yours leads in here were thinking they might have seen your truck and confused it with the truck were interested in walt shot boldt a quizzical look where had he come up with that piece of fiction is that right her eyes told them both she was buying herself time lights on vehicles can play tricks with the eye at night walt said depth perception if it was your truck and not the truck were interested in that helps why would i be here at night maggie sharp asked its not like anyones paying overtime around here i work a tenhour shift five days a week six oclock comes around im gone i appreciate the job and all dont get me wrong not a lot of jobs going around right now im not complaining im just saying if it was after six it wasnt me okay boldt said that makes sense enough how bout your boss one of your coworkers at night listen if there was a freeze warning or something maybe and the sheriff can tell you we get hard freezes every month of the year but a lot fewer since global warming right and none in the past month or so its a hot summer hot and even drier than usual these things hold up in the thunderstorms walt asked looking out across the hothouses they do okay she said we had a pretty decent storm a couple nights back he recalled hailed didnt it her eyes narrowed she sensed a trap but couldnt see it clearly i cant speak for the owner she said all i can tell you is if someone saw a pickup after six it wasnt me wasnt mine okay okay so we should talk to the owner boldt said about a truck being seen here at night no i mean sure thats up to you right what do i care and yet she did seem to care both men sensed her misgivings if you remember anything walt said were in the book yeah i think i can find you the smile didnt work on her face as out of place as the attempted confidence in her voice the men thanked her walt and boldt walked back up the road toward the highway howd you know it wasnt her truck boldt asked youre walking on it walt said noticed on the way in that there were only two trucks using this very much a pickup with narrower rubberhersand a dually probably a delivery truck there are some other tracks mixed in but theyre older for the most part and theyre all passenger cars not pickups more to this country sheriff thing than i might have thought boldt said i take a lot of heat from my father hes exbureau as you maybe already know he thinks im wasting my time here a big day for us is a bar brawl to each their own you have kids two girls twins eleven going on fifteen good place for them i imagine why im here not everybody gets that boldt said you boy and girl about the same age if i could figure out how to live in a place like this he said looking into the sky yeah nobrainer so i get it if you ever feel like retiring walt said he meant it more as a joke but he thought how valuable a person like boldt would be on a contractual basis and it gave him some new ideas hed taken to the guy immediately hed prepared himself for some holierthanthou city detective was stunned to find the man so approachable whatd you think of her boldt asked not much afraid of something the badge i suppose get a lot of that up here you same wasnt buying her so adamant about not working nights yeah so we know two things boldt said she saw something and she saw it at night walt said and thats a problem for her and us and us walt agreed boldt stopped near the middle of the dirt track and spun slowly in a full circle jeez he said he drew in a deep breath and took in so much air he coughed youve got to be kidding me walt took in the panorama of sagecovered hills evergreens and blue sky forget to look sometimes he admitted no property in sight with any kind of view walt realized boldt had been assessing the likelihood of witnesses i dont often canvass he explained well work the local media put the word out my guys will go doortodoor in golden eagle rainbow bend and maybe some of gimletall nearby subdivisions therere a couple private ranches tucked up behind the mountain on this side thats why there arent any trails up theretheres a lot of deeded ground they reached the highway shoulder and turned north toward the cars scattered off the road a truck going off the highway at night walt said this stretch is lousy with elk and deer we see more than a fair share of accidents and rolls right here you think he may have been on foot boldt asked someone swerves away from a deer and hits this guy on the side of the road maybe swipes him guy goes down headfirst walt said it wouldnt take much then why wouldnt martha stewart back there tell us what she saw walt bit back a smile were going to get along okay walt said ill be out of your hair day after tomorrow boldt reminded what if i beg walt said boldt grinned the two men walked north cars slowing to rubberneck the cop cars walt needed to assemble a team to walk the field alert for cigarette butts beer cans litter of any kind then he remembered that the boy scouts had been collecting litter at the time of the discovery and he took off running up the road reaching for his radio and calling through to brandon boldt trailed behind in no particular hurry already scheming how he might extend his stay along with three deputies walt moved carefully through the litter strewn across the plastic sheets taped to the motor pools garage floor the four piles of trash were kept separate in quadrants designated by blue painters tape piece by piece the bits of highwayside litterbeer cans cigarette butts and packs newspaper fast food and even a withered condom or twowere carefully dragged and moved away from where the four bright orange bags had been dumped it did not escape walt that these piles possibly represented his best and only chance at nailing a killer that a bunch of wellmeaning children had collected what might be his only hard evidence in the case it was seven pm well past walts usual office hours something not lost on his subordinates and no doubt adding to their concerted efforts the mood originally lightened with trash jokes had turned serious as time wore on walt kept his head down using a wooden poker to separate the garbage into three different piles useless personal possible dna corn chip bags and fast food went into useless anything with handwriting or printing into personal empty beer and soda cans cigarette butts the condoms into possible dna the boy scouts had done a thorough job and though walt had assigned five of his deputies into the same field to collect evidence he didnt anticipate them finding much nancy had stayed late as well without any discussion she arrived at walts side carrying a piece of paper in her right hand and walt knew what it was without asking on this day there was only one piece of paper one piece of information that would bring her out to the garage in person alps he called across the garage his voice reverberating off the corrugated steel roof automated latent print system she nodded its him she said walt churned an odd combination of dread and relief pleased that hed gotten it right disturbed by the confirmation martel gale notify boldt he said see if he wants to grab dinner walt couldnt remember the last time hed sat down to dinner oneonone with another guy never mind that it was a business dinner somehow that didnt matter it wasnt political it wasnt family it wasnt required hed chosen to be here boldt was a commanding presence whether standing over a dead body or sitting across the table at zou an upscale asian restaurant on the north end of haileys main street his size accounted for much of it as did his being easily mistaken for brian dennehy that sense of celebrity that he carried but more than that it was the intensity that he radiated a kind of force field that made even the loudest talker whisper instead that caused children to stare and adults to speculate on who this person might be walt accustomed to drawing looks whenever he wore the uniform knew to ignore the gaping but with boldt at the table he became all the more aware that the two of them were the center of attention they waded through the requisite small talk some sharing about family their mutual love of the outdoors and whidbey island a place boldt liked to vacation and where walt occasionally visited his father very occasionally i read the transcript of one of your lectures walt said the victim speaks if youre willing to listen dont hold it against me im not much of a speaker i found it interesting and i have to say i practice most of what you preach ive got nothing new to say believe me rehashing old ideas is all what does martel gale tell us now that we know its him we covered some good scenarios earlier boldt said the watch and the wallet could be a smoke screen could be for real vincent wynn threatened to kill the man and take his chances with the courts walt reminded theyd reviewed this during an earlier skype conversation i have to say it plays several ways when we factor in caroline vetta maybe carolines killer is dead or maybe hes an easy scapegoat or maybe wynn or boatwright had their own reasons for taking out gale that had nothing to do with caroline or maybe it had everything to do with carolinethat one of them attributed her death to gale and brought their own brand of justice to the table we have six pieces of trash that might carry dna walt said thats discounting the beer and pop cans because they can be so tricky for the lab twelve including the cans too expensive to run those without a suspect boldt said walt shrugged not sure he wouldnt resort to that at some point the existence of a national dna database for felons made it all the more tempting then theres your bandes boldt said the possibility this guy ran into the wrong guy in the woods we should conclude our canvassing tomorrow walt said maybe we pick up something and our plea to drivers will be on the morning news theres a good chance someone saw something its a busy highway but im not holding my breath you want to sit in on my interview with wynn tomorrow its fine with me appreciate it lets see about that were withholding gales identification id like to keep that quiet for a day or two which would allow you to interview both boatwright and wynn without them the wiser maybe ill accompany youdrive youand talk to some of his neighbors with that threat he made made to my face it would be irresponsible not to pursue but the interview is yours gives you the upper hand if you change your mind thanks the tire tracks the tread is being crossreferenced we got some markers on one of the rightside tires if we find the truck we can tie it to the scene but were a long way from pulling a sales receipt and identifying a suspect a long way they worked through their entrées boldt ordered a glass of milk and as it arrived drew more curious looks from the neighboring tables walt had a second beer what am i missing walt asked what am i not doing that you would do im not looking at this critically boldt said but if you were but im not listen i respect jurisdiction believe me that work you did on that dirt driveway i couldnt have done that youre better at this than i am false modesty aside anything else occur to you boldt ate some more of his teriyaki chicken and pushed aside the pickled seaweed i work with a criminal psychologist a woman named daphne matthews who has a way of drilling down into a victim along the same lines i do but all from inside the head instead of the evidence a case like this with so many moving parts the possible relationship to caroline vetta the complication with wynns threat if it was in my house id bring her in and have her work up gale shes been working vetta since that happened and maybe shed pick up an overlap who knows but in terms of police workthe grunt stuffim right with you so far i wouldnt lose sight of that nursery though like you it move down my list especially with limited manpower and resources can we ask her to look into gale or is that something i shouldnt ask it relates to vetta as far as im concerned i can ask her to do that absolutely ive only worked with a profiler a couple of times and only once when i had a suspect in custody shes not a profiler not exactly whats interesting about matthews is shes able to tell you who the victim was where the victim was emotionally in and around the death she can run a background on a suspect and give you a percentage of probability thats uncanny she has a heck of a track record all of that would help yeah it couldnt hurt youll make the call i will said boldt you ought to try the seaweed walt said its way better than it looks not a chance boldt said sipping the milk and savoring it as if a fine wine you dont look comfortable the woman said fiona glanced around the office at the medical school degrees the photos of views from several different mountain peaksher eye critical of the photography im not youve been to counseling before i have a few years ago it wasnt fun this isnt then the woman cautioned she was small and thin and her gray hair was cut like a mans for an instant fiona wondered about her sexual orientation then wondered why she would think such a thing the thing is its just that theres this blank spot and i want it back i thought everything would come back within a day or two sadly no head injury can affect memory both short term and long term i define short term as the past thirty minutes even though only a little over a day the blank spot youre talking about would be considered long term i dont remember what happened where i was what was going on i dont even remember falling down just waking up with angel licking me not unusual it is if youre on my side of it yes and we can address that anxiety i meant strictly medically speaking i dont want to address it i want it back and it will come back it nearly always does ive had patients whove been in traffic accidents lose anywhere from a few minutes up to several months before the accident but it has always come back there are exercises you can do and if its not entirely physical fiona asked emotions can block memory absolutely if thats what youre asking fear can alter memory a man comes into a bank waving a gun at five people and youll get five different explanations of what happened very common and if the man then pistolwhips one of the five are you suggesting someone hurt you someone caused your injury the woman leaned forward in her chair and spoke more softly it says i read it was an accident it was an accident im sure but i dont remember thats all youre safe here fiona you can talk to me nothing leaves this room that you dont want to have leave this room you need to know that to trust that its nothing like that katherine studied her thoughtfully how are you sleeping not great memory is affected by sleep and fatigue as well these exercises can they bring back those missing minutes they will help you retain your current memories the best thing for those missing minutes is to get you back on track to get the injury behind you and your life moving forward the brain has an amazing capacity to fill in to catch back up to reboot you were unconscious for a period of time how long we dont know you awoke and it was morning yes so youd been out the entire night id been sleeping we dont know that what you call sleep may have been the result of the trauma that kind of concussion severe head injury can do strange things to memory whats the last thing you recall that night if we establish the bookends we may be able to fill in the inbetween a car in the driveway i remember that the voice of a friend of mine i think but i cant say for sure can you check with this friend ask if he or she came to see you he i suppose so he may have talked to you do you think is it possible that no not him no he didnt push me or hurt me or anything if thats what youre going to ask and youre sure positive then id ask him fiona nodded do you remember having a conversation with him no its more like i hear him calling me im not sure that isnt wishful thinking its all very dreamlike doesnt seem so real you know id check with him yeah is there a reason you havent done that already fiona felt a spike of heat in her face and hoped katherine wouldnt see it but the woman didnt miss much are these the emotions you were referring to katherine asked its complicated fiona said the point being that there can easily be two elements to the memory loss physical and emotional if you can get past the emotional the physical may repair faster what if i dont want to know can memory loss protect us absolutely discounting the physical organic element to such loss we believe thats a major factor obscuring the memory of the original incident the painful physical trauma its too much to face at first the body has to heal has to put distance between itself and the accident before the brain allows us to relive it but it does come back it will and if its too much to face what then i get the feeling fiona that you know much more than youre sharing its okay to share your fears your suspicions thats what im here for please dont prejudge yourself dont think you can shock me or that ill judge you in any way for what youre thinking it doesnt work like that im here to help im equipped to deal with whatever you may throw at me i want to help you please fiona stared back through fearful eyes the man involved tell me about him no thank you you said hes a friend more than a friend yes but just recently the night no but recent and youre afraid to ask him if he came by if he called for you i can see that you dont want to sound needy you dont want to sound injured or damaged it isnt that then its katherine viewed her compassionately complicated she said i explained that hes married something like that no i mean yes but no not like that youre sure im good to the contrary you wouldnt be here if you were good i could suggest we meet again soon that you contact your friend and see if anything he tells you helps at all i can prescribe a sleep medication if you no thank you as you wish fiona glanced at her wristwatch i have plenty of time katherine said but im a student of body language and i can tell when a patient wants out it shows you could have gotten most of this off the internet maybe did for all i know that leads me to believe you came here wanting more than the wikipedia version of memory loss youve suggested there could very well be an emotional component and yet are reluctant to discuss what that may involve you were pushed or hit and you have memory of a man calling your name and i must say you display some of the indications of an abused or battered woman including your steadfast refusal that this friend of yours could ever do such a thing to you thats textbook fiona i know that because because i know that she said from experience katherine said correct me if im wrong fiona stared angrily youre wrong she said okay im wrong its complicated that doesnt forgive anything nor does it usually explain it no i dont imagine so you probably get that a lot my work is to untangle the complicated to simplify to help you to simplify actually your brain can tie a knot across your memory fiona we work together to untie that knot and the memory may very well return much quicker and if i dont want the memory will you block it forever no i would doubt that no i didnt think so do you want my help i thought i did now im not so sure you have to want it fiona set her jaw fear is so elusive katherine said its a bit of a magician it can make itself appear much larger than it actually is its our unwillingness to look at it to confront it that allows this inflated presence most of the time when we face our fears we let the air out and realize there wasnt much to it after all and when its justified fiona asked well then its more complicated exactly fiona said but talking about it is where to start keeping these things inside given your current situation isnt going to help anything ill be honest with you your memory is going to come backthats my prediction based on a good deal of experience talking to me may or may not precipitate that return but your sharing your fears with me your discussion of the emotional context will greatly improve how you handle the memories when they do returnthis i can promise you dont need to do this alone but i do she said im here katherine said day or night im here fiona bit her lower lip because she felt it quivering felt her eyes well she stood from the chair offering her back to katherine and tried to keep calm as she walked out of the room you okay boldt asked from the jeeps passenger seat beatrice halfslept in the backseat rolling a lazy eye as the men spoke yeah sorry i petitioned the court about acquiring a dna sample and was turned down its a child abuse case the toughest there are right so im a little out of sorts understandably any way around it maybe might be i have an article of clothinga pair of panties but ultimately i need the embryos dna and thats apparently not going to happen and another scumbag remains out there something like that you can always lie to the bastard and hope he comes apart though such guys rarely do and never discount the value of a fine piece of entrapment any felony will do both men laughed into the windshield the offer still stands for you to sit in on the boatwright interview were good walt said you dont have to drive me around i can rent a car its my pleasure i thought i might canvass the neighbors or his employees about any knowledge of gale or visits to the house id like to start eliminating potential suspects that is with your permission dont need my permission boldt said other way around im the guest here and i appreciate your helping me out i wouldnt mind talking to matthews walt said if you think thats possible easily arranged i can pay her if necessary bring her over here if you think thats possible no need for that boldt said im sure shell be happy to help out if you nail down a suspect and the suspect is a tough nut you might want to bring her over shes extremely good at reading people and leveraging weaknesses in personalities but thats for down the road walt could see boldt went somewhere else staring out the side window at first he thought the landscape had grabbed him overcome him the way it could but the longer the silence went on the more walt suspected something else was going on that hed triggered something without having any idea about what hed done hell of a place you live sheriff boldt finally said at the end of a long sigh no man in his seventies looked like marty boatwright without the help of plastic surgery his watery eyes and the chicken skin on the backs of his hands gave him away he greeted both men meeting the jeep in the driveway then escorted boldt inside as walt parked the cherokee he imagined boldt would likely take that to the bankguys like marty boatwright didnt greet anyone in their driveway the impending interview had rattled the man and had put him on the defensive before it began the squarefoot log home sat on three acres carved out of a hill giving boatwright an unobstructed view of the warm springs side of the sun valley ski area the property was terraced into two cascading drops both supported by fourfoot stone walls with a narrow creek falling down waterfalls and collecting into a halfacre pond at the bottom just this side of the helicopter pad that had drawn the scorn of his neighbors on the bib of lawn that supported a large flagstone terrace and dining patio a garden worker struggled with an invasive tube root in the first of three successive flower beds a wheelbarrow topped with fresh soil sat alongside a tarp and a variety of garden tools hows it going walt said immediately sensing the mans unease not an atypical reaction he tried to soften the moment i have the same problem in my backyard walt said cant stop the things i transplanted one indigenous aspen seven years ago and theres not a day i dont curse the decision if id gone with one from a nursery they dont send out tap roots like them natives the indigenous their suckers come up everywhere and most of the time i let them be but not when they invade my flower beds youre replanting i am the man seemed more relaxed in july walt tried to sound interested instead of accusatory mr boatwright wanted it done bad timing tell me about it too hot in the days to get anything decent started the lilies were doing fine in my opinion ill fill it with annuals and worry about it next spring the other beds too who knows you follow the nfl baseball well let me tell you something you work for mr boatwright you learn that hes the coach and quarterback all in one he says you go deep you go deep or youre on the bench in my case that means the unemployment line so i go deep i hear you walt considered his approach you ever get to meet any players you kidding place is like a hotel anyone id know of the gardener seemed proud of his insiders position head coach and a couple of assistants up here last weekend i hear the commissioners coming in for the wine auction this year you know these guys sheriff dinner parties every night jump in the jet fly back hes a human yoyo and hes not getting any younger the guy liked to talk walt wasnt complaining any players he interviewed a couple wide receivers back around the time of the draft an offensive lineman the kid that book was written aboutthe blind sideabout the same time no one too recently at least that i know about leaning on his shovel the heavily suntanned man seemed grateful for the respite but youd have to check with maryhis executive secretary she should be around here someplace her office is on the lower level of the north wing id probably need a map got that right is he a good guy to work for i actually report to debbie one of marys three assistants i dont actually deal with mr boatwright debbies all right they basically give me an open budget its the dream job im overpaid i get great benefits and im pretty much left on my own wanna trade walt said he won a chuckle anything a sheriff should know about mr boatwright that i dont already know i told you its a dream job im interested in a linebacker a retired linebacker he would have come by sometime in the past couple days big guy obviously might have been alone might have been wearing jeans and a leather jacket name of martel gale the gale force shit id have recognized him i think loved watching that guy hit listen i dont see that many of the guests and to tell you the truth i dont pay that much attention unless i happen to get a look and recognize someone i like the sport so im kind of a major fan but i dont know half the faces of the guys who come here the girls thats different hard not to look at the girls you know what i mean girls or women ive said enough i should get back to work walt didnt look over his shoulder immediately but hed seen a flicker in the mans eyes and suspected hed caught someone eyeing them both mary perhaps or one of the three assistants walt felt tempted to ask about caroline vetta but he lacked a photo and it was boldts business not his you think you could check with debbie informal like if gale has been around in the past week i suppose he sounded surprised i could do it walt said not sure that he could but all im interested in is trying to get an autograph for my nephew trying to catch gale while hes still in town and when a sheriff asks something it becomes a big production and its not like that so it makes it kind of difficult i can see that ive already asked vince wynn but hes not on such good terms with gale the gardener turned away and went back to the struggle with the root i shouldnt be loafing he said was it the mention of wynn walt wondered or had the man received a second signal from within the house nice talking to you walt said ill ask if i can the gardener told the dugup flower bed im sure im not telling you anything you dont already know walt said but i was told water stops tap roots you put the offending tree on an island and thats the end of it the gardener lifted his head and eyed the only stand of aspen in rough grass between the lawn and the driveway i might be able to work with that he said just a thought walt said but his mind had made a leap to boatwright and wynn and the dead man gale like the trees if he and boldt could keep the men from extending their reach to their handlers and attorneys maybe theyd have half a chance to get some piece of the truth out of them the secret might be to isolate them but walt had no idea how to go about that given emails and cell phones and the intricacies of both mens businesses unless he could find a way to turn one against the other one of the two must at least have heard from gale whether or not they had a connection to the mans death given boatwrights reliance on a team of personal secretaries there might even be a paper trail to follow he walked the grounds wondering if gale had done the same some night after being refused an audience with boatwright wondering if that was what had happened to wynn the night the agent had fired his gun into the dark boldt climbed into the jeep forty minutes later and walt started up the motor and drove off the property everyone has secrets boldt finally muttered but this guy what a piece of work my guess is hes got a couple vaults full of them it went that well did it treated me like i was the water boy is there a connection to caroline vetta he knows a heck of a lot more than hes telling boldt said thats for sure but hes done so many deals for so many years has told so many lies that hes an expert or maybe hes so old he believes them are you done with him youre kidding right any chance youll subpoena his personal calendar gale thats what i was thinking walt admitted im told the secretaries run his life manage every minute of his time surround him it may very well come to that boldt said boldt lowered the window and put his hand outside his fingers outstretched in the wind beatrice sat up and nosed the back window and walt put his window down as well boldt raised his voice over the wind i subpoena someone like that and itll be a lot of court time before its finally ruled upon and ill only be refused everyones a football fan including judges but we both want both need the same thing his personal calendar so if i could find a way to get a look at his book youd benefit too id make sure of that have you got an angle no not yet but maybe wynn will give me onegive you one if he can connect gale to boatwright well one of the judges here hes the home plate umpire for our softball league whats that got to do with the price of oil boldt asked hates football walt said beatrice barked into the wind for a moment walt thought it might have been boldt despite the three full facelifts marty boatwrights neck flesh flapped like a luffing sail as he dialed out on his mobile phone a tall man with flinty eyes and a cleft chin hed been mistaken for a douglas most of his adult life first kirk and then michael it had been explained to him by one of his lawyers that mobile phones were digitally encrypted and therefore impossible to casually eavesdrop upon and though the government could monitor any conversation on any phone stiff warrant requirements meant mobile phones were the safest from unwanted ears so this call was made mobile to mobile its me he said as vince wynn answered hey marty that cop was just here coming here next i didnt tell him shit let my boys do the talking okay they dont know shit about her nothing but a fishing trip as far as i can tell seems like they think it was all sex and power whoring and how maybe there were fees involved means she must have deposited the money can you believe that what kind of dumb shit would bank the money caroline no names you asshole may have been a lot of things but she was not dumb youll be scratching that on a cell wall you dont get your act together im fine marty we both know what this is about yeah and whatever happened to her she we talked about this yeah but it doesnt have to involve us doesnt involve us no thats right so keep it that way of course hes clever this cop looks big and thick but hes anything but hes more howie long than lyle alzado got it consider your answers carefully thats all im saying im good marty if youre so good what the hell were you doing shooting your gun off the other night silence you thought i wouldnt hear about that the whole towns heard about that what kind of a dumbass thing it was a personal security matter marty a disgruntled former player they were warning shots is all who never mind keep the damn gun in the closet asshole we dont need any more attention than weve already got this thing her people are going to jail for this shit jail im talking about im aware of that not me you hear me not me so noted stick to oneword answers dont get creative that mouth of yours and youre under no obligation to stus here wynn said hell do all the talking stu well tell him hello for me ill do that hes a wolf in sheeps clothing be careful with this guy for your own sake i will be i negotiate for a living marty no one ever knows what the hell im thinking marty boatwright coughed out a laugh half his lung came up once it started he couldnt stop it he shut down the call without signing off and sank into his desk chair and weathered the storm of old age his eyes and nose running the depends warming at his crotch prison no way this isnt charity boldt stated as walt pulled the jeep up to the wrought iron gate blocking vince wynns driveway walt rolled down his window and announced himself to a speaker key code box far from it he said youd like in on this interview thats why the escort not entirely true walt said im interested in wynn for gale absolutely he threatened the man to my face and im curious as to how he reacts to your questioning about vetta absolutely i dont see a guy like vince wynn dumping a body alongside a highway especially not the busiest road youve got the bottom of a construction site maybe but more likely hed drive him or more likely pay someone to drive him a long way into the wilderness and leave him for the scavengers agreed but i can see him clubbing him from behind wynns too smart to take on a guy like gale facetoface you hit him when his backs turned you make sure hes not getting backup he could have been jacked sheriff we talked about this lured out of the vehicle maybe struck from behind its more and more difficult to see it otherwise weve got to find that suv gales missing suv a rental from avis had been the topic of much discussion city and sheriff patrols were searching parking lots motels and campgrounds state police had been notified and a boloa be on lookouthad been issued in the sixstate region surrounding idaho walt had hoped for results by now and along with boldt secretly feared theyd lost the vehicle for good you think it was staged to look like a carjacking boldt said i think guys like wynn know what guys like us expect to see an agent at his level hes all about selling an impression of something that maybe isnt true maybe isnt all its made out to be so he gives us what we want id buy that plays into our comfort zone a carjacking gone wrong boldt said nodding its all after the fact walt said hes all boozed up and he does the guy and then has to backfill but a guy like that reads the paper up here he knows what kind of crime we see and how often we see it we had a carjacking not six months ago where a man was struck with a tire iron while changing a tire wasnt exactly like gale but close enough the doer finished changing the tire and drove off in the car having no idea the driver had already alerted onstar we were given gps coordinates and had the guy in custody within the hour and the body stuffed into a culvert twenty feet from the car wynn could easily have read about it and pulled a copycat boldt said if hes the killing type the gate opened electronically and walt drove through parking by a basketball backboard which is what weve come here to find out indeed it is if caroline vetta got him started broke his cherry then doing gale wouldnt have mattered much to him a wry smile overcame boldt you and matthews would like each other he said he took a long look at the house and walt thought he was using it as his introduction to wynn youre welcome to join me if youd like id just confuse things walt said only two can dance at a time ill leave the advance work up to you maybe well pull a columbo on him and doubleteam him after youre done hit him with gale five minutes after hes done fending off vetta sounds like a plan boldt climbed out you want to take off i could call you i hate to take up your time no worries im going to put it to good use the closest neighbors had a sport court behind the house that integrated tennis basketball volleyball and a backboard onto a single slab of asphalt walt crossed it and an apron of green grass to reach a singlestory adobe house with four wings running in an x from a central living area the back of which was a twentyfoothigh wall of tinted glass that faced the ski mountain he found the front door at the apex of a horseshoe driveway that housed what appeared to be a centuriesold pagoda through which the same stream that passed through wynns estate gurgled in and among an asian rock garden the woman who answered the door could have been going on sixty but looked more like forty and showed no signs of work having been done she was all yoga and juice drinks and acupuncture wearing stonewashed blue jeans and a tightfitting tshirt there was no hiding her surprise at discovering a uniformed sheriff at her front door hello walt introduced himself by rank gwen walters i know your face from the papers she said i voted for you walt thanked her he got that a lot but wondered how often it was true i wanted to ask you a few questions if you have a minute of course she motioned him inside tea juice im fine sunlight flooded the living room the outside patio was about the size of walts city lot they took seats at a teak table in padded chairs covered in sunbrella fabric vince wynn walt said yes she said i thought as much she squinted and squirmed uncomfortably in the chair the shooting yes among other things im not a gossip sheriff and i respect my neighbors privacy its important to all of us i agree vince is something of a celebrity in his own right yes he is though my husband calls all agents bloodsuckers hes in the film business my husband not that youd know him an effects director mr wynn claimed he had a trespasser the other night the shooting i wouldnt know about that she said the shooting or the trespasser i didnt see anyone she looked off into the sky then back at walt still squinting now choosing her words carefully vince is very social i suppose in his business one needs to entertain a great deal its busy up there walt said it is at all hours yes all hours a lot of partying men guests women guests guests many guests the gun incident was that a first vince how do i put this the entertaining can go quite late can get i think he enjoys a party as much as the next person sometimes it gets a little rowdy a little late and a lot loud and if i had to guess id say vince doesnt have the best control of his temper hotheaded im painting the wrong picture fights shouting arguments but they could be phone calls for all i know he seems to be on the phone more than hes off and he likes to take calls outside ive noticed and his work is confrontational by nature isnt it all that dealing and the sums mark my husband keeps up on all of it a sports fan loves living next to vince but my god some of the numbers arguments walt said he can be loud she said drugs she squinted looked pained to speak have you seen drug use in the home she hesitated and finally nodded walt felt a jolt of adrenalineif he could get her to say it he had probable cause to search wynns home is that a yes she nodded again i need a verbal answer hes my neighbor he lives a matter of yards from your kids he said keeping in mind the sports court she tilted her head and looked at him curiously the basketball court im assuming teenagers two boys and a girl a neighbor like that doesnt make for the best role model walt said dont patronize me sheriff he was losing her hed been so close does he interact with them at all hes great with the boys gets them autographed balls and things but vince is proud of his working out likes to go around barechested personally it kind of grosses me out and i dont love for my daughter to see that the night of the gunshots i called nineoneone if thats what youre after yes or maybe you already know that she studied him thoughtfully and won nothing back it scared the devil out of me and mark the drinking gunshots i mean were not very far away the drug use walt made it a statement gwen walters seemed ready to say something but didnt walt fumbled with his shirt pocket and produced a photo of gale and laid it on the table have you seen him before she shook her head i have to say he looks vaguely familiar but no i cant say i know him a guest of mr wynns familiar from that another shake of the head i couldnt say for sure there are so many but recently no not recently how about her walt said following this with a copy of a newspaper photograph of caroline vetta the woman had been midsip of some iced tea when she froze in that position her eyes trained onto the photo she placed the glass down looked at walt and then back to the photograph i couldnt say she repeated far less confidently she visited mr wynn i couldnt say she said yet again there are vince has a lot of friends many of them are women but she looks familiar to you walt said is it caroline the woman asked it is walt worked to keep any reaction off his face while inside hed gone electric firstname basis different hair when we knew her it changes her face dramatically you knew her as an acquaintance of mr wynns she came here often for a while last year this was ended around christmas i think we heard about what happened to her poor thing she was a sweet girl pretty as a picture how would you define their relationship warm hostile same as any other i suppose on again off again a light filled her eyes you dont think walt kept any reaction off his face vince she bordered on outrage what do you think is it possible we had them down to dinner barbecues vince was always so entertaining the stories he has and caroline caroline was good with men flirtatious attractive she appraised him and he thought he saw her nod faintly though he may have imagined it the veins in her neck rose the question that needs to be asked walt continued is whether mr wynn ever displayed his temper in her company did the arguments you overheard ever involve ms vetta the questioning was better left for boldt but there was no turning back vince argues with everybody sheriff hes confrontational by nature including ms vetta of course yes okay they argued vince is never afraid to take a position no shrinking violet he walt heard the word wrong shrinking violence he took a second to process it correctly and another few to collect his thoughts did he ever hit or threaten her in your presence and i caution you to carefully consider your answer vince threatens everyone she said matteroffactly he swears he boasts and he takes on anyone he wants to take on its who he is he enters the room you know it some people are just like that i need a straight answer walt said caroline vetta was brutally beaten to death i need you to keep that in mind gwen walters overcome struggled to keep her lips from shaking she hung her head nodding i get it poor thing then she shook her head but did i see vince actually hit her no nor did i see him hit anyone else not ever but you heard things walt speculated were neighbors neighbors know a lot more than they ought to it struck walt then hit him in the chest hed played it wrong from the start wynn knew something about this family they didnt want known the kids bedroom secrets drug use on their part who knew but she had something to hide to keep hidden the same as lisas neighbor the same as wynn and she wasnt about to open that valve because the water could flow both directions she stood from her chair suddenly a different woman extended her hand sheriff she said shes dead walt said i dont envy you your job if i think of something she said unconvincingly they shook hands hers was bloodless and cold and she quickly withdrew it not another word passed between them as he reentered the cathedral of light and made his way to the front door he marveled that people lived this way he stopped there at the threshold turned and met eyes with her said nothing but also didnt move time suspended for what its worth their relationship caroline and vince seemed more business than pleasure my husband wondered aloud more than once if she wasnt more mistress than girlfriend if you know what i mean a call girl a paid companion when they were together it felt different thats all like they shared a secret but not the kind of secret couples share i cant explain it i think you explained it very well he said and he thanked her i need you boldt said as he and walt stood talking beneath vince wynns basketball hoop it went that bad walt asked you want to doubleteam him dodge ball theres a lawyer named evers real piece of work wynn wants to put the vetta death on gale keeps it neat and clean does he know about gale not that i could tell but hes no one to play poker with did he blame gale outright his lawyer wouldnt let him go that far but he would have if hed been left on his own gales identity as your john doe is going to leak if were going to go after wynn before evers circles the wagons nows the time how do you want to handle it walt didnt want to come off as naïve but also wanted to show the man respect boldt said they were very well rehearsed for vetta not so sure that would prove to be the case with gale id hint at the evidenceask to see his vehicles a subscription to the local paper hint at hairs and fibers evidence and work to confirm the last time the two met get him back on his heels and then maybe ill interrupt and revisit vetta a guy like this hes a multitasker and his work is a constant pressure cooker were never going to win anything close to a confession but maybe he shows us a few cracks we can exploit later he agreed to meet you in the first place because he doesnt want the publicity thats in our favor i take it we have hairs and fibers from the vetta scene i like the way you think boldt said feel free to play that if you need it boldt slapped him on the back wynn appeared surprised as he opened the door revealing the two harris he called into the house harris evers was balding and was one of those city people who didnt look comfortable when dressing down for the role of country folk his jeans carried creases his bare ankles were the color of copy paper and his black leather belt with its industrial clasp was intended for a pair of fancy trousers sheriff evers said wondered if i might have a few words with your client concerning you might call it a followup on the shots fired the other night i think not evers said you are aware your client mr wynn threatened an individual to my face said hed kill the man and take his chances with the courts evers shot a furtive glance in wynns direction his disappointment impossible to disguise walt continued that individual is dead yesterday martel gale was discovered on the side of highway seventyfive now wait a goddamned minute wynn said practically levitating off the floor youre telling me gale is dead and you threatened to kill him i oh damn that was just bull that was just me being me you said it to my face walt reminded evers tensed eyes darting how about we all sit down a minute how about our friends here go back to wherever they came from wynn said his temperature rising we can go the formal route walt said but i cant promise that sports center and pardon the interruption wont hear a certain agent is under investigation wynn muttered you piece of vince evers waved everyone into the living room they sat down around an elephant saddle coffee table beneath a dale chihuly chandelier in a living room with a full view of the ski mountain a mile away walt could think of a dozen ways to begin the questioning but he heeded boldts advice about working the evidence wandering into territory that wasnt entirely familiar to him and hoping boldt would come to his rescue if necessary how many baseball bats do you own mr wynn what baseball bats what kind of a question is that pretty simple one some people collect electric guitars walt said wine demi moore has a threestory victorian house in hailey filled with nothing but dolls a couple hundred dolls has a housesitter that lives there and takes care of her doll collection im thinking a guy like you in your position you probably own more than your fair share of baseball bats am i wrong wynn checked with evers who nodded i have an autographed collection would that be here in idaho or los angeles both its divided between my houses and my office sheriff said evers this is pertinent because are we talking murder weapon walt ignored him how many bats maybe a dozen here and how about vehicles how many registered or otherwise vehicles do you own here in idaho wynn squinted including motorcycles you have access to that information evers said my client doesnt have to answer that look it up three walt said not including the four motorcycles a porsche a vintage roadster and a ford fone hundred so why ask wynn said sheriff fleming and i share interests in the vetta case which is open and ongoing boldt said when was the last time you or your employees drove the fone hundred boldt asked wynn my pickup no clue no idea i dont drive it all that much once a week maybe my employees have their own trucks they dont drive mine vince evers said you dont answer unless i say so he understood the mistake wynn had just made whether his client did or not by taking his employees out from behind the steering wheel hed just implicated himself if his truck offered any physical evidence it was a major victory and boldt shot walt a satisfyingly congratulatory look the last time you drove it walt said no vince thats enough about the truck evers said what wynn snapped at his attorney to walt he said i drove the dirt bikes over to the copper basin that was maybe ten days ago me and a friend left after lunch were back around sunset came over trail creek at sunset so thats what nine ninethirty it was a thursday two thursdays ago not since not since have you had any tire work done to the truck in the interim period jesus wynn said you will not answer that evers advised wynn was starting to get the idea were happy to cooperate sheriff the attorney said but if you seek specifics like this i will advise vince not to answer until he and i can study and discuss his alternatives walt noticed that boldt sat back in his chair and took it as a sign he was trying to look comfortable trying to establish they would be there a while though walt now doubted it you put the blame for vetta onto gale boldt said i think it makes sense yes wynn replied so who killed gale boldt asked how the fuck should i know after the incident the other night your discharge of the handgun did you have any contact with martel gale and i should warn you we have records of his communications wynns puzzled look turned toward his attorney my client wont answer that evers said gentlemen i need time with my client if you want to continue this i would suggest a trip down to my offices walt said should we say one hour wynns agitation flared in his cheeks you want this to leak you want this on television i want answers walt said correcting him we should point out that our departments see a correlation between the two deaths boldt added and will continue cooperating and sharing resources and evidence this is totally out of hand wynn said you guys are way off base coach us up mr wynn boldt said by all means i threatened him i was pissed off okay i was scared the guy iswas whatevera fucking freak of nature the last i saw him he was jacked so high on steroids he was the fucking incredible hulk and i mean after the guy turns green okay like that but does that mean i did the guy gimme a fucking break to your knowledge walt said calmly has your pickup truck had any tire work done in the past two weeks no no no evers said interrupting any chance that wynn might answer were not getting into details like that why what do i care wynn said no okay no tire work that i know of vince evers chastised this is not how this is going to be done you stated earlier boldt said that you came straight here from seattle correct yeah so upon your arrival to your home here were you then or are you now aware of any of your possessions having gone missing boldt inquired wynn checked with evers walt reminded its here or in hailey evers nodded to his client no wynn said boldt scribbled down a note okay evers said we are done here we will comply with any warrants or written requests as you present them harris we are not making a circus out of this wynn said he addressed both walt and boldt i have not seen or spoken to gale in over a year beginning and end of statement i dont know squat about his death or his even being here yet you shot at him the other night walt said i shot at someone you told me it was gale i told you i thought it was gale said the negotiator and now hes dead good riddance vince please you believed gale was in the area boldt asked i got that list server notice wynn said that was enough for me i figured caroline was probably on that list and i knew what had happened to her i wasnt taking any chances walt thought obtaining the names on the list server would prove difficult if not impossible but it seemed worth the effort if gale had indeed been seeking revenge then his likely victims would be on that list well ask that you not leave the county without checking with my office walt said thats bullshit wynn said ive got a dozen deals going im due in la on a moments notice check with my office before leaving walt said addressing the attorney i did not do gale wynn said exasperated boldt leaned forward tell us everything you know about your relationships with caroline vetta and martel gale right here right now and you have a chance to make this go away but my sense of things is this is probably your last chance to do this quietly youre threatening my client evers said am i hearing this right im trying to save you a trip to seattle boldt said but i think im about done doing you any favors he stood walt rose from the couch wondering how he might pull off obtaining a search warrant before wynn thought to bleach every baseball bat in his collection wondering what his father would think about his working hand in hand with a cop like lou boldt and then wondering why that mattered to him in the first place an image rose within the dreamlike swirl of color and the echo of a distant voice ethereal foreboding it felt more ghost than angel and she turned away from it im sorry a mans deep voice that she experienced as penetrating cold sexual and dangerous she clawed away from him dragging herself on hands and knees sensing the retreat was more memory than experience she caught a glimpse of herself naked but for a cotton thong rushing to escape then felt him catch hold of her ankle and drag her back she reached out grabbing the leg of a chair only to bring it down on top of herself take me back to that moment a womans voice as gentle and forgiving as silence where it came from she had no idea was god a woman with a voice like a summer breeze why did she feel so compelled to comply to do whatever this voice asked of her is there someone in the room with you the woman again i owe you that much more than that the mans voice now his silhouette blocking the glow from a window she knew that windowit existed in her present memory i see a window she heard herself say hes standing in front of a window tell me about him but as she looked again she flinched and ran from what she saw what she heard she stepped back arms out behind her like angel wings he says hes sorry she identified this as her own voice but she couldnt be sure if anyone heard or who it was intended for sorry for the woman again gently pressing always pressing hes lying he always lies you know him yes not a stranger no way hes in the room with you yes i the silhouette distended and broke into two black blobs the ephemeral quality suddenly made her doubt its authenticity do you recognize him recognize him oh yeah is he saying anything else hes coming toward me coming for me no no not again not that hell kill me hell kill me this time ive got to a bell rang a small bell the kind her grandmother kept on the fireplace mantel and told stories about tall tales of india and elephants and she could practically smell the incense burning her eyes came open to soft lighting and the barely discernible image of a thin woman with graying hair sitting stiffly in a chair opposite her her grandmother but no she was long dead her scalp itched she felt pearls of sweat on her upper lip that tasted of salt as she licked them off and then she identified the source of the incense a small ceramic dish to the left of the thin woman whoa she said did i go under i believe so yes fiona did i say anything well get to that katherine said fiona took in the surroundings of the office and for a moment didnt recall coming here to this session whoa she said again it can be a little surprising the first time katherine said im totally disoriented understandable you were somewhere else just now i dont remember a thing as it should be we can work on that did i remember anything do you know how i hit my head do you know what happened the important thing is that you know what happened i do i remembered i believe so yes and did i tell you anything useful its all useful we dont want to get ahead of ourselves there was a man i think he was speaking to me saying something to me though i dont know what exactly trying to connect what she was being told with an unwilling memory fiona felt as if she were reaching into dark water dont force it katherine said theres no rush the point is youll get there if you need to youll find it if its important of course its important theres a piece of my life missing maybe for good reason the only reason is because i hit my head not necessarily weve discussed this protecting myself from myself i dont buy that and im not selling just trying to help you to work this out fiona felt herself cooling off whatever it was it had to be something major for her to have gotten this worked up about it but what she had no idea i need this she said we generally have what we need the general misperception is that we need what we want be careful what you wish for words to live by katherine said can we try again not today soon enough though thursdays session well see i need to know she hung her head it was everything she could do not to cry no ill handle it walt said into his blackberry staring at the dairy case in atkinsons market im heading that way anyway on the other end of the call tommy brandon said nothing walt understood the source of his deputys confusion he rarely if ever refused the offer of help overburdened and overworked he welcomed even preached the need for such initiative but here he was pushing back on brandon and there was brandon not understandingor understanding too well walt thought brandon was no slouch he probably saw right through walts justification he cursed brandons efficiency in studying topographic maps and google earth images of the area around the location of gales body all in an effort to widen their canvassing brandon had made an interesting and possibly damaging discovery the engleton propertywhere fiona livedwas technically immediately adjacent to the crime scene if one discounted four hundred feet of elevation looking from high above only the blur of the scree field separated them if gale had not been tossed from a pickup truck then he had likely fallen to his death from the eastern edge of the engleton property though the condition of his clothes did not suggest hed been hiking the contradictions needed clarification someone needed to question fionaand quite possibly kiraand walt was not leaving that to anyone else he reviewed his exchange with brandon searching for a believable if inelegant way out she has some photos of the scene for me he said realizing upon reflection how stupid it sounded fiona emailed her photographs to the office he had to end the conversationquickly listen im in atkinsons trying to buy string cheese nikki is very picky and i cant for the life of me remember which brand it is she likes for her theres only the one ill take the engleton place you divvy up the rest and well hope someone saw something got it brandon said intentionally clipping his words so that walt would not miss his unspoken message a man stepped up and without so much as looking at the shelves snagged a carton of milk from the case and dumped it into his cart on top of several packs of beer and a halfdozen bags of beef jerky walt recognized him immediately from his drivers license photo dominique fancelli stepfather of dionne fancelli the pregnant highschooler a dozen options crowded walts mind confrontation arrest intimidation maybe he could steer him out back and just beat the shit out of him and take his chances with voters paying no attention to the string cheese walt placed it into his cart his eyes never leaving the man he pushed his cart following the man down the paper aisle watched him load up on paper towels and toilet tissue and consider an air freshener stood there watching hoping the man might turn and provoke him not much could test his patience but this man had walts heart going arrhythmic in his chest fancelli continued toward the checkout lanes and walt followed as if on surveillance holding back yet fully focused on the target reminding himself how unprofessional it would be to confront the man walt turned his cart away and headed for the fresh bread beneath the country bakery sign he was considering a loaf of raisin bread when fancelli appeared in his peripheral vision leaving with a bag of groceries in hand a teenage girl no older than thirteen passed him on her way into the store and fancelli ogled her bare legs and tank top before walt could even make sense of it hed abandoned his cart and rushed through the swinging door fancelli was halfway across the parking lot zeroing in on a trickedout pickup truck swinging the bag like a schoolboy fancelli walt marched in long stiff strides reaching the man as he turned around fancellis eyes flared at sight of the uniform his brow furrowed the bag slowed its pendular motion walt invaded the mans space putting his face to fancellis unbothered by their height difference hows dionne doing he asked a bit breathlessly fancelli leaned away but did not take a step back his eyes creased his lips suddenly bloodless and thin his nostrils flared give her my best the mans head nodded nearly imperceptibly walt stepped away and offered him his back as he returned to the store no problem fancelli croaked out walt stopped and looked over his shoulder at the man visions of emily and nikki playing before his eyes for all the reasons bullets were manufactured this seemed a way to put one to its best possible use he caught his hand actually touching the grip of his sidearm he turned back and walked on a fraction of a second gone but a lifetime passed he arrived at the top of fionas driveway to the yellow profusion of the engleton flower beds the air gauzy and charged with a glow of late afternoon he was slightly out of breath and lightheaded anticipation roaring in his ears knocked on the cottage door stepped through as she answered ive missed you youve been awfully quiet the hopeful yet sad look in her eyes prompted him he took her chin in his right hand placed his left on her hip as if dancing she didnt object and though he saw distance in her eyes as he kissed her she returned his offer as if he was somehow the answer shed been awaiting as they spun she shoved the door closed with the palm of her hand and they crashed across the coffee table and fell to the couch this time without a hint of amusement she infused the act with a seriousness a disconnected commitment and he sensed the danger of the moment but was unable to hold himself back if talk had been required it was too late for both of them if hed thought himself bulletproof he was not she closed her eyes tightly as he joined her a mask half of pleasure half of pain that caused him to reconsider but again he couldnt stop he fell atop her with a gasp surprised and alarmed by his urgency and the unshakeable knowledge that somewhere in the middle of their frantic actions she might have asked him to stop if shed been so inclined wow she said confusing him because she sounded so happy i ought to answer the door more often i didnt plan that he said which makes it all the more wonderful its not really me to do something like that well then maybe youll change she kissed him maybe i already have she left him collecting and dragging her clothes with her to the back of the cottage a few minutes later she had a pot of hot water going and they were both dressed and it was for a moment as if nothing had happened her cheeks and chest were flushed as she sat down next to him she looked out from behind sleepy eyes and he wanted her again right there but he behaved himself containing himself to the tea and a few minutes of delicious silence that they shared with the fading gurgle of the cooling tea kettle tell me this was a social call she said he felt a painful spike in his chest the uncommon urge to lie a matter of days and he was already corrupted prepared to compromise his ethics for this woman the danger sign flashed for the second time in a matter of hours she was getting to him if he went forward unguarded unchecked he needed to accept that some of this was irreversible that the flip side of such happiness and heartpounding excitement was the abyss not entirely he said prepared for her to distance herself glad when she didnt brandon noticed on the map that this place and the berkholders to a lesser degree are in fairly close proximity to the body site he added as the crow flies which bodies do not hed thought he might win a smile out of her but shed gone cold and he thought back to their work on the body and again regretted keeping her on the scene for so long he was about to apologize for that when she spoke so what does that involve asking you and kira if youd seen anyone matching gales description which i think you just might happen to have pointed out when we found the body ill talk to kira briefly shes not around or not and then look around the place and call it good same at the berkholders really it was just an excuse to see you you saw a lot of me she said cupping the mug of tea and offering him a vexing look of encouragement this is getting complicated he said it is more so for you than me certainly not true you have the girls to think of i understand that it cant be easy its the beast in the room were not discussing why is that some of this can wait for he grimaced you think this isnt serious its been two years in the making its very serious to me that is if it isnt serious to you thats important for me to hear im a big girl i get it its serious yes it is so the girls are a big part of it and i want you to know that i defer to you on how weif there is a wehandle it they dont need to know shouldnt know until were awfully sure where this is going once i become part of their lives if i become part of their lives its not fair to them to retreat so wed better be awfully sure we know what were doing do you know what youre doing im looking forward not back im trying to keep my pulse down because every time i look at you it runs out of control im seeing a future instead of fearing one and im hungry for the first time in what seems likes years he considered this you want to get something to eat i thought you have to canvass when will kira be back i dont keep her calendar ill walk around the premises no sign of the bearman right kira will tell you she hears things but thats kira and you do you hear things she turned away and he thought maybe hed embarrassed her and he wondered how hed managed gail had been out of his life long enough and the girls had dominated his attention that hed forgotten about how dealing with a woman was so incredibly different it may take me a while to get good at this he said ive lived in a bubble for too long it may take me a while to remember that all women are not elevenyearolds he got the smile hed been hoping for earlier some of us are seventeen she said point taken have a look around ill clean up and well grab some dinner that is if you want it was my idea take your time give me fifteen minutes a woman who could clean up in fifteen minutes hed hit the mother lode back shortly he said sunset was still two hours out but dusk had begun as a change to the quality of light the mountains stretching long shadows across the narrow valley and turning the air a dusty gray walt walked the perimeter of the property admiring the garden beds all dominated by a profusion of vibrant lilies and the meticulous landscaping briefly envious of the wealth on display the valley was a playground for trust funders and there were times that kind of inherited unearned money made him crazy his trackers eye caught evidence of activity up the hill toward the east ridge where he found a dump pile of dried twigs and leaves he circled high above the house and cottage then around and down a grassy slope overlooking a small teardrop pond he walked the back side of the house arriving at the attached garage and peered in through the window to notice a vehicle missing from the first of the three bays he decided to mention the empty bay when he reconnected with fiona does kira use that car fiona gave him a sideways glance and crossed the drive she keyed in a code and the first of the garage doors opened revealing the empty space put her hands on her hips but said nothing no the vehicles are offlimits except in emergencies though she must have taken it because im sure it wasnt stolen or anything i could call her and ask but i tried calling her earlier and her phone wasnt picking up not a big deal he said wandering into the garage and admiring the two luxury cars in the other bays he caught sight of a sheet of paper taped on the butt end of a tool cabinet lojack he said what looks like the engletons subscribe to a lojack service gps boxes that can track cars down if theyre stolen that sounds like michael should i call them and ask can if you want i dont want to get kira in any trouble shes had enough of it as it is and to add insult to injury if shes taken off then shes probably lost her job fiona stood still as walt wandered the garage you think i should call the company first she asked i think if you call the engletons will hear about it for sure because there could be charges involved with tracking down a vehicle ill bet kiras car is in the shop and she borrowed this one and didnt dare tell you about it probably id track her down first you know good idea he held the door for her as she got into his jeep and she paused there a moment as if not knowing what to do you have to be careful she said whys that i could get used to this not such a bad thing you spoil me ill be spoiled when you leave food on the shelf unattended it spoils when you pay attention to someone they only get better i never would have figured you for a sweettalker i suspect there are things about both of us that we have yet to learn isnt that supposed to be the fun part she didnt answer she pulled the door and he helped it shut and only as he glanced at her through the windshield as he came around the front of the jeep did it occur to him that with that statement hed somehow bruised her and he realized he had a lot to learn fiona returned from her dinner with walt and marched straight to the phone through a haze caused by constant flirting two glasses of wine and her unspoken concern for kira her first instinct was to call katherine to try to find out if the anxiety she felt could be a result of her memory lapse but she didnt want to be overanalyzed and she didnt need someone to question a decision shed already made so she googled the name of the company on the sheet in the garage and asked how to go about tracking down a missing vehicle angel rubbed warmly against her calf fiona reached down and cradled her in her lap and wondered if angel and beatrice would get along and whether or not it would ever come to that the man on the other end of the call spoke in a heavily accented indian english that she found hard to understand she repeated herself often briefly losing track of her purpose and finally determined that the company distinguished a missing vehicle from a stolen vehicle and only offered their service for stolen vehicles the request to trace a stolen vehicle had to come from a police department she was advised to report the vehicle as stolen and to tell the police department to make the request with their company as soon as possible vehicles reported within the first three hours of theft were statistically proven to suffer the least amount of damage and vandalism she hung up tried kiras cell phone for the umpteenth time in the past two days and listened as it went directly to voice mail disconnecting without leaving a tenth message only to have it never returned she considered calling kiras parents but knew of the strained relationship there and didnt want to get the girl in trouble over nothing but was it nothing was it a coincidence that kira had been missing since fiona had awakened from her comatose nightmare had she not tripped had kira pushed her had kira panicked and fled without calling an ambulance what kind of argument could have preceded such an act and why had katherine said that the apology revealed by her hypnotism had come from a man and not a woman if kira had been the one apologizing and why would kira possibly have to apologize they both avoided driving the engletons vehicles because of insurance coverage fiona had a hard time believing kira would take one of the cars if she had then it spoke volumes about kiras mindset at the time finding the truck was more important than ever she felt a twinge of guilt why had she intentionally avoided telling walt the missing vehicle was a pickup truck she locked the door to the cottage grabbed up her camera and reconnected it to the laptop quickly working through the shots of the gale crime scene her finger finally hovering over the mouse as a series of shots appeared onscreen muddy tire impressions walt had made it clear a pickup truck had left the tire impressions at the crime scene the missing pickup truck she wondered she doubleclicked the first of the four images and it opened in its own window she leaned in to take a closer look no photo to go with it deputy david blompier reported from the other side of walts desk he was balding with an amiable face and bulging belly he was under a second caution to begin a workout regimen and walt feared hed soon have to be suspended for failing to act upon the warning walt was looking at a printout of martel gales bank account transaction report forwarded through by email from purchase bank in mobile louisiana gale used his atm card a day after he died walt noted withdrew the full fourhundreddollar limit then again the next business day another four hundred and no photo sawtooth national has stickers on their atms saying there are cameras in use but there arent any remember it came up last year in that poacher case chasing that guy down yeah i remember walt said his killer blompier asked were a long way from making that jump walt said but its certainly possible its good work david thanks all i did was get hold of the bank and find out if theres a way to realtime monitor their atm use you looking for any ot pay absolutely let me know what the bank says yes sir and david walt caught him at the door blompier turned in profilea sight to behold yeah hit the gym and lay off the doughnuts last warning you have to pass the course on the third try or its an automatic suspension yes sir my hands are tied on this yes sir we need you you understand got it walt fingered the page wondering if the body had been found and robbed or gales wallet had been taken by his killer his phone rang as if in response dr royal mcclure an md who served as his medical examiner informed him the results of the autopsy were in walt called boldts cell and reached him on main street where hed been window shopping he picked him up and they drove north together im glad you stayed walt said from behind the wheel of the jeep my wife gave me a reprieve i figured im already here why not tack on a long weekend dont get this chance every day i havent been over here in years probably wont be back anytime soon walt knew the truthboldt suspected gales death tied into vettas and knew that once he left the area obtaining information would be increasingly difficult hed been anxiously awaiting the results of gales autopsy and blood tox results neither man mentioned or discussed any of this and walt wondered why not but at the same time felt hesitant to broach the subject himself the events of the past week had made him increasingly aware of and sensitive to the existence of secrets big and small and the role they played in his and other peoples lives in some ways everyone was acting out a role keeping a face on a much more complicated identity health issues relationships fantasies fears phobiasso often held in check just below the surface and the person living the lie molewhacking to keep the truths from surfacing at inopportune moments walt parked in front of the medical building adjacent to the hospital and they entered dr royal mcclures age was deceptive the white hair and liver spots suggested sixty but he was fit and brighteyed he had an excitable manner and a calming voice the two somehow working in concert to give the impression of a facile mind at work in a laidback personality he had rotated into the countys mandatory medical examiner service a few years back and had done such a good job walt had put him on contract they were spared the bodyonagurney routine mcclure only brought out the body if walt askedwhich he rarely didknowing walt preferred an office visit to the hospitals morgue in the preliminary mcclure began after introductions had been made i told you about the blunt trauma to the parietal and occipital plates of the skull he reached back and touched the back of his own head and my suspicions were borne out that was indeed the cause of death the guy was struck hard its a clean blow something smooth no bark or detritus in the hair or scalp a single blow theres nothing much more to give you clean tox no drugs or alcohol tobacco pot nothing guy was a churchgoer as far as i can tell what i do have is speculative or at least inconclusive but nonetheless interesting at least to me which is why i thought you might want to hear it facetoface absolutely walt said he placed down a stack of fionas photographs shots of the head injury and identifiers including several tattoos and from the clothing he said removing a plastic bag from a file box and laying it on his desk soil caught in the back pockets of both pant legs and both shoes and not just soil but clean soil clean soil and peat moss would be my guess though you may want the lab to run an analysis to nail that down more accurately but my point is its not your average dust bowl variety soil we typically see around here right its more like garden variety nursery boldt said drawing a sharp look from walt why not sure nursery it looks like what my wife and i use in our vegetable garden black compost soil mixed with peat moss to hold in moisture what it is not is the typical roadside dirt you see around here its far more refined than that and theres no pebbles leaf material sticks its clean thats helpful walt said very helpful which leads me to the only other thing ive got mcclure said and honestly i probably wouldnt have noticed without the soil or maybe i would have who knows he laughed selfconsciously his selfdeprecating humor one of the qualities walt appreciated most about him rare in a doctor earwax he said fishing out a small plastic petri dish from the same cardboard box the petri dish contained four cotton swabs on paper sticks earwax walt repeated pollen boldt said craning his huge body over the desk for a closer look the blue ribbon goes to the sergeant mcclure said very good detective weve used it a couple times once in a floater pollen most often adheres to sinus membranes antemortem and or the cerumenwhich is docspeak for earwaxpostmortem he pronounced it mortem lending finality to the sound of the word i retrieved the cerumen but found nothing in the sinuses ergo he was dragged through a garden or a flower bed or thrown from a truck into a pile of debris walt said id go along with the former but would lay doubt at the foot of the latter the doc said you can see by the strong orange color that the pollen was thick and apparently consistent it had to be abundant this time of year boldt asked isnt it a little late in nature yes mcclure said id agree quite late but we have a very shortened growing season here detective extremely short i would imagine any number of vegetables or other flowering plants might be pollinating at this time but im not a botanist sunflowers maybe the lab may be able to identify the pollen for you but i thought its existence worth bringing to your attention he delivered this to walt who nodded and reached out to examine the petri dish ill put a rush on it walt said the only other thing worth mentioning and i think youll find this of some interest is that a good number of the contusions and abrasions are also postmortem though scuffs on his knees and face are antemortem a struggle walt said if i had to guess id say the blow from behind was enough to kill him but possibly failed to do so right away he went down his brain hemorrhaged but in those few conscious seconds it took the pressure on his brain to overcome him maybe he managed to turn and get in a few blows on his attacker they may have fought i dont know his hands and forearms and mouth all suggest such a struggle an exchange of blows perhaps then the initial trauma caught up to himany of the rest of us would have gone unconscious with such a blow i thinkits something of a medical miracle if he did not but he was thickboned and his skull may have protected him somewhat his brain swamped and he died and was dragged through a garden walt said or a nursery boldt added the lab work should help you there mcclure said ill pack it up and get it off ill have one of my guys drive it down there this afternoon walt said a video of the struggle playing out in his minds eye and the disturbing realization that vince wynn had showed no signs of having been in such a struggle if there was a struggle mcclure said artfully awaiting the attention of the two a guy this size might have gotten in some serious blows it might be worth checking the emergency room or twentyfourhour convenience stores boldt said eyeing walt have you got any of those here good suggestions walt said as he and boldt were approaching the jeep boldt stopped and waited for walt to turn the woman at the nursery maggie sharp was wearing a lot of makeup you notice that i did struck me funny at the time an outdoor person like that bothering with cosmetics but if she was covering something and while you were thinking that i was thinking about boatwright the caretaker was tearing up a perfectly good garden and replanting it supposedly at boatwrights request that certainly plays a little differently now blunt trauma walt said i keep coming back to a baseball bat marty boatwrights a football guy and hes old i dont see him clubbing gale from behind his gardener maybe an ax handle what if wynn was right what if gale was here poking around old wounds wynn scares him off so he moves on to boatwright caretaker sees a trespasser and takes a club to the back of the guys head without introductions boatwright realizes who it is and for whatever reasons of his own doesnt want anything to do with this and tells him to dump the body and remake the garden because in the struggle the garden got trashed thered be an evidence trail a mile long boldt said if boatwright or his man owns a pickup truck id start there his mans clothes and house would be next be interesting if boatwrights name turned up on the same list server as wynn people considered at risk from gale that list would help us out i had a case down there that involved a home for boys i had contact with some people i could make a few calls its not your case walt said i couldnt ask you to do that you didnt not that i heard and as far as that goes gales death could easily tie to caroline vetta and that means im interested boatwright is not going to open his doors for us walt said and replanting a garden hardly gives me probable cause the lab identifies what kind of plant made that pollen and weve got frontrow seats either at the nursery or boatwrights i can nudge them to hurry it up but they wont get started until monday at the earliest and only then if i twist a few arms looks like you and i are entering a longdistance relationship sheriff and you know how those turn out in all honesty its been a pleasure back at you walt moved for the car door boldt stayed where he was its none of my business boldt said how do i say this your father when we talked my father can be a real asshole he took a kind of holierthanthou attitude not with me but about you like i could teach you something by coming over here as i said its none of my business i apologize my point being he was wrong dead wrong i could give him a call as a followup let him know how it went over here wouldnt want to do that without your permission wouldnt want to tread where i shouldnt the pit in walts stomach told him more about himself than he wanted to acknowledge tread wherever youd like he said feeling the warmth of sweet satisfaction flooding him kind of wish i had a wire in place for that phone call boldt barked out a laugh when he climbed into the jeep the vehicle sagged to his side and then leveled boldt clipped into the seat belt let out a sigh and said im going to miss this place this is a pleasant surprise walt told fiona as he entered his office to find her waiting for him i told nancy it had to do with photographs she said hoisting her camera case i lied a social visit he kissed her on the cheek the return kiss was tepid at best he moved around to behind his desk thinking of little else i wish no its i need a favor and im not sure its fair to ask i dont want to take advantage of our you know the other night but at the same time i need something he stood and eased his office door shut and returned to the chair next to her forgoing the seat behind the desk talk to me he said i the thing is she met his eyes and then looked quickly away were both adults here it isnt that she said its we dont really know each other she said not all that well he felt it in the center of his chest not like a knife but more like a medical procedure where all the blood all the life was being drawn out of him into a syringe while he sat there watching it thats what we do right from here on out get to know each other better share the stuff you never share its what makes the bond unique worth so much i want to know you i want to know all about you her eyes welled you might be surprised try me i like surprise for an instant he saw in her a hope or dream but something passed like a shadow between them and then that look was gone replaced by something more protective and even suspicious hed had similar moments in interrogations when the suspect seemed ready to download only to clamp down and turn inward hed lost her rather than push or fish which was his nature he sat back and tried to appear the model of patience i called the company the one that can trace the pickup michael and leslies pickup he kept his mouth shut measuring her fragility in her sideways looks and the whispering quality of her voice they said i have to file a police report report it as a stolen vehicle without that they wont trace it pretty common with these companies he said they want it to be for real its not a service to track down your missing teenager but thats just it thats what i need to track down kira meaning i havent seen her in a couple of days walt that happens sometimes we can go most of a week without overlapping but the pickup truck being gone thats not good she knows the rules the last thing i want is for her to get into trouble with michael and leslie and maybe lose the housesitting thing but if i want to track her down i have to report it as stolen and if i report it as stolen the engletons find out about it exactly but if i were to make the call something like that yes no problem what really he watched the load come off her her head raised her shoulders seemed higher straighter not a big deal he said i can have nancy make the call but does it i dont know could you get into trouble i cant imagine how we make these kinds of calls often enough its really not a big deal it is to me well then consider it done her eyes softened have you tried something oldfashioned like calling her voice mail i dont love the idea of her going missing at a time were searching the woods in your area i know do you think theres any chance any possibility that her departure is related to no she said sharply cutting him off i think she just took off in the truck shes still just a kid there was already stuff brewing between us she was mad that i left the advocates dinner when i did that surprised me as well and she apparently had a flashback in the middle of her talk yes she told me and that freaked her out and i think she was counting on me being there for her and i wasnt and i feel bad about that but it is what it is he hoped she might explain her sudden departure that night but she chose not toand that was how he thought of it that she made a decision not to share with him and he took that as a bad omen he nearly said so might have had she not cut into his thoughts i just want to find her and get that truck back before it blows up on her did you try her parents that relationship its complicated he thought she sounded more like a psychologist than herself so ill make the call we should hear something by the end of the day it doesnt take them long should i wait no itll be a few hours at the least maybe tomorrow ill call you its really nice of you she said her eyes softening happy to do it i could repay you with a dinner im with the girls the next few nights with boldt here ive been distracted first job and all that is he gone leaving in the morning hows that been interesting were kind of working together at the moment on the gale thing he eyed her good memory easy name to remember tell me about it he said every time he spoke of the dead man he thought of his exwife boldt was a big help to me weve got some solid leads from canvassing my place no doubt she said forcing a smile behind it a smile that didnt come easily exactly ive suspected you for some time he lowered his voice playfully i might need another oneonone just to clear you talk to my attorney she said biting back a grin she pulled herself out of the chair leaned forward and kissed him thank you she repeated she pulled his head to her lips and whispered i like your interrogation techniques like them a lot she left him there firmly rooted in the chair his neck still tingling from the sensation of her lips across his ear that afternoon the courts dealt walt a crushing defeat by refusing him access to dionne fancellis medical information and therefore preventing him from obtaining a dna sample of the child she was carrying he had her underwear possibly carrying her dna he had a swab from the accused teen but he lacked the dna of the child in question the state increasingly aggressive in possible abuse and paternity cases was nonetheless inconsistent he was debating strategy when nancys voice came over the intercom i have a reporter from the statesman pam from the express and a couple of the tv stations all on hold hit us all at once concerning martel gale walt swallowed gales identity had not been released he had expected the information might leak but not so quickly and he had to wonder if this was somehow harris everss doing vince wynns attorney he couldnt imagine wynn wanting the news public but it seemed too coincidental issue a no comment got it his mind reeled a sports celebrity death would bring the national news next that in turn would bring pressure from the hailey mayor state congressman clint stennett and soon the governor the cushion hed hoped for was now gone the longer the case dragged out the worse it would get the more demands hed receive for an arrest a good reporter would soon make the connection between gale and wynn and boatwright and possibly to caroline vetta making his investigation all the more difficult a good investigative reporter was a real pain in the ass because he or she could beat you to the information had none of the legal restrictions imposed on law enforcement and often had more resources at his disposal one call from nancy and it sounded in walts ears like a starting pistol he abhorred the idea that the investigation had just become a race but there was no denying it he shot off an email to boldt hoping to give him a headsup his office would be the next to be contacted he called his pio into his office as the offices public information officer deputy even eve sanchez had the looks and the brains to be a crowdpleaser she was bilingual beautiful and young the cameras liked her and so did walt he briefed her on gale and detailed the potential land mines theyd spoken about the case periodically over the past few days but not with the specifics of his suspicions and the boldt interviews with boatwright and wynnall information she needed they would take a public position of ongoing investigation and therefore no comment but mcclures office needed to be warned and tommy brandon and fiona both needed debriefings with eve they scheduled to meet twice daily and he promised updates as he had them for the time being he would not take any questions or interviews but when pressed by her agreed to join her at a press conference the following morning at ten am she would meet him at his house later in the evening to prep him with sanchez gone he called royal mcclure to warn him and asked nancy to bring fiona and brandon in as soon as possible he searched emails and his own notes about the case mentally reviewed discussions hed had with boldt and tried to see loose ends that needed tying off one that came to mind was the emergency room admissions for the night of gales death if they offered anything promising hed want to lock them down the louisiana list server for anyone affected by the gale prosecution loomed large it was just the kind of thing a reporter would scoop him on he fired off a second email to boldt asking if he could pull strings as hed offered he hung up from another call with nancyrequesting the emergency room log for the night in questionand felt dizzy he needed food he needed time he ordered takeout called lisa and asked her to stay with the girls nancy entered his office waving a sheet of paper emergency room records she said placing it before him walt straightened the sheet and read two admissions one a child with a broken ankle the other an ax wound to the leg he stared at the page unable to divorce himself from his fathers jabbing sarcasm about how unreal his sons job was when compared to one in a major city each hospital in seattle probably saw a dozen emergency room admissions a night some several dozen this is it he said youre looking at it not much help no i didnt think so he ran his hand through his hair one of the guys was going to look into the convenience stores and drug storeschateau and the drug store in particularand see if anyone remembers anything on that night can you chase that down not a problem wait he said holding the page now wishing he could choke it midnight to midnight he said excuse me he was found on the fourteenth and we bagged him on the fourteenth but royal couldnt give us a predictable time of death temperature drops too much each night he was guessing hed been there at least a day and that seemed supported by the degradationthe predation to the face and limbs so lets say he went lightsout the twelfth or thirteenth o k a y she said cautiously accustomed to being his sounding board and knowing to stay out of his way which is why i asked for the twelfth he said shaking the sheet of paper but its a midnight start its a true day and if gale was killed late night the twelfth she said unable to help herself exactly then we should be looking at the thirteenth not the twelfth ill call impatience got the better of him over the next twenty minutes he would try answering an email only to find himself holding down the backspace key and starting over he looked over his hot list of followups to accomplish before the press conference but felt stymied his computer rang a tone he saw notice of an email from boldt and read it the detective had managed to contact a man in the louisiana attorney generals office a deputy ag by the name of robert buddy cornell cornell believed he could scare up at least the email addresses for those people on the gale list server and hoped to have it to boldt by monday morning walt pounded out a thankyou and sent it off nancy was standing in his doorway holding another sheet of paper she looked different like shed tasted something funny gone was the playful dr watson whod sparred with him twenty minutes earlier you need some food or something he said you want to go home i can handle it from here she said nothing as she stepped forward and slid the piece of paper across his desk the st lukes wood river medical center banner across the top thats better he said noting right away that there had been tenno elevenemergency room admissions on the thirteenth he glanced up from the emergency room report at nancy who stood staring down at him still as pale as a sheet im telling you he said you do not look well second from the bottom she said watching as his eyes found the printed line his stubby finger traced across the page he looked up at nancy back to the page back to nancy head injury he said she nodded despite his concern he wasnt ready to make that call recognizing the caller id as the sheriffs office central number fiona answered her mobile phone expecting to hear walts voice she was disappointed to discover it was nancy his secretary standing in the cottages small galley kitchen she glanced out the window over the sink into the stand of aspen trees and the blinding shock of lilies mixing with the white bark nancy i need a little clarification on something we just got the gps coordinates for the pickup truck you requested oh thank god thing is the coordinates have it on the engleton property what theres like a fiveyard possibility of error or something so im not exactly sure how to proceed with this you want me to send a dep no no she said hurrying to the far side of the living room and looking toward the main house i cant believe this im so sorry let me look around and get back to you does it show where on the property does it get that detailed theres a hybrid view satellite image laid on top of the mapping software it shows the truck as in the main house like the living room but theres that margin of error ill look call me back would you please promise give me five minutes she disconnected the call and slipped the phone into a pocket absentmindedly she crossed the driveway oblivious to the chittering of tree squirrels and a redsailed paraglider working the thermals above a northern ridge to her there was only the garage the closer she drew to it the more trepidation maybe the device had been removed from the truck and left in the garage and if so what did that say about the trucks disappearance she and walt had checked the garage had stood in the empty bay she rose to tiptoe and peered through the garage doors glass pane looking in on the truck bed parked right where it belonged she felt foolish and embarrassed to have put walt up to the gps search kira had obviously taken the truck and returned it and fiona found herself overcome with anger furious at the girl for putting her through the worry and concern she marched to the front door of the home and found it locked she knocked loudly pounding on the door kira didnt answer she tried the handle again and stormed back across to the cottage to get her key returning she opened the door and barged inside kira kira she marched room to room growing madder by the minute kira hit the stairs running up a flight two doors to the right threw open the door empty no sign of kira no different than the room had appeared the last time shed checked a twinge of fright ran through her it hadnt occurred to her someone other than kira might have returned the truck someone other than kira might be inside the mountain man for instancewas he the one shed apparently mentioned while under hypnosis the one whod given her the concussion she moved stealthily creeping along the hallway toward the elegant stairway leading to the groundlevel living room clinging to the handrail she took each step carefully turning her head side to side to take in everything around her her damn you kira attitude had reversed and she was now once again concerned for the missing girls wellbeing panicked over her own situation wondering how shed allowed her emotions to dictate nancy would have sent a deputy had she asked in her determination to protect kira and the engletons shed acted hastily and stupidly she hesitated at the bottom of the stairs she heard the low hum of the twin subzero refrigerators the ticking of the ships clock on the mantel ringing in her ears and the thump of her own blood coursing past her eardrums the house was enormous multiple levels with several wings a wine cellar a sauna a workout gym on the one hand she felt terrified on the other if kira had returned the truck she wanted to talk to her before the sheriffs office did the front door called to her she would feel safer once outside instead she rounded the bottom of the unsupported curving cherrywood staircase and moved down a hallway lined with closets and family photos to a back stairwell that she followed lower to the split level she searched the weight room the hisher bathrooms and the sauna two guest bedrooms a utilitystorage area the laundry she returned upstairs and made her way into the south wing a guest wing consisting of a pair of twobedroom suites checked all the closets and all four bathrooms as she returned to the living room she was filled with an added sense of dread the feeling of being watched she snatched up a leaded crystal cubea philanthropic award given to michael and leslie by a california hospitalclutching it like a baseball but wielding it as a weapon carried high at her shoulder i know youre in here she said softly knowing no such thing i can feel you feeling too much to know what she felt she eyed the wide hallway leading to the garage it stretched out beyond her suddenly much longer more closets and a pantry lined ita person could hide behind any of the doors waiting she tried to slow her breathing to calm herself but it was useless she pressed her back to the wall and edged toward the first of the doors jumped across the hall and backed up to the opposing wall she kept the glass cube held high visualized herself smashing it into a strangers face she tacked her way down the hall wall to wall ever alert reached the garage door and threw it open it bounced off the stopper and came back at her and she blocked it with her toe a box freezer in the garage groaned and fiona suddenly viewed it as a coffin and moved toward it cautiously slipping past the pickup truck that shouldnt have been there with her back to the freezer her fingers deciphered its latch and forced it open and she lifted its springed lid blindly finally gathering the courage to peer behind her and see nothing but bricks of frozen meat in white paper wrappers now finally she felt her nerves settling her last great fear was that she would find kira in the truck she gathered her courage climbed onto the side rail and holding to the exterior mirror with her left hand and still clutching the glass cube in her right pressed her eyes to the glass and tried to see inside she moved front seat to back empty she climbed into the truck bed and hesitated only briefly before popping the lid on the tuffbox toolbox mounted below the cabs rear window tools a jumper cable no body she sat down into the truck bed and released an audible sigh waited for her lightheadedness to pass and collected herself slowly the anger at kira reentered her and it was everything she could do to suppress it she owed nancy a phone call she owed walt an explanation but her imagination got the better of her shed been fixated on trying to explain what had happened to her where kira had gone the body at the bottom of the mountain knowing nancy was expecting her call she moved quickly now suddenly energized freed of the weight of her prior fears it was almost as if shed rehearsed it the way she went about it so methodically she found the blank sheets of paper and the scotch tape in michaels office the acrylic paint in leslies painting studio she tripped the garage door on her return and climbed into the truck and found the keys in the center islands cup holder she slipped the key into the ignition and left the drivers door open and the key alarm sounding as she placed the tapedtogether sheets of copy paper behind each of the truck tires mixed the eggplant purple paint with some water and meticulously applied the paint to the tire rubber as if shed done it a hundred times she climbed behind the wheel and backed up the truck and then collected the four strips of paper and liked three of the four she saw she repeated the procedure for the front right tire and then wiped down all four tires with a wet rag and parked the truck and shut the automatic door returning to her cottage where she generated photographs of the truck tire impressions from the gale crime scene the scale was wrong and so she reprinted two of the photographs this time enlarging the photos to where she got less of the impression but a wider width then placing the photographs next to the impressions shed taken from the garage she studied the tread pattern and took out a tape measure from her kitchen junk drawer and noticed her hands shaking as she counted the rows of tread pattern and tried to calculate the widths at last she turned around the photo to her right and moved it along the tapedtogether copy pages and gasped at what she saw she jumped and let out a cry as the phone in her pocket buzzed jolting her she reached for it knowing who it would be before ever checking the caller id her thumb hovered wondering whether to answer it or not walt sat facing the computer screen on his diningroom table when he heard the rhythmic tap of footfalls on his front porch steps he was sending an email to boldt and hoping to skype with the detective to talk through the facts of the case and see if they converged for boldt as they did for him the tire impressions had come back from the lab as a bfgoodrichbranded treadthe radial long trail the pollen collected from gales earwax had been identified as coming from a yellow lily hed witnessed boatwrights gardener digging up a flower bed to mix blood into the soil if he went after a man like boatwright he would need more than pollen and some hunchesan army of attorneys was more like it the footfalls stopped and walt prepared himself for the doorbell or a knock at ninethirty pm it was late for a visitor and the longer the pause continued the more convinced he became that an insecure fiona awaited him at the door he pushed back his chair and closed the distance to the front door quickly not wanting to lose her throwing it open and feeling his expectation crushed as he stood facing a stranger hello he said in her late twenties or early thirties the woman had a tired look about her stringy brown hair wore no makeup had seven empty holes running up the spine of her left ear sheriff a husky smokers voice yes may i help you i need to speak with you i keep office hours if you dont mind away from the office the woman said interrupting a friend knew where you lived im sorry about this he motioned her inside and then to the couch he offered her something to drink hoping she wouldnt accept and she asked for coffeeany kind of coffee instants all right he used his coffee press to make two cups and served her in a simpsons mug his was a state farm beatrice combatcrawled across the floor to the womans feet and sighed to make sure to be noticed the woman bent down and petted her and bea set up camp climbing to a sitting position and placing just her jaw onto the edge of the couch for convenience im sorry the woman said but its wrong of me to come here but i cant be seen at your office or at least i dont want to be seen at your office you dont have to apologize its about the man the dead man walt kept his outward appearance calm though his insides were anything but martel gale martel yes i didnt know his last name at the time you knew him walt said he sipped the hot coffee in part to maintain the image of nonchalance sheriff im a member of nanarcotics anonymous the whole idea is anonymity so my being here is radically wrong but when i saw the story in the paper when they ran the photograph of himthat football onei felt an obligation to come forward im glad you did he visited our group last tuesday night it was a speaker night so there wasnt a lot of sharing but he stuck around for coffee at the end and i talked to him we get a lot of guests and like them to feel welcome walt wondered if martel gales good looks had had anything to do with her welcome he stuck around awhile she continued and we got to talking and though he didnt come right out and say it i think he was here in sun valley for the ninth step you know im familiar with twelvestep programsaa most of alland believe me we appreciate their success but im not familiar with the particular steps you might call it atonement she said we make direct amends to such people wherever possible except when to do so would injure them or others basically its our chance to remove excess baggage and clear the way for our full recovery i realize there is the assumption of anonymity walt said choosing his words carefully but with mr gale dead im hoping we can look beyond that and you can tell me as much as you know and i would except the last part of the step kind of prevents that i mean i have no way of knowing who such information might injure and its wrong for me to come here and talk about this in the first place much less accidentally harm or injure someone by doing so thats for the addict to decide im not about to play higher power lets back up a moment walt said he kept all urgency out of his voice found his professional self no matter how odd it felt to engage inside his own house he came to your meeting you two met after the meeting did you happen to go somewhere did this all take place at the meeting itself we might have gone for a cup of coffee at tullys and from what he told you you came to believe he was here in town for the ninth step yes so he would have been meeting with someone walt said more than one she blurted out before squinting at him accusingly the point is walt said we dont harm or injure people ellen ellen we the sheriffs office our job is just the opposite we protect people in this case its too late to protect mr gale our jobmy jobbecomes explaining his death and as you can imagine that can often be a tall order as it is in this case given mr gales status as a visitor to our valley and something of an unknown add to that his celebrity status as a sports figure and it gets more complicated which is one of the reasons i couldnt come to your office i do not want my name or face on the news no one knows i used sheriff not my boss not my family na saved my life but if im outed thats not going to happen youd be surprised how easily it does happen you are safe here until i find some reporter was camped in the bushes she was right reporters occasionally hounded his home her anonymity wasnt perfectly safe anywhere i thought about calling she said but it seemed like the cowardly thing to do not that i expect that to make any sense to anyone but me the point being im here but i dont think i can help all that much what gave you the impression he was here for the ninth step walt asked afraid he was already losing her ive said too much did he mention names no of course not but he did say something he said he was here to fix things and we talked about a couple of the other steps and i pretty much could figure he was here for the ninth did he ask your help in finding someone how could you possibly know that she asked most everyone has post office boxes getting a real address can be tricky she eyed him suspiciously im saying a lot more than i intended to she placed the coffee down and gave bea another pat on the head i should probably go he had nothing to go on a first name might not even be her real name he couldnt let her go was his mood angry or vengeful him no just the opposite are you kidding he was contrite were all contrite by the ninth when youre using you walk all over the people you care about the most steal from them lie to them cheat on them do whatever it takes to stay high use getting high as an excuse to do whatever you feel like drugs are incredibly convenient in that way sheriff you can do basically whatever you want and its always the drugs fault never yours and doing all that makes you feel shittypardon my frenchso you get high to forget about it and around and around we go but i imagine some grudges build up along the way jealousies or anger at those who stop helping or call you out youve been around it she said i can tell we see just a little bit of substance abuse in my line of work she laughed and rubbed bea out of nervousness i guess thats right she said uncomfortably but not martel gale he said he was a recovering addict he had his proverbial shit together as far as i could tell long way to come to make amends most people write a letter some dare to make a phone calland believe me thats not easy traveling halfway across the country to do it in person thats someone you care about trust me or someones i guess in his case he was all fucked up when he was using steroids and hgh and any kind of performance enhancer out there massive quantities to hear him tell it totally raged poisoned by it a maniac testosterone overdose put his fist through car windows shit like that incredible hulk stuff a real terror youd think that might carry some anger with it he said thinking of vince wynn firing blindly into the dark hoping to hit martel gale some rage he wouldnt have come here if that was still lingering doesnt make sense just the opposite he didnt come here to blame believe me he came here to take the heat even if it should be shared he came here to make it right and someone didnt want to hear him how should i know did he express any concern any reservations we all have reservations sheriff its terrifying to expose yourself like that to go up to another human being and admit your shortcomings and take responsibility for the wrongs youve committed and if you surprise them he asked whats that what happens when youre clearing your shelf and the other person didnt know wasnt aware of half the stuff you did it happens if thats what youre asking i cant imagine that goes down terribly well it can be awkward to say the least dangerous i suppose walt considered all hed heard im not saying thats what happened here she said quickly but if martel gale arrived unexpectedly to someone who didnt know hed been harmed by the guy during his addiction that could be embarrassing or even difficult for the person on the receiving end which is why the step is very clear about that you dont ninthstep someone if its going to injure or harm them or if theres any threat of that but if you didnt know you know she said confidently some of us have short lists some incredibly long but you give every person a lot of thought you share with your sponsor you work out who needs to be stepped and who doesnt your sponsor sure at least i did how would i find martel gales sponsor you wouldnt you wont thats what the a is about in the name but how could i you cant a man died here may have been killed im aware of that why do you think im here they could contact me walt said if the sponsor wanted to if someone told him or her that i needed to talk to them probably wouldnt but might might i suppose walt waited for the offer it didnt come the two stared at each other across the coffee table beas tail thumped against the leg of the table please walt said i know that if its anything like aa its a small world people know people anonymous or not and gale his sponsor knows what happened to him by this point all i need is someone to make an introduction his home group is new orleans a prison group at that walt lodged the information a prison group he could research this without her you could maybe make a call he pleaded wanting to attack it from as many sides as possible its true we all know someone who knows someone its a mans life or the loss of one i know that sheriff she placed down the mug thats really good coffee she said are you sure about this brandon asked from the passenger seat of the jeep its a regular monday game wynns in the group two birds and all that weve got the na members statement and maybe the pollen it feels like its coming together are you going to bust the game no although it would give me a reason to get them down to the office and interrogate them formally i wouldnt mind that but no one would back up the charges id look like a moron he barely hesitated are you going to marry her what arent you asking the wrong person gail doesnt always put the girls first tommy you know that i may need your help here i think its something we have to think about we it has to be figured out tommy elevenyearolds know perfectly well what you and their mother are doing in that trailer and that i dont appreciate it and do they know what you and your photographer are doing the jeep swerved walt flashed a punishing look over at brandon you have no idea what youre talking about no no okay then i take it back im perfectly capable of maintaining a private life without exposing my daughters to every aspect of it if you say so dangerous ground tommy wasnt me who brought it up wasnt me who made the call to lojack without a stolen vehicle report walt had left the company his direct number but somehow theyd reported back to the main office and brandon had taken the call if you two are serious then fine help me out if not its too much for them to handle right now listen i know this is i know its not easy on any of us i hear you okay for all his bravado brandon suddenly seemed more like a kid a good solid deputy trustworthy brave to the point of stupidity but young walt respected him even enjoyed his company but now thanks in part to fiona he thought he saw him more clearly and he nearly laughed gail had ridden the first horse out of the barn and at some point she was going to realize it wasnt yet broke tommy needed some miles walt pulled the jeep up to boatwrights ostentatious gate and was about to buzz the box when the garden workerthe caretakerwalt had spoken to before approached from the other side of the wrought iron wearing a plastic spray tank on his back goggles and a face mask he pulled down the mask ill tell him youre here he said rather you didnt do that hes got guests sheriff hes hosting the monday night poker game that gives me enough to come onto the property i only want to talk to him this becomes a hassle it will only get more complicated im supposed to just let you in ill be looking for a job in the morning you dont let us in youll be looking for a lawyer dont worry he wont fire you you dont know marty boatwright i can be pretty persuasive the man tripped the gate and it swung open and walt drove through those are bfgoodrich on that pickup brandon said same as the lab report just came back walt caught sight of the pickup pulled off onto the grass alongside a flower bed he wondered if he would have caught the make of the tires the way a gear head like brandon had nice catch he said brandon still steaming over their earlier discussion didnt respond immediately finally he said you want me to do anything about it walt felt a pressure at his temples and found himself wondering what boldt would have done a needless distraction he had testimony that at least circumstantially connected martel gale to boatwright and wynn he had the pollen and the flower bed being dug up on the property and now he had a pickup truck with the same brand of tires that had left impressions by gales body its not like we can lift impressions without a warrant walt said remaining behind the wheel as the caretaker stood impatiently alongside the vehicle he looked to be straining to hear what was being said a losing proposition not if we want to beat boatwrights attorneys guys like this we have to tread so carefully tommy theyre goodrich sheriff i can read them from here we dont want them knowing we know that we dont need them changing the tires on us destroying possible evidence i think we leave it for now we could call in for a warrant judge alban plays volleyball monday nights and sitter has his own poker game neither is going to appreciate my interrupting them wed have to drive back down valley to get the warrant providing either would issue it and wed need more than a tire brand thats on a few million vehicles for one of them to sign off on a guy like boatwright and in the meantime if boatwright gets word of what were up to then wed likely lose the evidence anyway so then what are we doing here gales fellow naer mentioned he was here to ninthstepto make amends i called wynns neighbor back and pressed her about the drug situation at wynns something shed given me on my first interview she gave up how her husband has been in this monday night game often enough and that there is always pot pot who cares about pot sheriff listen i know its not the perfect situation but guys like boatwright and wynn they protect their privacy you find mr green jeans and chat him up let him sweat a little got it well compare notes brandon climbed out of the jeep can i talk to you a minute he called out to the caretaker front door walt asked the man who suddenly looked a little frantic back patio the caretaker said that made things easier for walthe wouldnt need an invitation inside walt let himself through a splitrail fence gate and circled behind the house the back patio was the size of a tennis court and included a hot tub he was spotted by boatwright who made a hand gesture but it was too late walt arrived beneath a twelvefoot green umbrella where the eight men sat around a teak table cluttered with glasses of beer and wine and ashtrays cradling cuban cigars walt spotted the smoking joint as it was whisked from an ashtray and vanished into a hand before being tossed into the grass gentlemen he said dont you knock sheriff asked marty boatwright your caretaker told me where to find you technically walt could spin this into an invitation if pressed to do so walt recognized alex macdonald richie fabiano and vince wynn but it was the twotime cy young award winner next to alex who caused walts throat to tighten hed watched him pitch for the red sox all through his childhood and the fact that he was now standing five feet away from him that the man was looking at him smiling at him nearly stopped walts heart the sun valley celebritiespoliticians film stars pop starsnever affected him in the least but a twotime cy young winner he nearly had a coronary you know mandy halifax sheriff wynn asked having caught the look of astonishment on the sheriffs face to halifax wynn explained our sheriff is a catcher and captain of a leaguewinning team bats twoeightyfive pleased to meet you halifax said walt came around the table and shook the mans hand briefly feeling like an eightyearold only to realize this hand had been the one that had grabbed the joint off the table mr boatwright mr wynn a word in private walt said its marty sheriff these guys call me a lot worse than that but marty will do the group enjoyed that boatwright had been drinking as had wynn walt caught a look that transpired between the two it was a look of coconspirators causing him to wonder how much he was reading into it and how much was legitimate for an instant he saw an agatha christielike plot of the two of them teaming up against martel gale and realized his regular reading consisted of too many of his daughters mystery books boatwright struggled to stand halifax jumped up to help him out of his chair and walt thought how well the action fit with what he knew of the man mandy halifax went beyond legend to sports god he wished he could think of a way to involve halifax in the questioning just to spend more time with him with halifax out of his chair walt made a point of retrieving the smoldering joint snuffing it out and placing it into a glassine evidence bag he took out a pen and labeled it the joviality died around the table boatwright grabbed one of the wine bottles and carried it with him causing the others to bark with laughter id look out for him macdonald shouted to walt wynn walked side by side with boatwright and saw him inside to a sunroom off the kitchen he grabbed a wineglass and returned with it and boatwright poured himself a glass of red wine i have a very good hand sheriff boatwright said first decent hand of the night you screw up my luck and youll be sorry marty wynn chided to walt wynn said martys not feeling any pain tonight cant piss but a thimble full boatwright said cant get a hardon without riding a goddamn paint shaker dont talk to me about feeling no pain wynn rolled his eyes trying to apologize for the man martel gale came here to sun valley to make amends with you two walt said to make amends not to threaten not to make any financial claims were in the process of tracking down his communications and were going to find he contacted both of you or at least your assistants or secretaries and that could conceivably put you in a bind so im here to let you get out ahead of it slow down sheriff wynn said looking as blindsided as walt had hoped boatwrights face reddened his watery eyes dancing he reached for the wine but wynn touched his forearm and stopped him who wants to go first walt asked you know my situation wynn said mr evers you want to go that route its not a route wynn complained deny it walt said deny that he contacted you he looked between both men martel gale was a human time bomb boatwright said shut up marty wynn said you dont need to say anything youre drunk you shouldnt say anything was walt said as in the past or in the present whats the difference boatwright said slurring his words trouble is trouble and how did you react to that trouble walt asked marty wynn said yeah yeah boatwright said to wynn i know i know speaking for myself i was not contacted by martel gale wynn said the last time i spoke with him i think i told you was just after the sentencing this is maybe two years ago and marty im going to strongly urge you not to say anything youll thank me in the morning yeah yeah boatwright said he raised his rheumy eyes to walt the hell you looking at the list server notice was the first id heard about gale in a long time wynn continued carefully sticking to his original statement gale showed up here didnt he mr boatwright walt convinced himself he would never have boatwright as vulnerable again marty dont answer that id like to speak with mr boatwright alone please mr wynn no wynn said not going to happen let me explain how this plays out walt said patting his pocket that contained the joint marijuana in plain view is enough to get drug charges on all of you so you will be booked into jail my booking reports are a matter of public record theyll be sent to the press tomorrow morning and will be posted on our website youll spend the night at public safety in jail its also likely to win me probable cause to search not only mr boatwrights home but yours as well mr wynn as i have witnesses to repeated drug use at your residence so there are a couple ways to play this i admit it but you may want to consider just how badly you piss me off before withholding your cooperation he looked between the two men the fight in them gone you can stay if you want but if you play lawyer youre out of here understood wynn nodded reluctantly heres what we know walt said controlling the anger he felt martel gets a get out of jail card and the next week caroline vetta goes down hard ten days later gale himself is dead its either sweet justice or coincidence or incredibly convenient im supposed to figure out which and for whom you boys hold some of the answers and im going to have those answers wynn was too professional to give anything back to walt he remained outwardly calm showing what might have passed for surprise boatwright swam in the wine walt wasnt sure hed even heard him dont want to keep my guests waiting boatwright said you did or did not hear from martel gale prior to the discovery of his body walt asked boatwright glared at walt checked over with a disapproving wynn and rolled his eyes back in his head guy was a terror sheriff sorry hes dead but im not sorry hes out of my life id like an answer to the question walt said im sure you would walt heard the tinkle of metal coming from the direction of the patio knew by the sound it was a dog approaching he turned back expecting to see boatwrights dog but boatwright didnt own a dog it was beatrice nosing the carpet working scents the way shed been trained brandon must have left a car door open or put a window down there wasnt much that could keep bea from walt including apparently an open door on a patio a nosy dog at any time bea was locked on a scent he knew that randomlooking yet methodical movement of hersshe was working he held back his temptation to stop her as her paws tapped out on the stone and she circled the poker table then made a bealine straight for walt but it wasnt to walt nose to the ground she sniffed her way directly to wynn then hurried to walt and tapped his hand with her wet nose she backed up sat down and looked up at her master tail wagging for a moment walt stood there frozen looking at his dog then wynns shoes then back at his dog bea had just spoken to him as surely as if shed used english but the code was lost on boatwright and wynn only walt and beatrice understood what had been said walt processed the message his heart thumping in his chest knowing better than to speak until he knew what to say boatwright and wynn picked up on the change in walt a silence hung among the three broken only by beas rapid panting and the sound of male voices coming from the patio i dont like dogs boatwright finally said get that thing out of my home mr wynn walt said his voice eerily calm i wonder if i might have a look at your shoes what wynn said looking down at his handsewn italian loafers your shoes no he said taken aback what for in his limited dealings with wynn walt saw panic flash across the mans face for the first time it didnt last long but it had been there id like a look at your shoes if i might you might not wynn said eyeing the dog he gathered his wits you have a search warrant sheriff based on the possession of marijuana i can get one if i need one its your call we went over that he directed this to boatwright assuming the man would find the idea of jail and a crime scene team in his home repugnant no one spoke walt broke the silence i should be able to have them back to you in a day no more you want to take my shoes wynn said clarifying are you out of your mind im supposed to go home what barefoot what the hell sheriff two days at most walt said he met eyes with wynn impressed with the mans ability to so quickly dismiss the panic he saw now only contempt and irritability the hallmarks of a professional negotiator i dont think so thanks anyway walt winced have it your way he reached for his radios mike clip vince boatwright said im not leaving that hand on the table and im not putting up with some goddamned night in jail give the man your shoes cant do that marty wynn said ill loan you some slippers to get you home wynns pained expression told walt plenty walt had jammed him up and both men knew it walt was going to have the mans shoes i will keep everyone here walt explained and separated until the warrant is issued and the crime scene unit is in place the cs unit drives up from meridian just fyi and they wont begin that drive until sometime after nine am boatwright said sternly give the man the shoes vince dont be an asshole thats mandy halifax out there hes a guest in my home the two men locked into a staring contest wynn clearly considering his diminishing options he could anger boatwright and make walt jump through the warrant hoop and still end up surrendering the shoes or he could give them up now that dog had no business being in your house wynn explained to the drunken boatwright walt felt a shiver how exactly had beatrice escaped the jeep it crossed his mind that it might not have been accidental in which case bea sniffing out blood evidence could be questioned in a court of law he kept his mouth shut youre not thinking clearly boatwright told wynn youre not listening to me these men are my guests this is my home give the man the goddamned shoes the frustration and anger on wynns face gave way to resignation and he kicked off the loafers but he was not a happy man back in the jeep now driving through town walt finally dared to voice what had been bothering him beatrice stood partially between them front paws on the cup holders tommy you understand how i approach this work sheriff we dont invent evidence we dont spin the truth not in my office not sure what you mean i never want one of my deputies lying for me giving false testimony sheriff so im not going to ask you because i dont want the answer walt reached over and rubbed beatrices head brandon looked from the dog to the sheriff okay got it you should have checked with me before trying something like that tommy got it it was brilliant mind you walt said but the courts would take a dim view of it moons coming up brandon said gonna be full in a couple days nothing prettier walt said shes a good dog she is beatrices tail started thumping she knew they were talking about her but she doesnt open car doors walt said nothing but the whine of the tire rubber you want me to talk to gail about how to handle things i will i shouldnt have dumped that on you true story ill handle it walt said appreciate that sheriff walt craned his neck to get a look through the windshield at the moon growing over the edge of the mountaintops nothing prettier drop me off near grumpies brandon said because walt asked i got a call while you were inside from bonehead the public knew bonehead miller as a colorful bartender at ketchums local hamburger haunt the sheriffs office knew him as a twotime offender now working off the public service hours of his sentence acting as a criminal informant a ci concerning drop me off and ill let you know if one of his daughters had spoken to him with that tone walt would have chided her and he considered doing so now because once that contempt for authority crept into a department it was hard to weed out but his relationship with brandon demanded special handling something everyone in the office had come to understand how far he allowed brandon to stray and how hard brandon pushed would ultimately determine the deputys longevity with the office and quite possibly walts career for he was beginning to sense that if a real challenge were to come at the ballot box it would come from within his own ranks who better than a young experienced marlboro man like tommy brandon he mused at the irony that someday gail might end up the sheriffs wife for a second time and wondered if she would be the one to push her lover to stage the challenge brandon had street cred like few of walts other deputies people warmed to him easily and he to them he regularly turned arrests and even convictions into criminal informants for the office most of the rumors and hard information came through either brandon or eve sanchez as he watched brandon swagger across warm springs road and cut around to the back of the clapboard shack that was grumpies he wondered if by being this information conduit brandon didnt possess too much power wondering what if anything he might do about it brandon sent a text message and waited by the putrid dumpster behind the burger joint the garbage smoldering in the summer heat bonehead miller was aptly named for his protruding forehead and deepset eyes his dirty blond shoulderlength hair was tucked up under a cardinals baseball cap he wore a soiled apron over a sleeveless undershirt showing off some faded tattoos he had one silver toothall the rest chippedand a goatee and soul patch that looked like a wire brush for an outdoor grill there were no introductions he handed brandon a cheeseburger with catsup pickles pepperoncini and swiss wrapped in butcher paper and brandon ate as bonehead talked so im on the clock right mmm brandon answered using his finger to catch a drip youll like this i expect you to knock a couple hours off for this one bonehead always expected more than he would receive of course brandon said through the food lying youll get what i think its worth asshole he was thinking twice in for drugs was allin for drugs as far as he was concerned he had no room in his world for the bonehead millers theres this guy been in here a couple times and i asked around with my buddies and hes pretty much making the rounds far as i can tell rat fuck of a guy makes me look like fucking donald trump smells bad a woodsman i heard you were looking for a woodsman a meth cooker i hear right keep talking brandon said with his mouth full savoring the best burger in town it was half gone looks like tom hanks in that one where hes washed onto that island cast away brandon said thats the one comes in here smelling like piss and woodsmoke orders a burger and beer and lays down a hun wouldnt have thought nothing of it but raven over at the chute happens to mention some moron laying down a franklin for a beer and we get to talking and its gotta be the same asshole franklin as in ben franklin as in a hun brandon said just to get his facts straight thats what im saying thing is it was like the same day dude so this guys laying down the franklins just to be seen laying them down right what a jerk and this interests me because fuck if i know it just dont make sense to me and youre always telling me you want to hear about the shit that dont make sense true enough youre looking for a cooker right i didnt say anything brandon scrunched up the butcher paper and tossed it over his shoulder into the dumpster without looking they were always looking for meth cookers they were also looking for the guy who had tossed the berkholders place to look like a bear attack one and the same or two different guys you dont want it the guy said what do i care maybe jimmy johns wants it johns was a ketchum deputy dont bite the hand that feeds you bonehead youll get credit for this if it pays off pays off how get the word out that id like to talk to this guy if he shows up somewhere can you do that i can do that do that youll get more credit you got it i got it could be your meth cooker right could be worth five hours right could be hes been around i can get him for you do that brandon pulled out a fivedollar bill for the burger he said on the house cant accept it you know that bonehead accepted the cash why you play it so squeaky clean other guys take the burger and the beer ill knock ten off your time you get me this guy in the next twentyfour hours ten boneheads forehead lifted so fast his entire scalp shifted who the hells that important he said get to work brandon advised you look like something the dog drug in brandon said climbing back into the jeep resting his hands on the bottom of the steering wheel walt worked to control his voice maintaining the face of calm in the midst of turmoil was critical to rank and authority within his office it took them all of fifteen minutes to reach aanestead the county prosecutor hes blocked the shoes at least temporarily until its sorted out what my dog was doing in the house when i lacked a warrant that was fast hell question you tommy and ill give him answers ive known doug a long time way before he won the prosecutors job hes okay he gets it youll give him answers keeping in mind what we spoke about earlier keeping in mind that we have blood evidence on the shoes of a prime suspect the truth is a piece of glass tommy its either whole or cracked and broken theres no inbetween theres windshield welding brandon said where they suck that epoxy into rock dings and its good as new walt huffed you think hell let it through brandon asked let us keep the evidence not without a fight wynns going to put up a fight never known doug to back away from a good fight walt started the jeep and drove off the streets of ketchum were quiet the only action outside the few bars and restaurants that lined main street brandon caught him up on bonehead you think its good walt asked felt like it youve got some catsup walt indicated his own cheek and brandon wiped his face clean could be the mountain man who did the berkholders place thats not what youre thinking walt said you testing me okay could be the contents of gales wallet we know the guy lived large and probably carried a wad could be our meth cooker could be all the same guy thats what im talking about its not whoevers using the atm card brandon said atms dont dispense hundreds now youre thinking so its two different guys and we can assume whoever got the wallet whoever either found the body or did him in the first place is the one with the card so maybe our meth cooker breaks into houses for his jollies or for food runs into money after he makes his sale and starts spending it around doesnt necessarily put him with gale whatever his routine hes important to us hes a big piece of this and according to bonehead hes down here in town staying in town coming and going hes got some money and hes living it up or hes coming down at night to sell his goods and spend his winnings ill get gilly some night vision gear and ask him to watch the trails walt said he owes me that he was thinking walt had given him a second chance not reporting the forest rangers drinking on the job i told bonehead id knock ten hours off his ps if we caught the guy whatd he say acted like it was christmas youve got to watch offers like that they can backfire now he knows the guys important to us may try to take cash to keep quiet brandon stewed on the reprimand finding something to look at out the side window listen walt said its good stuff youre going to always hold this against me arent you sheriff he wasnt talking about bonehead walt drove for five more minutes crossing the bridge over the big wood just south of golden eagle a mile south of the turnoff to fionas place where hed had to fight to keep from looking as they drove past it is what it is walt said and what is it over walt said its over brandon crossed his arms and put his head back on the headrest and closed his eyes walt dropped the girls off at the rainbow trail adventure camp getting a hug from each as well as a wistful puppydog look from nikki that he didnt know how to interpret he wasnt sure if this was the result of some male defect or denial or if there was nothing to make of it in the first place a fine piece of acting by a daughter who wanted her mother back beatrice whined from the front passenger seat wishing the girls werent leaving causing walt to once again wonder if the dog wasnt channeling his own conscience he hesitated there a little longer considering calling them back to the car playing hooky for a day and taking them to the park or for ice cream or swimming in the public pool out at the high school but they loved the camp far more than a day with him or so he convinced himself in order to justify his driving off and leaving them for lisa to pick up which is what he did except for a chaotic press conference that had gone passably well and some news trucks out front in the office parking lot the prior day had moved monotonously slowly as hed weeded his way out from behind his desk and hoped for something to bust open the gale investigation the county prosecutor had determined that the existence of the lilies in boatwrights garden and the truck tires being the same manufacturergoodrichas the impressions left at the crime scene were enough to win walt a search based on probable cause but he cautioned walt not to be too hasty thered be formidable opposition from boatwrights attorneys once walt took it to the next level and he wanted time to prepare he also wanted to coordinate with the king county prosecuting attorney so they didnt accidentally jeopardize the caroline vetta investigation by coming off the blocks too early each day that passed decreased the odds the farther they got from the discovery of the body the less likely the case would be solved today passed much the same way walt feeling handcuffed by a cautious attorney and limited by circumstantial evidence he called fiona twice and left messages fearing that she was avoiding his calls over embarrassment about the reappearance of the stolen engleton truck and let her know that he couldnt care less and was just happy to know kira had apparently returned fionas refusal to return his calls annoyed and frustrated him but the next step was hers to make hers to take with the girls asleep and the dishes washed he sat down at the computer to catch up on email the kitchen phone rang and walt snatched it up i found the guys vehicle sheriff gilly i found the suv avis sticker on the bumper plates still on it its gales rental where well off trail or id have found it sooner was those night vision binoculars did it sun warmed the metal all day and the thing gave off a signature after dark im standing here looking at it you want me to open it up dont touch a thing give me directions itll take me an hour or so you sit tight got it he called lisa and asked her to cover called the office and told them what he needed including fiona and instructed them how to keep it off the radio and how to release the vehicles one at a time wanting to avoid a press stampede took a deep breath as he changed back into a freshly pressed uniform shirt he looked in on the girls just before lisa arrived wearing a bathrobe with jeans she looked tired and headed straight for the couch walt offered his bed saying fresh sheets how long are you going to be take the bed he said she nodded and trundled off scratching her backside through the bathrobe and causing him to wonder if they didnt know each other too well gilly menquez looked small and pale behind the glare of headlights squinting into the searchlight from walts cherokee this is good right sheriff very good about last week forget about it gilly its behind us i got me a wife and four kids another coming all the more reason not to drink on the job you coulda had me fired just dont make it should have gilly eyed him curiously never mind gilly just dont let it happen again it wont walt kept the smile off his face out of respect gilly looked all worked up his face twisted like he might cry walt placed a hand on his shoulder happy to have someone his own height but wondering if gillys devotion was to the blessed mother or the bottle this is exactly as you found it the man nodded but submissively and walt was beginning to feel uncomfortable wanting to keep him busy walt asked menquez to search the immediate area on the passenger side of the suv walt took the woods to the left awaiting fionas camera and at least one deputy before entering the vehicle hed shined his flashlight through the glass to find the suv was empty keys in the ignition the keys might come back with latent prints he was eager to get on with it flashlight in hand walt moved methodically through the forest undergrowth he heard beatrice clawing at the cherokees side window and wished he could let her out gales rental had been abandoned in a swale between two treed ridges running eastwest given the overhead canopy of evergreens it seemed a miracle gilly had ever spotted the heat signature and walt took it as a sign that the investigation had turned cases either turned for you or against you and hed grown superstitious over time he saw it as a wink of white a color that didnt belong in the forest palette approached it somewhat breathlessly nearly called out to gilly at his find he pulled back some fern revealing the smooth turned handle and grip of a baseball bat bent and reached down farther pulling back the twist of green revealing the bats wide end his heart was pounding now really pounding like hed run a fair distance or hit the bench press at first the discovery elated filled him with a childish glee cementing his theories and confirming his investigative excellence he thought how impressed boldt would be to discover that his own suspicions of vince wynn had not only been well founded but on the mark just below the crown of the bat was a rustcolored smudge and what looked to be some human hair he was looking at the murder weapon and though he had yet to equate the trucks abandonment with the discarded bat the timing and the logistics the connection to gale seemed inevitable with any luck the case might be closed by noon and the cameras and reporters could go home he donned surgical gloves checking behind him hed lost sight of gilly off in the woods and now from well below the first winks of arriving headlights and behind those another set his team would be here in a matter of minutes and hopefully fiona among themsomeone to celebrate the find with he dropped to one knee and was reaching for the center of the batkeeping his contact off both the handle and the blood evidencewhen the flashlight cast small shadows over the burned engravinga script fontand three letters ton he knew batslouisville sluggers in particularknew the placement of the logo and the location on the bat of certain brands or endorsements this fit neither without giving it any thought his mind jumped ahead trying to process which slugger this particular bat was named for and why it might have been burned onto the bat so far down the head he spun the bat slightly and the rest of the name appeared engleton a wood river little league allstar donor michael engleton walt froze the sound of the approaching vehicles growing louder offbalance and dizzy he realized he wasnt breathing the bat was supposed to have come from vince wynns autograph collection it was supposed to prove beyond a doubt that wynn had taken the law into his own hands just as hed threatened to do the next image in his head was that of kira tulivich raising a bat and coming from the engleton house toward walt as he peered into fionas window kira tulivich so traumatized and victimized that she couldnt get through her keynote address without having a flashback that kept her from continuing the vehicles approached walt hand on the bat hesitated the bat could have been stolen he said aloud quickly shutting his gob and thinking of the mountain man or the meth cooker or whoever had vandalized the berkholders place the bat firmly in hand now he held it down in lockstep with the movement of his right leg as he marched hurriedly toward the idling jeep beatrice went frantic with his approach the headlights of the oncoming cars grew nearer gilly menquez appeared out of nowhere at the rear of the suv sheriff walt stopped keeping the bat screened from menquez gilly you got anything walt didnt answer for me to do he added wave those cars down and keep them from contaminating the scene stop them back there as far as you can and tell them to kill their lights hurry it up gilly took off running a moment later as the car lights went dark walt slipped open his jeeps back hatch switched off the interior light wrapped the bat in a blue tarp the same blue tarp theyd used to move gales body and tucked the bundle behind his emergency backpack at the hinge of the backseat he told himself he was merely preserving evidence was hiding it so that no one would know of its existence so that there could be no possibility of it leaking to the press before hed had it properly recorded and analyzed so that whatever evidence it provided could be used effectively and properly before it was misused and abused in the court of public opinion he was not withholding evidence not doing anything wrong but then why had he hidden the bat from gilly why had he secreted it in the back of his jeep rather than record its location with a photographsop for a first officers discovery of any suspected murder weapon he shut the hatch as fiona emerged into the glow of the jeeps headlights from behind her appeared barge levy carrying a heavy backpack in his right hand and then a moment later two deputies one of them tommy brandon sheriff fiona called out juggling two camera bags she looked skeletal in the pale light fragile and pale and exhausted as she hurried ever closer ms kenshaw walt said his voice breaking the digital clock on the kitchen microwave read walt was forced to decide whether or not to wake lisa and hed ruled in favor of giving her a chance to sleep at least part of the night in her own bed she drove off in her robe and jeans blearyeyed but grateful for the chance to get home with her out of the house he pulled the blue bundle from the vehicle and walked it around to the privacy of the back door never doubting for a moment that he might be watched hed long since learned two things in law enforcement everyone carried at least one damaging secret and there was no such thing as privacy with the blinds drawn he carefully unfolded the tarp and stared at the bloody bat wondering what the hell he was doing he had a variety of excuses at the ready he was protecting the investigation from a leak that could potentially strengthen wynns defense though the inscription to michael engleton made that a difficult angle he was keeping the first real significant evidence away from any chance of public exposure he was sequestering evidence to allow himself to pursue a methodical investigation and interrogation of suspectsmost notably kira tulivich convinced that he was okay as long as he didnt contaminate or destroy evidence he wrapped the bat carefully in cling wrap then secured it with tape he hunted around in the garage and came up with an oversized cardboard box and cut it down to size with a razor knife and crudely shaped it to fit the bat he used bubble wrap and newspaper and packaged the bat in the box sealing it with more packing tape he went online and filled out an overnight shipping label printed it up and left the package on the diningroom table as a shrine to his misbehavior boldt had offered his help in speeding up the processing of evidence the meridian lab might expedite the work because of its association with a possible homicide but walt could overlook that possibility and send it to boldt with a decent excuse in his back pocket one day to reach seattle one day to process he should have results in less than fortyeight hours about the quickest he could expect it from the state lab in meridian but by putting it onto boldts books he maintained absolute privacy something that could play heavily in his favor in the days to come in the event the bat implicated someone of interest to boldt in the vetta investigation then his use of the seattle lab was further justified but he didnt sleep well that night he tossed and turned and what little sleep he found was marred with bad dreams and tangled plot lines that kept him barely below the surface he awoke irritable and tired and got the girls off to camp in a cloud of silence they could feel even beatrice kept her distance lying with her head on her crossed paws her eyes never leaving him stop it he called out to her across the room as he cooked french toast she blinked looked away then refocused on her master his fourlegged conscience refusing to let him go at ten am walt left the office without explanation telling nancy only that he was heading home and would be back in fifteen minutes nancy associated such unexplained departures with family or health issues both of which worried her as in her mind shed taken on the role of his guardian since the divorce she often handled personal matters for him that had nothing to do with his job everything all right shed asked a question he didnt have to answer given the expression he wore fine he lied if i can help she added causing him to slow down debating either a reprimand or an apology she received neither he continued out the door his eyes locked ahead of him like a marching soldier sorry to call so early walt said boldts face filling the small window on his computer screen up for hours boldt said what can i do for you am i that transparent youre using skype boldt said instead of the phone but im glad you called matthews had an explanation for us concerning first why dont you tell me why you called walt kept his explanation of shipping the bat short and simplehe needed the lab work expedited no excuse no reasoning offered hed appreciate a phone call or email the moment they knew anything boldt took it all in stride now you walt said the girl at the nursery boldt said what was her name martha sharp maggie pot matthews says shes growing pot out there shes working it at night when she doesnt belong there which is why she was so sensitive about not being there after hours shes doing this on her own to supplement her income she lives alone probably with one of her parents who is ill or relies upon her we scared the hell out of her by nosing around but the point is matthews thinks she probably saw something with gale i mean i described the interview andthis is her magic sheriffshe jumps in and starts to break it down for me i know it may sound like hocus pocus but this is what she does and ive learned to trust her pot underground maybe lights but the point is she was there she saw something and is withholding it because she cant explain her being out there at all hours matthews said the approach is to get to her need for this money identify and undermine her need you establish the need then you point out the ramifications to the need if shes busted for growing the parent or sibling will suffer if she goes down you trade burning her stash for what she knows and everyone wins and youd go with this walt asked skeptically youll meet her someday matthews shes well shes one of a kind id give this a seventyfive percent chance shed probably give it less than that but thats how she is modest to a fault youll call me the minute i hear from the lab walt bypassed the sacred doctorpatient privilege by avoiding the doctor altogether and appealing straight to the hospitals comptroller a man who served with walt on search and rescue the phone call took all of five minutes and by the time he reached the nursery he had what he needed without having to coax it out of maggie sharp your mothers dialysis he said before even addressing the woman behind him deputies milner and tilbert leaned against the grille of their cruiser maggie sharp gnawed on a fingernail couldnt keep her eyes from wandering to the two deputies she said nothing your employer need not know he said surprising her it wont be in the papers youll get off with some community service and even that will be kept off the books meaning no criminal record this is a onetime offer if the information you give me is good enough if you tell me the truth about what you saw that night and dont try to give me the runaround then my guys wont go tearing up every tree and plant and making a mess of this place this is a critical decision youre about to make maggie it has farreaching implications that will not only affect you but your mother and all your loved ones as she stood stone still tears burst from both eyes though she did not sniffle or sob i didnt know what else to do she said its so much money and without insurance marijuana cultivation she nodded my guys will dismantle it collect the plants and well dispose of them you will agree to two hundred hours of community service you fail to keep your end of the agreement and there will be dire consequences are we in agreement she nodded you saw something the dead man she nodded again tell me a pickup truck she hung her head and touched a knuckle to either eye catching her tears i heard it heard it hit something it must have swerved to avoid an elk or deer but i didnt actually see the animal the pickup came off the roadthis is maybe two in the morningthis side of the road and it stopped driver gets out im watching all this from hut two there arent any lights in any of the huts my stuff is underground show me walt turned to his guys and waved them forward inside the openended plastic hothouse maggie sharp pulled back one of the shipping pallets used as floorboards between the various rows using a spade she scraped away two inches of dirt revealing a wooden hatch an elaborate disguise that would have been impossible to detect the hatch was six feet square and the hole beneath it contained well over fifty threefoottall pot plants heavy with reddish buds there was an automatic watering system and a row of grow lights the aroma was pungent as the deputies climbed down into the pit maggie sharp pointed i was standing right here he or she he got out and did what walt asked started looking around dont know for what it was a long way and it was very dark that night the truck had a light rack i think maybe a ski rack on the top of the cab the description fit boatwrights caretakers pickup truck he had no way to reconcile the engleton bat with boatwrights caretaker but for a moment he felt partial relief as if this might work out okay for fiona and more important kira color couldnt see make pickup truck thats all i can tell you i dont think it was an extended cab but it was really dark i dont know exactly did he find anything the guy looking he was outside the truck for i dont know a couple of minutes at least maybe he was peeing maybe puking maybe freaking out at hitting the game and surviving to tell about it no idea just the one guy didnt see anyone else from that distance backlit and all headrests look like heads you know i only saw one guy get out dont know about inside the truck he use a flashlight no sir and you say you heard him hit something absolutely thats why i came out of the hole i heard the contact i heard the tires saw the truck off the road she was facing him now her eyes averted frightened with every sound of destruction from the hole she winced so you didnt actually see him swerve off the road no i suppose not but i heard it all a light rack or ski rack yes sir no extended cab correct lights do you remember the taillights would you recognize the pattern maybe be able to identify the make she shook her head its not that im not willing to try but it was way far away you want me to look at something i will of course but i doubt it the deputies started throwing the lighting equipment and tornup plants up out of the hole they were joking around down there walt didnt call them out for it were going to keep the equipment on file our insurance youll keep up the community service i will i promise i will this was a stupid thing to do maggie can get you twenty years in this state yes sir im not saying i dont sympathize with your situation wish i had an answer for your mother but this is not it no i get that i was desperate i dont smoke it ill take tests or whatever random tests will be part of the agreement rotating the plants like that i could make a couple thousand a month it was just too easy i guess im not saying it was right twenty years walt said i understand you talk this up if i hear about this deal from anywhere ill have to charge you strictly speaking i cant make a deal like this we occasionally make exceptions that door will close if you mention it to anyone i wont report to my office tomorrow talk to a woman named nancy shell have your community service outlined and some literature on how to apply for exceptional health care needs she hung her head and nodded ill want you to look at taillight patterns understood walt called down into the hole barking orders at his guys he then drove straight to the county courthouse knowing this time he would win his warrant walt trained beatrice by the side of the road as he awaited barge levy and fiona he enjoyed the dog training found it relaxing appreciated the need to repeat it several times a week whether on a walk around the neighborhood or more formally with some of the other search and rescue dogs he heeled her he put her on a scent hiding a rag among the sage and rabbit weed beatrice responded with heightened excitement pleased with and hungry for walts full attention basking in it she practically flew into the scrub after the rag found it and barked until walt released her she heeled flawlessly ever attentive of his slightest movement ears perked tail wagging high he kneeled and lavished her with praise and she reveled in it as if this moment with him were all she lived for and he loved her for it he picked some cheat grass from her hair and doublechecked the pads of her paws for cuts she sat without command as he checked her paws head held high her nose working furiously she turned toward the arriving cars before walt ever heard them he met fionas eyes through the subarus windshield and something immeasurable passed between them something he was too out of practice to understand but he thought she immediately picked up on the change in him and regretted he hadnt been able to hide his emotions better it was something he would have to improve upon and it struck him as odd that as he entered this relationship one of his first thoughts was how to hide what he was actually thinking and from her a distant look of worry and concern too complex for him to decipher too buried behind a pantomimed brighteyed hello for him to know what exactly he was seeing thought of the baseball bat wormed around in his abdomen souring his mood he felt slightly sick to the stomach lightheaded beatrice whined and nudged him with her wet nose and brought him back from a few seconds of paralysis levys volvo wagon pulled up behind fiona and he leaned from the window and squinted and shouted hello all set he called out with fionas window down as well walt moved to within earshot of both drivers and said the warrant is limited to the workers truck but gives us plain sight so fiona youll get shots of everything you can barge you and i will take the tire impressions well ink them first and if we get a likely match then well impound the vehicle we can pull full impressions later at the shop all three of us are looking for any sign of a collision or damage to the truck and fiona will cover us by shooting the whole truck in detail while looking like shes just covering us on the tires any questions you mentioned the flower bed to me she said yeah thats correct they redid one of the beds replanted it if we see anything left of what they pulled up i want that recorded im going to ask the caretaker about thatwhere he dumps the garden waste there may be a compost pile which would make it plain sight anyway but i may want pictures he tried to see something behind her eyes to read her to find some indication of what she knew about the bat about why it would end up alongside gales rental but he saw only fiona saw the two of them eye to eye in the throes of need and satisfaction and realized he was too far gone to be objective in the end it might take a call to boldt some independent eye to straighten him out they arrived at the gate and walt called through the caretaker met them accepting the warrant through the bars of the gate which seemed symbolic to walt they drove through and parked and walt asked the caretaker to stay away from his pickup truck as the man approached saying they were welcome to look it over he stood to one side and the trio went to work with a practiced efficiency levy had butcher paper and black acrylic paint in hand as he kneeled beside the front left tire fiona circled the vehicle slowly taking dozens of shots sheriff levy called walt joined him sorry to burst your bubble these are goodrich all right but brandons wrong about the model they arent long trail theyre rugged trail a step up not the same tire no way walt muttered afraid so theres a light rack yes there is youre sure the gale crime scene impressions could we have been wrong about those very different tread patterns walt im sorry well walts mind reeled were here lets take the impressions and well have them on file got it walt headed away but turned and approached levy once again he could have switched them out certainly could have new tires these not brandnew if thats what youre asking but listen we all keep multiple sets these could be his winter tirestheyre serious tires so the old ones might still be at his place or long gone at the dump the county trash dump out at ohio gulch had a tire dumping area walt wasnt past sending a team out there to look for a set of discarded long trails he joined fiona it may come down to you he whispered any dents anything looks in good shape to me and clean as a whistle real clean for a gardeners truck pickup truck owners in this valley were known for putting spit shines on their rigs the spotless condition meant nothing every inch he said got it what is it youre hoping to find the caretaker called out well know when we find it walt said you do and itll be news to me the man said brazenly walt wasnt accustomed to feeling desperate but his eyes darted between fiona busy at work and boatwrights estate with the growing sense of walls closing in what was caroline vetta like walt asked the man seizing on the idea of blindsiding him i dont know any of mr boatwrights guests personally quite a looker walt said kind of hard to miss wouldnt know walt pulled the photo from his pocket separating out gales which he returned to the pocket jog your memory remember were here on a warrant he said hoping the caretaker didnt know his law real well mr wynns friend yes nice lady i told you i wouldnt know what was your impression of how she got along with mr wynn or mr boatwright i wash the windows i oversee grounds maintenance im not paparazzi sheriff do you compost what walt appreciated the surprised reaction appreciated the effect the question had around back walt asked in the aspen stand east light early light get as much warmth on it as i can show me you want to see my composter he seemed dumbfounded if you dont mind actually walt said now spotting the twin geometric shadows in the tight stand of aspens on the back side of the sprawling house i can see it from here plain sight he was thinking fiona she joined him and they walked behind the house across a magnificent patio and past a bubbling fish pond he had a dozen questions he wanted to ask her but didnt want to blow the timing or sound suspicious he needed to think about how to proceed youre awfully quiet she said a lot to process he answered honestly the tires among other things you think he switched them out i think its possible all i go on are possibilities got it what are the possibilities our mountain man paid your place a visit he wondered why hed suddenly started down this path why hed chosen to sound so certain of himself we talked about this kira heard things kira imagined things should he bring up the bat the emergency room could he bring himself to believe any of what he was thinking inside the stand of aspen the air cooled significantly the two compost towers were green plastic with stackable sections the lids to both were closed look over there she said pointing out toward the house walt followed her arm what huh she said wonder whats inside walt turned around one of the lids was laid back open they exchanged a glance im not deputized she said its why you wanted me to come over here right walt said nothing thing is she said we know each other too well personally i think thats a good thing but youre going to have to tell me if you think otherwise i want to know you better he said i want in and i want to let you in i want to reach that place that were so far in that anything can be said anything shared i want to find that place where when one of us laughs the other knows why and when one of us is about to cry the other is already reaching for the hankie like that hankie havent heard that one in a while im oldschool you are nothing of the sort you are dreamy thank you for that she peered inside blue and white lilies she said you want pictures he stepped closer blue and white i remember them as yellow when he was working on the bed yellow she said that would be my place leslie and michaels they have like five beds planted in yellow lilies unbelievably pretty your place he stated his voice raspy his throat dry you want me to shoot these she asked he nodded unable to get another word out you okay he nodded again walt something wrong his mind tried to stop his mouth but it was over before he could stop himself everything he said walt stood backlit by the glare of the jeeps headlights his ghoulish shadow stretching far in front of him fiona parked her subaru by the cottage and stood alongside him do you want to come in she asked that flower bed is damaged he said his eyes on the freshly turned earth the deer wreak havoc she said he looked over at her the harsh light playing across her face when did kira go missing exactly i dont know exactly a couple days after the advocates dinner the right timing and shes in the clear do not go there believe me id rather not occupational hazard you dont really believe that kira i mean unfortunately its not about what i believe its what the evidence proves you know that and before it proves it suggests right now its suggesting things id rather it didnt i dont like any of this believe me it was a few nights after the advocates dinner that she took off thats all this is about she was upset at me at having a flashback in the middle of her talk she drew in a deep breath you know i have this weird memory of you coming by here one night but im not real clear on which night it was or what was said nothing was said because because you wouldnt open the door thats ridiculous if i didnt open the door it was because i wasnt home or it wasnt you i saw someone on the couch my door doesnt have a window in it yeah i know that she crossed her arms well maybe it was me for the record i dont like guys peeping on me for the record i care about you i was worried about you well dont be im fine and kira is kira fine youre beginning to be annoying youre beginning to piss me off maybe its late maybe it is id like to bring a team up here id like to eliminate her from consideration and thats the best way to do it dont you need a warrant for that do i its not my property walt i or i guess you can ask michael and leslie if we can find them theyre in tibet or bhutan or something shes on a meditation retreat so who knows it could be weeks a month or more its to help eliminate kira from i get it okay i understand it im just saying that michael and leslie arent easy to find find them he said for kiras sake its not that simple its not that complicated its late she said you want me to go he made it a statement your earlier invitation i dont think i realized how tired i was why he caught himself there were questions hed been wanting to ask her for some time nowher name appearing on st lukes emergency room manifest her refusal to answer the door that night he could have asked them anytime he could have asked them now but he held off because once asked he couldnt take them back once they were asked he would have answers and he wasnt sure he wanted the answers he couldnt recall a time that as sheriff hed not wanted answers the feeling so foreign to him he felt upended she was protecting kira and for him to go after the girl meant he would have to go through her and it was the last thing he wanted yes she asked let me help clear her he said i want to clear her ill try she said i promise if she was threatened if it was something like that walt she wasnt here that night yeah but you see thats part of the problem the autopsy couldnt establish an exact time of deaththe cold nights the hot days it screws everything up we have a witness he felt her tense and knew she tried to hide it but it doesnt establish a tod for us time of death he explained we dont know which night it was its one of two but you seem to think otherwise can you help me out here how explain to michael and leslie how important this is for kira if they complicate this it only makes things worse for her i told you ill try to find them it isnt always so easy im going to say something as a friend not as sheriff okay for a minute lets say im not wearing the uniform okay she crossed her arms more tightly any more and shed have trouble breathing collecting himself he looked up into the darkness of the trees the shadows from the headlights playing tricks on the eyes i know youd do anything to protect her i understand that urge but dont put yourself in the middle of this the law is real clear about that kind of thing believe me i dont want you or kira caught up in this but a thing like this it sorts itself out eventually and theres no going back and changing what was said or done before it does theres no changing that stuff some cases dont get solved she said some cases go cold he felt his breath catch a few seconds earlier hed been wondering if shed somehow managed to substitute her name for kiras on the emergency room manifestif she was sacrificing herself for the young woman fiona showed no signs of head injury had kira taken off to hide her injuries was she waiting for a bruise to heal before returning hed been thinking he needed a look at the actual medical records but that had all evaporated with her pushing him off the investigation could he let the case go cold could he do such a thing a month earlier he wouldnt have even considered such a possibility youre right its late neither of us is thinking clearly he stepped toward her and kissed her on the cheek but she stood rigid and unresponsive he whispered i hear you i my memory is all messed up he saw now that her face was stained with tears shhh she faced him and met eyes with him she looked frightenedterrified was more like itand he pulled her to him and held her theres so much to tell you she said im here i want to tell you its tricky he said some things may be better left unsaid he wondered where that had come from he couldntwouldntask her to betray kira there were other ways he could do this he could leave her out of it get some rest but i want to she said sleep on it she nodded his uniform shirt damp with her tears she clung to him as he gently pushed her away and walked back to the jeep he stopped and looked back at her in the headlights wondering how he could let such an opportunity pass wondering who hed become bea licked him as he climbed in he pushed her into the backseat and drove off intentionally avoiding a glance into the rearview mirror as lead investigator on the gale case walt was shown and was required to sign off on the case paperwork the longer and more involved a case the greater the paperwork he was no stranger to bureaucracy as sheriff he was in charge of people management and budget oversight he essentially ran a decentsized company with a charter to solve crimes and keep the peace work that was typically delegated to others he and nancy had developed a routine a rhythm to the administration of his office that allowed him as with the gale case to keep his hand in the work that interested him while keeping the office work moving ahead like any worthwhile assistant nancy was crucial to the process she knew what had to be done when and saw to it chasing him down for signatures and ensuring he attended the necessary meetings with the county commissioners and politicians he finished signing a stack of papers and slid the next in front of him recognizing the top sheets as the inventory from gales rented suv hed been so obsessed with his own handling of the baseball bat found outside the vehicle that while hed been briefed on the contents of the vehicle itselfincluding the victims missing wallet found under the seat blood evidence not on the headrest but near the ignition and on the steering wheel and passengerside floor mat and the car rental contract discovered inside the console lock boxhed not given a great deal of thought to any of it the wallet contained no cash the blood evidence had been collected and sent off to the lab along with the rental contract to be processed for fingerprints the vehicles interior and exterior had been processed for latent prints with little more than a few smears and smudges to show for it he flipped through the detailed inventory making sure to read it carefully as he continued to think about his handling of the baseball bat and how he was going to eventually add it to the same list boldt had promised quick lab work he made a mental note to follow up on that he read past the line before stopping abruptly and backtracking it was listed under contents of the wallet nancy she knew that tone and rushed through the doorway doublecheck this will you its got to be a mistake he spun the page around and indicated the line someone screwed something up im almost positive brandon said the atm withdrawals were from a visa with this same bank as in this same card it cant be in the wallet if its being used to make cash withdrawals in town can it sort it out please got it she took the page with her but walt came out of his seat and followed her back to her desk and hovered there as she located brandon walt held out his hand for the receiver she handed it over disappointed in him for micromanaging she and beatrice knew how to get to him tommy the atm card gales atm card it was a visa with what bank purchase bank in mobile youre sure positive walt cupped the receiver and said to nancy find out where gales effects are specifically his wallet the lab i assume nancy returned to walts desk and carried a stack of papers back to her desk she flipped through several and ran her finger along a line yes still in meridian ask them to email us a photo of the card will you both sides and i want that card fumed or dusted for prints she held out her hand wanting the phone back from him meet me in my office walt told brandon surrendering the phone to her brandon tried to fit himself into one of the two chairs facing walts desk he looked like walt felt when volunteering to read to kids in kindergarten walt passed him the inventory sheet where a yellow highlighted line now jumped off the page son of a butte brandon said banks dont issue two cards with the same name on the same account all i can tell you is that blompier i think it was was the one in touch with them and it was this card on this bank maximum cash advances a couple days in a row and he was dead yeah i get that and the card is now somehow back in his wallet im not saying i understand it blompier handed it right to me and i missed it walt said thinking aloud sheriff we were talking about cameras on the atms how convenient it was that the atm used didnt happen to have a working camera as part of its security okay brandon said we were made aware of this during that poacher case you remember sure so did deputy blompier he mentioned it to me reminded me you lost me i think all those trees the forest as thick as it is where we found the rentalit occurred to me at the time that it was a miracle it threw off any kind of heat signature now i know you lost me gilly menquez told me he found the truck because of its heat signature the poacher case menquez handled that for the forest service he knew that atm didnt have a camera menquez brandon couldnt believe it we need a way to prove it what about traffic cams walt asked what traffic cams we dont have any traffic cams you and i know that but is that common knowledge if i knew where you were going with this sheriff maybe i could help brandon stood out of the chair making it look normalsized again nancy walt shouted forgoing the intercom get me kenshaw im on it she shouted back brandon his face a mass of confusion pointed out the office door miming his request to leave walt assented sometime today would be good walt called out to nancy i said im on it walt addressed brandon saying find gilly get him down here for a chat menquez how am i supposed to do that im not asking im ordering walt said his phone rang shed put him through shaking his head brandon took off walt answered the phone sheriff fiona said sounding ever so professional i need you walt said for the sake of security and secrecy there was no window in the door of the offices incident command center but walt felt as if he could see inside to where fiona was working at his request he stood outside the door as agitated as an expectant father the prosecuting attorneys voice ringing in his ears finally he summoned the courage to knock and let himself in why he asked her she sat all alone in the room dwarfed in what could pass as a lecture hall her laptop connected to a large hidef television screen why what she said breaking her attention away from the screen the engletons turned down my request to search the property he felt confused by the look of surprise on her face i didnt know she said why why would they do that i warned you theyre private its a murder investigation its their home their sanctuary leslie is i tried to warn you shes all about energy centers chakras she would see this as a violation of everything shes built up there the peace and tranquility a bunch of men she doesnt know going through her things its just who she is its nothing personal or intentional you actually believe that you think i asked her to refuse you i didnt say that your face just did i need this search he said his frustration vented kira needs for me to do this search youre welcome onto the property you know that it needs to be a legal authorized search i contacted them thats about all i can do you could do more he blurted out youre welcome she said he took a few steps closer half the room still separating them you know how this is going to look dont you hows it going to look are you protecting her do you really have to ask that is that your answer if youre asking would i go to great lengths to protect an innocent girl whos seen more than her fair share of things then i would answer yes after what shes been through she certainly doesnt deserve to be dragged through something like this when her only crime is embarrassment but if youre asking if ive actually done anything like that the answer is no but dont count me out sheriff i will not allow anyone not even you to mess her up at a time she is finally getting her act together leave her out of this please i know this is difficult you seem to be blaming me for the engletons decision when all i do is live there you wanted to reach them and i reached them damn quickly i might add and this is the thanks i get thank you he said thats better is there anything else because i was actually busy volunteering my time to help you with these images im not the enemy he said speaking in a whisper ive never seen you as such if i can get ahead of the curve dont you get it maybe not trust me if youre suggesting i separate you from the badge when youre standing there wearing the badge thats asking too much i cant do that he reached for the badge pinned to his shirt as he did so a knock came on the door and he left the badge in place and turned to answer the door a call from seattle for you nancy looked beyond him to fiona and then between the two of them i can tell them youll return she said no walt said ill take it to fiona he said its good work stay with it her flushed angry face remained fixed on him his back now turned toward her yes sheriff she said through clenched teeth nancy held the door for him but knew better than to venture another look inside everything okay she asked as they crossed the hall into walts office that looked a little heated is it boldt he asked not answering a woman named matthews she asked if we had skype or video conferencing and i told her i could set it up for you can you you dont have to sound so surprised impressed is more like it kevin does that stuff for me at home lisa sometimes she does too much for you nancy said theyd reached his office nancy came around his desk and took control of his keyboard avoiding having to look at him knowing shed overstepped the tapping of the keys sounded louder than normal i shouldnt have said that she said youre entitled to your opinion am i she marched past him to his office door and shut it okay then he wished he could take it back under the heading of noneofmybusiness youve become way too dependent on lisa i guarantee you she only charges you for about a third of her billable hours because if she didnt youd be homeless by now the amount of time she spends there the girls have it bad enough being yanked back and forth when they land on your side of the net you should be there not some paidbythehour quasigoverness aunt babysitter and she will never tell you that she will never tell you how her own family needs her and how much you take advantage of her you got the short end of the stick walt no ones denying that you needed lisa to fill in while you got it together and she did and you did but you spend too much time here much more than you used to and i dont think you even see that the job can fill some of the heartache and no one begrudges you that but you and me weve been at this a long time together all im saying is its time to move on she drew in a deep breath and then exhaled when he failed to respond she said click the green telephone in the open window she should answer she stood there for a second too long huffed audibly and let herself out walt hadnt moved he made an effort to breathe shook his head and moved toward his desk daphne matthews was a looker given that computer video was anything but flattering a dark beauty that carried an intensity in her eyes and an implied invitation in her somewhat husky voice she piqued walts intellectual curiosity he wanted to step through the screen and spend a couple of hours with her he thought of her as cleopatramysterious seductive fiercely intelligentand she had yet to say anything more than hello and good to meet you the sergeant suggested i get in touch much appreciated anything new to add to the case walt walked her through some but not all of it sensing she somehow knew he was withholding from her maybe she expected that from any cop he watched her arm move as she took notes about beas discovery of the blood evidence watched her reread and study those notes her eyes flicked up at him and back down he could hear her faint breathing over the computers thin speaker nothing worse than unsolicited advice she said consider it solicited he said the sergeants seriously interested in your case and believes theres both a possibility and probability that it may overlap with the caroline vetta investigation which is why he asked for this meeting im okay with it really sergeant boldt and i he was a welcome presence here we worked well together i think he speaks highly of you and you thats nice to hear he asked that i walk you through my sense of the victim and some of the things ive taken away from reviewing the case by all means im all ears okay first youre looking for a male between because walt said cutting her off male because it was a single blow to the head that killed him walt was suddenly aware of his own pounding heart and the sound of the forced air coming from the wall vent something so simple something hed not considered a single blow he repeated yes the blow was high on the back of the victims head a single fatal blow requiring i would think a substantial amount of strength the medical examiner could help you there youve cracked a few skulls in your time i would imagine sheriff havent you i have then you know i do walt said honestly i hadnt given it much thought its what i do she said trying to let him off the hook its not inconceivable i suppose that a woman could deliver such a blow but i play percentages statistics and statistically we would put this into the male column another thing a woman would likely deliver a blow to the side of the head not the top down most women have not swung a bat or an ax as often as men and they learn to swing a bat right to left if they picked one up in selfdefense they would swing the bat right to left gale was struck high on the skull straight down like the person doing it was chopping wood listen this is all speculation i can easily be wrong and often am believe me no its good stuff im with you hed be between lets say early twenties and late thirtiesagain in part due to the considerable strength it would take to dispatch a man of gales size with a single blow hes strong and hes fit gale is carrying a few wounds on his hands and forearmspossibly defensive but im guessing those came after the blow im thinking his killer sneaked up on him surprised him from behind that carries its own implications a hunter a stalker and the blow to the head was meant to kill not wound it was lights out game over from the start of that swing as to gale she continued from what we can gather from your contact with the narcotics anonymous member his purpose for being in your area is at the very least unusual contrary to the image of vengeful paroled felon in light of what we now know i would suggest he was a remorseful recovering addict typically such people working through the twelve steps are upbeat even optimistic remorseful forgiving and in need of forgiveness can they turn violent of course im not saying i can predict that one way or the other but statistically i would not put gale very high up the list of caroline vettas likely killers and ive told the sergeant as much if he was there on a ninthstep call then i think we need to see him more in the light of a reconciler he would have come to apologize to make amends to atone and the thing is hes already internalized this already accepted his failures which is central to his state of mind hes turned control of his life over to another and has likely distanced himself from that other man the gale of the past no matter if a person like caroline vetta ranted and vented blamed him screamed threw a tantrum he would likely have two reactions stand there and take it accept it or turn and leave i just dont see him beating her to death especially not in the capacity this crime was carried out how does that inform your investigation she asked rhetorically it goes to state of mind of the deceased lets say he met with caroline vetta lets say when he left her she was very much alive lets say he then learns of her death her brutal death and understands the system well enough to know hes going to be first in line this puts him in a difficult even desperate situation hes assuming someone like the sergeant is coming after him he still has the step calls to make that may sound absurd but recovering addicts get focused sheriff they get into the program and for some its all they know all they live for hes there in sun valley to get a job done maybe he trespasses on that agents property maybe hes contemplating making contact but also fearing the word is out ahead of him his state of mind is fragile hes in the process of rebuilding redefining himself someone shooting at him who knows how he might react to that my informed guess is hed walk away he might return another day far into the future to make that step call but hes not going to press it contact would have started and stopped right there if the agent had then contacted him would he have agreed to meet i think so yes and remember hes full of forgiveness and in need of forgiveness despite being shot at i doubt hed be suspicious of the meeting hed walk right into it its possible the point being hes in an almost naïve state that first year in recovery its kind of a pink cloud he could have walked right into anything his guard down and by the look of it that must be close to what happened someone snuck up on him and dispatched him he was a very big man we both know it had to be a decisive blow and executed without warning gale had his back to the killer and did not expect the blow i think both are important considerations for you walt found himself jotting down notes yes he said thank you have you found the crime scene we have not i was denied the warrant he thought consider this an act of stealth she said i cant imagine the area was well lit i would think there would have been obstacles to hide behind in order to creep up quite close both unseen and unheard the sergeant said youd found his rental in the woods but its difficult if not impossible to sneak up like that in the woods maybe the killer was the one hiding and gale happened across him a lot of things to consider he wouldnt have necessarily known his killer would he coming up from behind like that id consider that two different ways the first it was a random attack possible i suppose but a blow like that a single killing blow implies intent second if it was in a remote location where he didnt hear or see the killer and i may be being a city girl here but that suggests to me he was led there invited there it suggests to me at least premeditation someone he knew im not always right id be making a lot more money if i were he grinned at the screen his own image displayed in a tiny window in the upper left corner its helpful i hope so i dont mean to confuse your investigation to the contrary the sergeant and i were here if you need us available any time if boldt put you up to this he must suspect it connects to vetta i cant speak for the sergeant did he tell you about the nursery about our witness he did and your opinion can i trust her can i trust what she saw she has everything to lose by lying to you thats how i saw it the dumping of the body im not real clear on that on the one hand we have a physically powerful assailant possibly premeditated on the other a roadside dumping we see such dumping along secluded highways certainly easily accessible by vehicle someplace people dont frequent i suppose this location of yours fits with that but the way the sergeant described it there are a lot more places over there to dump a body than alongside the valleys only traffic artery from what your witness said the driver of that truck didnt appear to dump something so much as collect something thats one way to read it the sergeant mentioned a carjacking a viable scenario certainly athletes carry baseball bats in vehicles it would have presented itself it fits with premeditation and the dumping of the body but then were faced with a single set of tire tracks just the one set and if what she saw is what she saw then that truck didnt dump him and i dont even know what that means he said exasperated i suppose she got it wrong the one set of tracks being the key possibly witnesses are if anything unreliable he said were going around in circles besides i have a suspect the blood evidence from wynns shoes is going to come back compatible with gale when it does its going to be about means not motive i wouldnt be looking too closely at vince wynn for this she cautioned he didnt want to hear any more he wanted to disconnect the call she volunteered of all the people gales agent would have known better than anyone the degree of threat martel gale represented the kind of trouble he could make he saw him through the assault trial the conviction he saw him on the playing field all the trouble in the locker room shed done her homework gale had forty pounds and several inches on vince wynn wynn showed his weapon of choice in his backyard you dont hunt a lion with a bb gun you dont take on gale with a baseball bat more like a doublebarreled shotgun i went over this with the sergeant it took some convincing i realize the evidencecircumstantial and maybe otherwisepoints you in a certain direction and far be it from me to contest evidence but if i had to describe his killer premeditated or not i would classify him as reluctant i realize that implies contradiction but the other way to explain that single blow is as a crime of passiona final lifeending flash of anger and rage so intense that it required but a single strike it happened in a single strike a blow perhaps never intended to kill that is contradictory he said maybe im just trying to cover myself she laughed somehow finding it amusing walt felt uncomfortable he was thinking maybe a woman could deliver a blow like thatan incredibly angry womanangry at men like martel gale who had a record of violence against women never mind that it had been a single blowthe human being was capable of extraordinary acts of violence he wondered if kira tulivich had played high school softball or if her family home was heated by wood as so many homes in the valley still were and if so who in her family wielded the ax after putting in a call to royal mcclure and summoning his nephew kevin to his offices walt returned to the incident command center at fionas request its done she said walt sat down next to her and trained his eyes on the rooms central flat panel display its better up there on the wall she explained because of the viewing distance i didnt have time to make everything perfect the stop action helpsit being all jerky she clicked the play button and walt watched the three seconds of choppy video amazing he said you think so is that even ketchum a seattle street but i cut and pasted the signs in and they make it familiar enough to trick the eye i think thank you it was fun a different kind of challenge do you mind showing me how to run it i can do it for you better if i do it he said theres a psychology involved whatever you want she said she walked him through the operation of the video software which turned out to be straightforward and in turn caused him to wonder why shed offered to stay and help out the only thing he could think of was that she wanted to eavesdrop to stay as current on the investigation as possible and it troubled him whered you go she said he grimaced right here i dont think so a lot on my mind you went cold all of a sudden he hated being so easily read did i it wasnt intentional nancy saved him by knocking and opening the iccs door kevins on his way i heard back from mcclure and hes emailed your request and brandon told me to tell you hes herethe person you wanted she knew better than to name names fiona stood looking down onto walt and said good luck i guess it being my laptop ill need it back so ill wait in the break room she was fishing for his invitation to remain in the room with him thank you he said irritating her to nancy he said okay have brandon send him in i want him oneonone gilly menquez entered the icc sheepish and confused clearly overwhelmed by the rooms size and the abundance of hightech audiovisual equipment he joined walt at the front table where fiona had set up her laptop the video window on the overhead screen was black whats this about walt i was hoping maybe you could tell me gilly sat down in the chair fiona had been occupying alongside walt he kept his hands clenched tightly in his lap im not sure what you mean by that he said i gave you a break gilly i know that appreciate it sheriff and how do you repay me gilly couldnt bring himself to look at walt dont know what youre talking about think before you say anything gilly there are no lawyers involved at the moment that can change gilly dared a glance but couldnt hold the eye contact are you drunk gilly right now i mean have you been drinking two beers i swear thats all im fine i need you in your right mind i said im fine okay then walt said thats going to go down in the statement walt scribbled a note what are you talking about are you going to mess with me gilly i swear sheriff i dont know what youre talking about ten fifteen years ago a person in my position would have just beat the crap out of a person in your position it wouldnt have been this way i dont mean to make you angry sheriff some things we cant help that seemed to hit deeply are you going to tell me about it or am i going to have to explain it to you walt asked i dont know what youre talking about walt took a deep breath and spoke in a harsh faint voice damn you gilly menquez ventured another look but again couldnt maintain it the first time i suspected something walt explained was when i saw how thick the forest was over the suvgales rental you said youd picked up the heat signature from it i dont think so if everyone hadnt descended on the site at once maybe id have spotted your tracks by daylight you knew that about memy tracking skills i should have understood how it was you failed to hold them all back from the scene should have seen through that sheriff i he hung his head putting the atm card back that was quick thinking i dont know nothing about any of this sheriff but it was a stupid thing to do you could have just thrown it out tossed it into a dumpster but i imagine thats when it began to unwind for you how to make it look like youd just come across gales rental when in fact youd discovered it much earlier dont know nothing about any atm card blompier mentioned the poacher case the atm card the lack of a camera in that atm your poacher case gillythe case you handled there were only a few of us who knew that particular atm didnt have a camera in it you knew thats why you chose it walt gave him a moment to absorb it all not telling me about the suv thats not exactly a crime not something you could go to jail for lose your job maybe but not jail time its when you sobered up and realized how deep you were in this that you decided to return the card to the wallet to let me find gales suv you thought that card being found still in his wallet might make things okay but weve been onto the withdrawals since they first started a person couldnt lower his head more than menquez was now i got no idea what youre talking about here sheriff you sure thats the way you want to play this gilly walt reached for the laptop i need to clear this up i need to know what you found when you first came across the suv i need a clean chain of evidence and you screwed that up for me i cant get that now and youre to blame but youre of value to me if youre willing to come clean and tell me exactly what happened exactly what you found what you saw youre nothing to me if you play dumb like this menquez remained bent forward have you lost your job walt asked rhetorically i suspect you have are you in jail not yet cut your losses gilly play it smart i didnt do nothing gilly he leaned into walt and whispered harshly you got nothing walt dropped his fingers onto the space bar the black and white video ran on the overhead screen winning gillys attention but it played too quickly for him to see it for exactly what it was walt hit the rewind button and played the clip again the screen showed an elevated view of a quiet street with the signs of ketchum establishments lining either side there was an intermountain bank sign a block in the distance the short clip played out as a series of stillslike from a banks security cameras a forest service pickup truck entered the frame moved down the street and pulled into a parking space in front of the bank recognize that truck traffic cams gilly did you know ketchum has traffic cams now menquezs face went a pasty gray he looked at walt and back to the overhead screen as walt played the clip again you see the time stamp walt asked days before you claimed to have found the suv theres a time stamp on the withdrawal as well menquez licked his dry lips he looked like a beached fish we can get you into treatment gilly we can do that before all this comes out so the service will foot the bill for it youll come out clean and sober and on your feet and maybe you even keep your job i got kids a family i needed that money i wouldnt have taken it youve been drinking up your paycheck gilly i see this all the time this is nothing new to me let me help you i didnt mean to screw things up for you i found the truck i swear i was going to tell you but there was the wallet on the floor the guy had written his pin number on a piece of paper tucked into his wallet i mean how stupid is that its like he was asking me to do it i need you to run it down for me i need every detail exactly as it happened including the bat gilly said walt felt a bubble in his chest and did his best to suppress his surprise how come no one found that bat gilly asked that wouldnt have nothing to do with you would it sheriff walt wasnt going to answer that every detail he said including the bat or am i supposed to leave out the bat then again maybe this is up for negotiation maybe both of us have something the other guy wants maybe we both got something to hide maybe this works out for the both of us i need to know exactly what you did walt said the chain of evidence is corrupted its not going to hold up in court but i need this evidence do not play with me gilly but then that bats going to need explaining thats evidence too right you let me worry about that i imagine you are worried about that you dont want to go there were already thereyou and me im not going anywhere but to treatment and jail isnt that right sheriff or maybe youre buying me my next drink and we get all chummylike i wouldnt count on that i saw you go to the back of the jeep just when everyone showed up i didnt see you take nothing out of the jeep so maybe you put something in you want to talk about evidence sheriff walt pushed the legal pad toward gilly ill give you thirty minutes every detail exactly as it happened what you found when you found it what you did im going to include tossing that bat into the woods menquez said taking a deep breath thats right it was lying there on top of the wallet didnt see the blood on it until i moved it but when i did i chucked it out of there that goes down here he said tapping the pad unless you tell me otherwise did you see who drove the suv no engine was cold when i found it you said there was blood a stain on the bat i know dried blood when i see it sheriff you track poachers for thirteen years theres not much you havent seen the bat and wallet were on the floor anything else was there anything else of value in there maybe there was maybe there wasnt walt sensed there wasnt he pushed the pad even closer to menquez he needed a few minutes to get in front of the baseball bat as evidence he hoped boldt would answer the phone exactly as it happened he said he stood and headed to the door whatever you say sheriff gilly menquez gurgled up a laugh beggars cant be choosers walt said hed placed the call from his office phone where there would be a record of it he felt like a juggler who kept adding balls to the circle he kept alive in the air there was a limit to it all and he was quickly approaching it they developed prints boldt said half apologizing three different sets last i was told those prints were being run through alps not sure of the hangup let me put you on hold the phone line went dead in walts ear thirty seconds gave way to a minute closer to two minutes before the line popped and boldt returned the delay was with alps their email went down theyve had the results we just never got them my guy made a call just now no hits im afraid the guy said he can and will email them some other way ill send them along when i get them walt thanked him and asked for the bat to be returned by overnight courier and all the paperwork please chain of evidence boldt didnt miss much id appreciate it you spoke with matthews smart lady hang on boldt said i just got them walt heard a keyboard tapping and a moment later an email notice popped up in the lower corner of his screen that was fast walt said she shared your conversation with me i hope thats all right were in this together walt said you get anything back on the blood evidence never went to the lab wynns lawyer evers put a noose around it the shoes are still in limbo well be lucky if we get them before the next millennium its got to be either your case or mine boldt said he didnt cut himself shaving my deputy got a little overzealous if they take a deposition were going to lose the evidence blood shadow boldt said i didnt catch that youre going to lose the blood evidence on the shoes boldt explained but then theres the matter of the shoes themselves im afraid youve lost me thats ironic boldt said because i think you may have just saved me do me a favor and send across the manufacturer and shoe size will you please happy to do it and if nothing else convince the judge that its worth holding wynn in town until the evidence is sorted out i may need him to claim those shoes and i dont want him going anywhere i dont want someone doing it for him ill make a couple calls you going to let me in on this walt asked youll be the first to know boldt said they ended the call and walt opened the email that included nine attachments all highresolution scans of latent fingerprints the automated latent print system was a national fingerprint database for felons in all fifty states the fact that these prints had not kicked out identities didnt tell the whole story most states including idaho also maintained databases of fingerprints of state health workers teachers law enforcement officers politicians judges attorneys and even some ministers and priests there were national databases for federal employees as well with the push of a button walt could initiate additional database searches the searches would then generate candidate lists and the results would be scrutinized by hand by latent print experts the results could take anywhere from hours to days sometimes weeks depending how walt labeled the request and the workload at the facility potential homicides moved to the top of the list aggravated assault would move a request down the list two people lived on the engleton property fulltime one was a small woman just twentyone the other a parttime fishing guide who had singlehandedly rescued a drowning child from a raging river walt typed up the request in the frame of the email message set to be forwarded to several departments both state and federal his finger hovered over the enter key kevins here nancys voice coming over the intercom walt pulled his hand away from the keyboard and into his lap he pushed back his chair the wheels squeaking walt watched as his nephew worked on a mac laptop on the opposite side of his desk the physical similarities to walts dead brotherthe high cheekbones the nearly permanent five oclock shadow the perfect teeth a darkly brooding rugged handsomenessreminded walt how much he missed the beers on the back porch the softball games their shared dislike of their father hed tried to step in to fill the void for kevin after bobbys death and would always wonder how much that had affected the failure of his own marriage he and kevin had been through some challenging times together looking at him now his intense concentration the singular focus reminded walt of bobby even more alongside the laptop lay a scaled color printout of a human skull with curved arrows indicating a region on the top of the skull that looked like a jigsaw puzzle there were measurements written in mcclures hand at the blunt end of the arrows while their sharper ends pointed to the area of impact that had resulted in the death of martel gale regulation baseball bat is fortytwo inches kevin said he sat on the guest side of walts office desk facing his uncle on the other side of the open screen okay im doing this two wayswith and without a choked grip come on around walt came around the desk and leaned in behind kevin his left hand on the boys shoulder the screen showed two animated figures looking like mannequins against a plain background several boxes spread around the screen outside the center window held software tools including one that contained two other much smaller mannequinlike figures on the right is your victim kevin said all sixfootfour and a half of him a frickin giant on the left is the giant killer the bat is to scale and i googled the average arm length for specific heights you gave me fivefootfour so this guy on the left is fivefootfour so check it out he set the screen into motion the figure on the leftnot a guy but kira tulivich in walts mindhoisted the baseball bat and in framebyframe slow motion brought it down onto gales head kevin used the mouse to draw an arrow at the area of impact and then pointed to the printout to his left not even close walt said hes too short kevin said referring to the kira figure this guy was hit way up on top of his head even if i set it so he doesnt choke up he said adjusting the bat in kiras hands and animating the action for a second time the bat hits the skull in about the same place the problem being this guy just isnt tall enough to reach the top of the victims head so what i did was put him up a single step seven inches because maybe the guy with the bats standing on a step when he connects with this guy he repositioned the smaller figure and though its better its actually too high too tall i mean if the victim is at the perfect distance away sure it can be made to work this way he moved gale forward and this time when animated the bat landed squarely on the top of gales head walt shuddered able to see beyond the world of computerrealized mannequins but if it isnt absolutely the perfect distance what happens is a length of the bat connects from the back of the skull to the front making like a trench instead of a pit so no good walt said it takes a perfect storm kevin said thats all im saying a step height and the perfect separation between the two my guess you could run this a dozen times and youd be lucky for it to come out right once or twice its not a highpercentage shot and the highpercentage shot thats different two options kevin replaced the kira figure with another taller figure from the toolbox six foot sixfootone wouldnt matter if it was twohanded or one the length of the guys arms more than compensates slightly chokedup on the bat he completed setting up the scene and put the new figure into motion the bat was lifted high in the air and came down squarely with the end of the bat impacting the top of gales skullexactly as mcclure had suggested thats a frickin bullseye six foot sixfootone walt said his voice giving away his relief kevin looked over his shoulder and into walts face whats up with that he didnt wait for an answer i didnt say it was the only option did i when kevin got behind a computer he became arrogant walt considered reprimanding him but didnt want to get into it with him heres the thing i forgot tiptoes when you really whale on a bat he scooted out stood up and demonstrated rising to his tiptoes as he swung high overhead okay slipping back into the chair he manipulated the laptop to replace the taller assailant with a slightly smaller one the figure rose up onto bent feet and the bat came down the impact perfectly reflecting mcclures notes kevin highlighted some areas and made the assailant stand once again walt returned to his earlier thought there were only two people living on the engleton property a minute earlier kevin had all but ruled out kira how tall walt choked out kevin moved the cursor arrow to the top of the head of the assailant figure and steadied it there a yellow box popped up alongside the arrow containing the measurement cm inches walt asked dryly he already knew the answerhis height when wearing a pair of boots kevin asked the software for the conversion a new number filled the box in fivefooteight kevin said or more precisely fivefooteight on tiptoesix foot sixfootone walt remembered kissing her coming slightly off his heels to reach her lips he thanked kevin and politely asked him to leave telling him he thought he could get him some compensation as a consultant and kevin saying how he didnt care about getting paid when they both knew otherwise the kid was carting bags at the sun valley lodge and delivering room service how long was that going to last walt shut his office door and returned to his chair and stared at the email there waiting to be sent his request for the fingerprint work it wasnt a matter of thinking clearly he couldnt think at all the number fivefooteight stuck in his head like a wedge like a baseball bat to the top of his skull back to kevins perfect storm a smaller person elevated on a step at just the right distance from gale a taller person killing the man easily but it was the last option that wouldnt leave his thoughts the last option that had been building like a tsunami inside him he hit enter and the computer made a swishing sound indicating the email had been sent some cases dont get solved shed said to him some cases go cold at the time hed thought shed been protecting kira brandon his stocking feet up on the trailers small coffee table his hand in a bag of white corn chips and his eye on the mariners fourth inning at bat spoke through a full mouth i think you two should talk gail paying bills at what passed for the kitchen table didnt look up we talk im just saying and im telling you we do maybe we need to think about getting a bigger place oh yeah thats going to happen i can barely pay the electric maybe you need to think about what we talked about still not looking up she continued writing out the check maybe you need to get some overtime theres a freeze you know that then some security work you know how many people up here have bodyguards you want me working eighteen hours a day seriously theres nothing out there for me you think im going to wait tables or something she pushed the pile of checks to the edge of the table you need to sign these brandons cell phone rang from the back bedroom he struggled to standing spilled the chips and pushed past her to reach the phone before the call went to voice mail it was the little nuisances that bothered tommy brandonvoice mail catching calls lawn mowers that wouldnt start birth control interrupting the act the bathroom counter being cluttered with beauty products he could leave the wars and the economy and illegal immigration to others just give him a remote control with a button that worked yeah he barked into a phone that looked toylike in his big hand bonehead slow down thats better now youre sure yeah its worth something dont do anything dont say anything go back to flipping burgers and leave this to me he slapped the phone shut and right back open hit a speed dial key its me tommy bonehead says our guy is at the casino right now a pal of his bartends there called him suspects got a burger and beer in front of himyeah five seven minutes max he moved quickly down the trailers narrow aisle and found the black windbreaker hanging on a peg by the doorsheriff it read on the back in bold yellow letters he returned to the small bedroom his ear pinched to the phone and wrapped his gun belt around his waist buckling it okay ill call it in ill wait i promise the phone went into his pocket he kissed her on the top of her head as he swept past her his hand was on the door later your vest she said he kept it behind the front seat of the pickup he paused there at the front door for a second thinking that only the exwife of a cop would have been able to decipher what was going on based on one end of a phone call yeah he said be safe nothing stupid as he ran to the truck he was wondering if this was how shed sent walt out the door all those years if she hadnt simply traded him in for a newer model it made him feel cheap it made him relive a dozen conversations that the sheriff had started some completed some not a twilight zone moment as he stepped into another life a life different from the one he thought hed been living jesus he muttered to himself as he yanked open the drivers door and climbed behind the wheel he pulled the door shut as he backed out the tires yelped as he throttled down he fished the bluetooth device into his ear and got the phone dialing officer in need of assistance he said running a stop sign and fishtailing out onto the twolane highway he forgot all about the vest behind the seat just one brandon mumbled to himself as a ketchum police department cruiser pulled to the curb and parked across main street ketchums nightlife scene was confined to this twoblock stretch of bars and restaurants bookended by traffic lights tourists milled outside the establishments and jaywalked to join friends on either side the casinos aframe appropriately pushed a few yards back from the other buildings on main street as if shunned by the mainstream population was not for the faint of heart nor was it for the tourists if ketchum had bikers this was where theyd go it served as home for the hardcore drinkers the barflies and the locals who preferred tattoorevealing tshirts the women wore their shirts tight and their lipstick red some nights you could bowl a frame down the center of the place and then there were nights like this when it looked like a convention was under way the allman brothers shook the exterior wall as brandon approached the establishments doorway which was open to the night air his backup was positioned at the casinos rear door in case the mountain man made a break but he had no description to give the cop no way for this guy to discern one person from the next and when a copor in his case a deputy sheriffentered a place like the casino it would be like shining a flashlight under the fridgethe roaches were sure to scatter brandon stepped through the door and pressed his back against a bulletin board covered in flyers for secondhand fishing boats and twelvestep groups he kept the yellow lettering to the wall kept the windbreaker zipped to his navel just high enough to hide the gun belt at sixfour he had a clear view over the heads of the customers five deep and crowding the bar of the pool table in the back and the line of deuces to the right two guys sitting at separate tables had empty red plastic baskets in front of them the deli paper stained with oil and catsup either could be the mountain man practically everyone in the place could qualify given the beards the sweat stains and the unkempt hair brandon searched the three behind the bartwo guys and a girlall moving calmly but at light speed to address the needs of the customers the beer taps remained on a plastic cup or mug replacing the last and catching the next horse piss brandon thought hed hoped for eye contact with one of the male bartenders was surprised when the hardfaced woman connected with him and cocked her head just faintly to her left indicating the second of the two at the tables brandon didnt acknowledge knew better than to connect her with himself just for an instant he remembered his vest behind the seat in the truck heard her voice reminding him just for an instant he considered going back to get it howdy deputy a male voice called out loudly from brandons left offered as a warning to the clientele it came from one of the bartenders a guy named stone whom brandon had once arrested for breaking the windshield of his girlfriends car with her mailbox uprooted with a fortypound ball of concrete on the business end while stones warning didnt cause a mass exodus some of those in the room froze and a few slinked away both the men sitting in front of the red food baskets stayed rooted in their seats neither so much as looked up brandon didnt move he wasnt going to have a bartender dictating how this went down he checked his watch the sheriff could arrive anytime in the next few minutes maybe another backup or two he liked those odds much better than twotoone he adjusted the bluetooth in his ear hoping it might ring hoping the sheriff was close despite stones broadcast despite the wandering eyes not many had landed upon him maybe no one cared maybe those that did were now gone what he didnt like was the collective cool of his two suspects against the far wall not so much as a twitch from either his bluetooth purred he touched the device and connected the call yeah i have a runner in custody the kpd cop announced lose him brandon said softly say what hes cuffed and on the way to the cruiser no no no lose him return to post brandon ended the call moron the sin was not arresting the wrong guy but leaving his post hed lost his backup he pulled the phone from his pocket and speeddialed fleming came the sheriffs voice in his ear your twenty just passing the hospital five minutes i make my move and the front door goes unguarded got it my backup vacated the back im wide open here do you see our boy yeah could be one of two im looking at does he see you its a work in progress sheriff hold tight tommy you hear me for once hold tight its about to go down id love to be wrong about that me too two minutes away ill take the front out he slipped the phone back into his pocket felt the bulge of his handgun in the holster remembered the vest behind the seat in the truck was that what was stopping him he wondered had he allowed gails warning to wedge into the cracks that held duty in place over the mortal fear that always existed the noise of the place was getting to him he found a mirror behind the bar that allowed him to monitor both men without facing them the man at the second table the one farthest away reached beneath the table and brandons right hand sought out his own gun up under the windbreaker the guy held a wad of bills not a weapon and brandon saw what appeared to be a neat stack of hundreds with smaller bills in the fold the man peeled off a ten and a five and left them on the table returning the money to his pocket the man stood and brandon saw it too late the guy fired a single shot into the ceiling everyone in the room ducked at the same instant all but brandon all but the one man trained not to duck he was reaching for his own sidearm as the second bullet was fired brandon was jerked to his left it was a hot searing pain but not overwhelming the way hed imagined it might feel he felt his breath catch instantly lightheaded heard a car door out there somewhere and knew it was the sheriff wondered if the sheriff had heard the shots the man whod shot himtheir mountain manswung a chair through the window alongside his table raked a leg of the chair along the lower edge clearing the shards of broken glass and jumped through and out onto the sidewalk the sheriff came through the door taking one step past him and rose onto his toes immediately seeing the broken window here brandon coughed out slouching toward the floor the sheriff spun around damn it he said holstering his weapon and reaching out to catch his deputy some help here he reached for his radio clipped to his uniform brandon heard officer down request ambulance he fought against the purple ooze at the edges of his vision fought against the image of the muzzle flash from the handgun that burst of light occupied his thought had overtaken him stay with me he heard the sheriff he wasnt sure where that had come from his brother a priest no white light no journey through his lifetime memories only that dark purple rim flooding in from the edges like a spreading pool of blood that and a penetrating cold a cold like no other the cold of fear the cold of the unknown of outright terror there was no warm wash of love no angels just that cold dragging him down and unrelentingly pulling him out of sight walt was heading to the jeep to follow the ambulance to the hospital when he glanced back at the casino and the swarm of deputies now involved in the crime scene he thought it ironic and unacceptable that when a deputy needed backup one local cop showed up on the scene but when a deputy was shot and wounded the place was lousy with law enforcement he had to turn that around climbing into the jeeps front seat pushing beas wet nose out of his way he caught sight of the chair in the sea of broken glass out on the sidewalk one of the bar staff broom in hand was just approaching the tossed chair walt slipped out of the vehicle and shouted you stop yes you he moved at a run toward the spread of broken glass stand back please walt said i clean up broken glass all the time sheriff im good the guy said ill be careful its not that walt said again amazed that a dozen deputies and local officers could be on the scene and none within shouting range none paying any attention to the actions of their superior officer things needed to change deputy walt hollered three appeared within seconds one from the other side of the broken window and two from around the corner at the back of the club gloves walt said addressing the nearest kramer on the other side of the missing window i want this chair collected and bagged i want it handled by the edges of the seatnot the back not the legs are you clear on that yes sir see if they have a clean garbage bag no problem said the casino employee leaning the broom against the exterior wall you want me to get one better get two walt said go on he explained to his deputy how he wanted it done how he was to treat the chair as a murder weapon that the deputy would personally be responsible to log the chair as evidence and then to transport it to the meridian lab the following day for a full fingerprint analysis and i want every shard of glass collected by hand as well the glass on the sidewalk and the broken glass in the frame i want it placed in a bagplasticand sealed and labeled it goes with the chair to the lab and theyre to test for blood evidence pointing through the window he said theres a toothpick in that food basket that may have come out of the mouth of our shooter its to be dnatested at the same time anything they get is to be run through every database known to man one of our own was shot tonight and while it doesnt look as bad as it might have been we are on this cross every t dot every i no procedural screwups on this you doublecheck everything you do before you do it you do it right the first time we owe that to tommy are we good were good so someone pull some tape here and cordon off the crime scene inside and out somebody act like a sheriffs deputy for a change would you please the two at the end got moving as did kramer walt considered apologizing for the outburst it was born more of concern for tommy brandon than the failures of his men but he didnt correct himself he rushed back to the jeep hoping hed put the fear of god into his team marveling at how brandons being wounded had so deeply affected him from the moment gail entered emergency walt sensed she blamed him for the shooting she didnt say as much but she didnt have to the first look she gave him he interpreted as how could you and the second ill bet youre just loving this he didnt need a translator hed lived with her for over a decade she sat down well away from him in the small waiting area he gave her five minutes it took her less than three to stand up and move closer to him sitting just one seat away was he wearing his vest she looked straight ahead as did he no i told him to wear his vest and you were right to do so he should have been it was in his truck did you catch the guy no working on it working real hard i can see that didnt take long he thought it collapsed his left lung missed the major arteries and blood vessels theyll hold him a few days as if you care wouldnt be here if i didnt i know youre upset you want to take it out on me thats okay her eyes flashed he wasnt sure shed heard him youre only here because it would cost you votes if you didnt look concerned about your deputies but only you and i know that he said sarcastically the comment won a tick from hershe glanced hotly in his direction and then back to face the receptionist screw you she said he had a halfdozen retorts on the tip of his tongue he swallowed them away how do you comfort someone youre still uncomfortable around he wondered hes going to come through okay he said thats what counts how could you send him into something like that without proper backup what kind of halfassed office are you running what kind of superior would let his subordinates do something like that a lousy one he said might be as few as three days if his lung holds hes in good shape good condition thats in his favor bet you were hoping it killed him walt jerked in her direction and she flinched tilting away from him but at the last moment he controlled himself and kept himself in check you think he said between clenched teeth he stood turned and faced her she looked afraid of him i know you probably wont but id like it very much if you would let him know that i was out here when you got here that im thinking of him she hung her head after a long moment she whispered i told him to wear the vest he thought she might be crying if tommy started listening to someone else that would be a first she cracked a smile and looked up at him through welling tears no kidding he got lucky we all got lucky believe it or not this is one of the good days she nodded selfconsciously how weird is that tell him hello ill drop by later ive got some stuff to do he walked toward the doors they slid open automatically ill tell him she called after him it caused him to catch a step he stood there for a moment his back to her then he continued on through the double set of automatic doors and into the chorus of frogs and night insects switching on his blackberry turning on his radio and walking stifflegged to the jeep as incoming messages and emails began to light up his phone my name is michael it was the third of seven voice mails walt was set to retrieve i understand you want to talk to me i amwas whatevermartels sponsor his na sponsor down here in new orleans gimme a shout you want to talk to me the man recited a number that walt scribbled into his notebook bea nudged him from behind wanting walt to drive but the jeep idled in the hospital parking spot he faced four large framed photographs of happy healthy people mounted to the hospitals brick wall they were an illusion and he resented their presence back he commanded bea retreated whining in protest he slogged through the remaining voice mails making notes his patience wearing thin by the time he returned the call sheriff walt fleming he informed the man who answered michael we go by first names only he had a pronounced louisiana drawl i respect that walt said i understand you were asking after me sheriff i have some questions pertaining to mr gales visit to idaho was hoping you might illuminate some of this for me whats shared in the program is of a confidential nature that is never more true than between sponsor and sponsee i have nothing but respect for twelvestep programs but in this case given mr gale is dead and that you may possess information vital to the investigation i have to ask you to drop the confidentiality ill tell you what i can tell you i am not going to harm others or put them at risk that goes against the steps if theres a killer loose were all at risk your point is taken sheriff one of your members up here believed martel he switched to his first name to try to make michael more comfortable was ninthstepping i have no reason to contradict that walt then understood michael would rather deny or confirm something walt said than offer information directly himself there are two individuals in the sun valley area who are part of professional football and we believe may have been the intended recipients of martels goodwill is that so a team owner and an agent martels former agent interesting were you given any reason to believe one or both of these men might have been who martel intended to visit he may have you dont sound convinced you have a good ear michael said somebody else then could be a teammate in a manner of speaking not a football teammate very good a different team someone in the program youre colder you could just tell me walt suggested we those of us in the program do not break the law sheriff but nearly all of us have had contact with law enforcement im not exactly a fan if youll pardon me we cooperate with law enforcement when required when asked volunteering is another matter at least for me so its twenty questions walt hadnt meant to say that it came out viciously something like that balls in your court if you want to look at it that way coming up here that was about his atoning his working the ninth step that was my understanding yes a different kind of team walt said thinking aloud a relationship women not men caroline vetta you see youre good at this can you confirm caroline vetta i can confirm it was women not men i dont have names for you plural walt thought caroline vetta and at least one other he mentioned seattle and sun valley walt stated not exactly seattle and idaho yes nothing to do with football everything in his life had to do with football did he see caroline vetta did he contact you he contacted me we spoke every day this was a big deal for him an important trip its one of the hardest things we do also one of the most rewarding and he told you how it went with caroline walt stated he never saw his seattle friend nor did he mention a name it was my impression he may have spoken with her presumably by phone but that their facetoface meeting never took place the mans drawl put emphasis on his verbs making his speech sound foreign to walt because she was killed i cant confirm that he called you after she was killed when he called me the second time he was in a panic what youre saying would make sense wouldnt it he panicked he knew hed be implicated once youve been part of it you understand the mechanics of the legal system that hed be a suspect that it was weighted against him he never said that exactly but that was my impression yes michael did he commit that crime did he do harm to caroline vetta they never met facetoface he wouldnt have lied to me especially about that he was afraid i believe he understood it was bad timing you advised him to get out of there i did to move on correct did he suggest to you who might have done caroline vetta he heard the mans steady breathing over the sound of the idling car and beas raspy panting from the backseat not directly no walt considered the careful nature of the mans answer he wasnt scared walt said guessing he was angry he thought he knew who killed her he was emotional its true he did suspect someone that would be speculation on my part i cant do that sure you can im asking you to speculate believe me i filter all of this i believe his anger was directed at someone at a particular person yes but i caution you i do not know the identity of that person nor did he give me any indication of who it might be the trip to sun valley a woman or this person or both im not sure i can answer that accurately a woman walt said like seattle he was ninthstepping a woman a former lover or at least someone hed harmed in some way something that required atonement idaho was mentioned in his original plans so yes im sure youre right one of the four photographs on the side of the hospital showed a hispanic child several of her teeth still coming in wideeyed and smiling for an instant that photograph bled into another a black kid on a porch with nearly the same smile the two photos were surprisingly similar then he recalled where hed seen the photo of the black kid and his hand holding the phone went out to the wheel and he pushed himself back against the headrest oh hell he gasped aloud michaels voice came thinly from the blackberry and walt returned it to his ear there sheriff sorry about that walt said dropped the phone i dont know what else i can tell you youll be at this number i will youve been very helpful you dont sound too pleased ill be in touch walt ended the call and holstered the blackberry the photo mounted to the hospital wall was itself again showing the cheerful hispanic girl but the other childs facethe one in fionas photolingered beneath the surface poisoning him at eight pm walt was watching the disney channel with his daughters the smell of burgers and home fries lingering in the air nikki lay on the floor playing animal crossing on her ds while simultaneously watching the show something walt disapproved of but tonight wasnt going to make a big deal about but it reminded him that as he made the transition back away from depending so much on lisa that he had a responsibility to be consistent the girls had learned to slip through the cracks sometimes more like fissures that existed between his way of parenting lisas discipline and their mothers basic fear of how to handle them the girls had brokered these differences to their benefit playing one against the other citing established rules from another camp that likely didnt exist and effectively playing walts guilt against him there were at least two downsides to this first they got away with everything second they learned how to manipulate rather than face the music he could cut them a certain amount of slack for the difficulty of their situationthe taffy twins pulled and stretched in several directions at oncebut for their sakes it was time to lay down the law and see to it that as much as humanly possible gail kept with the same program nikki the tv or the ds but not both he said mom lets me you want me to call her if she says otherwise itll cost you the ds for the week she flipped the machine shut stuck her lower lip out as she did so and huffed as she pushed it aside this show is boring nikki said no it isnt emily complained i like it why dont you read nikki after this show were going to read together the three of us oh dad emily complained to her sister she said see what you did did not did too girls walt said raising his voice this show then reading he looked over at them thinking that these two children defined him more than his job more than any of his accomplishments at school events he introduced himself with im nikki and emilys father he thought that summed it up his computer chirped from the living room skype the girls both said nearly in unison ill get it walt announced but when this shows over he said already moving toward the dining table dont start another one yeah yeah nikki said sounding entirely insincere he was going to have to work on that attitude of hers as well have you got a pen boldt asked once walt had logged on i do there cant be a paper trail right now although thats being worked on did you get my email with wynns shoe information i did thanks for that more to come stay tuned ready when you are these are the email addresses on the list server all people who requested to be notified of gales parole some im told had restraining orders in place others were his victims he had a pile of assault charges by the time they put him away there are twentytwo on here ill read them slowly here goes boldt head down in the video reading glasses perched on the end of his nose out of scale on his huge head and looking toylike read the email addresses carefully calling out capitalization underscores and dots working patiently through the list walt read each back some were easy to identify the sender by the name others wouldnt be difficult to follow up on because of the host serverthe name of a football team or a recognizable company five were generic and therefore obscure theyre going to be tricky walt said i could ask buddy cornell to chase down the real names theres probably an email trail in their system from these people and i imagine at least some sign their names when sending a message all hes got to do is chase down those emails and read them as long as we keep this by phone and off any kind of paper trail i think buddy will help us id appreciate it let me check it out for you i can google the email addresses as well sometimes that works and i can coldcall the hosts weve had to do that before and some of them are pretty cooperative and we have cis here boldt said meaning criminal informants that are magicians when it comes to this stuff anagrams nikkis girlish voice said from over walts shoulder hello young lady boldt said from the screen walt didnt have to look over his shoulder because the camera view that showed his face in a small window also showed nikki standing to his left my friends parents she said they make anagrams out of my friends names so you cant tell who they are cause of all the creepy stuff you talk about at school dad maybe theyre anagrams boldt bit back a smile on the screen worth a try he said looks like my daughters are going to help me walt said cant argue with that ill give buddy a call as backup much appreciated and thanks again for the shoe stats i think we may be able to pull this off by tomorrow sometime if youre available im here walt confirmed they ended the call walt wrapped his arm around nikki okay girl looks like you just earned yourself a job double your allowance if you unscramble these names what about me emily complained you take half the names nikki takes half nikki goes first you both get the extra allowance and reading time is delayed by half an hour hooray nikki shouted too close to her fathers ear the girls took to the work enthusiastically thrilled to be needed he realized it alerted him to a glaring omission in his fathering he took care of his girls but he rarely asked them to take care of him as the computer printer whined from the other room walt realized it wasnt just the girls he felt uncomfortable when others offered him their helphe looked at generosity as a debt rather than as a gift even in the workplace he had trouble delegating pleased to have a deputy sheriff to handle that for him he was sitting there contemplating the mistakes hed made with gail and was still making with the girls when nikki delivered several pages of printout to him we crossed out the ones that didnt make any sense emily explained and we put arrows by the ones that sounded like names nikki said he looked at his watch theyd been at it for just over an hour content to eat up reading time hed been occupied with larry king and stewing over his personality shortcomings he praised their effort placed the pages down onto the coffee table and headed into their room the three of them spent fortyfive minutes reading about five kids inside disney world after dark the girls went to bed reluctantly which was typical for any night especially in summer when the sun didnt set until ninethirty and the sky glowed faintly well past ten pm he got a kick out of their effort pushing the pages aside and reviewing some paperwork from his briefcase until well past eleven letterman was tearing into the administrations health care proposals as walt packed it up for the night he killed the tv and subsequently knocked the girls hard work onto the floor scattering the pages there was no explaining what the eye could see or the ear could hear no explaining why walt could look across a forest floor and effortlessly spot game tracks where others could not no explaining how a musician could hear a flurry of notes within the confines of utter silence walt was bent over and scooping up the fallen pages as his eye picked first one word singled out with a handdrawn arrow then a second shaw ken his eye darted around the page as his fingers found the sheet and brought it up to a reading distance walt still bent over the coffee table both entries had been crossed out distinguished as nonsense words by either nikki or em the crossout was such that he could read the word as fine or fino the top of the page carried an extraordinarily long url that combined the website and the search string walt hurried to the computer and carefully typed the address into the browser bar his throat tight his mouth dry his heart pounding he knew the answer but the investigator in him would not allow any jumping to conclusions demanding precise evidence he doublechecked each letter in the long address not wanting to input it a second time and confirming its accuracy hit enter the screen went blank walt found himself holding his breath as the web page loaded he scrolled down the results the page lying alongside the keyboard fino no he muttered aloud the email address anonweakfishgmailcom unscrambled to fino a shaw ken fiona kenshaw he looked back and forth between the page and screen in disbelief trying hard to convince himself there had to be a mistake obviously the girls had input the address incorrectly but that reliable eye of his picked out the truth all the doublechecking wasnt going to change the results nikki and emily had done a fine job of it he pushed away from the table the chair legs caught and he nearly went over backward throwing his legs out and recovering his balance but he was unsteady on his feet as he stood and roamed the room his eyes unable to leave the screen and the piece of paper carrying his daughters handiwork he paced hurried into the kitchen and popped a beer and drank from the can greedily as he continued to contemplate what it all meant he knew what it meant of course but he couldnt allow it to mean that so his effort was to reframe the evidence into something that made sense offered an alternate universe he pried his eyes away long enough to glance at his watch he pulled the blackberry off his hip and held it in his palm then sneaked a glimpse over his shoulder toward the girls room this was the collision of work and family this moment and moments like it the afterhours demands of the job and his allowing it to interfere he scrolled through the blackberrys address book to myras entry his sisterinlaw or kevin would willingly come over and be in the house for the sake of his daughters if asked kevin was probably awake anyway he worked the device and his thumb hovered over the green key now with fionas cell number highlighted then not the list server evidence was not yet evidenceit would have to arrive in written form from either boldt or buddy cornell to be of use to walts prosecuting attorney walt had mistakenlystupidly he thoughtrequested that boldt pressure his people to authenticate the evidence to deliver it formally could he now undo that request without sending up a red flag was he willing to do so for her did he dare jump to such conclusions without giving her a chance to explain things but he told himself he wasnt jumping to any conclusions first had been gales na sponsor telling him gale was atoning to women and walts recollection of the photo of the wideeyed black kid on fionas wall photos taken of katrina victims new orleans gales home city now the list server email address providing a direct link between gale and fiona combined with fionas recent erratic behavior walt began to see his suspicion of kiraand fionas reaction to itin a new light he thought back to his interview of vince wynn on the night of the backyard shooting and wynns mention of having received an email from the list server announcing gales parole nearly two weeks late he connected this rightly or wrongly to fionas going pale at the advocates dinner as she got a look at her phone had she too received a list server email that night had the man at the back of the conference room the man kira had mistaken for her abductor roy coats actually been martel gale if kira knew about fionas past it was conceivable shed experienced a transference making fionas anxiety her own and not realizing the difference the two kids working valet parking had described the man as a hulk of almost comic book proportions that fit with gales steroidinduced enormity if he drove up to see her what excuse would there be later for his not having used a ruling of probable cause to conduct a search of the property he no longer needed the engletons permission for such a search he had to shed his emotional response and think this through more carefully where did the evidence lead what was hard evidence and what amounted to speculation what would his record show or suggest detailed records were kept of his emails phone calls radio calls informal meetings proper interrogations could he untangle that to keep charges off of fiona was that what he wanted to do was that something he was willing to do he had prided himself over a career of public service at having never corrupted a case or allowed himself to be corrupted the office had accepted donations of hummers rvs boats trailers and cashhe had never once taken so much as a gas can or a dime for himself hed had ample opportunity to screen friends from drunk driving charges or excuse parking tickets never had done it but fiona was different not only could he forgive a woman from defending herself against the likes of a martel gale but after nearly two years of avoiding women in the wake of his marriages collapse hed now found the one woman he was willing to risk himself withand here was his repayment it seemed quite possible shed bludgeoned a man to death his thumb cleared the phones search field and typed an f into the blank bar hovered there but his cell phone calls were a matter of public record he looked toward the kitchen phone his home calls could easily be subpoenaed his work calls his email he cursed into the room his life was a matter of public record he caught sight of the computer nikki had a hotmail account she used for instant messaging hed set it up for her he knew the password he stepped toward the dinner table recalling that skype allowed the user to place phone calls anywhere in the world including six miles up the highway walt asked fiona to step outside the cottage and led her up the hill to the edge of one of the dimly lit yet oddly colorful flower beds where hed dragged a pair of her lawn chairs beatrice patrolled the forest snapping twigs and snorting when she caught something up her nose why the cloak and dagger she asked the nearest floodlight was a good distance behind them at the corner of her cottage their long shadows stretched in front of them following their motions their faces dark i cant see you very well she said thats probably okay walt this is tricky for me he said what is tricky for you ive never done anything like this like what he let the hum of the crickets answer her an old tree house hung between two firs on the far side of the flower bed filled with yellow lilies its presence suggested the children the engletons never had and for walt it hung there like sadness an investigation like thisprobable homicideis either straightforward or elliptical when its your case you hope itll be easy fast and easy when they drag out they often go unsolved this is about your case and what happens is some of the evidence is hard some soft some you can take to court some not and then theres this gray area where evidence is soft when it first comes in but then firms up as the lab gets it or the chain is laid out properly its this nomansland where as the investigator you know something but cant legally prove it at least not at the time its a dangerous and difficult minefield to negotiate because if you misstep maybe you alert your suspect or the suspects lawyer to what you have and theyre in front of it before you actually have it is your circumvention intentional making matters more difficult he said as if not having heard her is that any of us can be made to testify in court as to what was done or what was said in any given circumstance including this one including me for once in my career maybe i dont want to get on the stand there are databasesall sorts of databases out there nowfor everything from fingerprints to dna he continued felons sureknown criminals but also government employees federal and state teachers military idaho maintains a database of the fingerprints of victims of abuse in case a body should ever be found or a kidnapping or abduction takes place its voluntary but especially with minors parents nearly always give their consent he paused allowing that all to sink in just now on the way up here its been one of those days where all the data comes in at once i just picked up a voice mail from the lab the way it works is the computers do the yeomans job of searching the database and then people take over carefully studying the promising matches minors victims of abuse under eighteen are nearly always in the system he made that as concrete as possible i need to ask you on the record so i need you to consider your answer carefully are you aware of the whereabouts of kira tulivich do you mind if i get a glass of water or something he told her he didnt mind she brought them both lemonades a few minutes later she placed hers in a cup holder attached to the lawn furniture and drew patterns on the sweating glass youve won my attention she said i need you to answer the question no i dont know where she is but im guessing you found her prints on something she made it a statement i cant confirm or deny that though id like to he said what i can tell you because its soft evidence is that i received the list server database the email list for people at possible risk from martel gale she drew a deep inhale through her nose keeping her vision set straight ahead if im going to help you he said reaching over and touching her arm and i want to help you because i care about you i need to know i need to know it all a minute or two passed for him it felt much longer please its not the sheriff asking i tried to stop my picture from running in the paper i tried to get you to help me i knew someone would see it i knew hed find out about it she said nothing for a long time he thought back to how hed interpreted her attempts to stop the photos of the rescue as false modesty if only shed explained back then the emergency room she said i woke up with a lump on my head and not much memory of what happened so as youve put this thing together ive tried to figure it out from my side i keep hoping something will help me remember but so far not so much he felt awash with relief she had decided to talk not close him out hed feared the latter probably better if we talk hypothetically whenever possible he said it wont always be possible im not asking you to protect me i didnt say you were and you dont have to ask but hypothetical is still better but what im telling you is that i dont know i dont think i can help you an email addressan anagram of your nameis on the list server for those at risk from martel gale im sorry i didnt tell you several more minutes passed beatrice came out of the dark and lay down next to walt he reached down and scratched her head i didnt want you to know not you not anybody especially not you not given you know us i was afraid what youd think you and gale her shadow faintly nodded on river rocks edging the garden it was supposed to be behind me it still can be no not now she waited for what seemed like minutes i came here to get away from all that him to get away and stay away kira she and i we share that its what allowed me to reach her in the first place to help her find her way back it could have been me giving that speech at the advocates dinner walt martymartelwas awful people like that theyre insidious youre afraid to leave you know you cant stay stuff like that a situation like that its a lot to go through a lot more to get out of but the worst of it is the labels people put on it and how others see you once those labels are put on you and i didnt want that i wanted a clean slate with you of all people youre in contact with that stuff i didnt want you knowing i didnt want you seeing me that way wouldnt happen wont happen easier said than done you think i havent seen this stuff im telling you it wont happen im not that guy the bottom line is i was selfish it was wrong of me he worked to control his breathing he was both angry and scared scared that he would succumb to seeing her as she feared i have to protect her she said she doesnt need this this is my problem not hers if she had any part in it well listen he deserved what he got im not putting her through this again its not her im looking at he admitted thats where the conflict comes in she gasped and turned her head fully toward him seriously but i assumed i thought she took off right after it happened i just assumed some of the most important evidence is still soft fiona thats why were talking why im here meaning help me through this walt i dont know where we are much less where were going why are you here because for the first time in a long time im afraid to be right i would do i will do nearly anything in my power to help you protect you keep this off you she continued looking off into the dark when you found him in that pile of stuff that debris when i saw him he recalled how wrecked shed been how hed put that off to the horrific condition of the body not its identity thatout there by the roadwas the first id seen of him in twentysix months and nine days she said at least i think it was him let me ask you something did his killing happen on the same night as my accident is that what you mean by youre not looking at kira the timing makes sense he said nothing weighing how to answer her without damaging them both down the road hed never been in this position new territory the timing didnt escape me she told him and i could already hear the questions why hadnt i called in the breach of the restraining order why hadnt i at least told you or someone else about my connection to him when i had the chance ill tell you why i panicked my secret was still safe my identity my role in the trial was sealed by the court not even you could uncover i was the one who testified against him i knew that much no one could possibly connect the two of us all i had to do was keep my mouth shut and let him be dead but as it turns out i underestimated the investigator should have known better have you done anything to protect kira a question that had to be asked but as it came out of him it sounded more like an accusation i beg your pardon forgive me for even asking but you said you couldnt let her become a suspect what did you mean by that did you do something to protect her you think i messed with the investigation you control our record of evidence i just need to know my pictures are you kidding me she turned back thats unfair he searched for the right words wondering how the law defined conspiracy unfair of me she said correcting herself did i consider it hell yes i printed the truck tires after it was returned to the garage she left that hanging there like a knot of bugs around his head theyre the right brand the same tread i couldnt be sure if they matched or not i didnt see anything to say they did but i have to admit i considered what id do if they did i thought i realized i could probably switch out the photos in your office i mean its all electronic you probably would have given me access if id asked did i consider it yes did i do it he breathed a little easier the logical next question he couldnt ask where were you that night a simple enough question explain your head injury thats on record at the hospital in fact he nearly asked both of these but he stopped himself knowing the code that would bind him if either answer proved revelatory he not only didnt want the answers he didnt want to have to lie about having asked them if it ever came to that id seen her nearly come after you that night you were poking around the cottage its not like there was blood or anything in my house there was nothing in there my place to suggest i thought maybe it had happened outside and if so i had a pretty good idea whod done it the lilies he said the pollen wasnt from vince wynns not fifteen feet in front of them like a carpet beneath the tree house was a flower bed of yellow lilies the body was dragged through a flower bed of lilies dragged up a hillway up a hilland dumped rolled off and down a scree slide into some avalanche slash at the side of the highway the evidence we have supports that scenario it just took us a while to piece it together thats what we call hard evidence her taking off without a word not answering my calls taking the truck when thats totally offlimits i know her walt its just not like her but listen to me she cant take this do you understand she wont survive this if she did this if shes put through something like this again she is beyond fragile right now has been for a long time shes young should he tell her again that he was no longer looking at kira he thought not he sipped the lemonade to open his throat his ability to refrain from and resist corruption through several terms defined him it was not only a matter of pride but a matter of identity so ingrained in him that to contemplate otherwise made him feel physically sick he searched for a way to do this without doing it to remain true to himself but to limit collateral damage to protect and serve he thought the idea behind what i do he found himself saying in a whisper of a voice is to serve the public to do so equally uniformly to treat people fairly and equally the idea being that you make society safer i accept that thats a naïve attitude but there you have it safe to live and work and to limit or eliminate fear as much as its a cliché fear is in fact the real enemy fear limits us all the fear of illness is often much greater than the illness itself the fear of crime is the same way so im supposed to keep the crime down and to bring in those who commit crimes when they happen and those two things are supposed to work in concert i realize how hard this must be im so sorry walt he drew in another lungful of air like it was his last exhaled harder on you i know i can bend the laws fiona i cant break them understood and i dont want you to have to do either its supposed to rain tonight he said walt bear with me he pleaded a lightning strike can set an area on fire spark a little wildfire that burns an acre or two before help arrives youre pretty high here on this knoll and youre what about a mile from the east fork station house theyd probably respond in under ten minutes five minutes more like five minutes from the time of the call walt the thing about a small fire like that youd have to have the right winds so it didnt hit any buildings not much wind tonight not at the moment which is good the thing about blood evidence in the wild it stays there for a long long time its recoverable weeks months sometimes years later rain doesnt do much to it snow ice but wildfire fires the one thing that destroys it an owl screeched from deep in the woods bea lifted her head but thought better of it he heard fiona swallow and noted her lemonade was still in the drink holder i see she said its a twoedged sword he cautioned when a fires called in of course they respond but we do too were on the property we have access at that point i cant possibly do something like that who said anything about you doing anything he said as if it were the farthest thing from his mind it would be entirely improper for me to suggest such a thing i was simply talking about lightning strikes in general if a fire started out here obviously youd call it in and theyd be up here quickly he dragged himself up out of the chair bea jumped to her feet fiona remained seated i worked so hard to put all this behind me she spoke straight ahead as if the forest were listening when the evidence firms upand it willwere going to act on it its what we do the thing is she said a guy like him he ruins things forever they talk about second chances but there are none people warned me but i didnt want to believe it even after a fire you put a little water on it and a forest grows back again sometimes prettier than it was i imagine the same is true for flower beds were you listening to me she asked caustically whats important here is whether or not youre listening to me he said is that right yeah thats right what youre askingits impossible im not asking anything he said i thought i made that clear telling me asking me whatever shit happens he said do not go there do not even think that thats not you you do something like that and itll be there between us forever it wont bind us dont fool yourself itll be there between us something youll regret something youll always hold against me promise me you wont do this focus on what we talked about i know what youre asking i just think dont think he said theres a time for thinking and a time for doing is that right i dont think so dont make this into something it isnt he cautioned remember what i said about investigations about evidence striving to better we often wreck whats well dont lay that on me i didnt lay anything on anyone im paraphrasing shakespeare oft we mar whats well you blame me already i dont blame people i arrest them fiona i have no plan to make any arrests in the near future no plans right now she qualified right now he said going along with her ive got nothing in terms of hard evidence the owl called again and a coyote followed chills ran up walts spine feels like rain she said ive got to go i left kevin at the house and its late even for him too late she asked he came up behind her chair and lowered his head next to hers from behind he kissed her on the left cheek kept their cheeks touching until he felt the wetness of her tears wiped her right cheek with his thumb pressed their heads together you are not alone he said trust that she shook her head their cheeks slapping i mean it she nodded sniffling fighting a losing battle go she whispered walt clucked for bea and the dog jumped up holding obediently by his side until together they reached the jeep walt thanked kevin for sitting his sleeping children as he walked him to his car howd all that baseball bat stuff work out kevin asked as they stood outside on the front porch the summer insects were in full throat the smell of freshcut grass and burning charcoal lingering in the air these were the nights walt lived for but this particular one he wished hed never been through his head reeling hmm el kabob kevin said making a motion with both arms bringing them down sharply from overhead walt shuddered wondering how he was going to handle this some cases go cold that work is confidential you know he delivered it as a rebuke and regretted it immediately whatever i was just asking its a work in progress i appreciate your contribution this isnt a press conference sorry im kind of preoccupied would never have noticed kevin said sarcastically he didnt seem to want to go it was nearing one am everything good walt asked sure i guess your mother same a head case she means well been thinking about asking summer up there it was the reason for his delay summer was a girl walt knew well a girl that had nearly gotten his nephew killed and yet he liked her they both did for a visit thats a good idea thing of it is i cant exactly ask her to stay with us mom has like totally taken over the other bedroom and hell if im sleeping on the couch and parading around in my skivvies and even if we got the other bedroom happening theres only the one bathroom for the two rooms the one in the hall and that would be like totally not cool she could stay here walt said knowing where this was heading with the girls yeah thats what i was thinking take care of the girls for youwe could do that together you think seriously there are not a lot of high school kids who would want to stay at a sheriffs house youll want to clear it with her first i wouldnt hold my breath if i were you she doesnt think like that with you i put her father in jail true it was as if hed forgotten yeah well but i could ask right youre offering i am it would only be a couple days three or four days he seemed to be talking himself into this or needing encouragement long way to come for a long weekend ask her for the week with your working and all its not as if youll have a ton of time together im hoping i can juggle my schedule that might work seriously though you dont mind i dont mind happy to do it it was as if the sun had come out in the middle of the night he smiled widely and stayed on his toes a beat longer than he had to balancing up there extending his arms as if he might take flight smells like rain it does walt remained on the porch and watched him drive off waving once as a final thankyou as he was heading inside his blackberry buzzed announcing the arrival of a text message a rare thing for him call me when ur upb walt called brandons cell damn didnt mean to wake you sheriff no tommy im up what are you doing awake at this hour brandon asked i could ask the same thing you arent lying in a bed with a hose stuck in your chest no but i feel like it how you doing other than the hose walt asked appreciate your hanging around here gail told me was worried about you tommy doing fine theyre going to fill up the flat tire and im walking out of here like maybe tomorrow if im lucky any sign of my shooter were on it so nothing he took off im optimistic forest service is scouring the camps west of the highway below cold springs guys like this they get in a rut he wont go far smack him around for me when you catch him yeah thats my style walt quipped whats up tommy wanted you to check the property room for not much to do here but watch the tube or stare out the window yeah so i was looking out the window and saw this hawk circling tommy i dont mind the call but it is late so you suppose theres any chance thats what the truck was about not a deer but the hawk walt heard the sounds of the night like a hum in his head not sure where youre going with this tommy hawks feed on carrion like roadkill wouldnt be the first time weve seen a wreck caused by mowing over a hawk or eagle does that change anything walt asked truck hits a hawk and skids off the road so what walt asked he checked his watch suddenly feeling extremely tired the driver knows what he hit brandon said speculating maybe theres some of it smeared on the windshield he skids off the road but gets out your witness gave us that im listening indeed walt was perched forward on the edge of the bench the truck the tracks we found had nothing to do with gale brandon proposed he never saw the body his attention was on finding that bird the bird flight feathers brandon said id like to say im following you tommy but im afraid im not who gives a shit about a dead bird brandon asked sure maybe he wanted to go back and stomp the thing for sending him off the road like that but i dont think so i think he wanted the flight feathers walt shifted the phone to his left ear flight feathers he repeated light rack on the roof of the pickup what kind of fool is that search and rescue maybe walt said taking issue with his description a volunteer firefighter or just your basic backwoods asshole lovely a trickedout pickup truck a backwoods yahoo a hunter now dont go putting down hunters brandon said this is your theory tommy whatever it is not your everyday hunter a bow hunter walt heard himself breathing into the phone the feathers dude brandon said the hawk runs the guy off the road driver knows what he hit finds himself offroad maybe sees the hawk flapping away in the mirror heads back to check out his victim our witness confirmed that walt said recalling the woman at the nursery any bow hunter knows its a felony to collect feathers from a wild bird but this one ran him off the road this one asked for it he isnt about to risk the fine by taking the whole bird but he lifts a couple feathers whos going to notice you are walt said we can check it right i collected that bird its in the property room fridge so the bolo should include an inspection of the front grille could be easier than that a pickup sucks a bird in the grille its not going off the road but if the bird hits the windshield thats another story a broken windshield a redtailed hawk going fifty or sixty its like hitting a freaking rock window welders window repair shops a pickup with a light rack brandon said that ought to narrow it down we catch this guy maybe he saw gale maybe not but hes someone we want to talk to itll be good to have you back walt said the first raindrops fell in huge splashes on his front walkway lightning flashed high in the sky to the north keep me posted sheriff and just in case anyone asks daytime tv sucks ill pass that along walt was at the foot of his bed he had his shirt off and was stripping down to his shorts when he heard the distant grind of heavy machinery living just two blocks from the towns firehouse he knew exactly what it was he crossed the room grabbed his radio off the dresser and called dispatch the fire was north mile cold springs drainage a bcs patrol had been dispatched walt had his pants buttoned and was reaching for his gun belt as he simultaneously called kevin fifteen minutes later kevin returned wearing pajama bottoms and a tshirt he climbed from behind the wheel of his beatup subaru and passed walt on the front porch without a word walt hurried to the jeep pulses of blue and white lights flashed in the treetops as walt merged the jeep into the phalanx of fire trucks and emergency vehicles fiona wearing a tshirt and fulllength pajama bottoms stood at the door to her cottage arms crossed against the chill her hair down and tousled she looked both tired and frightened her attention fixed up the hill where rising whiffs of smoke still faintly clouded the air four firemen clad in turnouts and armed with pickaxes and shovels were chasing down the last vestiges of fire the buried smoldering plant roots that could hold fire for days she didnt see him arrive but when he told beatrice to stay fiona must have heard his voice and she turned toward him her solemn expression like a veil he took away only this shed heard him over the shouts and pumps and diesel engines shed recognized his voice with only the single word spoken somehow this gave him hope the fire had consumed an acre of hill singeing the bark of the fir and pine trees destroying the flower bed where walt had stood with her only hours earlier it left behind a black carpet of charred pine straw and the gray ash of what had been lawn grass another sheriffs office cruiser rolled in only seconds behind him two deputies blompier and chalmers they clambered out and looked to him for instruction search the main house confirm its vacant he walked slowly to her wondering what he was going to say i swear she said beating him to it she hung her head shaking it side to side i know how this looks but it isnt true i didnt say anything lowering her voice to where he could barely hear she said tell me youre not involved walt if you did this for me me im not involved seriously do you honestly think id do something like this they studied one another in the flashes of colored light was he to believe this charade after their discussion about this very act or was she playing out the hand hed dealt her attempting to keep the cover story going a lightning strike he said she said nothing but snorted her derision her arms crossed more tightly she lifted her head wearing a look of incipient terror i was asleep she whispered though defensively it could have burned the cottage i could have a shudder passed through her head to toe for a fleeting moment he was tempted to want to believe her but the moment passed you called it in he asked i smelled it she said idaho airconditioning without that who knows few homes in the area carried any kind of airconditioning with fortydegree summer nights the trick was to throw all your windows wide open and chill the house down and shut it back up again before eight am a wellinsulated house could remain cool the remainder of the day might have saved your life thats what im saying he kept waiting for the wink or the nudge but it wasnt forthcoming she wasnt going to give him so much as an inch of rope okay then he said you dont believe me spoken as if it had just occurred to her of course i believe you the flashing light continued to play across their faces she looked at him searchingly probing i should get on with it he said yes get a jacket or something its chilly out here im fine she said its cold get a jacket he repeated heading off to a firefighter he recognized as the one in charge any ideas storm strike the man said he was tall and broadshouldered and had a deep voice best guess yeah walt said its usually a tree takes the strike but im no expert got it walt said wanting to leave it right there anything you need from us were good another thirty or forty minutes ill send some guys back up here in an hour or two to make sure therere no flareups you might tell her so she doesnt scare he jerked a shoulder toward fiona will do walt turned back downhill sheriff yeah shape of the fire doesnt add up in case you care we should have a pear shape running uphill like this but if youll notice its flipped upside down since when does fire run downhill that is or isnt significant walt asked you didnt mention that when i asked its different thats all significant its not like i can put down a lightning strike to arson right but its unusual in case you care thats all of course i care walt said a little too defensively not something we see very often if at all i got it walt said okay okay the guy huffed turned and swung his pickax into the ground spraying ash and soil walt couldnt be sure but he thought he heard him say something under his breath asshole worst of all he thought he probably deserved it sheriff deputy linda chalmers called out from the front door of the main house deputy blompier stood just inside the house in silhouette it took walt a moment to see the person wedged between them the shorter girl her arm clasped tightly in lindas hand took him yet another fraction of a second to process that it was kira tulivich his mind made the identification and then his eyes tracked over to fiona whose surprise appeared too genuine to be anything but barefoot fiona walked half on tiptoe as she crossed the driveway she looked up the hill to walt and back to kira mirroring him found her in a room off the wine cellar chalmers explained as walt reached them a safe room hot plate chemical toilet the works blompier supplied what safe room fiona said reaching them blompier your jacket walt instructed the deputy peeled off his jacket and walt placed it around fionas shoulders she tugged it around herself tightly and seemed to shrink kira looking tired could not take her eyes off fiona it was this heated locked stare of hers that interested walt it wasnt a look of daughter to mother or friend to friend but one of incredulity concern that was it he thought the girl was afraid for her projecting sympathy had kira overheard them talking at the garden had she lit the fire had she killed martel gale as the evidence suggested walt had no choice but to act upon the evidence kira he said his voice subdued id like you to come down to my office with me for a talk now fiona complained she tried to win kiras attention walt spoke up immediately yes now for the time being im asking but it can get more complicated than that kiras focus remained on the sheriff sure i can do that walt wouldnt have offered any visitor a personal explanation any one of his deputies or the desk sergeant could convey the procedures and practices well enough but the woman sitting alone in a row of chairs separated by a table holding people magazine and copies of western sheriffs association was not just any visitor since when dont you video an interview fiona said angrily we are videoing the interview walt said calmly it wouldnt be approp oh bull for you to be in the room its one in the morning it is you should do this tomorrow lets not get into this okay im doing what i have to do kira is here voluntarily so what you think its a conspiracy she choked out really walt of all people youve been around this enough to know the way it works you try not to judge she said thats right thats a pile of crap its voluntary exploratory you think im incapable of keeping an open mind im like her guardian or something i need to be in there with her shes not a minor you notified her parents thats up to her i dont believe she has an attorney this was a sticking point a matter of investigative leverage she has not requested a lawyer and theres no reason she should she has not been charged with anything this is exploratory walt she chided im sorry you came all the way down here i dont mean to shut you out please know that he remained on his feet avoiding the chairs he did not want to get into this with her you cant conduct this interview without an attorney present she doesnt know any better why wont you look at me look at me please he turned oh jesus she said youd actually do something like this like what its voluntary its necessary she stood and lowered her voice taking his forearm in hand and squeezing you think youre helping me somehow is that it i can see it in your eyes how was that possible how could she nail his thoughts so perfectly he wanted back behind the restricted door and into his world but her grip only tightened listen to me she said in a tone he would have rather not heard if you put this on her i will be forced to i will not let her be charged with this she hasnt been charged fiona but thisthe way youre acting isnt helping anything let me do my job i know what im doing he let that sit there a second but maybe youve forgotten who youre doing it to we have evidencehard evidencethat has to be accounted for for all your good intentionsand i believe in themtheres a process a procedure were just at the start of that she answers these questions honestly she walks out of here for now if an attorney gets into it it will prejudice the interview thats when i get backed into a corner and things get tricky lets not get there lets avoid that youre setting her up i am absolutely not setting her up hed raised his voice it reverberated against the high ceiling the receptionist on the other side of the window kept her head down he lowered his voice to a hush listen to me i care for that girl and i care about you at some point you have to trust me i happen to know what im doing shes innocent good then there is nothing to worry about she started for the doors turning to look back at him once and put an exclamation point onto her disgust then she reconsidered no she said im not going im not giving you that ill be right here waiting im not going anywhere suit yourself walt said heading back through the door that cloistered him he mumbled to himself as he strode down the hall toward the first interview room where he would find deputy linda chalmers behind the video camera truth was there was nothing to operating the camera he asked fiona to do the recording as a way to slip her extra income and get a chance to see her she had begun to seep into his work and his decision making in ways like this and he saw it for what it wastroublewhile still feeling no desire to change it he opened the door and looked at the young woman on the other side of the table frightened unsure deputy blompier sat in the chair to the left by the wall walt took the only other chair facing kira you okay he began something transformed in him the moment he took his chair a voice in his head said game on establish a rapport mimic language control emotions manipulate the empty chair to her left the chair intended for an attorney called out to him was he supposed to charge her and fill that chair for her to give up the slight advantage he held by her not being represented did that help anyone kira held a fixed stare of bewilderment and fear he reminded himself beguilement took on many faces came in all sizes and ages whether or not she might attempt to play him he couldnt tell her dazed expression seemed real enough but one learned in the narrow confines of these interview rooms to put away interpretation to ignore the suspects beauty or the tattoos or the lack of language skills and to drill down so he took a second to make himself comfortable in the chair his decision made he took a deep calming breath and exhaled placed his forearms onto the table a man determined his body language as practiced as important as each word each inflection he lived for such moments he glanced over his shoulder chalmers gave him a nod tape was running do you want a glass of water or a coke or anything im okay thank you you understand why youre here she nodded to talk thats right do you have any questions i dont get it why me whatd i do why do you think youre here that guy getting killed and all youre referring to martel gale i guess walt opened a file folder and slid a photograph in front of her hed had two choices an nfl photo or the crime scenehalf the guys face eaten off it wasnt out of the question that in certain interviews he would have chosen the crime scene photo but not here not her have you ever seen this man before she nodded its important you answer aloud walt said yes she said please describe the circumstances of the last time you saw him the only time i saw him you mean the only time then you were there she said it was the night of the advocates dinner walt caught his breath but maintained his composure id seen shed showed me never mind i knew who he was thats all walt hesitated facing a fork in the road he knew who she was referring to some cases go cold he felt obliged to pursue the identity of she but understood not to he was painfully aware of the camera aimed at the back of his head you knew who he was he said making it a statement the football guy you follow pro football do you not exactly but you recognized a linebacker whos been out of the league for several years can you explain that i knew who he was i dont remember how as her eyes lowered to the desk and her shoulders caved forward he thought even a firstyear graduate student could identify the lie from her body language seeing him was that when you stopped for a second in your talk your address your speech youre right i was there and i remember your interrupting yourself might have been seeing this man caused that kind of reaction why is that why couldnt he bring himself to just ask her the identity of the woman shed referred to why did he insist on dancing around the edges roy coats she said naming the man who had brutally assaulted her a few years before walt winced at the mention of the man his memory still holding on to the grainy webcam images of the violent sexual abuse this young woman had endured his brain lacked the delete button he sometimes wished it had i dont get exactly why i dont expect you to get it but when that guy opened the doors back there and looked inside it wasnt him i saw it was roy coats that happens to me pretty much all the time in atkinsons out on the street can be anywhere i just see him hes looking at me that way he looked at me like he knew what he was going to do to me and me having no clue like that like people look when they know a secret you dont and it makes me physically sick like im going to puke i want to scream i want to scratch his eyes out castrate him kill him she looked up from what had looked like a trance walt felt a jolt neither of them had wanted her to say that word not that i ever would she added quickly i didnt mean it that way look that was the only time i ever saw the guy im telling the truth that one time in the limelight room i hadnt seen him again until just now when you put his picture down here she reached out and touched the photograph that came out all wrong yes it did walt thought roy coats walt clarified you wanted to kill roy coats exactly but hes dead look i know that okay i know hes dead but what your mind knows and the rest of you feels are two different things and that particular time i saw roy coats and all that stuff came back and thats the only time you saw martel gale yes walt pulled the photo back and returned it to the folder the job turned sordid too often at times like this he wondered why him why law enforcement why expose yourself to this stuff where do you live im staying housesitting at the moment up at the engletons place the residence of leslie and michael engleton yes in the main house or the guest cottage fiona lives in the guest cottage im housesitting the main house fiona kenshaw our crime scene photographer yes for how long have you been residing at the engleton residence theyre on this trip you know for like the whole summer ive been there i dont know two months another month or so to go you and i have seen each other there walt said yes you came after me with a baseball bat in your hand yeah sorry about that theres that guy in the woods around there that guy youre looking for it was dark i didnt know it was you you looking in the window and all i thought you were a peeping tom or something walt felt himself flush an uncontrollable reaction tell me about the baseball bat i dont know its michaels i guess he has a bunch of them in the sports thing out in the garage fiona and i we both put one by the door you know in case that guy came around in fact walt did not know had not heard he didnt recall seeing a bat by the door to fionas cottage had there been one had it been moved had it been left in the rental car dangerous territory he steered slightly away what purpose did the bat serve you know when youre scared like that to strike an intruder not that i ever have or would but yeah i guess closest i ever got was hitting you and i didnt do that i cant even kill spiders i have to ask fiona to do that call her over to the house nothing seems to bother her why did it have to keep coming back to fiona if a man like martel gale came onto the property unannounced and you saw him in the dark a big guy huge guy if he turned on you if he scared you any reaction on your part could be considered selfdefense do you understand that i get what youre saying but thats not what happened the thing about a voluntary interview well for one thing were recording all this on video as you know for another none of us can take back what we say its incredibly important that you tell the truth the first time the very first time that you stick to the truth no matter how hard it may be to speak of it the law it isnt black and white the way you might think thats not the way it actually works we think of it that way right and wrong in practice it works a lot differently a guy comes onto your property uninvited comes on there at a time theres some guy vandalizing neighborhood properties maybe late at night when its hard to see clearly he surprises you and you defend yourselfshe was shaking her head violently side to sideespecially a person any person with a past that makes overreaction understandable its all viewed differently each case is viewed differently that didnt happen im just saying you want to stick to the truth i am i didnt do that its not like that i saw him once at the limelight room that was it only then and a few minutes later fiona left the room without notice walt thought hed followed outside and had quizzed the kids working the valet parking theyd all but identified the visitor as martel gale we my deputies conducted a search of the engleton residence we found no baseball bat by the front door of the main residence walt said he left out that none had been found at the cottage either we located the ones in the sports cabinet as youve mentioned but nothing by the front door can you account for that bats whereabouts no idea has it been missing no idea whys that i have no idea where i left it that night i saw you i dont know what i did with it i could have left it outside for all i know anyway its not like i was hanging around in the main part of the house ive been in the safe room and why is that she looked as if hed slapped her did you leave the residence for a while i did in what vehicle id rather not say im afraid i have to ask you to answer the question the truck im not supposed to drive the pickup truck okay i get it i blew it but i drove the truck i went over to yellowstone like fiona said but the campgrounds were full so i slept in the truck a couple of nights and couldnt stand it and came back here like fiona said you were in communication with ms kenshaw during this absence he hated dragging her back into it could he find a way to just end it no i wasnt but you just said she was bugging me okay leaving messages and stuff and i dont know it was like my parents or something i just wasnt interested the answer felt rehearsed shed expected that question long before the interview had begun it knocked him back on his heels how much of this had been rehearsed how much had he missed because of his own interest in the outcome of the interview would he pick up things in replaying the tape if youre trying to get me to say something about fiona im not going to walts chest tightened could he instruct chalmers to shut off the video could he call a break to the interview what would i want you to say about ms kenshaw she locked eyes with him im not going to say it she said tell me about that night walt said what night late the twelfth early morning the thirteenth nothing theres nothing to tell someone came onto the propertydrove an suv onto the property speculation was part of any interrogation but he knew he was on thin ice if you didnt see him as youve stated you must have heard him you could hear cars arrive couldnt you theres a bell that rings its one of those electronic eye things at the gate this was new information for walt when a vehicle enters walt said yeah thats how big the house is you cant hear squat in there the gates like in a different zip code without the bell youd probably never know someone was out there late night the twelfth i told you i didnt see him but you heard a bell the bell rang a few different times it wasnt like i jumped up to see what was going on wasnt it no it wasnt so you were used to visitors late at night he realized what hed saidwhat hed askedtoo late i saw your car out there a couple of times your police car he closed his eyes and took a deep breath glad that his face was off camera he never had trouble thinking when in these rooms an interview was supposed to sharpen his wits engage him the deeper he dug the faster the sand poured back down in burying him he reminded himself he was not the one being interviewed he reminded himself that he didnt need to react to or explain anything he was the one in charge so youre suggesting you did in fact look outside when you heard that tone she looked stunned maybe i guess so you did or you didnt look out that night late night the twelfth maybe the early hours of the thirteenth her eyes told him the whole story concealment fear an overwhelming sense of emotion a knock interrupted him he could have screamed he was never to be interrupted during an interview he collected himself nodded and let blompier open the door for him sheriff his receptionist said with urgency in her voice peter arians here arian a young public defender who was recently winning far too many cases as far as walt was concerned could only be there for one reason but walt played along so he says hes representing ms tulivich walt shut the door ms tulivich did you contact a lawyer we were not aware of no i didnt fiona he realized anger competed with resignation he felt the wind knocked out of him mindful of the video he kept his cool youll excuse me for a moment the interview will now pause he said for the sake of the video sandbagged by a possible suspect he thought hed identified a seam to exploit a way to let the system do his work for him fiona had just turned all that on its head but if theres a lawyer here it doesnt work like that ill be right back out in the hall he told his deputy show ms kenshaw to interview two will you please fiona the deputy clarified interview two walt repeated mr arian will see me in my office yes sir he waited for the choreography to play out closing his office door he met with arian first sheriff id like to see my client if you dont mind shes not your client peter she has not called for an attorney and you cannot solicit clients in this building you know the rules its one am and im here to see kira tulivich take a seat at reception if you want but you wont see her until im done speaking with her her guardian appointed me kira tulivich is not a minor and you know it shes been under the care and responsibility of take it up with the courts if you want counselor but not here not tonight shes here voluntarily and shes staying here voluntarily arian stood by tomorrow its a different playing field sheriff shorter field for me longer for you you might want to think about that i dont like getting out of bed at one in the morning affects my mood in the morning take an ambien youll sleep like a baby walt opened the office door good night counselor he then joined fiona in interview she looked smug and confident but it was a fragile veneer youre pissed at me she said he stared her down unflinchingly i had to she said shes entitled to representation his eyes darted to the soundproof door ensuring it was shut tightly do you really think the right thing to do is to play me the two of you i take it you have an end game in mind you mind cluing me in on what it is exactly she glared back at him whats that mean theres a dead body in the hospital cooler and i need answers you and kira are right in the middle of this you think i killed him youre protecting her shes protecting you do you actually think i cant see that do you actually think you can keep this up its a homicide fiona it doesnt get any more serious than this she squinted im worried about you he slapped the table she jumped back homicide im talking about the fire im talking about a baseball bat from michael engletons collection im talking about you and kira doing this dance thats growing really old and is not going to hold up you want attorneys involved youd rather have peter arian handling this than me jesus he breathed deeply trying to calm himself you two had better get in front of this i had a planone youve just made a hell of a lot more complicated i hope to hell you have one because this thing is coming apart on youon both of you you think i set that fire are you still playing like you didnt do that for me you want to talk talk me he asked incredulously this is me were talking about and im supposed to believe you he reached across the table and took her hand in his now right here right now you look me in the eye and tell me you didnt set that fire i didnt set that fire his mind raced no way he mumbled i told you i didnt kira do you think she could have overheard us from inside that house i dont think so walt you cant hear anything from in there its a fortress and if she was in the safe rooma room i didnt even know existedyou really think so you should never have brought peter arian into this you send him packing i can work this out if youd just let me let you railroad kira i dont think so some cases go cold he said back at her what you said that to me did i his patience tested he fought to stay in his chair yes you did im attempting to bring charges against her you have to stay out of this i will not stay out of it i will not allow that shes been through this is my job my world stay out of it is that an order sheriff all life had gone out of her she leaned away from him nearly tipping over the chair if i cant push arian off the base if he gets to her then my game plan is over at that point you two will need to get in front of this a mechanical silence hung between themthe eerie whisper of hvac terry hogues the best criminal lawyer in town you call terry what plan she said you said you have a plan had he corrected i said i had a plan with arian in the mix the evidence is going to come out and thats coming back to bite her but a worm started drilling through his head the unidentified prints on the baseball bat fionas insistence she hadnt set the fire the probable height of gales attacker the bits and pieces began to come together in unexpected ways the fire was not a lightning strike he said you dont talk about something and two hours later it spontaneously combusts do you see how it plays out if its forced to play out kira goes off the rails at the advocates dinner shes unstable she takes after him like she almost did to me that night then she takes the truck and runs comes back and hides overhears us and sets the fire there is evidence to support most of this my plan well at least i had one i hope you do she was squinting and blinking and looked as if she was either going to cry or pass out you okay he asked i need a minute she sat there breathing deeply he wasnt sure what to doan uncommon feeling in him i need to see katherine i need to talk to katherine whos katherine katherine she said as if that answered him standing from the chair she hurried toward the interview room door dont walk out on me he said she glanced over at him turned and was gone it was like a door opened or something fiona said okay katherine crossed her legs and brushed the front of her blouse fiona had been made to wait a half hour while a client finished her session katherine had pushed back the next appointment to accommodate fionas arrival will you hypnotize me perhaps theres no need tell me about it walt mentioned he started talking about that night and i dont know like i said it was like a door coming open it happens do you want to tell me about it im not sure what there is to tell katherine offered her a sly but affecting grin as if she knew there was much to tell he was there fiona said katherine said nothing did not ask her for a name barely moved at all fiona felt at the center of a wind storm leaves and sticks swirling each with a message written on it words names parts of sentences like a magnetic word game for the refrigerator a hundred thoughts or glimpses of thoughts awaiting some semblance of order her instinct was to try to stop it to try to grab hold of one or two and begin organizing them but the more she reached the more the cloud moved away from her she felt the tears spring to her eyes before she knew what was happening before she had a chance to protect herself from them the leaves moved closer what a bastard she whispered dryly youre safe here katherine said prick take your time he just arrived you know unannounced all of a sudden just there at the door like i expected him or something such a prick so typical she sniffled and dragged her wrist across her nose creating a snail line katherine leaned forward and offered a tissue fiona saw it more as a flag of surrender and refused it i didnt know why he was there i thought maybe to kill me you know after the trial and everything but it wasnt even him not the marty i knew had known whatever she looked out through the blur katherine with her expressionless face how did people do that sit there impassive while the other person eviscerated herself she might have been waiting for a cake to finish baking if shed had knitting i backed inside and he followed without invitation when he spoke it was like it wasnt even him like he was channeling someone else i couldnt process it all round peg square hole him softspoken and polite me loud and demanding i told him to get out and he stopped and turned around this is marty were talking about the gale force i told him to wait and he stopped and it was like i controlled him me controlling him try that one on for size he stopped again what are you doing here i said and he spoke to the door not to me his back to me his hand on the doorknob maybe he didnt want to be there thats what was going through my head this guy shows up and he doesnt want to even be here and it was like he was reading my thoughtsi always thought he could he tells the door how hes part of a program and that part of the steps of that programand i cut him off scornfully abusively marty gale reformed as if and he waits me out politely i might add and then starts into it again like its something hed rehearsed and maybe he had for all i know how its something hes got to do for me and for him for both of us wants me to know this is not a gift not a negotiated truce but a requirement to his sobriety and how what it amounts to is an apology he says that word she continued and as he does he looks over his shoulder at me delivers it like a spear into my heart an apology marty you know how long id waited for that for that one word apologize all the shit id been through with him the hell the endless hell of it all and me too weak to leave and him too overpowering to allow me to too marty too unpredictable and dangerous and here it is and its not better late than never never would have worked for me just fine thank you apologizing turning toward me now tears real tears streaming down his face how he didnt know the guy hed been how the things hed done she pursed her lips and realized her eyes were clear now i think he stepped toward me i must have stepped back whatever happened to him happened after that maybe once i fell he came to help me maybe kmaybe someone showed up and saw him bent over me like that how should i know what a bastard is that where your memory stops katherine said its not like i remember hitting my head but yeah im assuming thats what happened why what are you saying i didnt hit my head are you saying that my memory stops there because i did something to him is that why youre looking at me like that like what dont give me that crap like that like youre looking right now so katherine looked away but the seed was planted and fiona sank into a well of despair a dark cold unmerciful place i thought you were supposed to help me fiona said you want to talk to her again youre going to have to charge her peter arian carried confidence in a way that disarmed juries and wooed judges a surfer through college he was armaniad handsome even at nine am his eyes had a hollywood sparkle he spoke like a southern californian despite his san francisco roots the thing was walt liked arian thought if hed been a lawyer instead of a lawman that he might have come out much the same way hed occasionally teased the young lawyer about switching sides and joining the prosecutor but all hed ever won was a laugh the bare hills outside walts office were electric with the morning sun he wished he were hiking i want to see the evidence involved i respect your situation peter youre good at what you do and we both know it but you do not want to go the evidence route this is one time where in the best interest of your client you should just walk out the door and leave this to me i like kira thats not happening let me talk to her again this morning for an hour or so alone everyones a winner walk me through the evidence first arian issued a penetrating look meant to intimidate but it fell short make a believer out of me dont do this you know thats not going to happen walts intercom sounded sheriff when you have a minute walt wasnt superstitious by nature there were cops who were guys who turned their wallets a certain way in a back pocket wore their shield upside down or carried a talisman there were guys who checked the calendar in the morning and determined their activities on the whims of numerology he wasnt one of them but the interruption served the same purpose something about the timing something about that look on arians face something indiscernible impossible to put a finger on that weird kind of something that made him act in a way that he felt was inconsistent with his own actions nonetheless he did it he held out his hand waited for peter to shake it and motioned him toward his office door the evidence arian said or no interview his mind made up his hand forced and his plan with it walt said im going to brief doug the countys prosecutor doug aanestead well take it from there arian looked wounded he forced a grinmore of a snarland made for the door thats a bad call sheriff the bad call was the one ms kenshaw made to you counselor a knot formed in his stomach it was one thing to find yourself out on a limb another thing entirely to crawl out there willingly he blamed fiona he blamed himself for seeing everything through the distorted lens of emotion he felt foolish and vulnerable and knew perfectly well it was the small decisions that determine success or failure more so than the bigger ones he was typically rooted in procedure so this feeling of flying by the seat of his pants left him queasy a feeling of regret overcame him regret for digging so deeply in the first place he returned calmly to the other side of his desk picked up the phone and followed up on the intercom interruption wood river glass he was told replaced a cracked windshield in a ford fonefifty on the afternoon of the thirteenth truck has a light rack on the cab he did not want to deal with the missing pickup truck right now but he also did not want to overlook any chance at new evidence he intended to find doug aanestead and make his case do we have a name he asked dominique fancelli of eighteen alturas drive walt said supplying the address well yeah spoken with a mixture of disappointment and astonishment but if you knew that lucky guess walt said yeah right issue a bolo for the fonefifty walt instructed and have a patrol do a driveby real quietlike of the fancelli residence if that pickups in the drive i want to be notified immediately got it he allowed himself a faint smile the satisfaction of a small victory he didnt want to misstep hed have to check with the prosecutor about how to approach this as well ironically the law was the reason he most often lost a case he called tommy brandon because it was only fair brandon had made the connection to the redtailed hawka bow hunterin the first place it felt good to possibly deliver on a favor and for lisa of all people brandon answered on the first ring as if just sitting by the phone waiting for his call do you feel strong enough to drive about a mile south walt asked what do you think i think you just got out of the hospital i told you the soaps dont cut it for me be ready to move ill call as soon as i know anything the pickup truck yeah did you ever see little big man the movie with dustin hoffman its one of gails favorites brandon said no its one of my favorites walt felt like correcting she just happened to have been in the room at the time but he let it go the indian scene walt said the one where hes dying or trying to what a great scene sometimes the magic works walt quoted yeah i remember walt blocked from his mind the second half of the couplet sometimes it doesnt doug aanestead reviewed the evidence from behind the twelfth hole on the valley clubs upper eighteen he and his golf partner allowed three other groups to play through each one increasing the mans impatience a light breeze curled the edges of the papers in the open folder causing aanestead to wrestle with its contents his putter was gripped between his knees the handle sticking out somewhat phallically honestly walt i dont love it is that right walt understood the risk of his current and only plan the plan hed wanted to play out on his time frame not arians but here he was the law could be your friend or enemy and for the past several days walt had been working up a way to convince aanestead he had a pretty good case against kira like walts aanesteads was an elected office walt was counting on that itll be damn unpopular indicting this girl hells bells she addressed the advocates this year we were both there we were shes something of a local hero we have the bat walt reminded a bat thats carrying three sets of prints shes already admitted to handling the thing and taking a drive to yellowstone thats not in the code that i know of no what about fiona aanestead asked she see gale around the place she confirm any of this walt couldnt afford to lie aanestead had a competent staff the man was ambitious was said to have his eye on the state attorney generals race he would vet this thoroughly ms kenshaw showed up at the emergency room early the next day a blow to the back of the head shes a little fuzzy about the details says she fell over a footstool aanestead looked at him askance have you questioned her formally questioned her i wouldnt if i could shes not of sound mind anything she says anything we get from her would be tossed out because of the existing medical condition when the effects of that blow wear off but who knows when that might happen shes saying she doesnt remember thats certainly convenient her prints are not the ones we found on the bat she didnt take off unannounced and return to hide in the basement the tulivich girls had a tough time of it for christs sake walt shes scared of her own shadow we go after her wed better be damned sure we know what were doing and i dont see it in here walt kept a straight face theres the forensic evidence he reminded the pollen he was on the engleton property we all know juries love this shit but judges take more convincing and i dont see anywhere in here a lab comparison of the flowers up at the engletons to what was found on gale do i that kind of lab work can take weeks in fact walt had been refused the collection of evidence by the engletons not my problem aanestead handed the folder back to walt and eyed the thirteenth tee you play dont you yes we ought to knock it around together sometime id like that aanestead glanced at the thirteenth for a second time his partner looked ready to explode as yet another party reached the twelfth green what about fancelli walt asked i followed a pickup truck thinking it important to the gale killing only to have a deputy figure it differently but i can use it we can use this to our advantage youd be going out on a limb i would doubt that federal laws been tested for some time there was that classaction suit against northwest generation in wyoming that was birds frying on hightension lines not some bow hunter plucking roadkill its federal law not state but its on the books yes it is but untested you see where im going with it i do its creative and i think important a scumbag like that you take him down however you can thats the point translation the voters would approve ill not only back you on this fancelli thing aanestead said ill hold a press conference and lay it out there and hope that helps us get a foot across the finish line surprise ill want you by my side he said not a problem walt said you want my guys to leak it if the press were notified it might mean fiona was sent to photograph the arrest walt shuddered at the thought probably better off not you sure hell of a card to play a frontpage piece showing a guy in cuffs talk about prejudicing the jury pool he punched walt lightly in the shoulder things were getting too friendly for walt ill notify your office when we have him in custody hows that how soon are we talking about he didnt want to be caught on the back nine by reporters wouldnt look right i can hold off for about an hour walt said youre a good man walt aanestead said grinning widely he leaned in close twenty bucks a hole and with tim its like taking candy from a baby but you didnt hear it from me my guysll call your office once weve got him walt repeated ill want you by my side understood youre going to need a hell of a lot more before youll have me signing off on tulivich shes a dead end walt nothing but trouble okay he tried to sound disappointed while inside he was celebrating the mans predictability it wouldnt be the first time the evidence came up short despite having a suspect in the sights i wouldnt go there unless you have the dead guy sitting up and pointing a finger at her he smiled perfect teeth standing out against the wicked tan walt was looking at the next attorney general and both men knew it it may go unsolved walt warned again keeping the celebration out of his voice hell of a game aanestead said holding his club but looking walt in the eye somewhat suspiciously hed picked up on walts relief hell of a game walt echoed walt focused intently on the small log cabin in front of him one of twelve homes in a subdivision dating from the s it was log with forest green trim and asphalt shingles two mountain bikes sagged next to the front door along with a pair of work boots and a dog bowl the f was parked in the driveway lisas house was one to the left a charming home with wooden flowers painted primary colors in a line across the lawn strung between two of the flowers was a small sailcloth banner reading alturas day care when she wasnt taking care of his kids she was running the day care walt didnt see lisas house he barely saw the fancelli place instead as brandon sat quietly in the seat beside him his arm in a sling walt saw only the horror of what lisa had witnessed he heard the slapping of the bed frame against the wall as she had heard it he felt sick as she had felt its not like hes going to give us a hard time you think brandon ventured we need him hows that our witness maggie sharp puts his truck there that night so this is or is not a takedown sorry to disappoint you what the hell sheriff we need to work it and im here because you love this stuff true and i have a warrant a search warrant to execute but for now we have to execute it without his knowing whats going on keep him thinking its about bird feathers so plain sight for now exactly which is where i come in now youve got it walt said and you sweettalk him ill do my best and if it doesnt get that far if he bolts on us we cant afford that walt said thats why were here thats why its you and me instead of anyone else we cant scare him we cant let him know the real reason were here or the card we can play its not an arrest were lucky to have found him youre the only one i trust to understand how to play that the other guys knowing the crime might allow that knowledge to get the best of them i understand so be cool in there despite the fact this guys a bastard of the first order and id like nothing more than to make his arrest as uncomfortable as possible maybe dislocate a shoulder or two walts guys occasionally played the resisting arrest card the same as in any other cop shop took their frustrations with the system out on the suspect made sure the arrest was as painful as possible since the system tended to coddle suspects jails with television and fresh food an hour a day outside gym equipment a few of the suspects deserved the black hole and everyone knew it arresting deputies felt it their responsibility to punish the person right to the edge of what was tolerated and sometimes a touch beyond not this time tommy understood youre the one guy i trust got it brandon took the back side of the home going around the far side looking for windows without screens on his way to cover the back door he stood at the corner with a view of a potential escape window but within a few steps of the back door he clicked his radio once walt waiting at the front door heard the radio click and knocked and rang the bell within a second of each other the wood river valley was not a place residents checked outside before opening their doors a beautiful girl opened the door she wore a loose shirt which obscured her figure your father here dominique fancelli maybe it was walts use of his formal name she stood staring clearly unable to speak she nodded stepfather she finally managed would you tell him the sheriffs here please sheriff walt fleming kay she filled her lungs d a d she then hesitated swallowed and added sheriff s here to see you walt thought her face grew more ashen as the clomp of footfalls approached more sullen he understood the risks involved by his coming here if there was any suggestion any indication she had spoken to the police about her situation it could mean a beating or even death walts mission was to get as much as he could from the man and then to separate the two and make sure things remained that way as fancelli arrived at the other side of the screen door walt reached up and pushed the button on his radio mike twice brandon now knew walt had made contact even so his deputy would not leave his post until and unless a second signal was sent dominique fancelli yeah walt did not need to introduce himself i have a few questions concerning your ford fonefifty dionnes face relaxed considerably the furrow left dominiques brow is that right you mind if i come in fancelli pushed open the screen door but he stepped outside instead of allowing walt in walt thought the move shrewd and an important indicator of who he was dealing with shut the door fancelli told his daughter the girl did so but her expression behind her stepfathers back was one of intense curiosity and no small degree of fear walt elected to play his brandon card he clicked his handset three times and brandon rounded the far corner of the house and approached them brandon slowed at each window looking inside even wearing the sling brandons size and demeanor were intimidating he was a person you paid attention to kept one eye on in any given situation the big dog poised in the corner his eyes taking in everyone in the room he approached the front of the f slowly and when he had walts attention nodded slightly that motion affirmed hed seen evidence of the bird strike and filled walt with additional confidence fancelli was appropriately distracted whats up sheriff deputy tommy brandon walt said introducing the two tommy nodded at the man but kept six feet away if a stare could burn walt thought whats going on fancelli greeted brandon brandon said nothing in return mr fancelli don were occasionally put in the position of seeking a statement from a civilian a citizen on a voluntary basis were not asking that you get involved but to be forthright its not out of the question that at some future date you might be deposed or even asked to give testimony at a trial if you were opposed to that we would do everything in our power to protect you and prevent that from happening the effect was as hed hoped first hed distracted the suspect into believing their arrival at his front door had nothing to do with his own actions second theyd instilled in him a sense of their dependence on him lending him a false selfconfidence whats this about we believe your ford fonefifty may have swerved off the highway on the night of the twelfth or early morning of the thirteenth fancelli managed a convincing deadpan though his eyes darted nervously between walt and brandon yeah thats right he said walt concealed his calming exhale having worried he might have to fight the man on this part of the story we had a witness he said just to place one nail firmly in place is that so idd your truck brandon said in his deep baritone a fox was into some roadkill swerved to miss it and lost control it happens walt said secretly impressed the man could seem so nonchalant he was learning more about fancelli than fancelli would have wanted him to know this was the testing phase the chance to probe the suspect in an effort to decode him find the right code and you could unlock all the walls erected in front of the truth so you were driving walt said continuing you were behind the wheel its my truck you came to a stop and you left the vehicle walt said watching as that piece of information caught fancelli off guard now most guys i know would move to the front of the vehicle to see if there was any damage done i didnt hit anything fancelli volunteered i said there was a fox in the road and that i swerved to avoid him yes you did walt said my point was that most guys would get out of the vehicle to check for damage i mean why get out at all why not just drive back to the highway i still dont get what this is about did you leave the vehicle running what does that have to do with anything your headlights it has to do with your headlights my headlights are fine both headlights are working that model fonefifty even if the engines turned off the headlights remain illuminated for sixty seconds its a safety feature to let you reach your door whats with the headlights sheriff you got out of the vehicle and walked back behind it this said brandon according to our witness yeah so what scared the shit out of me running off the road like that i had to take a leak you think i was going to take a leak in the headlights so i got away from the truck big deal makes sense to me walt said to brandon who nodded its of no never mind to us could have fooled me fancelli said the point being you were behind the truck and the headlights were on brandon said chiming in yeah so so walt said you approach the truck from the rear as you return to the cab can you see that i suppose were interested in what you saw as you returned to your truck you lost me if you saw anything anyone in the general vicinity of your truck as you returned to the cab such as anything at all unusual not that i recall we need you to think about this need you to tell us anything you might have seen that might have struck you as out of the ordinary i didnt see anything i took a leak got back in the truck and drove back to the road walt kept his shoulders from slumping with disappointment he retained his impassive slightly bored expressiona public servant doing his job are you a bow hunter mr fancelli what of it would you have applied for bear tags for the past three years no law against that is there not to my knowledge walt said okay then did you take the ford into wood river glass for a windshield replacement on the afternoon of the thirteenth fancellis veneer cracked his brow tightened his eyes narrowed and he dismissed brandon as if he wasnt there his full attention was now fixed on walt hed identified the enemy and he tracked it with a hunters eye whats going on here do you remember what you told the mechanic the worker at wood river glass what you told him had caused the damage to your windshield i ate a rock are you aware that shops like wood river glass take pictures of damage for insurance purposes no some do walt said the ones that want to get paid so have you ever heard the expression why do it the hard way when theres an easy way whats your point sheriff i gotta get back inside you sure it was a fox mr fancelli maybe im mixing it up with another time i was run off the road i think thats right did i say fox it was a bird a bird hit my windshield what kind of bird how would i know maybe it landed somewhere behind your truck maybe you saw it brandon said when you were taking that piss there was a dead hawk there fancelli said you think it was the same bird what does any of this matter anyway wed like to see your arrows don walt said you handmake them dont you how the what do you care about my arrows someone shoot someone or something it wasnt me walt withdrew the search warrant and handed it to fancelli we have a warrant to search the premises he nodded to brandon who pushed past fancelli and entered the home walt caught a glimpse of dionne shed been standing right by the door listening to everything said there was a body fancelli blurted out walt tensed excuse me there was a body in the bushes a guy big son of a bitch brandon stopped and turned now inside the house where are we talking about walt asked in front of my pickup that night you saw a body i did and did you call it in i didnt no because he looked confused we could cut a little deal right fancelli proposed i saw the body ive got what you want so maybe you cut me some slack regarding you know damn well i need to hear it from you the feathers i took some hawk feathers okay thing was dead its a stupid law anyway you ask me i took a couple flight feathers your warrant thats what youre looking for right my arrows you wont find them in there ive got a workshop in the garage my gears in the garage i tell you about the body you cut me some slack on the feathers deal wed have to see the feathers first walt said sure no problem fancelli led walt and tommy brandon to the small garage in back and inside to a corner workbench where an array of material was collected the air was stale some moths worked frantically against the glass trying to escape so let me get this straight walt said inspecting a piece of one of the hawk feathers not yet used you didnt call in the body because youd taken the hawks feathers and didnt want to get involved listen i thought about calling it in to nineoneone or something but you guys trace all those calls right am i right i just didnt want to be involved the hawk feathers were more important to you than the dead man walt made it a statement i know that sounds stupid walt waited for brandon to be in position behind fancelli with his one good hand dominique fancelli walt said formally youre under arrest for violation of the fish and wildlife act before fancelli could think brandon had a strong hold of one arm he turned the man effortlessly toward walt who cuffed him what the hell is going on here i thought we had a deal walt spoke over the noise call in the team i want them to take this house apart nail by nail fancelli suddenly looked terrified what the hell are you doing my job walt said catching sight through the garage doors raingray windows of the forlorn face of dionne fancelli who looked as if she wanted to disappear the two women faced each other in sumptuous opulence in the first of three living rooms in the engleton house peter arian sat to the side in a padded needlepoint chair that creaked when he moved hed called fiona over to the house requesting her help in reaching his new client who had so far refused to answer any of his questions it was late afternoon the hottest part of the day and the shades were drawn against the sun denying them the glorious views of bald mountain to the west hey k fiona said kira pursed her lips its okay no its not i think i got you in trouble arian seemed to know better than to interrupt or to take notes or to react in any way that might cause his client to clam up he was a human mannequin but his eyes found fiona and attempted to deliver something that she found difficult to interpret you remember that i was having problems remembering what happened kira lifted her eyes to look across at fiona but said nothing ive made some headway in that department kira appeared concerned in a good way fiona said the way i look at it the truth cant get us into trouble you know it is what it is what happened happened thats all were after here the truth what happened its no big deal it is if it gets you in trouble do you think thats going to happen kira looked over at her attorney then at fiona yes i do i wouldnt worry about it you would if you were me kira said why is that because you know tell me i left the bat there where outside the door that night the sheriff came and i sneaked up on him and all which door the front door here she pointed okay and what about the bat kiras eyes darted to arian then to fiona well it isnt there anymore the thing is fiona said hes on your side our side whatever he hears it doesnt matter because he represents you what about you who represents you im not the one who needs a lawyer fiona said kira lowered her head k what if you do need a lawyer she nodded fiona checked with arian who nodded ever so slightly encouraging her to pursue this line the night of the advocates dinner you recognized him didnt you she nodded marty was there you saw him you told me that later and i didnt believe you and now i know i should have i apologize for that kira shrugged her shoulders i just it just didnt seem possible i froze i must have walked right by him you realize that i got that email and i left right away and if i didnt walk right by him i came incredibly close none of this would have happened none of this would have been the same if hed found me there he was looking for me thats what i was afraid of thats why i froze all these years well you know how afraid i was of him youre the only one here ive talked to about any of this your thing with roy coats we shared stuff you and me i know you want to protect me but you can let go of that because i remember now something waltthe sheriffsaid i dont know it was like it all came back to me like something unlocked katherine says it happens she told me it would happen and i didnt believe her but it happened i dont have it all back she says it takes time but what i remember i remember clearly he was there he came here to apologize to me kira not hurt me but to apologize he freaked me out i was terrified of him and him apologizing like that i think i freaked out and stepped back and probably went over the stool and hit my head but i saw you with the bat kira blurted out as if forgetting about arian i saw you hit him me on the head from the back me fiona gasped dryly for a second time in front of your place the two of you but you saw me what was i supposed to do i didnt want you to know id seen i didnt want anyone to know the car took off the guys car it wasnt him driving that was for sure not after that i got in the truck and left i didnt know what else to do me fiona repeated you saw me kira was crying she lowered her head fiona came around the coffee table and sat down next to her and held her kira sobbed i didnt want to get you in trouble fiona fought back her own tears but i thought youd done it me kira leaned back and explored fionas face seriously and walt he thinks we did it together that were covering for each other kira burst out laughing tears still falling he what i know seriously fiona nodded what do we do kira asked then she looked to her attorney theres evidence peter arian said from what im hearing from you im assuming its the baseball bat that could be damaging the sheriff wouldnt give me that so were better off now that i know and they havent charged you either of you im assuming the prosecuting attorney called off the sheriff and for good reason he didnt like the evidence or it could be that theyre awaiting more lab results or witnesses or it could be your standing in the community youre something of a celebrity he said to kira they may simply be waiting for it all to come together thats important for us to consider whats equally important is that both of you lay out exactly what you remember that you write it down exactly as you remember it i will be the only one in possession of those documents if charges are filed i can apply for access to the evidence if the sheriff is building a case against the two of you thats more complicated and will take more time at some point hell attempt to get one of you to turn on the other its a pretty straightforward approach i will need to be there for those interviews it wasnt me outside the cottage fiona said im willing to bet i was inside lying on the floor unconscious although i dont know that for sure thats a big bet arian said im not sure thats a bet you want to make well it wasnt me kira said i saw it i didnt do it no other cars arian asked kira not that i saw and i didnt hear the gate beep they can make a case that it was one or the other of you or that as you say the sheriff is thinking that it was both of you and youre covering for each other but its not true kira said arians face sagged this is the law were talking about truth is only one small part of the equation he waited a moment for this to sink in your parents have asked you to stay with them kira nodded theyd discussed this earlier on the drive up but i dont want to fiona spoke up kira you should do it maybe this is the chance youve been waiting for i dont want to see him what if your fathers changed he doesnt change we all change fiona said if others give us the chance to kira nodded faintly but only for tonight dont be too quick to judge fiona advised i dont want to leave you ive got stuff to work out fiona said stuff to write down ill be all right i can drop you off arian proposed ill get my things kira said standing and reluctantly letting go of fionas hand what do you make of all this fiona asked arian when they were alone do you believe her he asked absolutely and how do you know you went over a stool what if your injury occurred outside your cottage you think that didnt occur to me do you think its possible did i hate him that much yes i did could i do something like that never nevers a big word never fiona repeated arian dug out his wallet and from it a business card in case you need me i dont but in case you do he said fiona accepted the card a disney channel original movie played from the living room as walt worked the computer at the diningroom table tied in to his offices server he was finishing up the report on the fancelli arrest hed already been in touch with ausa in boise whod promised walt the wildlife act charge would hold walt believed that with some backroom discussion he might get fancelli the maximum sentence of a fine and a year in jail small payment for his real crime but at least something the search of the fancelli home had failed to turn up any suggestion of child molestation or abuseno souvenirs no videosbut the mans arrest included a mandatory dna swabthis had been the golden ring walt had been reaching forand he hoped within the week to use that sample to prove the paternity of his daughters unborn child fancelli would be going away for a lot longer than a year as he wrapped up the report he was feeling good for a change and thinking that this was one of the good nights hey dad nikki called from the living room it had to be a commercial break because typically they didnt know he existed if a show was on yes i thought you were going to build us a tree fort a family issue that arose every six months or so walt had resisted the idea of a tree fort because of the enormous work involved and the likelihood of it turning out to be only a passing interest he realized more important that this was gender bias on his part he thought of tree forts as a boys realm and was convinced his daughters would quickly lose interest a conviction he now questioned youre right he answered i think i forgot all about it can we build one now emily was sitting up and looking at him excitedly as well with curtains and a bucket to bring stuff up she said he wondered if a tree house was part of the show they were watching they were easily influenced curtains why not he said when emily shouted far too loudly how soon nikki added the questions hit him as a fist in the chest everything came down to time it was the one commodity that fell short and left him feeling cheated as well as the one doing the cheating never mind that he had no time for himself he gave his daughters short shrift and even his job occasionally suffered he considered himself an excellent time manager and yet how was he supposed to find the four hours to erect a tree house with his daughters and if he couldnt find four hours to be with his kids what did that say about him this weekend he answered seriously nikki said suddenly the spokesperson for the two this change caught her fathers attention of the two nikki had retreated far more deeply into herself following the divorce her elevation to spokesperson and emilys willingness to allow it to happen held profound significance for him seriously he answered this saturday to his surprise the girls exploded off the floor throwing their hands high in the air and dancing around causing walt to realize how much he missed the obvious their excitement had little or nothing to do with a tree house saturday he repeated watching how it spurred even more celebration he wished he had a camera wished he could preserve forever the elation on his daughters faces wished he understood the complexities of fatherhood better and resolved to do just that with the idea of a tree house now firmly rooted he began to imagine what backyard tree or trees could be used as well as the structures overall design a tree house was no simple undertaking and walt was no doityourselfer he googled tree house plans and uncovered a halfmillion hits he scrolled down through then changed his mind and clicked on the images link at the top of the page to see what he was in for there on the screen was a small thumbnail photograph of a structure that matched the last tree house hed seen the one in the engletons woods the one hed been sitting near when hed suggested to fiona that a small fire would clean things up nicely his house phone ringing interrupted him and he rose to answer it with reluctance anyone who wanted to reach him called him on his mobile so he assumed this was either for the girls or a telemarketer both options left him grumpy he answered the phone this is walt and paused sheriff fleming it was a high timid voice with a hispanic accent and walts first thought was how shed gotten his unpublished phone number speaking my name victoria menquez i am married to guillermo you know guillermo he work for forest service yes mrs menquez my guillermo he no come home walt had been led into a search for gilly once before he felt the taste of sarcasm lingering on the tip of his tongue as he swallowed it away im sure hes fine walt said have you called his friends he not fine she protested he said he do something for you when he left this morning this is why i call you why he not call why he not come for supper me walt blurted out too quickly the last thing he needed was to be dragged into a pub crawl looking for gilly menquez he was about to suggest looking under bar in the yellow pages when he gained some control the forest service he said he must carry a radio or something i call no answer only recording office opens eight am i know when office opens she was the one reverting to sarcasm he glanced at the kitchen clock it felt later than it was the soundtrack of the disney movie was bothering him too much laughter for his present conversation i think you should try some of his friends you are his friend no guillermo say what a good man you are that stuck like a bone in his throat listen mrs menquez if im going to be honest with you i would suggest you call his favorite taverns my hunch is thats where youll find him but he said he was working for you i wouldnt know anything about that im afraid i havent seen or spoken to gillyguillermoin over a week said you were looking for someone that he could find him my guillermo he can find anyone in the woods says you are almost as good as him a bubble of laughter rose in walts throat but he choked it back thats what he said walt asked that i was looking for someone he made a mistake sheriff he know that he told me and i told him you make a mistake you fix it that is what he was doing in the woods today he was fixing it then the collision happened as it so often did for him like one idea cant get out of the way of the other so theres nowhere to go but into each other and suddenly two thoughts spawn a third it was thisthe google image overlaid with the lovely lilting speech of this womanthat drove walt to sign off the call as politely as possible hit the record button he called out advising his daughters youre coming with me he called myra from the car the girls strapped into the backseat beatrices tail smacking them both as it swished back and forth im heading up your way he told myra before his sisterinlaw could get a word out i need to leave the girls with you for a few minutes can you handle that walt i can you do that for me of course ten minutes lock the door and stay near the phone walt fiona said better yet just get out of there i will not she paused the telephone connection crackling we need to talk later right now you need to get in your car and get out of there no no stay thats good but lock up tight do you have a weapon in there if youre working on scaring me youre doing a fine job you do or dont have a weapon i own a handgun but he caught himself how had he never asked her this question earlier who went after a guy with a baseball bat if there was a handgun in the drawer he couldnt help himself have you had training walt whats going on im coming onto the property on foot ive called for backup but there was a drowning in carey anyway for the time being its just me do you know how to use that handgun yes then keep it close and dont do anything stupid it may be me coming through your door who else would it be thats the point he said anything out of place there recently anything missing clothes maybe underwear whats got into you should i take that as a no i havent thought about it well think about it he guessed he was still five to seven minutes away he liked keeping her on the phone liked hearing her voice so close i havent lost anything kira and i leave each other little gifts you know cookies wildflowers its a girl thing any lately her pause was far too long fiona youre coming straight here come straight here will you fiona talk to me ill get the gun now like you said ive already locked up you were going to tell me something no i wasnt i think you were the mobile connection sparked and crackled reception wasnt perfect on this stretch of the road walts jeep approached and passed the area where gales body had been found broken yellow police tape flapped in the light glow of the headlights he is dead right with his face so badlywhat if it wasnt him walts question about the gifts had in fact jogged loose yet another memory gale entering her cottage carrying flowers shed found them withered and dry on the coffee table after returning from the hospital believing them to be from kira but she now knew kira had taken off by then they couldnt have been from her only him the idea of that monster bearing a gift of flowers was almost too much to take we idd the body he said no worries sit tight im on my way he pulled off the highway but took the right fork toward the berkholders instead of going left toward the engletons he drove twenty yards killed his lights and coasted to a stop shutting off the engine beatrice was made to heel and understood from the urgency of the whispered command that this was not a training session she responded appropriately silent attentive holding close to his left leg her nose and eyes working overtime together the two moved quickly through the dark up the hill the engleton flagpole showed in silhouette against the illumination of the night sky and the richness of the milky way also in silhouette to the right of the flagpole and farther still up the hill a strongly geometric shape revealed itselfthe northeastern corner of the engleton tree house minutes later walt hopped over the rail fence alongside the gate and beatrice slipped through catching up to his leg and heeling obediently without further command walt stayed in the shelter of the planted aspens that formed grove after grove as the driveway climbed up the knoll he reached the end of the drive where it widened into a turnaround and parking area connecting fionas cottage to the main houses garage and a path leading to the front door he crouched here and waited settling his heartbeat and getting control of his respiration his left arm over beatrices back as she panted at his side he rubbed the dogs head rewarding her and as he stood gently placed his hand on the outside of his left leg reinforcing the heel she followed him to the right around the back side of the house rather than across the inviting open space of the turnaround he passed more beds containing the yellow lilies reminding him of the fire then his conversation with fiona near the tree house he held to shadow beatrice at his side moving silently walt stayed low as he finally reached the southeastern corner of the main house facing the scar of burned earth directly in front of him then moved up the hill the tree house now immediately to his right a pine rail ladder was attached to one of the three fir trees supporting the tree house a sizable structure fifteen feet off the ground he signaled beatrice to stay and then moved in a stealthy crouch to the base of the ladder and began to climb beatrice followed his every action her nose rising with each ladder rung it was a trapdoor entrance leading up through the tree house floor walt paused just beneath it he fished out his maglite and beretta and marrying the two while holding to the ladder used his back to push and throw open the trapdoor the maglites bluish halogen beam flooded the lavishly decorated space past posters curtains a handhooked rug crumpled tissues on the floor a childsized table littered with halfeaten food and open soup cans and landed on gilly menquez stuffed awkwardly into the corner his tongue purple and grotesque his eyes open and unmoving walt threw himself up into the space spinning preparing for someone on the other side of the elevated trapdoor but the space was empty he caught his breath as he scrambled to menquez still not quite believing the tree house was empty the flashlights beam caught the overhead vaulted ceiling a tiny loft and the rope ladder leading to it gilly menquez was warm to the touch no more than thirty minutes dead probably closer to ten or fifteen walt called it in as calmly as possible over the radio but there was no return the radios signal lost to the contours of the geography he tried his phone and got through i want the highway entrance sealed he explained to his dispatcher ambulance and coroner to the residence every deputy available is on the manhunt we want greenhorn covered and a team to watch cold springs contact roger hillabrand and have his place locked down this guy could be out there could be long gone the bottom third of gillys boots were soaked brown mud filled the space between the heel and sole there was a piece of velvet leaf caught in the cuff of his khakis along with pine straw and flecks of bark but it was the amber beads of field grass that won his full attention these along with the cheat grass stuck to his socks you didnt find grasses in the forest only in meadows and one meadow in particular came to mind gilly had returned to the high mountain campsite theyd discovered the same campsite hed been keeping an eye on when hed drunk himself into a blackout walt could picture gilly an expert tracker starting there and working his way down to the engleton estate could picture him finding his way directly to the tree house could only imagine his surprise when hed thrown open the trapdoor ahead of him as he came down the exterior ladder he slipped a couple of rungs catching himself at the last second seeing this beatrice lunged but did not leave her spot he saw her and reminded of her value to him returned to the tree house carefully retrieving two of the discarded tissues without touching them himself a moment later he presented the tissues to beatrices discerning nose and issued a single command find it the dog a bundle of repressed energy took off at a shot nose to the ground executing her bizarre loops and doublebacks at the base of the ladder at astounding speed wagging excitedly she faced her master and paused expectantly shed caught the scent find it he repeated motioning into the woods beatrice raced off into the darkness and walt followed his mobile phone already dialing fionas number whats going on she said before even identifying him are you here i need you to listen carefully and do exactly as i say he said are you with me okay he hadnt checked her subaru he hadnt cleared the main house he was trusting beatrice but knew some slight possibility existed that the dog might be following gillys scent and not the killers do you lock your car he asked what the hell i need you to stay with me fiona i need you to answer my questions and do as i say why are you breathing like that whats going on im in the woods above you do you lock your car no the car was a likely hiding place if the killer had spotted walts approach had left the tree house while walt had circled the main house he could be anywhereincluding in the back of the subaru awaiting a hostage your doors and windows are locked yes youre scaring me good i want you alert my people are on their way it may take them a while theyre coming in quietly on my orders do me a favor and dont shoot one of my deputies but if anyone tries to break into your place shoot first and ask questions later you got that silence my guys will not break into your place certainly not without announcing themselves are you with me what the hells going on walt it wasnt kira he said i told you that she said indignantly the guy our mountain man hes been living in your tree house her gasp was audible through the phone at least part time hes been up there the tree house our tree house stay put my guys are maybe ten minutes out are you with me i wont be a victim again walt its not going to come to that beatrices continuing up into the forest pulled walt in that direction he could call her off return make sure fiona got in the subaru and that the subaru was safe im just saying we wont let that happen we you and me the silence was protracted walt felt it in his chest okay she finally said okay he signed off and holstered the blackberry and followed the sound of beatrice up ahead of him she was focused and determined and it was her level of concentration that returned him to the task at hand swallowed in the darkness of a thick conifer forest navigating more on instinct than vision led by the sounds from a dog he had come to trust and depend upon he drove himself on halfblind halfterrified determined to push fiona from his mind but finding it impossible higher and higher they climbed beatrice leading him along a meandering game trail they were moving quickly walt light on his feet and nearly silent and he wondered if they werent closing the gap on menquezs killer the man might or might not know walt was in pursuit might or might not be experiencing remorse over killing menquez walt imagined him justifying taking the baseball bat to the head of martel gale but strangling a forest service ranger whether panicked or not had to weigh differently walt imagined him desperate irrational and in search of some way out of his actions he didnt picture the man a lunatic despite his having jumped through a window at the casino the breakin at the berkholders had been cleverly planned and disguised as the work of a bear that wasnt the mark of a lunatic he and beatrice were really moving now walt at a near run beatrice stopping ahead waiting and then bolting on when beatrice allowed him to catch up her body craning forward over her front paws and every inch trembling he knew they were close he patted her head and chest and thrust his palm out marking her to stay worked forward through some underbrush as quietly as any man or animal could move believed himself invisible faster and more capable than his adversary no matter how much the person considered himself a mountain man this right now was walts domain a place where he thrived a place with which he identified and drew upon for his own identity leave the conference rooms and the relationships to others give him the pitchblack forest and the motivation of a killer on the loose by the time he got a look at the meadow it was empty the blackberry vibrated in his pocket he ignored it and it stopped starlight gave the grassy field a blue hue its abandoned campsite like a scar in the distance walt reached through the chokecherry taking hold of a clump of field grass the ripened seeds falling away seeds hed recovered from gillys pants cuff the cheat grass played out in the driest portions of the meadow in oblong shapes kidney beans and a hook nose walt broke out and entered the meadow but stayed low and held to the boundary of where the forest formed a wall of shadow he clicked his tongue once and beatrice came padding up behind him faster than he could have expected a single hand motion and she heeled given his angle walt was able to look behind struck by a darker swath in the still sea of grass a person alone moving from very near where walt had crouched and in the direction of the abandoned leanto and campfire he stayed perfectly still as his eye sought other anomalies he easily spotted the beatendown path used by the occasional hiker the path he and others had used to approach the campsite he could imagine gilly there now having picked up on some markers in the woods following expeditiously the way of any tracker excited driven forward with purpose given the line leading that direction he pictured menquezs killer somewhere up near the leanto or by now well beyond following the trail that led up and over the ridge and into greenhorn gulch walt caught the flicker of headlights through the trees below and to his right the ambulance he thought he faced a choice of trying to start beatrice on the scent again or heading out on the same trail on which he and brandon had followed the amorous backpackers he tried to think like his adversary or if not think react like him what would the headlights mean to him danger or curiosity the man had revealed himself as brazen staying at least some of the time in a tree house within a matter of yards from two women did his clubbing martel gale suggest an attachment to fiona had walt perhaps been in store for the same outcome when kira had interrupted his peering inside the cottage windows would the arrival of headlights arouse curiosity could the killer resist the gravitational pull to see if his kill had been discovered and if so the reaction walt resorted to what had gotten him here to the one thing he could trust he pulled the tissue from his breast pocket placed it for beatrice to sniff and commanded once again find it you cant go up there fiona called out as the ambulance driver put his foot on the ladders first rung excuse me the man said the mans partner the medic approached from the far side of the ambulance lady weve got a shift change in fortyfive minutes weve been on twelve hours weve been instructed to do a job here and id appreciate it if you didnt interfere to recover a body she said an educated guess on her part walt had said his people were on their way hed warned her to stay put but she had to know given the ambulance had arrived under no siren or lights given that walt had left the area immediately after coming out of the tree housefor shed watched the whole thingadded up to the obvious and you are the ambulance driver inquired the medic was new or hed have recognized her me about to give her name she revised her answer crime scene photographer you cant go in there until im through and i havent started you can identify yourself wait here she said to the medic dont move she instructed the driver at the base of the ladder stall she thought she returned with her camera bag and her wallet displaying her sheriffs office id you want to take some pictures go ahead and take them but youve got five minutes more like a half hour she said i told you we got a shift change in forty he said listen if this was a big deal the place would be lousy with deputiesam i right its a body bagger thats all we got the call we do the job and ive got to do mine and im giving you five minutes four now that weve used one jawing it to death hold up he called out to his buddy the driver stepped away from the ladder fiona slung the camera bag over her shoulder walked to the ladder and climbed with each rung she feared what she might find with the advent of a siren coming closer but still far in the distance walts blood pressure rose he had specifically ordered otherwise and it was only as the siren passed and faded to the north that he realized the cruiser was on another call beatrice loaded herself with cheat grass as she spun her loops in the meadow snorting and hurrying to pick up the lost scent walt looking on from a distance not crowding her but prepared to follow as he looked up he saw thousands of acres of national forest acres that by now the mountain man knew well had exploited for the past few months it gave the man a decided advantage whereas beatrice provided walt a counterpunch hindsight was nobodys friend least of all his he could see now the unspoken pressure hed put on gilly menquez to deliver he would have to live with the outcome while gilly would not could begin to see how hed allowed the evidence to form unwarranted suspicions wondering how much of his own feelings had colored those suspicions standing alone in the meadow he felt an urge to cry out a need to beg forgiveness though from whom he couldnt be sure he withdrew his blackberry and checked the missed call dispatch he doublechecked his radio still not working even with the added elevation he called in his temper getting the better of him emergency services answered the outwardly calm womans voice its fleming wheres the backup we have an ambulance on site sheriff as to the patrols it appears all but huxley rolled to carey on that drowning huxley was the other side of galena hes on his way south to your twenty budgetary concerns had lowered his swing shift to six officers in four cruisers he cursed the commissioners for pulling the dollars out from under him and his own deputies and dispatch for allowing a patrol void to occur it wasnt the first time a group of bored deputies had bunched up walts office rang the ketchum police department as well ketchum fourcar pileup with fire and injury at the saddle intersection two patrols on site we need your ambulance up there asap i called them off just now walt hadnt seen the headlights leaving his attention on beatrice i need backup gloria yes sir i need those areas blocked and searched as we discussed this is a homicide suspect goddamn it he flared revealing a rare display of emotion i want every oncall deputy up here i want anyone and everyone weve got right now do i have to spell it out for you copy that initiating the call tree it was a nottoosubtle stab at walt by a very alert dispatcher gloria knew her stuff and hed been wrong to dress her down all that had been required of him was to order the call tree instigated his outburst hadnt helped anyone thank you he said it caught her off guard no problem sheriff make it happen he couldnt help adding he disconnected the call his flashlight followed beatrices apparent random looping as she began to define the pattern and walt knew to move in her general direction however her olfactory process worked it eventually led to a smaller tighter pattern from which she shot out in a straight line suddenly fixed on the scent that moment quickly approached and as she got a faceful of the trail left by the killer she looked back to make sure walt was paying attention she actually looked proud of him as she found him coming up behind her and she tore excitedly to the edge of the meadow looked back once more and dropped out of sight for a moment walt lost his equilibrium when hed last seen her shed been nose to the ground aimed back down the hill toward the engleton estate fiona had taken more than the five minutes allotted to her for the a recording of the remains of guillermo menquez so she was surprised to hear the ambulance engine start and the vehicle drive away when shed been expecting a reprimand hello she called down through the hole left by the open trapdoor hello are you there in truth there wasnt anything more to photograph shed taken a dozen pictures of the deceased and another dozen of the tree house interior overcome by chills most of the time both to be alone in the presence of a dead body and to realize someone had been living up here it looked like it it smelled like it there was little doubt that the structure had been used as a hideaway and the thought that it was but a matter of yards from her cottage and the main house made her sick to her stomach as she came out of the tree house and back down its ladder she looked over her shoulder to see a tiny light up the hill winking at her as it descended steadily through the forest she clung there to the ladder and reached for her phone to call walt to confirm this was him headed toward her but didnt have it on her shed left it in her bedroom along with the handgun suddenly the cottage and the main house looked different to her given the evidence of someone living in the tree house given the dead body up there she considered the safe room where kira had hidden herself but couldnt bring herself to enter either the home or her own cottage the flashlight was heading through the forest at a run heading down the hill heading toward her now she heard her ringtone from within the cottage she took two steps in that direction but stopped picturing someone hiding in there waiting for her the phones dull ringing continued through three more cycles and went silent the phone the gun the flashlight no longer seen no way she was going in there she looked up maybe the safest place was in the tree house standing on the trapdoor to keep it from opening but not if it was the killers lair not if she had to hole up with a dead body hadnt walt once said the best place to hide was out in the open she spotted the stack of split firewood and beyond another stack of the unsplit rounds a trail led up into the woods from just beyond the pond where would she feel safer wandering an empty house the size of a hotel or tucked away in the woods with her back against a tree the flashlight had to be walt he couldnt be more than ten minutes away she left her camera bag at the foot of the ladder and hurried to the stack of logs jumpy and agitated and feeling like someone was constantly a few feet behind her glancing over her shoulder nervously scared of her own shadow she reached the stack of rounds and there was a baseball bat stacked among the logs kiras missing baseball bat probably placed there by one of the gardeners or maybe it was the bat from outside her own cottage she wrapped her hand around it and squeezed tightly it felt right walt followed beatrice down the hill at a jog their routine familiar to both she would go out ahead of him locked on the scent then return to within a few yards of him to make sure he was still with her as he broke out onto a defined path walt switched off the flashlight and fitted it back into its loop on his gun belt it was dark in the woods but the path revealed itself as a pale ribbon and walt followed it effortlessly slowing only occasionally as it turned or twisted around a rock outcropping or became darkened with a tangle of exposed roots as much as he appreciated being on the scent as much as he understood a killers bizarre need to return to the crime scene he took little comfort fiona was not answering her phone this fact alone drove him toward the engleton place at a dangerous pace nearly keeping up with beatrice and by doing so encouraging the dog ahead at a full run he pushed her faster she pulled him along but he was no match for her she took his pursuit of her as some kind of game and quickly outpaced him two minutes passed walt charging down the descending path five beatrices absenceher failure to return to himbegan to weigh on him had the sense of game won out over her obligation to follow the scent had he confused her with his running he couldnt be sure the woods unfamiliar to him but it felt as if he would arrive at the estate any minute beatrice yipped it was a cry a painful cry and it set into him a sense of panic and dread as if one of his daughters had called out beware when the hunter becomes the hunted his first and only conclusion was that the killer had somehow known the dog was trailing him that walt by challenging the dog had driven her headlong into a trapthat that yip had been beatrices final moment one last desperate attempt to warn walt his response visceral and immediate his foot speed increased exponentially running blindly now all out it was more than a connection between them it was a bond walt to her and her to him it was something in his blood the kind of something that couldnt be explained to another human being without sounding foolish even childish the love of family the love of forever her yip rang in his ears burned a babys cry in the night a call for help his eyes blurred watery from the run or from tears or from both he wiped them away but all was a blurry darkened landscape the paths lighter shade swirling and shifting suddenly a river beneath his feet a geometric shape among it all the engleton roof and then the pain it ripped through both legs at the shins he hadnt seen a log across the path but he went down facefirst losing the gun as he reached out to break the fall his head flirting with unconsciousness in an effort to escape the pain it seared from his broken shins up through his knees his groin his stomach and exploded into his head as he cried out a sickening agonized shriek blackness loomed at the edges of his consciousness as he rolled over and drew his knees into his chest writhing and gasping for air breathe through it he told himself as impossible as it was he could ill afford to pass out from somewhere through the fog of pain fiona appeared on her knees a baseball bat in hand even with the evidence so blatant it took walt several seconds to connect the bat with the excruciating pain in his legs and only then in what amounted to total disbelief she was mouthing im sorry beneath the intense ringing in his ears and the waves of his own internal groaning then from behind her came the mountain man like a specter he emerged through the darkness drawn by walts shriek or out of some sixth sense that made him aware of fionas presence whether a lunatic or a calculating murderer who understood the value of a hostage he moved straight for fiona who was herself too absorbed in her own mishap to have any awareness of him but it wasnt fiona he wanted she screamed and rolled away releasing the bat as the man seized hold of it it hung at his side like the bat of a hitter stepping up to home plate staring down the pitcherwalt whether traumatized or demonized vengeful or drugged and demented both men knew what the mountain man intended to do with the bat as he took another step closer fiona who had scooted away on her back thrusting herself along the forest floor by digging in her heels who had moved a good five yards away also saw the futurewhere the next ten seconds were headed whether to protect him or herselfwalt couldnt fathom such thoughts still gripped in his painshe rolled to her knees and began sweeping her arms through the pine straw in what at first appeared such a lame and odd behavior the gun he realized in a flash of lucidity she was going for his gun movement caught the edges of walts wavering peripheral vision beatrice limped onto the path holding her right front paw aloft her expressiondid he imagine it or actually see it clearly in the darkone of remorse and grave concern as her master lay writhing in the dirt a camouflaged giant glowering over him walt who couldnt hear anything beyond the rush of his own blood past his ears who sensed fiona clambering in the underbrush raking left and right in search of his handgun who saw martel gales and gilly menquezs killer turn toward the woman clearly sensing she presented the greatest threat managed a single word to rise up through the pain defend beatrice squealed again as she lighted onto her injured paw bounding some four feet through air like a projected missilea dozen bared and flashing white teeth walt found the wheelchair an embarrassment never mind a necessity the orthopedist told him that despite the lack of any fractures he wouldnt walk for a week he spent as much time as possible behind his desk because it hid his disability his condition forcing him to reassess what formed his selfidentity nancy came in to wheel him i can do it myself he barked youre going to be a delight in your old age you know that maybe i wont get there not if you work without backup that was supposed to be my fault was there somebody else out there in the woods with you did i miss something she grabbed the wheelchairs handles and walt didnt object she rolled her eyes behind his back yeah well he said lacking any decent retort he hated her sometimes you sure youre up for this im fine he loved her at other times it can wait no it cant i cant he cant it has to happen now yes boss shut up yes boss she delivered him to interview as charmless and bland as interview but one door closer to reception he thought it some aspect of intelligent design that he should be the one conducting the interview and she the one behind the video camera all they lacked was beatrice currently bandaged and on the floor of his office asleep shed taken a piece of cheat grass in the pad of her front paw had run on it leaped on it and driven it in so far that mark aker had to remove it surgically the accused in the jails blue jumpsuit won the charles manson lookalike contest curly black tangled hair unshaven bassethound brown eyes peter arian had wisely ducked this one letting a wetbehindtheears public defender by the name of crawford sit in the attorneys chair crawford worked to lose his neophytes startled look making him appear to be the one accused of homicide sheriff crawford began my client objects to any alleged victim of his you shut the fuck up said the accused handcuffed he couldnt add the punctuation he would have clearly liked walt appreciated the reprimand crawford was now officially a spectator the attorney glanced in the direction of the video camera and fiona but then thought better of making any further protest i dont care who you are the accused stated dryly why should i its not like i killed you he smiled he might have had decent teeth once he looked directly at fiona and therefore directly into the camera lens i wasnt going to let him push you around him knocking you down like that walt had some housekeeping to take care of name age current residence but he let it go for now fiona had been warned not to engage with the man is it running walt asked her she nodded you can leave the room she slipped from behind the tripod and past the wheelchair she leaned down and whispered i wasnt pushed walt nodded she closed the door gently her presence had accomplished what hed hoped he wasnt going to put her through anything more walt said you shot one of my deputies we have your prints off the chair you threw through the window and theyre going to match your prints at booking and thats going to buy you a long long time in maximum the state of idaho doesnt take kindly to people shooting its peace officers so you might as well tell me everything to walts surprise randy dowling then confessed to the two murders and brandons shooting hed killed gale in a fit of rage at him pushing fiona and hurting herthe way it had looked from his vantage point behind a living room window my own wife walked out on me you probably know that much am i right me being the loser i am thats what youre thinking am i right takes the kids with her all because of money because i lose my stinking job im a cpa ill bet you know that a guy like you knows everything right you bet you do but you dont know me im not the guy you think i am college of central utah top twentyfive of my class you know all this im not telling you anything new im putting it down on tape i was this guy he said pointing his two cuffed hands at crawford who recoiled even looked like him youd a bought insurance from me the way i looked but a guy that big pushing a finelooking woman like that one gave him the old louisville slugger up top of the head beaned him thought it was lights out till the prick got up and came at me like frankenstein jesus like trying to chainsaw a sequoia guy takes these steps toward me and me im backing up lockstep i couldnt believe hed gotten back up his eyes are staring straight aheadi swear he doesnt see meand right as i think hes about to do me he drops to his knees and then faceplants into the garden down for the count like a zombie night of the living dead i couldnt believe it walt had witnessed other confessions where the guilty party proved himself eager to purge but honestly hadnt expected it of this one hed initially appraised the mans wild looks deciding he had an ignorant lunatic on his hands when nancy had brought what little they could find on him walt had ordered it doublechecked but now the man was confirming what theyd learned about him somewhere down the line hed be deemed a victim of the economy by a sympathetic press or a politician seeking additional funding a poster boy for all that can go wrong you cooked meth walt said seeing it as a conversation starter crawford leaned forward but not for long his participation shortened by a woeful look from dowling and damn near every penny went into an envelope i slipped under the door of my wifes mothers place i can take care of my family we sure as hell arent food stamp people the tree house i got tired of running around you know your peoplepeople like you like that other onescouring the woods looking for me you know how that feels you get treated like an animal you start acting like one you drove me to that place you and people like you couldnt leave well enough alone you know how many people are out in these woods sheriff more than you think and come to find out these other people have tree houses nicer than a lot of peoples homes including mine whats with that you think i liked it out there shitting in a hole getting sick from the water what kind of country is this when you cant even drink the creek water howd we let something like that happen so you killed him mostly i slept days and moved around the woods at night safer that way fewer of your kind except for that one a drinker that one id had my eye on him before no real threat to me not until he pokes his head up in that tree house like its groundhogs day scared the shit out of me wanted to take my tree house away im thinking so i kicked himkicked him in the throat turns out grabbed him by the hair hauled him up musta broken a bone or something in his throat voice box maybe guy went purple on me didnt mean for it to happen that way im not a killer there are two men dead yeah but that just kind of happened what happened to those men walt asked i just told you you killed them martel gale and guillermo menquez if you say so its you saying so mr dowling not me are you saying you killed them i killed them i dragged gale up the hill and dumped him im not proud of it you understand im not like some sicko or something you know im not one of them i didnt like it it wasnt like that it just happened you think about it it was bound to happen a person like me you and everyone like you did this youre the ones made it happen dowling was still ranting about the economic inequalities of the valley as walt let the door shut behind his chair fiona had her back pressed against the wall across from him her expression severe so walt shook his head the lunatics are easier he didnt confess oh no he confessed no resistance at all gilly messed us up by taking the atm card this guy he took gales cash out of the wallet left the cards gilly came along and hijacked the atm card we thought we were looking for one guy when it was two she said nothing uninterested lunatics he said i meant theyre easier to live with to sleep a guy like this hes going to haunt me because because he was avoidable you dont need to be haunted too the least i can do is shelter you from that she squatted so she could face him eye to eye he found the pose vaguely sexual and reminded himself once again that he was on dangerous ground with this woman id like that she said hed forgotten what it was hed said for the past i dont know how many years ive wanted nothing but independence to take care of myself to protect myselfdefend myselfwhatever to be reliant upon no one to trust no one sounds lonely about as lonely as a divorced man with two young daughters i imagine she said no arguing that a female deputy entered the long hallway and walt looked at her and she stood and put her back against the wall to allow the woman to pass to her credit the deputy passed without a glance walt thought fiona looked sexy against the wall like that too trouble this is extremely complicated he said yet incredibly simple she countered allowing a smile onto her face but complicated he had to have the last word my point being i wouldnt mind someone sheltering me from some of the stuff just as long as that someone allowed me to shelter him in return i wont be a kept woman but im not an open relationship type youre racking up the points he said in the good column i hope in the very good column he said we take it slow she said look at me he said indicating the wheelchair whats it look like to you home again home again jiggityjig shouted emily more enthusiasm than shed showed in a very long time their father confined to a wheelchair the two girls had taken it upon themselves to make dinnermicrowaved prepackaged meat loaf and stovetop mashed potatoesand were incredibly proud of their effort you know fiona walt said of course the girls said almost in unison shes going to hang out tonight help me out maybe help get you guys in bed and then take off no problem said nikki you want to help him or us fiona considered her options she placed walts briefcase into his lap and entered the kitchen with the girls he feigned complaint and wheeled himself into the dining room following up on an email to skype boldt you heard boldt asked when his visage appeared on screen heard what
