jilly cooper rivals acknowledgements a very large number of people helped me with this book most of them work in television and are exceptionally busy they still found the time to talk to me and particularly in the case of those from htv to entertain me with lavishness and generosity all of them are experts in their own field but as i was writing fiction i only took their advice so far as it fitted my plot the accuracy of the book in no way reflects their expertise they were also all so nice to me that it was impossible to base any of the unpleasant characters in the story on any of them they include georgina abrahams rita angel william beloe michael blakstad roy bottomley james bredin adrian brenard doug carnegie stephen cole john corbett jenny crick mike davey geoff druett ron evans

millionaire sitting in the concorde departure lounge at heathrow on a perfect blue june morning anthony second baron baddingham chairman and managing director of corinium television should have been perfectly happy he was blessed with great wealth a title a brilliant career a beautiful flat in kensington houses in gloucestershire and tuscany a loyal muchadmired wife three charming children and a somewhat demanding mistress to whom he had just bidden a long farewell on the free telephone beside him he was about to fly on his favourite aeroplane concorde to his favourite city new york to indulge in his favourite pastime selling coriniums programmes to american television and raising american money to make more programmes tony baddingham was a great believer in using other peoples money or opm as he called it then if a project bombed someone else picked up the bill as a final bonus neatly folded beside him were the morning papers which hed already read in the post house hotel and which all contained glowing reports of coriniums past six months results announced yesterday just as he had been checking out of the post house an hour earlier however tonys perfect pleasure had been ruined by the sight of his near neighbour and longterm rival rupert campbellblack checking in he was scribbling his signature with one hand and holding firmly on to a rather grubby but nonetheless ravishing girl with the other the girl who had chipped nail polish wildly tangled blonde hair mascara smudges under her eyes and a deep suntan had obviously just been pulled out of some other bed and was giggling hysterically rupert she wailed there simply isnt time youll miss the plane itll wait said rupert and gathering up his keys started to drag her towards the lift as the doors closed like curtains coming down on the first act of a play tony could see the two of them glued together in a passionate embrace a deeply competitive man tony had felt dizzy with jealousy he had seldom particularly since he had inherited the title and become chief executive of corinium had any difficulty attracting women but hed never attracted anything so wantonly desirable and desiring as that grubby vaguely familiar blonde more coffee lord baddingham one of the beautiful attendants in the concorde lounge interrupted tonys brooding he shook his head comforted by the obvious admiration in her voice shouldnt we be boarding he asked well be a few minutes late there was a slight engineering problem theyre just doing a lastminute check tony glanced round the departure lounge filled with businessmen and american tourists and noticed a pale redheaded young man in a grey pinstripe suit who had stopped his steady flow of writing notes on a foolscap pad and was looking apprehensively at his watch boarding the plane twenty minutes later tony found himself sitting up at the front on an inside seat with a jap immersed in a portable computer on his right across the gangway next to the window sat the young man in the pinstripe suit he was even paler now and looking distinctly put out good morning lord baddingham said a stewardess handing tony that days newlyflownin copy of the wall street journal engineering fault sorted out asked tony as the engines started revving up not quite meeting his eyes the girl nodded brightly then looking out of the window she seemed to relax as a black car raced across the tarmac next there was a commotion as a light flat familiar drawl could be heard down the gangway frightfully sorry to hold you all up traffic was diabolical all the stewardesses seemed to converge on the new arrival fighting to carry his newspaper and put his hand luggage up in the locker wont you be needing your briefcase minister asked a male steward shimmying down the gangway rupert campbellblack shook his head no thanks sweetheart have a nice zizz then said the male steward going crimson with pleasure at the endearment as the doors slammed shut rupert collapsed into the seat across the gangway from tony wearing a crumpled cream suit a blue striped shirt dark glasses and with an eighth of an inch of stubble on his chin he looked more like a rock star than one of her majestys ministers terribly sorry gerald he murmured to the pale young man in the pinstripe suit there was a terrible pileup on the m smiling thinly gerald removed a blonde hair from ruperts lapel i really must buy you an alarm clock for christmas minister if youd missed that lunchtime speech wed have been in real stück good of them to hold the plane thank christ they did looking round rupert saw tony baddingham and grinned why its the big baddingham wolf cutting it a bit fine arent you said tony disapprovingly both men required each others goodwill rupert as an mp within tonys television companys territory needed the coverage whereas tony needed ruperts recommendation to the government that he was running a respectable company but it didnt make either like the other any better bloody good results you had this morning said rupert fastening his seat belt id better buy some corinium shares slightly mollified tony congratulated rupert on his recent appointment as tory minister for sport rupert shrugged the pms shitscared about football hooliganism seems to think i can come up with some magic formula setting a yobbo to catch a yobbo perhaps said tony nastily then regretted it i was at thames television yesterday said rupert icily as the plane taxied towards the runway after the programme i had a drink with the home secretary and the chairman of the iba they were both saying that youd better watch out if you dont spend a bit more of that bloody fortune youre coining from advertising on making some decent programmes youre going to lose your franchise as rupert leant forward so tony could hear him over the engines tony caught a whiff of the scent the girl had been wearing in the post house foyer earlier and you ought to spend some time in the area how the hell can you run a television company in the cotswolds if you spend all your time in london hawking your ass round the advertising companies the shareholders wouldnt be very pleased if i didnt said tony thoroughly nettled look at our results rupert shrugged again youre also supposed to make good programmes as your local mp im just passing on whats being said as one of your more influential constituents said tony furiously i dont think you should be checking into the post house with bimbos half your age rupert laughed that was no bimbo that was beattie johnson of course instantly tony remembered the girl beattie johnson was one of the most scurrilous and successful women columnists dubbed by private eye the first notquitealady of fleet street shes ghosting my memoirs added rupert we were doing research i always believe in laying ones ghost below the blank stare of the dark glasses his curved smiling mouth seemed even more insolent as the plane revved up both men turned to look out of the window and tony found himself trembling with rage but not even the splendid stripedsilkshirted bosom of the air hostess which rose and fell as she showed passengers how to inflate their life jackets could keep ruperts eyes open by the time they were airborne he was asleep tony accepted a glass of champagne and tried to concentrate on the wall street journal he didnt know which he resented most ruperts habitual contempt his ability to sleep anywhere his effortless acquisition of women or the obvious devotion of the palely efficient gerald who was now sipping perrier and polishing the speech rupert was to deliver to the international olympic committee at lunchtime there had hardly been a husband in gloucestershire indeed in the world tony reflected who hadnt cheered four years ago when ruperts beautiful wife helen had walked out on him in the middle of the los angeles olympics running off with another rider and causing rupert the maximum humiliation but infuriatingly rupert had appeared outwardly unaffected and had risen to the occasion by winning a showjumping gold medal despite a trapped shoulder nerve and going on two years later to win the world championship the only prize hitherto to elude him then giving up show jumping at the pinnacle of his fame he had moved effortlessly into politics winning the tory seat of chalford and bisley with ease even worse he had turned out a surprisingly good mp being very quick on his feet totally unfazed by the opposition or the prime minister and prepared to fight very hard for his constituency although scandal had threatened eighteen months ago when ruperts then mistress amanda hamilton wife of the foreign secretary had withdrawn her patronage on finding out that rupert was also sleeping with her teenage daughter by this time in the eyes of a doting prime minister rupert could do no wrong now as minister for sport with gerald middleton as an exceptional private secretary to do all the donkey work rupert was free to roam round exuding glamour raising money for the olympic team here defusing a riot against a south african athlete there responsibility however hadnt cleaned up his private life at all divorced from helen he could behave as he chose hence his cavorting with beattie johnson in the post house that morning glancing at rupert sprawled out on the palegrey leather seat taking up most of geralds leg room beautiful despite the emergent stubble tony felt a further stab of jealousy he couldnt remember a time in his fortyfour years when he hadnt envied the campbellblacks for all their outlandish behaviour they had always been looked up to in gloucestershire they had lived in the same beautiful house in penscombe for generations while tony was brought up behind net curtains in a boring semi in the suburbs of cheltenham tony also had a chip because he only went to a grammar school where hed been teased for being fat and short and because his conventional colourless father although subsequently ennobled for his work in the war had been considered far too valuable as a munitions manufacturer to be allowed to go off and fight unlike ruperts father eddie whod had a dazzling war in the blues even when tonys father had been given his peerage eddie campbellblack and his cronies had laughed always referring to him dismissively as lord poppop as they blasted away slaughtering wild life with one of his products on their large estates growing up near the campbellblacks tony had longed to be invited to penscombe and drawn into that rackety exciting set but the privilege had been bestowed on his brother basil who was ten years younger and who because tonys father had made his pile by then had been given a pony to ride and sent to harrow instead of a grammar school and had there become a friend of ruperts as a result of such imagined early deprivation tony had grown up indelibly competitive not just at work but also socially sexually and at all games spurning the family firm when he left school hed gone straight into advertising and specialized in buying television air time having learnt the form from there he moved to the advertising side of television a brilliant entrepreneur who felt he was slipping unless he had a dozen calls from tokyo and new york during christmas dinner by changing jobs repeatedly he had gained the plum post of chief executive at corinium television eight years ago having shot up to five feet ten and lost his puppy fat in his twenties tony had in middle age grown very attractive in a brutal sort of way although with his roman nose heavylidded charcoalgrey eyes coarsely modelled mouth and springy closecropped dark hair he looked more like a sicilian wide boy than an english peer he chose to proclaim the latter however by wearing coronets on absolutely everything and on the little finger on his left hand gleamed a massive gold signet ring sporting the baddingham crest of wrestling rams above the motto chosen by lord poppop peaceful is the country that is strongly armed considerably adding to tonys sex appeal was a hunky bullnecked body kept in shape by selfcontrol and ruthless exercise and a voice deliberately deep and smooth to eradicate any trace of a gloucestershire accent this only slipped when he went into one of his terrifying rages which flattened the corinium television staff against the creamhessianed walls of his vast office in fact it irritated the hell out of tony that despite his success his fortune and his immense power rupert still refused to take him seriously he would not have been so upset by ruperts sniping if it had not echoed a warning last night from charles crawford the rotund and retiring chairman of the independent broadcasting authority or iba as they were known the ibas job was to grant franchises to the fifteen independent television companies every eight years or so monitor their programmes and generally beat them with a big stick if they stepped out of line after his programme with rupert and the home secretary at thames television yesterday charles crawford had gone on to the garrick to dine with tony as an old friend said charles greedily pouring the cream tony had rejected together with his own supply over his strawberries i dont see what else we can do but give you a stinking midterm report you promised us corinium would provide at least ten hours drama a year for the network and all youve produced is one lousy copsandrobbers twoparter totally targeted at the american market why cant you provide some decent programmes like patrick dromgoole does at htv for a second tony gritted his teeth he was fed up with having patrick dromgoole and htv held up to him as models of perfection then pulling himself together he filled up charles crawfords glass with priceless barsac things are going to change he said soothingly ive just poached simon harris from the bbc as programme controller hes very hot on drama and has dreamed up a terrific idea for a thirteenparter a cross between james herriot and animal house well thats a start grumbled charles but your regional programmes are quite awful too your territory which you conveniently seem to have forgotten stretches from oxford to wales and from southampton to stratford and youre supposed to cover the whole area thats why we gave you the franchise we also know youve been spending corinium advertising profits which should have been spent improving your programmes buying up charles ticked the list off with his fat fingers a film production company a publishing firm a travel agency a cinema chain a film library and a safari park and whats this i hear about plans to buy an american distribution company american for christs sake thats fallen through lied tony it was only an idea well keep it that way finally youve got to spend more time in your area many of your staff have absolutely no idea what you look like i could understand if you had to live in the middle of birmingham or even manchester but cotchester must be the most delightfully civilized town in the country we awarded you the franchise to reflect the region responsibly and weve given you a very easy ride up till now and ive given you some bloody good dinners thought tony sourly as charles sniffed appreciatively at a passing plate of welsh rarebit but when lady gosling takes over from me in the autumn went on charles spooning up the last drop of pink cream youre all going to feel the chill cloud of higher education across the industry lady g believes in quality programmes and lots of women at the helm go on producing your usual crap and youll be out on your ear having brooded on this conversation and on rupert campbellblacks contumely the entire flight the only thing that managed to cheer tony up was when the limousine that met him at kennedy turned out to be at least three feet longer than ruperts and twice as plush tonys rule once he got to america was never to check what time it was in england to compensate for such an unsatisfactory start to the day he spent the next few hours in a heady spate of wheeling and dealing selling the format of two sitcoms and a game show for such a large sum that it wouldnt matter even if they bombed it was only when he got back to the waldorf and found three messages to ring his very demanding mistress alicia and checking the time realized that he couldnt because it was long after midnight and shed be tucked up in bed with her husband that he suddenly felt tired he kicked himself for agreeing to dine with ronnie havegal head of coproductions at nbs particularly as ronnie had asked if he could bring some producer called cameron cook camerons a good friend of mine ronnie had said in his harvard drawl very bright just done a documentary on debutantes up for a peabody award real class they like that sort of thing in england with his royalblue blazers butterscotch tan and streaked hair tony had often wondered about ronnies sexual preferences he didnt want to spend an evening avoiding buying some lousy programme from one of ronnies fag friends yanks always got class wrong anyway christ he was tired unable to master the taps in the shower he shot boiling lava straight into his eyes then forgetting to put the shower curtain inside the bath he drenched the floor and his only pair of black shoes tony spent a lot of money on his clothes and ever since hed seen marlon brando in guys and dolls as a teenager tended to wear dark shirts with light ties the new darkblue silk shirt alicia had given him for his birthday would be wasted on two fags he would keep it for lunch with ali macgraw tomorrow dressed he fortified himself with a large whisky and put the presentation booklet of four men went to mow simon harriss new idea for a thirteenpart series on the glass table together with a video of possible exteriors and interiors to give the americans a taste of the ravishing cotswold countryside he was woken by ronnie ringing up from downstairs but when ronnie came through the door tony suddenly didnt feel tired any more for with him was the sexiest most truculentlooking girl tony had ever seen around twentysix she was wearing a straight linen dress the colour of a new york taxi and earrings like mini satellite dishes she had a lean wonderfully rapacious body long legs very short dark hair sleeked back from her thin face and a clear olive skin with her straight black brows angry slightly protruding amber eyes beaky nose and predatory mouth she reminded him of a bird of prey beautiful intensely ferocious and tameable only by the few she gave out an appalling sexual energy she was also so rude to ronnie who was very much her senior that at first tony assumed they must be sleeping together he soon realized she was rude to everyone this is cameron cook said ronnie nodding angrily in tonys direction cameron set off prowling round the huge suite looking at the large blue urn in the centre of the livingroom holding agapanthus as big as footballs the leather sofas and arm chairs the vast double bed next door and the six telephones with one even in the shower shit her voice was low and rasping this place is bigger than buckingham palace no wonder you brits need american coproduction money tony who was opening a bottle of dom perignon ignored the jibe and asked cameron where she came from cincinnati city of the seven hills said tony smoothly but you must have bought those legs in new york cameron didnt smile you dont look like a lord more like a mafia hood what do i call you your grace sir my lord baron lord ant you can call me tony he handed her a glass cameron picked up the presentation booklet of four men went to mow kicking off her flat black shoes she curled up looking very tiny on the huge pockmarked red leather sofa whats this shit cameron remonstrated ronnie coriniums latest thirteenparter explained tony we aim to start shooting in october if you get american finance said cameron sharply tony nodded well put it out early in the evening should appeal to kids and adults dumb title what the shit does it mean its the line of an english song said tony evenly thought it was a series about back yards its about four agricultural students living in a house i can read thank you snapped cameron running her eyes down the page and someone finds someone in bed with someone in the first episode jesus and youre expecting this shit to go out as wholesome family entertainment in middle america where we havent seen a nipple on the network for years dont listen to cameron said ronnie she needs a muzzle in the office to stop her savaging her colleagues shut up and let me read it ronnie then proceeded to update tony on the recent changes at nbs they axed twenty people last week good people whove been there fifteen years the new business guys are running the place like a supermarket but tony wasnt listening he was watching this incredibly savage girl with her skirt rucked up round her thighs christ hed like to screw all that smouldering bad temper out of her as if aware of his scrutiny she glanced up theres too much air in this glass she said holding it out for a refill youre too old for tv at twentyfive these days ronnie rattled on obsessively i work with a guy of fifty he lives in such constant fear of his age getting out he keeps on having his face lifted ronnie looked desperately tired beneath the butterscotch tan there were new lines round the eyes cameron chucked the presentation booklet back on the glass table well tony raised his eyebrows schmaltz schlock shit what dyou want me to say its utterly provincial right but the dialogues far too sophisticated if youre going to appeal to alabama blacks mexican peasants and russian jews in the same programme you cant have a vocab bigger than three hundred words and i dont know any of the stars no one had heard of tim piggottsmith or charles dance or geraldine james before jewel theyd heard of peggy ashcroft your characters are so stereotyped and youve got the wrong hero johnnys the guy the americans will identify with hes got drive he comes from a poor home hes going to make it the hon wills got it already whats an hon anyway a peers son said tony well make him a lord americans understand lords and theyre all far too wimpish americans are pissed off with wimps weve seen too many guys crying in pinnies you cant wear your sensitivity on your silk shirtsleeve any more tony whod never done any of these things warmed to this girl go on he said as a nation were getting behind the family and the strong patriarch again theres a large part of the population that want men to reassert themselves be more aggressive more accountable more heterosexual and youve got a marvellous chance with four guys in a house together to explore friendship between men i dont mean faggotry i mean comradeship it was a great victorian virtue but no one associated it with being gay todays man shoots first then gets in touch with his feelings later is that how you like your men said tony getting up to put the video into the machine shit no im just talking about the viewers youve got one of the guys ironing the girls ball gown for her yuk tony filled up her glass yet again have a look at this up on the screen came a honeycoloured cotswold village an ancient church golden cornfields then a particularly ravishing queen anne house we plan to use this as wills fathers house said tony bit artyfarty snapped cameron as the camera roved lasciviously over a limetree avenue waterfalls of old roses and a lake surrounded by yellow irises beautiful place said ronnie in awe mine said tony smugly dont you have a wife who owns it as well said cameron feminist hackles rising of course shes a very good gardener looks like fucking disneyland said cameron switching off the video machine tony emptied the bottle into camerons glass and said corinium did make more than twelve million pounds last year selling programmes to america so were not quite amateurs some of the points you made are interesting but we do have to appeal to a slightly more sophisticated audience at home we ought to eat soon said ronnie you must be exhausted not at all said tony who was looking at cameron must just have a pee alone in the bathroom he whipped out his red fountain pen and in the memo page of his diary listed every criticism cameron had made then he brushed his hair and smiling at his reflection hastily removed a honeyroast peanut from between his teeth fortunately he hadnt been smiling much at that bitch even in a packed restaurant swarming with celebrities cameron turned heads there was something about her combative unsmiling beauty her refusal to look to left or right that made even the vainest diners put on their spectacles to have a second glance immediately theyd ordered ronnie went off tablehopping nice guy said tony fishing very social register said cameron dismissively watch him work the room he makes everyone feel theyve had a meaningful intimate conversation in ten seconds flat seems a bit flustered about the bloodletting at nbs cameron took a slug of dom perignon he needs a big success both the series he set up last year have bombed given him an ulcer too cameron looked at tony speculatively i guess youve never had an ulcer lord ant no said tony smoothly i give them to other people how do the nbs sackings affect you cameron shrugged i dont mind the sackings or the rows but now the money men have moved in i figure ill have less freedom to make the programmes i want how dyou get into television my mother walked out on my father at the height of the feminist revolution came to new york hellbent on growth the only thing that grew was her overdraft she was too proud to ask for money from my father so i went to barnard on a scholarship and got a reporting job in the vac to make ends meet after graduation i joined the new york times then moved to the nbs newsroom last year i switched over to documentaries as a writerproducer at the moment im directing drama your mother must be proud of you she thinks im too goalorientated said cameron bitterly shes never forgiven me for voting for reagan i dont understand my mothers generation all that crap about going back to nature and open marriages and communes and peace marches jesus tony laughed i cant see you on a peace march what are your generation into physical beauty money power fame youve certainly achieved the first sure cameron made no attempt to deny it how dyou intend to achieve the rest i aim to be the first woman to run a network company what about marriage and children cameron shook her head so violently she nearly blacked her own eyes with her satellite dish earrings gets in the way of a career ive seen too many women at nbs poised to close a deal being interrupted by a phone call and having to rush home because their kids got a temperature of the waiter arrived with their first course escargots for cameron gulls eggs for tony ronnie who hadnt ordered anything returned to the table buttered a roll but didnt eat it anyway went on cameron angrily whats the point of getting married look at the guys new york is absolutely crammed with emotionally immature guys quite unable to make a commitment theyre all gay said tony he peeled a gulls egg dipped it in celery salt and handed it to cameron bullshit she said accepting it without thanking him there are loads of heterosexuals in new york i know at least three and what makes it worse with the men being so dire is that new york is absolutely crawling with prosperous talented beautiful women in a state of frenzy about getting laid give me their telephone numbers said tony lightly dont be fatuous snarled cameron guys are turned off by achieving women they make them feel inferior what beats me is why women are so dependent on men you see them everywhere with their leather briefcases and their dressedforsuccess business suits rabbiting on about independence yet clinging onto a thoroughly destructive relationship rather than be without a guy furiously she gouged the last of the garlic and parsley butter out of her snail shells the lady reflected tony is protesting too much ronnie was off tablehopping again the head waiter was now making a great song and dance about cooking camerons steak diane at the table throwing mushrooms and spring onions into the sizzling butter the champagne having got to camerons tongue she was also spitting away like the hot fat tv people have no idea whats important ask them about their kids they just tell you what private schools theyre enrolled in thats a very subtle way of telling you how well theyre doing whats the point of having kids just as a status symbol youre a bit of a puritan at heart tony filled her glass yet again your ancestors didnt come over on the mayflower by any chance no but my father was british ive got a british passport better and better thought tony the head waiter was pouring napoleon brandy over the steak now and setting fire to it the orange purple flames flared upwards charring the ceiling lighting up camerons hostile predatory face another waiter served tonys red snapper which was surrounded by tiny courgettes sweetcorn and carrots they employ one guy here to sharpen the turnips said cameron pinching a courgette from tonys plate for a second she looked at it tiny she added dismissively like the average new york cock and with one bite she devoured it tony laughed encouraging her in her scorn enjoy your meal said the head waiter laying the steak in front of cameron with a flourish i wonder if im reading her right thought tony anyone that aggressive must either be desperately insecure or impossibly spoilt maybe her mother had felt guilty about splitting up from her father and let cameron get away with murder ronnies sole was cold when he returned to the table shaking his head i hear you had a row with bella wakefield this afternoon cameron raised her eyes to the charred ceiling shes so fucking useless she is the vicepresidents daughter she pisses me off every time shes got a line which is about once a year she teeters up on her spike heels saying cameron whats my motivation in this scene so finally i flip and say pay day on friday she went kinda mad im not surprised said ronnie disapprovingly the head waiter glided up everything all right sir perfect said ronnie who hadnt touched his sole steak as madam likes it cameron tipped back her chair if you want the honest truth it tastes like moderately flavoured socks the smile was wiped off the waiters face i beg your pardon cameron hissed ronnie like chewing my own laundry i cannot figure why you waste such expensive ingredients producing something so disgusting id rather drink the brandy straight the head waiter looked as though he was going to cry would madam like something else ill pass said cameron ostentatiously putting her knife and fork together its not even worth a doggie bag as they came out of the restaurant limos for ronnie and tony glided up cameron paused between the two i havent seen your deb programme yet said tony why dont we go back to the waldorf and look at it ronnie shook his head you guys go im pooped back in tonys suite an almost unbearable tension developed between them having poured large brandies tony removed his coat despite the air conditioning he could feel damp patches of sweat forming under his arms and trickling down his spine in silence they watched camerons tape within five minutes tony realized its outstanding quality the commentary was cut to a minimum cameron had let the debs and their mothers speak for themselves but you could feel her fierce egalitarian scorn in the way she had highlighted their silliness and pretension and the compassion she displayed for the noveau riche who tried to break in and for the wallflower who sat unfêted through ball after ball despite the fact that cameron had been vile about four men went to mow tony knew when to be generous theyll adore it in england he said at the end ill ring the film purchasing committee tomorrow and insist they look at it thanks cameron got up to rewind the tape id better go i got up at six this morning and you must be reeling from concorde lag with that sleek eton crop thought tony itd be like making love to a boy putting out a hand to halt her he encountered a huge shoulder pad sit down i want to talk to you you got a regular boyfriend until three months ago she sat down on the far end of the leather sofa what did he do he was a threat analyst spent all day looking at the soviets and saying theyre a threat tony laughed edging down the sofa i dont need a man to look after me said cameron defensively just someone to make the sparks fly if im not having a good time i quit are you happily married not overwhelmingly she a dog not at all its a marriage of extreme public convenience we get on very well when we dont see too much of each other this girl is exactly what i need to wake them all up at corinium he was thinking shes superbright ambitious aggressive the iba would adore the deb programme it had quality and universal appeal and being a woman cameron would appeal to the incoming chairman lady gosling even more important from the way she had carved up simon harriss treatment she was capable of seeing what was wrong with a programme and subtly gearing it towards the american market without making it too bland and finally as she had a british passport there wouldnt be the usual ghastly hassle about work permits howd you like to work in england how much thirty grand youve got to be joking im on a hundred thousand dollars here its cheaper living in england and we could pick up a few bills id have to have somewhere to live said cameron thinking longingly of the honeycoloured houses shed seen on the video we can arrange that if im stuck in the country ill need a car of course for a minute she glared at him how soon do i get on the board cameron said tony gently im the boss of corinium i decide that ill kick it around she said indifferently youd better sleep with me first not by a flicker did tonys swarthy face betray his surprise why dyou think afterwards i might not want to offer you the job cameron smiled for the first time that evening no i might not want to take it even in the bedroom she didnt stop fighting promptly switching on the television god is love a lady in a shirtwaister with very long royal blue eyelashes was saying not a guy with a stick he wants us all to enjoy ourselves and so say all of us said cameron tony turned off the television and with remarkably steady hands removed her huge earrings and massaged the reddened lobes dyou get a good satellite picture from these there wasnt much else to take off just the yellow dress and a pair of yellow pants tony never dreamed that anyone with such a sinewy wellmuscled body could have such a smooth skin those yfronts went out with the ark said cameron throwing them in the wastepaper basket im going to buy you some boxer shorts bearing in mind that it was eight oclock in the morning in england tony thought he acquitted himself with honours mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the lord sang cameron as she finally climbed off him still fighting the american war of independence murmured tony into her shoulder but just as he was falling asleep he realized she was rigid and shuddering beside him reaching down he found her hand in her bush i thought youd come as well he said outraged if you figured that buster youve got a lot to learn come here you bitch tugging away her hand he knelt over her kissing her navel then very slowly progressing downwards lying on the floor tangled in each others arms they were interrupted much later by the telephone it was coriniums sales director georgie baines i thought youd like the monthly revenue figures tony i didnt wake you ive been up for hours you can say that again said cameron wriggling out from under him theyre up four million on last year said georgie jubilantly for five minutes they discussed business then georgie said that percy tonys chauffeur would like a word good morning my lord said percy we won the test match by four wickets tony was almost more delighted by that than by the advertising figures hearing water running in the shower he was about to jump on cameron once more when the telephone rang again after that it kept ringing ending up with a call from alicia tonys beautiful and demanding mistress do you spend all your life on the telephone she screamed there was a knock on the door tony hung up and wrapping a towel round his waist went to answer it it was the breakfast hed ordered before going out last night having signed the bill he found cameron in the bathroom drying her pants with the hair dryer she was wearing tonys darkblue silk birthday shirt with one of his red paisley ties wound round her waist her hair was wet from the shower she looked sensational come back to bed cant ive got a breakfast meeting got to get there early to check the room isnt bugged the telephone rang again you answer it said tony evilly cameron picked it up someone called alicia she said say im in the shower she didnt sound very pleased said cameron putting down the receiver scooping up the minibottles of shampoo conditioner bath gel and cologne she dropped them into her bag then peeling the shoulder pads out of her yellow dress she fixed them into the shoulders of tonys darkblue shirt as she went into the bedroom she removed a strawberry as big as a cricket ball from the grapefruit on tonys breakfast tray what are your plans asked tony im in the studios from ten oclock onwards i should be through around eight and you ive got people to see im lunching with ali macgraw more my age group sweetie he kissed cameron on the forehead and i want that shirt back you can wear my yellow dress if i wear it ronniell know i havent been home taking a mirror from her bag she winced at her reflection in the bright sunlight hell know it anyway ill call you later said tony the moment shed gone he showered dressed and having summoned one of the secretaries from coriniums american office on th avenue dictated a completely new treatment for four men went to mow in the middle alicia rang and demanded who had answered the telephone your successor said tony without a trace of compassion and hung up by midday he had a new and beautifully bound presentation booklet for four men went to mow containing a character analysis of the new hero who was now the workingclass boy and not the peers son who had become a lord plus a new list of possible stars suggested locations story lines and a couple of pages of simplified dialogue all based entirely on camerons recommendations ronnie called up as tony was reading it through how dyou like cameron like wasnt the operative word whats bugging her more enfant than terrible said ronnie who wanted to do business with tony very badly but shes too ambitious for her own good and too upfront theres a streak of idealism which makes her scream and shout till she gets what she wants and if youre as sexy as she is you antagonize not only women but also the men who dont get to pull you dont tell anyone i told you but the programme controllers going to axe her last documentary and shes been so rude to bella wakefield shes being taken off the series but shes bright ronnie sighed sadly they dont give a shit about talent here any more but thats off the record we havent spoken said tony as a quid pro quo can we be the first people to see four men went to mow asked ronnie i know cameron carved it up but it looked great to me of course said tony smoothly after an exceptionally affable lunch with ali macgraw who was an old friend to discuss a longterm project tony strolled down to see usbc the deadly rivals of nbs at the plaza of the seagram building tourists and office workers sat on the walls eating sandwiches and pizza trying to woo the blazing sun down between the office blocks on to their bare arms and legs the flowers in the centre strip of park avenue wilted in the heat as tony sauntered past general motors and the pan am building with their thousand glittering windows admiring the coloured awnings outside the houses and the beautiful loping new york girls with their briefcases who looked back at him with flattering interest maybe cameron was right about the paucity of real new york men the head of coproduction at usbc and the daytime programme controller were enchanted by the video of the honeycoloured houses and the cotswold countryside this series tony told them his deep beautiful voice flowing on like vintage port glugging out of a priceless decanter will be a cross between james herriot and animal house but in a way its much much more we intend to explore real friendship between real men not homosexuality but that victorian virtue comradeship the hero a poor boy from a deprived background doesnt inherit the earth or the girl but he finds his integrity the story despite its depths is simple enough to appeal to a mexican peasant or to an alabama black out of the corner of his eye he noticed that the extremely influential vpicdt prog which stood for vicepresident in charge of daytime programming had just entered the room tony warmed to his subject in england he went on we are sick of wimps who wear their sensitivity on their silk shirtsleeves the guys in our story are kind to animals and women but they shoot from the hip first and get in touch with their feelings later nor would they be seen dead in an apron let us have men as men again and bring back dignity and chivalry to our sex thinking hed gone slightly over the top tony switched briskly to finance we can do it for threequarters of a million an hour he said itll be thirty per cent cheaper if we make it in england well put up twenty per cent of the cost against europe and the uk admiring the discreet blue coronet on tonys darkgreen shirt the vpicdt prog whod just been bawled out on the phone by his wife for forgetting to collect the suit shed had altered at ralph lauren reflected that lord b had real class and he was right it was high time men were men again very interesting tony he said wed like to kick the idea around you in new york for a few days yes said tony showing it to other people of course well get back to you as soon as possible outside it had rained the trees had taken on a deeper greenness the city had the warm wet smell of a conservatory park avenue was a solid yellow mass of honking taxis quivering with the excitement of wheelerdealing tony knew he ought to ring ronnie and show him the treatment let him sweat he thought let cameron sweat he went back to the waldorf checked out and without leaving a forwarding address flew to los angeles cameron lived in an eleventhfloor apartment on riverside drive with a glorious view of the hudson river she got home at about nine after a hellish day punctuated with screaming matches which had finally culminated in bella wakefield turning up on the set wearing twoinch false eyelashes and half a ton of purple eyeshadow to play a victorian governess when cameron had ordered her to take her makeup down bella had stormed out presumably to sob on the vicepresidents already sodden shoulder the moment she got in cameron played back her recording machine but there was no message from tony not even a click to show hed rung and hung up because she wasnt there he hadnt left any messages at nbs either cameron however had done her homework as tony had learnt from ronnie that she was brilliant but unbalanced she in turn had discovered that tony was an unprincipled shit much more interested in making money than good programmes masterly at boardroom intrigue and so smooth he could slide up a hill convinced she could handle him cameron wasnt at all put out by this information and decided to accept the job shed always wanted to work in england and track down her english relations she admired british television and shed bitterly envied all those rich girls at barnard whod travelled to europe so effortlessly on daddys income it would also give her a chance to get away from her mother and her mothers appalling lover mike cameron gave a shudder she had recurrent nightmares about mike she turned on the light she would be sad to leave her apartment which was painted white throughout with yellow curtains and rush matting on the polished floors furniture in the livingroom included a grand piano a dentists chair upholstered in red paisley like tonys tie a dartboard and a gold toe one foot high which had been surreptitiously chipped from the foot of a cherub in the metropolitan museum books lined most of one wall but half a shelf was taken up with videos of the programmes shed made these were her identity cameron only felt she truly existed when she saw her credits coming up on the screen and now this english lord had come along and thrown her into complete turmoil because he hadnt called denied a father in her teens cameron was always drawn to older men she was attracted by tonys utter ruthlessness and despite her sniping sexually it had ended up a great night then why didnt the bastard call lord of the never rings collapsing on the sofa she gazed out of the window on the opposite bank lights from the factories and power stations sent glittering yellow snakes across the black water watching the coloured dinky cars whizzing up and down the freeway she fell asleep when she woke next morning very cold and stiff the hudson had turned to a sheet of white metal with the power stations smoking dreamily in the morning mist perhaps tony had only offered her a job as a ruse to get her into bed but she didnt think he was like that if hed just wanted to screw her hed have said so yet when she rang the waldorf to accept she was outraged to be told that tony had checked out leaving no forwarding address this guys mighty popular said the operator everyones been ringing him nor would coriniums new york office tell her where tony had gone and even worse the morning paper had a charming picture of him coming out of the four seasons with ali macgraw in los angeles when he wasnt spreading the word about four men went to mow or finalizing the deal to buy the american distributors which hed had to acquire through a holding company so as not to upset the iba tony thought about cameron back in new york two days later ignoring the increasingly desperate messages from nbs he went to usbc and after screwing another quarter million dollars a programme out of them on the grounds that disney were madly interested he closed the deal he returned to the waldorf sweating like a pig had a shower poured himself an enormous whisky and rang cameron he had to hold the telephone at arms length where the fuck have you been you bastard she screamed busy said tony and when she started to give him an earful very sharply told her to shut up and calm down ive raised the cash for four men went to mow who put it up demanded cameron usbc the lawyers are thrashing out the nuts and bolts at the moment poor ronnie nbs arent going to be very happy we didnt even get to see it well there you go he probably will right out of the front door and never come back after this ronnies right you are a shit thats no way to address your new boss camerons heart was hammering so hard her palms were suddenly so damp that the receiver nearly slid out of her hand hullo hullo said tony have you thought about that job i offered you you just fuck off like that how do i know i can trust you give me the address ill be over in half an hour and well talk terms yet when he arrived at camerons flat armed with a bottle of champagne he was outraged to find an impossibly handsome young man lounging in the dentists chair holding a glass that definitely didnt contain mouthwash who the hells he snarled tony this is skip my lawyer he dropped by to draw up my contract of employment said cameron why the hells he wearing my shirt and tie cameron laughed since im moving to england i figured he deserved a leaving present on a cold friday in february exactly twenty months after hed signed up cameron cook in new york tony baddingham made an infinitely more dramatic and controversial addition to his staff having exchanged contracts in the utmost secrecy in the morning he popped into the iba headquarters in brompton road for a midday glass of sherry with the new chairman lady gosling to dazzle her with the secret news of his latest acquisition before setting out on the twohour drive down to cotchester even on a raw blustery february afternoon cotchesters wide streets and ancient pale gold houses gave off an air of serenity and prosperity to the north of the town in the market square a statue of charles i on his horse indicated that cotchester had once been a royalist stronghold round the plinth pigeons pecked among the straw left by the sheep and cattle sold in the market earlier in the day to the south soared the cathedral its great bell only muted during rush hour the shadow of its spire on bright days lying like a benediction over the town dominating the high street was a fine queen anne building once the corn exchange now the headquarters of corinium television although over the last twenty years the building had been considerably extended at the back to include studios dressingrooms an imposing new board room and a suite of splendid offices for the directors nothing except paleyellow rambler roses had been allowed to alter its imposing façade on the roof the vast dark red letters ctv could be seen for miles around letters topped by a splendid ram standing foursquare with a roman nose and curly horns originally chosen as a symbol of the wool trade which once characterized the area according to some of coriniums more uncharitable employees the ram could now be used to symbolize tony baddinghams sexual excesses at the back of the building an entire wall of the board room consisted of a huge window looking out on to the cathedral close water meadows and willows trailing their yellow branches in the river fleet a peaceful scene totally at variance with the tensions and feuds within corinium television itself these tensions had been exacerbated that particular friday by tony returning unexpectedly from london and calling a programmeplanning meeting at three oclock when he knew most of his staff would be hoping to slope off early tony had actually returned in an excellent mood his meeting with lady gosling had been decidedly satisfactory simon harris the exbbc golden boy and cameron cook had so improved corinium programmes over the last twenty months that he was no longer seriously worried that his franchise would be taken away in midterm but in case there were rival groups who might pitch for the corinium franchise when it came up for renewal next year he had made the decision on the way down to clean up coriniums act well in advance until that time therefore until corinium were officially reselected he was determined not only to trail some of the most glittering names in television and the arts in front of the iba but also to put on some really worthy regional programmes it was to map out ideas for these programmes that hed called the impromptu meeting unfortunately half the staff were away the head of news was in munich on a freebie the head of documentaries was in rome getting a prize the male head of light entertainment and the comely female head of kids programmes were both away with gastric flu which caused a few raised eyebrows as they had been seen looking perfectly healthy the day before tony took the chair but was instantly summoned to take an urgent call from los angeles the only people in the room who didnt appear terrified or at least extremely wary of him were charles fairburn head of religious programmes whod got pissed at lunchtime and cameron cook now head of drama the head of sport mike meadows a oncefamous footballer with ginger sideboards whose musclebound shoulders had grown too big for his shiny blue blazer smoked one cigarette after another simon harris the controller of programmes who was principled and intelligent and always saw both sides of every problem and was therefore labelled indecisive trembled on tonys right he kept his hands under the table to hide a nerve rash he had scratched raw his thin face twitched in an attempt to gain some kind of authority he had recently grown a straggly beard when he took off his coat tony always kept the central heating tropical you could hear the rattle of the valium bottle and see the great damp patches under his arms beyond simon was tonys pa cyril peacock dfc coriniums exsales manager once a stocky jolly assertive fellow sensational at his job the point of a pa however is that he should be utterly loyal some chief executives in television buy this loyalty with money which is dangerous because someone else can buy it with more money tony bought it with fear after making cyril his pa and sometime publicity officer tony had encouraged him to invest his savings in a company that promptly went broke now the terror of the luftwaffe was someone tony hung his coat on a poor old dodderer in his early sixties with loss of job and pension hanging over his head like a sword of damocles tony took great pleasure in making cyril do his dirty work he had four people for him to fire on monday on tonys left was miss madden his secretary also in her sixties plain and utterly dedicated whose chilblains were itching because of the central heating and who never let anyone into tonys office without an appointment except cameron cook on whom she had a love hate crush finally down the table opposite cameron sat james vereker the impossibly goodlooking beautifully coiffeured anchorman of the six oclock regional news programme cotswold roundup james should have been in the newsroom getting ready for the evenings programme but hating to miss anything he had muscled in on the meeting and was now using tonys absence to rewrite the links he would have to say later on air to fit his own speech patterns glancing across at cameron james wondered if she and tony had rehearsed the whole meeting in bed earlier this week turning each other on by seeing who could be the most gratuitously bloody to everyone else he looked at camerons darkbrown cashmere jersey snugly fitting the lean body the palebrown suede skirt the charles jourdan boots and the lascivious unmadeup face and felt a wave of loathing today her short hair had been coaxed upwards in gelled spikes like a hedgehog whod rolled in chicken fat james pointedly moved the arrangement of spring flowers left over from wednesdays board meeting up a couple of inches to obscure his view of her and getting out a packet of polos handed one to miss madden who went slightly pink as she accepted it james offered polos to no one else he knew who to suck up to properly courted miss madden would sing his praises to tony and admit him to the inner sanctum when necessary as tony walked back into the room everyone rose from their chairs except cameron who pointedly ignored him perhaps theyve had a bustup thought james vereker hopefully the good thing about tony reflected charles fairburn head of religious programmes was that he did cut out the waffle there was a good chance that charles who was going to the ballet at covent garden that evening would be out of the building by five id like to start said tony briskly by congratulating cameron on being nominated for a bafta award as you all know four men went to mow has not only been a huge network success and sold everywhere overseas but also because of the exceptional camera work attracted scores of tourists to the area and last month toppled howards way in the ratings were looking for more programmes like this that project the area into the network hear hear said cyril peacock his false teeth rattling with nerves tonys conveniently forgotten that four men went to mow was my idea in the first place thought simon harris bitterly cameron still ignoring tony gazed sourly at the framed photograph on the wall of him smilingly assisting princess margaret to plant a cherry tree on the corinium front lawn christ they have had a row thought james id like to give the goahead for a second series tony went on weve got the coproduction money again from usbc but i think it would be a good idea cameron if you introduced perhaps a black unmarried mother into the cottage of the agricultural students to appeal to the iba charles fairburn suppressed a grin the iba were crazy about minority groups cameron looked outraged black unmarried mothers dont become agricultural students she snarled theres always a first time said tony smoothly she could be the girlfriend of one of the four boys for chrissake why not have a gay shepherdess with one leg said cameron why not a deaf unemployed merry peasant suggested charles fairburn with a hiccup or a handicapped harvester thats enough snapped tony he then went on to ok plans for an obscure michael tippett opera which cameron also scowled at detecting lady baddinghams influence tonys wife was crazy about opera and a production of midsummer nights dream as a sop to stratfordonavon which was just within the corinium boundary now it was the turn of james vereker who having finished rewriting his links helped himself to a glass of perrier and then suggested corinium ought to show its caring face tony and do a series on poverty and the aged jesus how turgid said cameron glaring at him through the screen of fading daffodils of all the boring tony raised his hand for silence his huge signet ring catching the light not a bad idea we could do a very cheap pilot to impress the iba we dont have to make the series perhaps cyril he smiled malevolently at his pa could front it hes been looking rather old and povertystricken lately cyril peacock cracked his twitching face trying to smile back thus encouraged james suggested they should do something very strong tony on rioting and drug abuse at cotchester university swiftly cameron swooped the falcon tony had trained tearing into james what a crappy awful idea she screamed dyou want to antagonize the entire tourist board because everyones scared to visit cotchester any more no one will want to invest money here were trying to boost the area for chrissake what about a programme on the role of women in cotchester town hall stammered simon harris tugging at his straggling yellow beard and have the town halls at bath southampton oxford winchester stratford et cetera et cetera in an uproar because we havent done programmes on them said cameron crushingly i thought your idea tony of interviewing the wives of celebrities living in the area looked a winner said cyril peacock desperate to get back into favour behind every famous man cameron turned on cyril furiously that was my idea we could start with one of our directors wives or perhaps cyril lumbered on even lady baddingham tony looked not unpleased i think that would be a bit close to home why not do a series on the very very rich said charles fairburn who had not quite sobered up theyre far more of a minority group than anyone else we could start with you tony he was quelled by an icy glance from tony who aware that the meeting was slightly lacking in carnage suddenly realized that his head of operations whose role was to tell creative people what they could not do was missing wheres victor page he said ominously gone to his grandmothers funeral said miss madden her lips tightening but he killed off two grandmothers during wimbledon last year this was his stepgranny said miss madden his mother married twice no doubt his other stepgrandmother will pop off during next wimbledon said tony making a note on his memo pad that would be five people for cyril to fire on monday tony then turned to the points made during his talk with lady gosling that morning there was no need to let his production staff get complacent several viewers he said have complained about field mice copulating too long on our nature at night programme charles fairburn who had a round red face like a dutch cheese suppressed another smile hed better do his expenses he hadnt been anywhere this week but he needed some cash to buy drinks for his airlinesteward friend at the ballet tonight cloakroom and gratuities wrote charles fairburn drinks with the archdeacon that was pushing it the archdeacon was teetotal but the accounts department didnt know it theyd be shut if tony didnt wrap up this meeting soon on the kids programmes front went on tony weve also had complaints about too much violence in dorothy dove what kind of violence asked simon harris pecking priscilla pigeon and pulling out all her feathers james was tempted to say his children had absolutely adored that particular episode but decided not to the head of kids programmes had rejected his advances at the christmas party he didnt owe her any favours dorothy dove is supposed to be a symbol of peace said tony peaceful is the dove that is strongly armed or beaked in dorothys case murmured charles fairburn and regretted it there have been complaints went on tony nastily about insufficient religious content in our religious programmes ill talk to you after the meeting charles and the iba are very unhappy about rags to riches simon harris turned dark red it was he who had bought the format for rags to riches from america and adapted it for the british network but the ratings are sensational he protested i know but the iba have pointed out that the contestants are far too glamorous and upmarket we do need a few unemployed frumps to add a touch of reality and please remember our ethnic minorities you can borrow my black unmarried mother said cameron shooting tony a venomous look the iba went on tony squinting down the polished table like a daily looking for smears also feel we should have more women on the corinium board after all lady eveshams nearly sixtyfive so we must all wrack our brains for some powerful ladies the men in the room exchanged glances of horror would tony use this as an excuse to put the appalling cameron cook on the board and went on tony swiftly they feel we still havent enough directors who live in the area that thought james savagely also includes cameron and her exquisite regency house on the outskirts of cotchester now tony was saying not without complacency that freddie jones the electronics multimillionaire and rupert campbellblack the minister for sport who both lived in the area would be coming in his party to the west cotchester hunt ball that evening and he would be sounding them out as possible directors for a second outrage overcame the head of sports terror of tony but rupert campbellblacks been consistently vile about our coverage he spluttered youd think it was our fault cotchester was bottom of the third division good name on the writing paper weve got to keep our local mps sweet with the franchise coming up said tony anyway hes far too tied up with football hooligans to come to more than a couple of meetings a year so he wont get a chance to make a nuisance of himself dont you be too sure of it spat cameron macho pig smug in the knowledge that he was the only member of the staff whod been asked to join tonys party at the hunt ball that evening james vereker couldnt resist saying as the meeting broke up how much he and lizzie his wife were looking foward to it and what time would tony like them for drinks about eight said tony gathering up his papers james could feel the laser beams of loathing and jealousy directed at him from all around the table particularly from cameron that should rattle the stuckup bitch he thought since shed been nominated for a bafta shed been getting much too big for her charles jourdan boots as tony went out of the room straightening the photograph of himself and princess margaret as he passed james glanced at his watch fourthirty he was on the air in an hour and a half and they would wrap up the programme by seven if he had to drive the eleven miles home bath and change hed be pushed for time hed better have a quick shower and blow dry his hair beforehand then he could legitimately keep his makeup on just bronzing gel a bit of creme puff and dark brown mascara for the ball one got so pale in february he considered whether to wear his turquoise evening shirt which brought out the bluegreen in his eyes or a white one with a turquoise bowtie then decided on the former the gel might show up on the white shirt wandering into the newsroom he selected the secretary who was most in love with him and handed her twenty pages of longhand entitled poverty and the aged a treatment by james vereker i think youll have rather fun with this one he told her could you centre the title in caps i dont need it till first thing monday morning entirely sobered up now charles fairburn followed tony into his office hed never get to covent garden and his airline steward now but to his amazement tony greeted him warmly ratings arent bad charles wheel in the bishop of cotchester a few sikhs and a woman priest next week to talk about the meaning of selfdenial and lent that should keep lady gosling happy look im reading the lesson in church on sunday rather tricky phrasing i want to get the sense right could you just run through it with me james vereker drove home in his porsche warmly aware that my programme as he always referred to it had gone well james verekers outstanding qualities apart from his dazzling good looks were his total egotism and chronic insecurity in order not to miss himself on television he had even been known to take a portable television into a restaurant a huge local celebrity much of whose time was spent opening fêtes and pas legs he disliked going to london or even worse abroad because no one recognized him when hed worked in radio he used to dread some crisis blowing up in southern europe or the middle east in case he couldnt pronounce it aware that he was dismissed as a popinjay by the editors journalists and researchers who got cotswold roundup on air and who were jealous of his inflated salary and his celebrity status he was given to little tantrums yet couldnt resist seeking constant reassurance cameron cook had even suggested the parrot used in coriniums christmas production of treasure island should be given a permanent squawkon part telling james he was wonderful after every programme he kept his job because he was quite good at it and because he always won the fight for viewers from the bbc back at jamess house birgitta the childrens curvaceous nanny had just lovingly finished ironing both jamess white and turquoise evening shirts and was scenting herself and putting on makeup for jamess return i wish birgitta would spend slightly more time putting the children to bed thought jamess wife lizzie as they swarmed into her study demanding attention lizzie had had two novels published and well reviewed a third was on the way but it was causing a great deal of morning sickness she and james had been married eight years and lizzie had supported james on her publishing salary in the early days when he was trying to break into television once very pretty she had the bright eyes and long questing nose of a vole and the shaggy light brown hair of a clematis montana clambering over an old apple tree in winter she had recently put on too much weight the verekers lived in a large messy house with a large messy garden two miles down the valley from rupert campbellblack where the frogsmore stream hurtled into a large reedfringed lake they had bought lake house as it was called five years ago just after james had got the job at corinium when it had seemed ridiculously cheap viewing it in high summer they had only seen its romantic aspect not realizing that for at least five months of the year it was so low in the valley that it never saw the sun and would be quite inaccessible when the snows came in winter this mattered little to james because he spent so much time at corinium when the house got snowed up he simply didnt come home for several days but it was not good for lizzie who wrote there all day eating too many biscuits to keep out the cold or for the children who caught one cold after another or for the nannies who found it dank and depressing except when james was at home for lizzie life turned on the children not getting ill and nannies not leaving so that she had time to write unfortunately james couldnt resist pulling the prettier nannies who invariably walked out when he moved on to someone else lizzie always found out the score by reading the nannies diaries when they were shopping in cotchester or nearby stroud birgitta the current nanny wrote her diary in swedish which lizzie couldnt understand but with the aid of a swedish dictionary she was beginning to crack the code and the word james appeared rather too often in fact you only had to see the way birgitta perked up when james came through the door lizzie was used to his infidelity she realized he needed little adventures to boost his ego but they still upset her she would have liked an admirer herself but felt she was too fat to attract anyone lizzie nearly had a fit when she heard james banging the front door shed stopped writing far too late wrestling to get at least a draft of the first chapter down on paper still struggling mentally with her plot shed spent too long washing her hair and in the bath then she discovered that the long lowcut black silk ball dress which shed decided to wear was far too tight not even shoe horns or the disdainful tugging of birgitta could get her into it so she had to wear another dress dark red velvet to match her distraught face and calflength so it wouldnt conceal her ankles which had swelled up in the bath finally because she couldnt see out shed cut her fringe with the kitchen scissors not realizing that birgitta had just used them to cut rind off the childrens bacon so now her fringe stuck together and reeked of bacon she was about to wash it again when james arrived he hadnt been home so early in months usually he hung around the corinium bar mopping up adulation have a bath darling shouted lizzie desperately trying to tone down her face with green foundation i had a shower at the studios said james so ive only got to change we ought to leave in five minutes how did you think my programme went wonderful lied lizzie who hadnt watched it starting to panic as it was dark outside she couldnt even make up in the car ill read you an extra story tomorrow darlings she told the children as they clung whining to her on the landing or perhaps birgitta she raised her voice hopefully will read you one before you go to bed but birgitta was watching james who had decided on the white shirt after all putting a pink carnation in his buttonhole poor mr vereker she thought looking so handsome in his dinner jacket going out with such a frump how much better would she birgitta be in lizzies place james however hardly noticed his wifes appearance his was the one that mattered you look absolutely lovely james said lizzie dutifully low sepia clouds obscured the moon as the headlamps lit up grey stone walls acid green tree trunks and long blonde grasses lizzie tried abortively to apply eye liner as james described every little triumph of the planning meeting and his programme afterwards anyone interesting in our party tonight asked lizzie as he paused for breath rupert campbellblack beattie johnson his mistress freddie jones whos he dont you ever read the papers said james appalled mr electronics oh god sighed lizzie to herself i darent ask what electronics are and i bet im sitting next to him at dinner and paul stratton and his new wife oooh squeaked lizzie thats exciting three years ago just after the conservatives won the last election paul stratton the tory mp for cotchester and the very upright minister for home affairs with a special brief to investigate sex education in schools had rocked his constituency and the entire nation by walking out on winifred his solid dependable boot of a wife and running off with his secretary half his age not that his constituents were prudish having rupert campbellblack in the next door constituency they were used to the erotic junketing of mps but as paul stratton had not only used his political career to feather his nest financially but also set himself up as a pillar of respectability and uxoriousness constantly inveighing against pornography homosexuality easier divorce and the general laxity of the nations morals they had found it hard to stomach his hypocrisy evidently theyve bought a place in chalford said james and paul and sarah i think shes called are planning to spend weekends down here reestablishing themselves with the local community i suppose tony inviting them this evening heralds the official return of the prodigal son said lizzie i wonder if shes as beautiful as her photographs i bet rupert makes a pass at her hes always enjoyed bugging paul dont be fatuous theyre only just back from their honeymoon snapped james steering round a sharp bend and bringing the conversation neatly back to himself ive got a gut feeling tonight is going to mark a turningpoint in my career he said importantly tonys been exceptionally nice to me recently and when i popped into maddens office later this evening to find out exactly who was in the party there was a confidential memo on tonys desk about the autumn schedules which i managed to read upsidedown it appears corinium are committed to a series of prime time interviews for the network i didnt dare read any more in case madden got suspicious but i suspect tonys got me in mind and thats why hes asked us this evening tony baddingham soaked in a boiling florisscented bath admiring his flat stomach for once the cordless telephone was mute giving him the chance to savour the prospect of the evening ahead one of the joys of becoming hugely successful was that it gave you the opportunity to patronize those who in the past had patronized you paul stratton for example it was going to be so amusing tonight extending the hand of friendship to paul and his bimbo wife how grateful and subservient theyd be then there was rupert tony was not given to fantasy but more than anything else in the world he longed to be in a position when an abject penitent penniless rupert whod somehow lost all his looks was seeking tonys favour and friendship the only reason tony really wanted rupert on his board was in order to dazzle him with his brilliant business acumen in wilder fantasy tony dreamt of flaunting an undeniably sexy mistress who would be impervious to ruperts charms cant you bloody understand he imagined cameron screaming at rupert that tonys the only man therell ever be in my life tony added more boiling water to his bath to steel himself against the arctic climate of the rest of the house there was a running battle between tony who liked the heat and whose office according to charles fairburn provided an excellent dress rehearsal both physically and mentally for hell fires and monica his wife who regarded central heating as a wanton extravagance which ate into ones capital i still feel dreadfully guilty not telling winifred about paul and sarah coming tonight said monica when later fully dressed tony went into his wifes bedroom and found her sitting at her dressing table vigorously brushing her short fair hair she was wearing the same emeraldgreen taffeta shed worn for the last four hunt balls which went beautifully with tonys diamonds but did nothing to play down the red veins that mapped her cheeks as a result of gardening and striding large labradors across the gloucestershire valleys in all weathers yet in a way her rather masculine beauty splendid on the prow of a ship or as a model for a victorian bust of duty needed no enhancement monica had once been head girl of her boarding school and had remained so all her life winifred stratton pauls exwife had been her senior prefect together they had run the school firmly and wisely diverting the headmistresss attention away from a plume of cigarette smoke rising from the shrubbery but gently reproaching the errant smoker afterwards all the lower fourths had had crushes on monica sometimes even today unheard by tony who slept in a separate room she cried dont talk in the passage in her sleep known locally as monica of the glen because of her noble appearance and total lack of humour she was the only woman to whom tony was always polite and also a little afraid in the icy highceilinged bedroom opera and gardening books crowded the tables on either side of the ancient crimsoncurtained fourposter which tony visited perhaps once a week but even after eighteen years of marriage these visits gave him an incredible sexual frisson on the chest of drawers which contained no new clothes were silverframed photographs of their three children with her sense of fairness monica would never let the other two know that she loved her elder son archie sixteen last week the best nor that she loved her two yellow labradors and her great passions opera and gardening often a great deal more than her husband running tonys life with effortful efficiency she never had enough time for these two passions but if she was disappointed by the hand life had dealt her she never showed it she was not looking forward to this evening which would involve talking until three oclock in the morning to all those people tony considered so important but she would treat them with the same impersonal kindness whether they were lordslieutenant or electronics millionaires always anxious to help humanity collectively she did a huge amount for charity monica was not interested in people individually or what made them tick or leap into bed with one another but she was worried about winifred even after shed married tony and winifred had married the much more brilliant handsome and ambitious paul stratton they had remained friends and gone to the opera and old school reunions together when paul had run off with his secretary in a scandal that rocked gloucestershire almost as much as helen campbellblack walking out on rupert winifred had been utterly devastated but like a building sapped by dry rot one couldnt initially see the damage from outside after winifred had moved to spain with her two daughters in a desperate attempt to rebuild her life monica missed her friendship desperately and now to crown it tony had asked paul and sarah to join the party tonight and she monica was expected to smooth over sarahs first public outing in gloucestershire i just feel its revoltingly disloyal to winifred repeated monica she had applied ponds vanishing cream and face powder and a dash of brightred lipstick which was the extent of her daytime makeup and was now adding her night makeup brown block mascara put on with a little brush i swore to winifred id never have that little tramp monica spat on her mascara over the threshold tonys brows drew together like two black caterpillars paul is still our local mp even if he has been booted out of the cabinet he said patiently with the franchise coming up next year i have to entertain whatever wife he chooses at least i waited until after they were married as tony moved forward to do up the clasp of her diamond necklace monica caught sight of her husbands reflection the red tailcoat with dovegrey facings made him look taller and thinner and gave a distinction to his somewhat heavy good looks but monica hardly noticed i still ought to telephone winifred and tell her shes in spain let it rest id better go down theyll be here in a minute monica glanced at her diamond watch lohengrin was about to start on radio if only she could stay at home and listen to it she thought wistfully as she slotted a threehour blank tape into her radio cassette and pressed the record button she called after tony can you tell victor to up the proportion of orange juice in the bucks fizz we dont want everyone arriving at the town hall plastered like last year an hour later downstairs in the huge dark panelled drawingroom hung with tapestries members of the party were beginning to unthaw and retreat from the fierce red glow of the beech logs smouldering and crackling in the vast fireplace lizzie vereker sustained by at least six glasses of bucks fizz had perked up and forgotten her extra pounds and her straining red dress neither rupert nor beattie johnson had arrived yet but there was plenty to gaze at paul strattons new wife for example was absolutely gorgeous she had entered the room looking little girlish and apprehensive eyes cast down clinging to pauls arm and hardly speaking she was wearing a yellow silk dress which matched her thick piledup gold hair and a beautiful tobaccobrown fringed silk shawl covering her shoulders and wound high round her neck after replying in shy monosyllables to tony and monicas questions she had allowed herself to be introduced to james and also to tonys youngest brother bas who was a terrific rake with black patentleather hair a smooth olive complexion and a very overdeveloped little finger from twisting women round it now a small smile was beginning to play around sarahs full coral lips at bass extravagant compliments and the shawl was beginning to slip to reveal the most voluptuous golden shoulders and bosom she and paul must have been somewhere hot for their honeymoon decided lizzie paul didnt seem to have reaped the same benefit his dark hair which hed once brushed straight back had gone silver grey and been coaxed forward almost to his eyebrows and in little commas over his very pink ears sarah being young had obviously encouraged him into a paisley bowtie and a wing collar the points of which kept being bent over by a new double chin his once hard angular face seemed to have softened and weakened he still however had the same allembracing smile that passed over you like a lighthouse beam and still liked the sound of his own voice he was now talking to freddie jones the electronics multimillionaire three million unemployed he boomed is a mickey mouse figure didnt you see that article about that factory manager who was offering people two hundred and twenty pounds a week merely to stuff mattresses and simply couldnt get staff the working classes just dont want to work theyre shored up by moonlighting and the great feather bed of the welfare state paul made the mistake of thinking that someone with such capitalist instincts would automatically vote tory freddie jones listened to him carefully but didnt say anything he was plump and jolly with rumpled redgold curls round merry greyblue eyes a snub nose and an air that life was a tremendous adventure lizzie thought he looked much more fun than anyone else across the room she noticed james had broken swiftly away from sarah stratton and was now talking to a very slim woman with dimples and short brown curls tied up by a blue bow she was wearing a paleblue midi dress with a full skirt and a top of which the satin lining was the strapless bodice and the gauze over it covered her arms down to her wrists and her shoulders and tied in a pussycat bow at the neck it was the most ghastly dress lizzie had ever seen but the woman who lizzie deduced must be freddie joness wife seemed frightfully pleased with herself and was laughing away rolling her eyes and gazing up at jamess beautiful bronzed face with excessive admiration apart from sarah stratton lizzie decided hazily the men looked much more glamorous than the women this evening gaudy peacocks in their different tail coats red with greyblue facings for the west cotchester hunt red with crimson for the neighbouring gatherham hunt dark blue with buff for the beaufort if he hadnt been so goodlooking james in a dinner jacket would have been outclassed helping herself to another bucks fizz lizzie wandered somewhat unsteadily over to the seating plan for dinner at the town hall she was sitting next to freddie jones james was on monica baddinghams right maybe his predictions about his brilliant future were about to come true laughing uproariously two handsome young bloods in red coats now rushed up and started marking the seating plan with red asterisks what are you doing asked lizzie singling out the worst gropers said one were starting with bas baddingham and rupert campbellblack better put one beside my husband said lizzie whos he james vereker we were just about to they all collapsed with laughter have some more fizz yelled monica baddingham in her raucous voice arriving with a jug which contained almost straight orange juice now i cant think whats happened to rupert well have to leave in a sec or well be late for dinner she drifted off do we dare put an asterisk by tonys name said one of the young bloods of course said the other seizing the pentel giggling lizzie glanced across the room to see james beckoning imperiously hes had enough of mrs jones so he wants to palm her off on me and press the flesh thought lizzie ignoring james she turned back to the seating plan next minute james had crossed the room and seized her wrist may i borrow her he asked coldly of course said the young bloods as long as you bring her straight back james dragged lizzie away do pay attention when i signal i was having a nice time this is work hissed james i want you to meet valerie jones shes opening a boutique in cotchester next month you must go and buy something never never thought lizzie sulkily if she sells dresses like that blue thing shes wearing lizzie writes novels james told valerie jones as if to explain his wifes scruffy appearance id laike to wraite novels if i had the taime said valerie jones in an incredibly elocuted voice but aym so busy with the boutique and the kids and moving in and we do have to entertain a lot people are always saying you should wraite a book mrs jones youve had such a fascinating laife she screwed her face up in what she obviously thought was a fascinating smile close up lizzie noticed that valerie jones had very clean nails perfectly shaved armpits and the very white eyeballs of the nonreader and nondrinker she was tiny and very pretty in a dolllike way but lizzie suddenly understood the expression blue with cold valeries chinablue eyes were the coldest shed ever seen the pink and white skin also concealed the rhinoceros hide of the relentless social climber ill leave you girls to get acquainted said james better have a word with paul stratton or hell think im avoiding him we must have a dance later he added admiringly to valerie i bet youre as light as thistledown seven stone on the scales this morning simpered valerie and sixandahalf of thats ego thought lizzie where dyou live she asked at whychey said valerie quite near us said lizzie were at penscombe but valerie wasnt remotely interested in where lizzie lived and only quarter of an hour from the boutique so ay can rush down there if theres any craysis or a special client comes in they always ask for me valerie put her head on one side ay dont know why ay think ay tell people the truth ay mean what is the point of selling somebody a gown that doesnt suit them its such a bad advertisement for the boutique which house in whychey asked lizzie oh its lovely elizabethan said valerie we had to do an awful lot though ripping out all that horrid dark panelling lizzie winced and of course weve completely relandscaped the garden but itll be a year or two before green lawns is the paradise we want lizzie looked puzzled the only elizabethan house i know in whychey is bottom hollow court we changed the name said valerie we thought green lawns sounded prettier where did you live before cheam said valerie with the flourish of one saying windsor castle we never thought wed find anywhere as perfect as cheam all our help broke down and crayed when we left but gloucestershire has so much to offer at that moment monica came up i was just saying monica that gloucestershire has so much to offer particularly valerie raised her untouched glass on a gracious evening like tonight not if we dont get any grub said monica briskly weve decided not to wait for rupert do either of you need a loo outside it had turned bitterly cold valerie came out of the house smothered in an almost floorlength mink i hope hounds get her thought lizzie savagely as she watched freddie open the door and settle valerie in before going round to the driving seat isnt she a poppet said james knew so much about my programme sarah stratton asked lizzie no valerie jones i do hope freddie joins the board we could do with a few caring wives like valerie at corinium lizzie was dumbfounded was james such a dreadful judge of character what did you think of sarah stratton she asked not a lot didnt even know who i was youd have thought paul would have briefed her off they set in convoy cars with silver foxes on the bonnet skidding all over the road rattling the cattle grids lighting up the last grey curls of the travellers joy and the last red beech leaves flakes of snow were drifting down as they arrived at cotchester town hall its already fetlockdeep in stow bellowed a woman whod just driven up with a white windscreen but of course youre a coat warmer down here cotchester town hall a splendid baroque edifice two hundred yards down on the other side of the high street from corinium television had been built in to replace the old assembly rooms the huge diningrooms on either side of the ballroom were filled with tables packed with laughing chattering people but in a noisy glamorous gathering easily the most glamorous scrutinized table belonged to corinium television the krug was circulating tony was always generous when the evening was deductible and dinner was now well underway but rupert and beattie johnson still hadnt turned up and sarah stratton who should have been on ruperts right and tony who should have had beattie on his left were trying to hide their irritation and disappointment lizzie vereker however was having a lovely time sitting next to freddie jones totally unpompous instinctively courteous noisily sucking up his bortsch rattling off remarks in a broad cockney accent at a speed which must tax the most accomplished shorthand typist he was also despite a scarlet cummerbund strained double by his wide girth curiously attractive i dont know anything about electronics confessed lizzie taking a belt of krug but i know youre very good at them james says youre one of the most powerful men in england my wife doesnt fink so said freddie its a fallacy women are attracted to power no ones fallen in love wiv me for years id like to be tall like your usband but i got my height from my muvver and my shoulders from my dad and the rest ad to go somewhere he roared with laughter at the head of the table monica listened politely to james vereker talking about his programme and his ideas for other programmes and surreptitiously gazed at sarah stratton her tobaccobrown shawl had slid right off her golden shoulders now her piledup blonde hair emphasized her long slender neck the seat beside her which should have been ruperts had now been taken by bas tonys wicked brother who was chatting her up like mad shes so beautiful thought monica what chance could poor winifred have stood she felt jolted and uneasy she wished she were at home reading gardening books and listening to lohengrin valerie jones had one aim in life to rise socially she had therefore done her homework knowing james was coming this evening she had watched his programme all week so she could comment on every item she was now sitting next to paul stratton whose recent speech in the house on the proposed cotchester bypass she had learnt almost by heart but paul was less flattered by her obvious homework than james he like monica was surreptitiously watching his wife flirting with bas and experiencing a tightness round his heart a jealousy never felt when he was married to winifred lizzies and freddies conversation had noisily progressed to hunting it was rupert who got me going said freddie put me up on a really quiet orse last march i was cubbing by august and huntin by november werent you terrified asked lizzie in awe i needed three ports and lemons to get me on to the orse for the opening meet i can tell you but i reckoned if i fell orf id bounce anyway he roared with laughter again im going to take up shootin next huge oval silver plates of roast beef were now coming round hows rupert getting on with beattie johnson asked lizzie helping herself freddie shrugged not very well she keeps earing wedding bells and we all know rupes tonedeaf he said the other day he fort the relationship would last till cheltenham lizzie giggled what a typically rupert remark has she finished ghosting his memoirs yet probably providing material for the last chapter at the moment said freddie digging a serving spoon into a creamy mass of potato dauphinoise he gave a big helping to lizzie and was just helping himself when valerie called sharply down the table no tatties fredfred its friday said freddie the cockney accent wheedling as the spoon edged towards his plate no tatties i said valeries voice was pure steel freddie put back the potatoes looking across at lizzie sarah stratton gave her a ghost of a wink you can have my roll fredfred she said lobbing it across the table to him valerie opened her rosebud mouth and shut it again she knew one must behave like a lady at all times and not brawl with ones hubby in public then she suddenly noticed that james whod ground to a halt with monica was looking very put out whats your programme about on monday valerie asked him across the table paul stratton on monicas left seized his opportunity turning to her he said in a low voice its awfully good of you to take sarah under your wing this evening i know how close you were to winifred monica almost choked on her roast beef she didnt want to talk about winifred it meant so much to sarah went on paul she was so worried about coming tonight she doesnt look worried now thought monica watching sarah laughing up at bas i felt guilty at the time said paul rather heartily but we are all sinners are we not what happened to sarah and me was part of a loving relationship all sides behaved with dignity i feel i can now walk down cotchester high street with my head held high do you indeed thought monica furiously but one cant destroy something thats lasted twentyfive years overnight said paul spearing a piece of yorkshire pudding i still miss win and the girls particularly when i see old friends like you and tony he wants my sympathy thought monica incredulously hes utterly destroyed my best friend and he wants me to feel sorry for him do you correspond with win asked paul fortunately deliverance appeared in the form of one of the hall porters who whispered a message in monicas ear thank you so much she said and banging the table with her spoon yelled down to tony at the other end that was a message from rupert he cant make it after all something urgent has come up probably ruperts cock said lizzie idly earning herself a thunderous look of disapproval from james pity said sarah lightly i was looking forward to meeting him therell be other occasions said bas leaning back as a waitress removed his plate tony for a minute was unable to disguise his rage of all the fucking bad manners he exploded ruperts defection put a considerable dampener on the evening it was not until the syllabub had been handed round in tall glasses that bas baddingham who was among other things a partner in a local estate agents made an attempt to lighten the atmosphere has anyone else heard a rumour that declan oharas bought penscombe priory he asked for a second there was a stunned silence then all the women acted with the frantic excitement of dogs when their leads are rattled im going on a crash diet tomorrow squeaked lizzie dropping her spoon with a clatter oh why didnt we buy a house in penscombe rather than chalford wailed sarah stratton how much did he pay for it asked valerie jones half a million said bas there was a long pause as everyone did frantic sums to work out how much that now made their houses worth thats an awful lot grumbled valerie but its such a romantic house sighed lizzie and that lovely wild garden hellishly cold shuddered james and faces north said valerie so does declan ohara said sarah dreamily earning herself a sharp look from paul rather a lot to pay for a weekend retreat said james looking put out to hell with impressing rupert with the secret hed been hugging to himself all day thought tony he had a good enough audience as it was and it was too late for any of them to leak the story to the press tonight declans going to live here said tony looking slowly down the table hes joining corinium in september there was a gasp of excitement followed by another stunned silence troublesome tetchy but monumentally talented declan ohara was simply the bbcs hottest property his weekly interviews with the great and very famous went out at prime time and were avidly watched and discussed by the entire nation nothing like the normal chat show host he indulged in no back slapping nor drinking in the green room nor bandying round of christian names before a programme nor did he bounce around on long pastel sofas cosily exchanging confidences his victims sat facing him and once on air like a jesuit priest he really listened to them relentlessly probing with the most devastating questions and waiting so unbearably long for an answer that they invariably stumbled into a confession to the intense disappointment of his armies of female fans the camera was constantly trained on the person he was interviewing rather than on declan himself poor james thought lizzie oh poor poor james that must be the series of networked interviews scheduled for the autumn how the hell did you persuade declan asked bas hes fed up with the beeb said tony the last straw was axing his interview with paisley people who saw the video said it was absolute carnage they didnt think paisley would go the fifteen rounds then they hacked great contentious chunks out of his interview with reagan he wants to go out live so this kind of thing cant happen he will when he joins us youll never get people like reagan coming down to cotchester said paul stratton you will for declan said freddie the bbc must be as sick as a parrot theyre not pleased tony was purring like a great leopard now but its not exactly our job to please the beeb clicking their tongues the waitresses removed the untouched syllabubs declans a bit of a pinko said paul disapprovingly thats putting it mildly said tony but as it looks as though the socialists will be in power next year unless you lot get your act together we cant afford to be too right wing any more trying for jamess sake to curb her excitement lizzie turned to monica have you met him they came to lunch said monica declan seems a super chap sarah and lizzie caught each others eyes again and giggled at such a totally inadequate description a bit remote monica went on probably shy his wife is charming beautiful asked lizzie oh yes exceptional pity sighed sarah earning another scowl from paul and three utterly ravishing children said monica a boy of twenty at trinity dublin and two teenage girls about seventeen and fourteen with rupert living just across the valley said lizzie shaking her shaggy head declan must be barking hell have to lock his wife and both daughters up in chastity belts the youngest kiddy will make a friend for sharon although sharon made a lot of friends at pony club camp i must get them together when the oharas move in said valerie catching sarahs eye yet again lizzie decided sarah was definitely going to be a mate a group of young waitresses from other tables were now hovering wondering if it were the right moment to ask james vereker for his autograph tony was also looking at james and experiencing a glow of pure pleasure coriniums most popular presenter was feeling all the pique and disquiet of a big fish whos been basking for years in a rock pool then suddenly sees the fin of a shark coming over the horizon jamess exquisitely straight nose would be frightfully put out of joint by declans arrival james tony decided had been getting a shade above himself recently there was nothing tony loved more than cutting people down to size as liqueurs and cigars came round tony moved down the table beside freddie jones now rupert had stood him up so summarily he was even keener to get freddie on to the board with satellite television in the offing freddies millions and electronic expertise would be invaluable when declan arrives well get him to interview you said tony valerie also changed places and sat next to monica what a lovely meal lady anthony she said oh please call me monica well thank you monica said valerie gratified you may if you like call me mousie thats fredfreds pet name for me i only allow very special friends to become members of the mousie club oblivious of monicas look of amazement and sarahs and lizzies complete hysterics valerie ploughed on i wanted to pick your brains monica about public schools wayne is eleven but hes extra bright so were thinking of winchester or even eton but i just wondered if you and tony had been satisfied with rugborough well archies very happy there said monica her raucous voice softening the only problem if ones got a flat in london is that rugboroughs on the central line and whenever he gets bored archie keeps nipping home on the tube it drives tony demented archies supposed to be doing his olevels our problem said valerie smugly is to stop wayne working not that hes a sissy monica hes really plucky at sport but you know how important qualifications are the band was playing red red wine the brilliantly lit ballroom beckoned the vast springy floor was now filling up with couples like a shaken kaleidoscope the red coats of the men with their flying tails clashed gloriously with the stinging fuchsia pinks and electric blues of the womens dresses i wouldnt mind if tonyd given me an inkling beforehand said james vereker furiously as oblivious for once of the admiring glances of most of the young girls in the room he lugged lizzie round the floor but i looked such a pratt knowing nothing about it and monica actually admitted never watching my programme says she prefers bbc what kind of a chairmans wife is that lizzie let him rabbit on she felt terribly sorry for him but it was such exciting news that declan was moving to corinium and she was fascinated by what was happening on the floor monica was dancing with the lordlieutenant now for someone so mad about opera she had no sense of rhythm gyrating three feet apart they looked like two ostriches on hot bricks red red wine sang the lordlieutenant over and over again which were the only words he knew as the tempo speeded up valerie took the floor with freddie showing off her come dancing skills fishtailing telemarquing reversing correcting freddie sharply whenever he made a mistake freddie his little black shoes twinkling laughed and took it in good part what on earth did you find to say to james verekers wife asked valerie as the band paused for a moment what a mess cant have combed her hair for weeks and that fraightful gown nice lady said freddie firmly i liked her a lot valerie gazed at freddie as uncomprehendingly as lizzie had gazed at james when earlier hed called valerie a poppet and that new wife of paul strattons looks a handful she went on freddie refrained from saying hed love to have his hands full of sarah stratton paul and sarah were dancing together now he was holding her close his hands moving over her flawless gold back as if testing she were real perhaps shed made a special effort to look particularly stunning tonight thought lizzie knowing winifred was such a chum of monicas tony devoted the rest of the evening to wooing freddie but he allowed himself the treat of a dance with sarah she was really gorgeous he decided one could understand exactly why paul let his heart rule his very swollen head and ditched winifred but would he ever hold sarah she had obviously fallen in love with paul because he was powerful and unobtainable now his career had taken a nose dive in the party and hed been sacked from the cabinet he was neither of these things nervous of losing his seat at the next election he kept angling for tony to offer him an executive directorship on the corinium board but paul shouldnt have patronized tony in the past how much more amusing thought tony to employ pauls new wife instead holding her dazzlingly full and exciting body breathing in the scent of her thickly piledup blonde hair trying not to gaze too openly at the beautiful gold breasts tony felt the stirrings of lust if she was any good shed be perfect to present the new late night show that would really put paul in a tizz its terribly exciting about declan said sarah im such a fan those programmes are like rembrandts did you see the one on placido domingo you must come and meet him as soon as they move in said tony youre going to be a distinct asset to gloucestershire suddenly sarah looked terribly young even in the dim light tony could see she was blushing it was angelic of you to ask us tonight knowing what friends you were particularly your wife of winifreds pauls friends havent been exactly friendly they think ive screwed up pauls career tony gave a piratical smile all he needs between his teeth is a cutlass thought sarah youve given paul a castiron excuse not to be prime minister he said hed never have made it he has neither the bottle nor the conviction youre speaking of the man i love said sarah im sorry tony didnt sound it im going to tell james vereker to interview you for our new behind every famous man series sarah smiled showing very small white even teeth youd do better to interview valerie she drives poor fredfred on with a pitchfork probably spent half the day reading etiquette books on the correct way to hold your pitchfork said tony back at the table the waiter poured more krug but tony put a hand over his glass im driving to london after this he said were announcing declans appointment tomorrow so all hells going to break loose the gloucestershire poacher strikes again said lizzie receiving a sharp kick on the ankle from james as everyone swarmed out into the high street after the post horn gallop and auld lang syne they found a thick layer of snow on the pavements down the road high above them the corinium red ram was already wearing a white barristers wig of snow on his curly poll drive carefully tony called monica as percy the chauffeur held open the door of the rolls for her see you tomorrow evening happily she settled back in the grey seat soon shed be home to at least an hour of lohengrin before she fell asleep bet the old rams making a cooks detour via hamilton terrace said james vereker savagely as tony set off for london in the bmw waving goodbye to the last of his guests tony drove towards the motorway but sure enough as soon as hed shaken everyone else off he did a uturn and just as the snow started to fall again belted back to cotchester it was three oclock in the morning but cameron cook was still working on the first story outline for the new series of four men went to mow on monday shed start commissioning writers ones that were talented and bullyable were not easy to find beyond having a shower and brushing her teeth shed made no preparations for tony no satin sheets no black silk negligées no fracas the sharp dry scent he so adored and which he brought her by the bucket sprayed round the room she was wearing the same brown cashmere jersey shed worn to the office earlier tight black trousers and no makeup after twenty months the one thing that held tony was her indifference her refusal to jump to his ringmasters whip perhaps he wouldnt turn up at all to punish her for being so bloody at the meeting but she was so pissed off with him going to the hunt ball without her and even worse inviting that jerk james vereker that shed refused to speak to him after the meeting and stormed off home she mustnt drop her guard like that once tony detected weakness he stuck the knife in all the same her stint in england had been terrifically exciting she remembered so well the july day she had arrived tony had met her at heathrow and driven her straight down to cotchester to the quiet regency terrace to the honeygold house he had bought her it was the only time shed ever known him nervous inside as theyd gone from room to room as finely proportioned and delicately coloured as the eggs of a bird primrose and wedgwood blue lemonyellow and cream pale green and white with large sash windows and pretty alcoves with shelves for china scooped out of the walls cameron hadnt said a word apart from a fully equipped kitchen and a television set in the livingroom there was no furniture except a huge brass fourposter in the upstairs attic which spread across the whole top floor cameron had opened the window and gazed out at her new back yard with its palepink roses and three ancient apple trees at the end someone had just mowed the lawn and as she breathed in the smell of grass cuttings and admired the greygold spire of cotchester cathedral rising from its brightgreen water meadows she burst into tears tony who hadnt touched her until then thinking she hated the house or was feeling homesick moved forward like lightning and took her in his arms darling whats the matter well find something else if you dont like it then cameron sobbed into his prussianblue silk shirt that it was the loveliest house shed ever seen and why didnt they christen the bed and their lovemaking turned out to be even more rapturous than it had been in new york but that was the last time shed displayed weakness in his presence from the moment shed arrived shed had no time to consider whether she was homesick or not when she wasnt producing and masterminding every detail of the thirteen episodes of four men went to mow battling with directors designers actors and technicians who werent at all pleased to have a twentysevenyearold american upstart ordering them around she was furnishing the house driving from southampton to stratford from bath to oxford picking up antiques thoroughly acquainting herself with the cotswold area and seeking new ideas for programmes otherwise her life revolved around tony he managed to spend several evenings a week with her people noticed hed started leaving official dinners and cocktail parties abnormally early he also took her to all the big events in the television calendar edinburgh monte carlo cannes new york new orleans where shed justified her existence a hundred times over selling corinium programmes and acquiring new ones but there was still the married side of tonys life from which she was so ruthlessly excluded she had only been once to his beautiful house the falconry when monica and the children were away and that she was sure was because he wanted to show the place off going into the drawingroom she had exclaimed with pleasure at the renoir over the mantelpiece dont touch it screamed tony or youll have the entire gloucestershire constabulary on the doorstep cameron had only met monica once or twice at office parties or at the odd business reception and occasionally monica sailed into corinium to collect tony the galling thing was she never recognized cameron in one way monicas lack of interest in tonys job made it much easier for him to deceive her in another brooded cameron if you had a rival you wanted her at least to be aware of your existence lady baddingham is a real lady miss madden was fond of saying when she wanted to get under camerons skin cameron liked to think tony only stayed with monica because the silly old bag gave him respectability and he didnt want any scandal before the franchise was renewed getting up from her desk cameron wandered round the livingroom it was the only room in the house shed redecorated papering the walls in scarlet with a tiny bluegrey flower pattern and adding scarlet curtains and a bluegrey carpet sofas and chairs she had acquired a new piano in england lacquered in red but had brought with her from america the dentists chair upholstered in scarlet paisley the dartboard the gold toe from the metropolitan museum and all the videos of her nbs programmes beside them on the shelf were now stacked the thirteen prizewinning episodes of four men went to mow and the two documentaries cameron had also made on all souls college oxford and on anthony trollope whod based barchester on salisbury which was after all within the corinium boundary on the mantelpiece was a signed photograph of the four young actors whod starred in four men went to mow and a huge phallic cactus given to her as an endofshoot present by the entire cast darling cameron said the card which was still propped against it youre spikey but youre great after all the screaming matches it had been a great accolade tony obviously wasnt coming cameron decided shed blown it once and for all the weekend stretched ahead nothing but work until more work on monday for consolation she picked up that weeks copy of broadcast which fell open at a photograph of her cuddling a dopey looking jersey cow producer cameron cook on location during filming of her baftanominated series four men went to mow said the caption the lucky cow is on the left going over to the window cameron realized it was snowing there were already three inches on top of her car and soft white dustsheets had been laid over the houses opposite snow had also filled up the cups of the winter jasmine that jostled with the virginia creeper climbing up the front of her house if you wanted to get to the top you had to jostle reflected cameron tony had hinted he might put her on the board but she knew james vereker simon harris and all the heads of departments would block her appointment to the last ditch she had interfered at all levels criticizing every programme and every script she could lay her hands on she knew she was unpopular with everyone in the building but she didnt want popularity she wanted power and the freedom to make the programmes she wanted without running to tony for protection she was so deep in thought she didnt notice the bmw drawing up nor that tony was outside until he lobbed a snowball against the window she wished he didnt look so revoltingly handsome in that red coat cameron detested hunting not because she felt sorry for the fox but because of the bloodyminded arrogance of people like tony and rupert campbellblack who hunted how was it she asked getting a bottle of champagne from the fridge great immediately her antagonism came flooding back how was rupert she knew her interest would bug tony bastard didnt turn up but bas had heard a rumour that declan had bought the priory so i told everyone he was joining corinium it was ok he added seeing camerons look of horror it was too late for any of them to ring the papers you should have seen jamess face cameron grinned thats an improvement said tony why were you so bloody bootfaced at the meeting i had a migraine they both knew she was lying but excited by dancing with sarah and upsetting james and even more by the prospect of bringing cameron to shuddering gasping submission tony didnt want a row he soon had her undressed and into the huge brass bed now curtained with palegrey silk which he or rather corinium had paid for just as they had paid for the whole house the excuse was that putting up visiting vips in camerons spare room would be cheaper than the cotchester arms which served awful food and had no air conditioning do you do this to keep your mind off your work asked tony later as a naked cameron straddled him in all her angry voracious beauty cameron leaned over and took a gulp of champagne who says it takes my mind off my work ive got an idea what feeling those muscles gripping his cock tony wondered how he ever refused her anything i want to produce declan when he arrives in september leaving cameron at six oclock tony drove up to london hed put on a jersey over his evening shirt and planned to bath shave and breakfast at his flat in rutland gate as he was going up a deserted kensington high street his car was splashed by another some celebrity being raced the opposite way to breakfast television at lime grove lights on in the back as he mugged up his notes red coat over his arm tony let himself into his flat for a second he thought hed been burgled clothes littered the hall bottles glasses and unwashed plates covered the kitchen table then going into monicas bedroom tony discovered the naked figure of his son archie come home once again from rugborough on the tube fast asleep in the arms of an extremely pretty very young girl tonys bellow of rage nearly sent them through the double glazing the girl dived under the flowered sheets archie mumbled that he was terribly sorry but hed thought his parents were at the hunt ball we were snapped tony now im going to have a bath and i want her out of here by the time ive finished at least archie had the manners to take the girl home reflected tony as he soaked for the second time in twelve hours in a boiling bath pretty little thing too hed always been nervous archie might turn out a bit acdc having a very dominant but adoring mother didnt help but he was pleased to see archie following in his fathers footsteps tony was extremely fond of his elder son he was frying eggs and bacon when archie returned very sheepishly having bawled him out for his disgraceful behaviour tony said where the hell does your housemaster think you are in bed i suppose but not whose how old is she sixteen over age thank christ if you ever use mummys bed again ill disinherit you i hope you took precautions we did mumbled archie im really sorry we were going to change the sheets think how upset mummy would have been we dont have to tell her do we archies round face turned pale thinking he would also have some very fast explaining to do if monica discovered he hadnt reached the flat until eight oclock tony agreed that they didnt but dont let it happen again youve bloody well got to pass your olevels you know how important qualifications are now i suppose you expect me to give you breakfast six months later on the wettest august day for fifty years declan ohara moved into penscombe priory to the feverish excitement of the entire county it rained so hard that on cotswold roundup james vereker caringly warned his viewers about flooding on the cotchesterpenscombe road but perhaps being irish reflected lizzie vereker the next morning the rain made declan and his family feel more at home lizzies children had gone out to friends for the day her daily mrs makepiece was due later ortrud the nanny who had replaced birgitta in april was upstairs no doubt writing about james in her diary lizzie had a rare clear day to work but she was halfway through and very bored with her novel outside the downpour had given way to brilliant sunshine and delphiniumblue skies from her study lizzie could see the keys on the sycamore already turning coral and yellow leaves flecking the huge weeping willow which blocked her view of the lake there wouldnt be many more beautiful days this year reflected lizzie overcome by restlessness and curiosity she decided to walk up the valley and drop in on the oharas as a movingin present she would take them some bantams eggs and the bottle of champagne an adoring fan had given james yesterday the trees in the wood that marked the beginning of ruperts land were so blackly bowed down with rain that it was like walking through a dripping tunnel emerging lizzie wandered up the meadows closely cropped by ruperts horses in the opposite direction thundered the frogsmore stream which ran along the bottom of the valley hurtling over mossy stones twisting round fallen logs shrugging off the caress of hanging forgetmenots and pink campion and occasionally disappearing altogether into a cavern of bramble and briar coming in the other direction was mrs makepiece who worked mornings for the unspeakable valerie jones and who was bursting with gossip the four pickfords vans bearing the oharas belongings had nearly got stuck on chalford hill she told lizzie and declans son well the image of declan anyway had been sighted in the village shop asking for whisky chocolate biscuits toilet paper and lightbulbs and was quite the handsomest young man anyone had seen in penscombe since rupert campbellblack was a lad will they be bringing their own staff from london asked mrs makepiece wistfully thinking it would be much more fun working for mrs ohara who probably paid london prices and wouldnt slavedrive like valerie jones lizzie said she didnt know mrs makepiece was an ace cleaner a treasure even the exacting valerie jones admitted it annexing treasures was a far worse sin in gloucestershire than stealing somebodys husband lizzie wandered on having had no lunch because she was on a diet she kept stopping to eat blackberries which didnt count up on the left dominating the valley ruperts beautiful tawny house dozed in the sunshine the garden wasnt as good as it had been when ruperts exwife helen had lived there the beeches shed planted round the tennis court were nearly eight feet tall now rupert should fly a flag when he was in residence thought lizzie one couldnt help feeling excited when he was at home half a mile upstream the village of penscombe with its church spire and ancient ashblond houses lay in a cleavage of green hills like a retirement poster promising a happy future lizzie however turned right clambering over a mossy gate into a beech wood whose smooth grey trunks soared like the pipes of some vast organ following a zigzagging path upwards which three times crossed a waterfall hurtling down to join the frogsmore lizzie finally stumbled and panted her way to the top across a hundredyard sweep of lawn which was now almost a hayfield rose the confusion of mediaeval chimneys pointed gables gothic turrets and crenellated battlements that made up penscombe priory on either side with the sun behind them like a funeral cortège towered great black yew trees cedars and wellingtonias to the left of the lawn where once before the dissolution of the monasteries the nuns must have strolled and prayed grew a tangled rose walk poor oharas thought lizzie as she hurried along it after divorce and death moving house is supposed to be the most traumatic experience but as she skirted a large pond overgrown with water lilies round to the front of the house which faced into the hillside for shelter she was suddenly deafened by pop music booming out of two of the upstairs turrets and opera she thought it was rheingold pouring out of the other two the old oak front door studded with nails was open on the sweep of gravel outside a van was still being unloaded peering inside lizzie noticed some very smeary furniture the oharas would be needing a treasure after all a grand piano whose yellow keys seemed to be leering at her and several tea chests full of books sprawling over the front porch was an ancient clematis which acted as a curtain for the bathroom window above and covered the doorbell which didnt work anyway inside lizzie called hullooo hullooo in a high voice next minute a very plain selfimportant black and white mongrel appeared barking furiously and wagging a tightly curled tail turning right down the hall into the kitchen which was situated in the oldest thirteenthcentury part of the house lizzie found a woman whom she assumed must be declans wife maud ravishing but inappropriately dressed in a pink sequinned tshirt limegreen tracksuit bottoms with a jewelled comb in her long red hair she was very slowly unpacking china from a tea chest stopping to smooth out and read each bit of paper it was wrapped in and drinking whisky out of a tea cup on the window seat training a pair of binoculars on rupert campbellblacks house knelt a teenage girl with spiky short pink hair a brace on her teeth and a pale clever charming face in her black clumpy shoes wrinkled socks and black woolly cardigan she looked like a tramp whod just changed into his old clothes neither of them took any notice when lizzie came in but a very tall girl in jeans and a darkgreen jersey with a cloud of thick black hair strange silvergrey eyes and a smudge on her cheek who was quickly unloading china looked up and smiled i live down the valley announced lizzie ive brought you some eggs and a bottle dont open it now its a bit shaken up put it in the fridge oh how really kind of you said the dark girl she had a soft deep slightly gruff voice like a teddy bears growl she looked very tired maud having finished reading her piece of newspaper glanced up and gave lizzie the benefit of her amazing eyes which were almondshaped sleepy fringed with very thick dark red lashes and as brilliantly green as bristol glass deciding lizzie was worthy of interest she introduced her daughters taggie short for agatha the tall dark one and caitlin the little redhead the sink was crammed with flowers still in cellophane sidling over lizzie noticed one lot was from tony and monica baddingham wishing the oharas good luck in their new house and a long and happy association with corinium all the nations press tramped through here yesterday in the mud trying to interview declan grumbled maud tv times has been here all morning photographing us moving in two local papers are due this afternoon and a man from the electricity board has been rabbiting on like mr darcy about the inferiority of our connections and says the whole place will have to be rewired have a drink she extracted a mug wrapped in a page of new statesman splashed some whisky into it for lizzie and filled up her own tea cup its a glorious house said lizzie raising her mug to them welcome were all wildly excited youve come to live here after yesterdays deluge weve discovered it leaks in half a dozen places said maud so we shall probably have to have a new roof as well were thinking of letting our grounds to some cows said caitlin putting down her binoculars and helping herself to a chocolate biscuit which she proceeded to share with the black and white mongrel who was drooling on the window seat beside her movings very disorientating she went on daddys trying to work upstairs and hes frantic because hes lost his telephone book taggies lost her bra caitlin the tall girl blushed and ive lost my heart continued caitlin training her binoculars back on rupert campbellblacks house will you introduce me hes not here that much said lizzie but when he is im sure hell introduce himself its not fair moaned caitlin im going to bloody boarding school next week and i wont get first crack at him hes bound to fall for taggie or even mummy she said dismissively there was a knock on the door and a removal man came in with a yellowing dress in a polythene bag where did mrs ohara want this put my wedding dress said maud theatrically rising to her feet and holding it against her just to think twentyone years ago ugh said caitlin its gross how did you get daddy in that but i suppose he didnt see you till he came up the aisle and then it was too late caitlin hush chided taggie as mauds face tightened with anger mummy looked beautiful youve seen the photos oh put it in my bedroom snapped maud going back to the new statesman im not sure im going to like living in the country said caitlin fiddling with the wireless no capital radio no standard no second post no second post taggies gasp of dismay was interrupted by a knock on the door another removal man wanted to know where the piano was to go on the right of the front door said maud not there shrieked caitlin wandering aengus is shut in there and that stupid bugger daddys let him out twice already and theres daddy the nations biggest megastar thought lizzie aengus is our cat hes a bit unsettled said taggie smiling apologetically at lizzie oh look sighed maud unwrapping a babys bottle that was patricks when he was a baby caitlin tapped the fastemptying whisky bottle with a finger and this was daddys when he was fortytwo she said accusingly oh go away said maud shooting her another dirty look peering at a pile of books in the corner lizzie was highly gratified to see a copy of her first novel i wrote that she blurted out did you said maud in amazement picking up the book and examining the photograph on the inside flap when i was thinner said lizzie humbly it was really good said maud i thoroughly enjoyed it at that moment a punk lord byron wandered into the room he had flawless cheek bones short dark glossy vertical hair and an inch of violet shadow under his eyes which were like mauds only darker and much more direct obviously the son patrick who had so dazzled the village shop darling said maud in excitement this is lizzie vereker she wrote this marvellous novel and she lives down the valley so perhaps penscombe wont be such a cultural desert after all patrick said hullo lizzie and announced that hed liked the book too and where did his mother want the piano in the big drawingroom too cold youll never play it in there said caitlin put it in the small sittingroom then said maud there wont be room for anything else in there not even a piano stool protested patrick oh well you sort it out darling youre so good at that sort of thing said maud and dont let aengus out screamed caitlin patricks reply was drowned by a bellow of rage from outside and declan stormed in holding a piece of paper in one hand and the cordless telephone in the other lizzie caught her breath shed never expected him to be so tall and broad in the shoulders or quite so heroic looking he had very thick dark hair streaked with grey and worry and hard work had dug deep lines on either sides of his mouth and round his eyes which were as sombre and dark as the rainsoaked yew trees outside but even with halfmoon spectacles fallen down over his broken nose a quarter of an inch of stubble and odd socks one had to admit his force this is lizzie vereker announced maud shes brought us some eggs and a bottle of champagne and she writes lovely books declan glared at lizzie as though she didnt exist i cant find the focking ad directory his irish accent was much more pronounced than the rest of the family i cant find my focking telephone book i cant get through to claridges i cant get any answer from directory enquiries in london ive been trying for the last halfhour he dialled the number again then held out the receiver so they could all hear the parrot screech of the unobtainable shall i try said lizzie you have to dial for london directories in the country and then before the number two minutes later she got through to claridges and handed the telephone to an amazed and grateful declan who asked to be put through to johnny friedlander lizzie almost fainted johnny friedlander was a brilliant madly desirable american actor with a wellknown cocaine habit and a penchant for underage school girls the johnny friedlander she mouthed at taggie taggie nodded and smiled declan was put straight through and invited johnny on to his first programme for corinium next month id ask you to stay with us declan went on in his worldfamous husky infinitely sexy smokers voice but were in shit order this end and youd do better in a hotel we can have dinner after the programme ill get our contract people to talk to your people thanks johnny i cant think of a better person to kick off the series but hes never given an interview ever said lizzie in wonder as declan came off the telephone i know isnt it great declan suddenly smiled a wide slightly gaptoothed grin which made him look much more like taggie and made lizzie feel utterly weak at the knees and all because you know how to use a telephone he went on if id left it any later hed have been looped or refused point blank ill certainly read your book he turned to maud dyou hear that darling johnnys coming on the programme thats nice said maud without interest hell she went on reaching the end of another torn bit of paper this piece on princess michael is continued on page eight do see if you can find it taggie she started frantically burrowing in the tea chest throwing discarded bits of newspaper all over the floor taggie raised her eyes to heaven lizzie turned to declan what are you writing at the moment cheques mostly said declan gazing out of the window towards the pond he suddenly started and grabbed the binoculars from caitlin nearly garrotting her with the straps grasshopper warbler he said a second later pretty rare for this part of the world there are some marvellous birds round here there could be some marvellous blokes too said caitlin rubbing her neck and snatching back the binoculars to train them once more on ruperts house if they were ever at home im off to the public library darling said declan attempting to kiss a still scrabbling maud on the cheek but you havent had any breakfast or lunch said taggie in distress trust you to push off leaving us to do all the work grumbled maud leaving taggie to do all the work said declan with a slight edge to his voice after hed gone and maud and lizzie had had some more whisky the doorbell rang probably the local paper and your fathers not here said maud who was now reading about boy george but it was another bouquet of flowers brought in by caitlin who are they for asked taggie hope flaring then dying in her eyes when caitlin opened the envelope and read to declan and maura thats a new one mum seeing the flash of irritation on mauds face lizzie wondered quite how much fun it must be to be married to such a famous man lizzie had experienced the same thing in a smaller way being married to james but she wasnt stunningly beautiful like maud it must be awful looking like that and having people getting your name wrong and wanting to gawp all the time at your husband wheres grace said maud fretfully not up yet said caitlin said she couldnt sleep because of the quiet i suggested the removal men should drive their vans round and round hooting under her window to remind her of the juggernauts in fulham grace is our socalled housekeeper she explained to lizzie patrick says she ought to join the rspca shes so kind to spiders i must go said lizzie regretfully have another drink said maud not looking up have some lunch said taggie i was just going to make some omelettes i must work said lizzie thanks awfully the childrenll be home soon it must be nearly four ill walk some of the way with you said caitlin gertrude needs a walk do you want to come with us mummy her voice was suddenly conciliatory as though she regretted cheeking her mother no thanks said maud vaguely i must measure up some windows for curtains curtains indeed muttered caitlin as she and lizzie left the room the only thing my mother measures with any efficiency is her length after parties then noticing lizzies raised eyebrows im afraid im at the age when one tends to criticize ones parents a lot sadly one cant sever the umbilical cord gently it has to be done with a razor blade and without an anaesthetic along a winding passage caitlin opened a door into a large octagonal room the base of one of the mediaeval turrets tall narrow ecclesiastical windows with stained glass in the top panes provided the only interruption to shelves and shelves of books daddys library said caitlin i thought being a writer youd like it how lovely gasped lizzie i think daddy bought the house because it already had shelves in they went out of the west door on the other side of the house past stables and a clock tower with a roof covered in ferns and dark moss through a vegetable garden which had been taken over by nettles and an orchard whose stunted lichened trees grew no higher than seven feet because of the constant blasting of the winds patrick says its going to take a fleet of gardeners to keep this place in order said caitlin and what with my school fees and the rewiring and the new roof and mummys house and garden fantasies daddys bloody well going to need his new salary out in the sunshine lizzie noticed how pale and thin caitlin was and thought a few terms playing games and eating stodge at a vigorous girls boarding school would do her no harm gertrude bounced ahead plunging into the beech wood after rabbits certainly slithering down the wood was easier than climbing up is rupert campbellblack as attractive as everyone says asked caitlin yes sighed lizzie he seems to get more so they say he was very wild in his youth well hes had a rather extended youth and brainy well street bright and very sharp with money my brother patrick is like that i have brains taggie has beauty patrick has both oh youre going to be very beautiful said lizzie truthfully i may blossom said caitlin beadily but at present i am undernourished and my teeth leave a lot to be desired i had to make the dentist put this beastly brace on my mother only believes in going to the dentist when ones teeth hurt and taggie seems very efficient in the kitchen said lizzie isnt she bright not at all shes dyslexic poor darling hardly stumbles through mills and boon and she has fearful trouble with recipe books which is a pity as she wants to be a cook patrick said it was ghastly when she was small everyone thought she was retarded because she couldnt read mummy shouted at her all the time never thought of taking her to an educational psychologist the wall at the bottom of the beech wood marked the end of declans land caitlin scrambled over it and held out a hand to help lizzie how beautiful she said gazing at the flat water meadows and the bustling little stream i can imagine mediaeval knights jousting here in the old days she whistled to gertrude whod belted the other way and who now rushed back splashing and drinking in the stream the ghastly thing about having brilliant famous parents caitlin went on is you never feel the centre of the universe because theyre so obsessed with their own lives and if you do brilliantly at school everyone nods sagely and says declans daughter its in the genes and if you do badly like poor tag they just assume youre lazy or bloodyminded tags selfconfidence was in tatters when she left school but shes so beautiful protested lizzie i know but she doesnt realize it shes madly in love with ralphie henriques one of patricks even more brilliant friends after months of pestering he seduced tag at a may ball at trinity this year god look at those blackberries caitlin started tearing them off the bushes with both hands and cramming them into her mouth i hoped tag would tell me exactly what it was like one cant obtain ones entire sexual education from the pages of jackie collins but she just clammed up and he never rang her again just one postcard from cork and nothing since can you imagine doing that to tag thats why she waits for every post and jumps on every telephone patrick says ralphies got someone else some pert little blonde who reads sophocles in the original poor tag cant even read english in the original what about patrick asked lizzie does he like trinity he feels right there he thinks my father has betrayed his roots working in england and he also rather despises daddy for being in television god these blackberries are good perhaps rupert smiled at them but your fathers a genius said lizzie shocked those interviews are works of art i know but patrick thinks daddy ought to write books hes been working on a biography of yeats for years and he used to write wonderful plays whats patrick going to do when he leaves trinity hell write hes much more together than daddy i know daddy makes pots of money but it all gets spent and hes always having frightful rows at work patricks calmer hes a prose version of daddy really and for someone with such high principles he thinks nothing of running up the most enormous debts which of course mummy settles out of daddys despised television earnings jolly easy to have principles when someone else picks up the bill said lizzie right said caitlin patricks also a bit smug because he attracts the opposite sex so effortlessly do you think gertrude will get lonely in the country should we get her a dog friend they had crossed the stream now to the same side as ruperts house despite the lack of wind thistledown was drifting everywhere as though a pillow had just burst panting up the slope and turning in their tracks they could just see the creepered battlements and turrets of the priory above its ruff of beech trees now warmed by the late afternoon sun climbing had also given caitlins pale freckled face a tinge of colour think of all those nuns living there in the middle ages she sighed ecstatically gazing across the valley yearning for rupert campbellblacks ancestors lizzie decided not to spoil such a romantic concept by pointing out that ruperts house hadnt been built until the seventeenth century it is a romantic house isnt it said caitlin still gazing at the priory exciting things must happen to us all even tag in a place like that im sure they will said lizzie id better go home now said caitlin can i come and see you next time im back for the weekend lizzie floated home what richness what a fascinating afternoon the prospect of new friends excited her these days almost as much as new boyfriends had when she was young she was still bubbling over when james got home later than usual what did you think of my programme he asked lizzie had to confess shed forgotten to watch it because shed dropped in and had a drink with the oharas did declan say anything about me or the programme demanded james no said lizzie didnt you tell them you were married to me said james utterly scandalized i forgot said lizzie im awfully sorry but there was so much going on and the oharas are just so glamorous declan ohara had two obsessions in life his work and rare in a profession that tends to regard a broken marriage as the only essential qualification his wife he was born in a thatched cottage on a green hillside in the wicklow mountains where his father scratched a living from the land when declan was ten his father broke his back falling from a tractor when drunk and was thus rendered useless for heavy work so the family moved back to cork his protestant mothers home town here his mother proceeded to bring up declan and his three brothers by taking endless cleaning and secretarial jobs aided by occasional handouts from her parents her one joy in an exhausting life was declan who fulfilled his promise at school by winning a history scholarship to trinity dublin soon he was writing poetry and plays working freelance for the irish times and sending money home one evening in his second year at trinity he dropped into the theatre to see the playboy of the western world maud with her red hair and her amazing green eyes was the toast of dublin as pegeen mike declan went round in a daze for three days afterwards then sat down wrote a play for her in a month and posted it off impressed by the play maud asked him backstage and was even more impressed by this roaring blackeyed boy with his volcanic moods and his gift for words the theatre put on the play for a threemonth run it was an instant success with mauds extra radiance being noted by all the critics by the sixth week she was pregnant and married declan as soon as the play came off although stunned with amazement and joy that this glorious creature was his declan soon realized there was no way he could support her and a baby by writing plays so he junked his academic career and got a fulltime job doing profiles on the irish times there was talk of maud returning to the stage when patrick grew older but then taggie came along and then caitlin habitually strapped for cash declan moved to television where although his family in cork thought he was joining the circus he soon became a star snapped up by the bbc in london that milker of irish talent in a year he was writing and fronting his own programmes culminating in a series of interviews which had promptly climbed to the top of the ratings and remained there for two years for not only was declan the most natural thing ever seen on television but unlike other presenters and chat show hosts he never showed off or talked about himself and he always did his homework to get public figures as a result of this quiet sympathetic utterly relentless probing to reveal facets of their character never seen before made for spellbinding television these revelations however did not always please the bbc who got rattled if a sinn fein leader appeared too attractive or a politician too unpleasant known as the terror of lime grove because of his black glooms and his sporadic bouts of heavy drinking declan bitterly resented interference from above he finally walked out because the governors heavily leant on by the home secretary pulled his interview with ian paisley and because tony baddingham offered to triple his salary and declan couldnt see any other way of paying his tax bill or ever clearing his overdraft after his early childhood in wicklow too declan had always yearned to live in the country he truly believed it would be cheaper than london that he would have more time to spend with his family particularly maud and to finish his biography of yeats maud herself was lazy egotistical and selfish she idled her time away reading novels and token scripts spending money and talking playing second fiddle on the other hand is not an easy part when she married declan she had been the star pursued by half the men in dublin and the mistress of the director then she had to watch declan rise to international fame while her career dwindled away through lethargy and terror of failure on the excuse that she was always too busy with the children underneath she was desperately jealous of declans success and one reason he had never become spoilt was because maud showed no interest in his career and was constantly mobbing him up there was a tremendously strong erotic pull between them but even after twentyone years declan still felt he hadnt really won her he was also in a catch situation in order to support mauds wanton extravagance he was forced to work all hours which meant she got bored and spent more and to goad him toyed with other men another reason declan had moved to the country was that last year one of her toyings had got out of hand a week after the oharas moved into the priory declan started work at corinium he didnt sleep at all the night before it was a long time since february when hed accepted the job but maud had immediately started spending in the expectation of riches culminating in a vast farewell to fulham party christ knew how he was to pay for that or for all mauds redecorating schemes nor had his friends at the bbc been backward in telling him that tony baddingham was a shit or that itv notoriously more reactionary and restrictive than the beeb would be far harder to work for in the end too as he had been desolate to leave ireland he was sad to leave the bbc particularly as so many of the staff had come out on strike when his programme on paisley had been axed they had then held a succession of riotous and tearful leaving parties finally clubbing together to give him the complete oxford dictionary of national biography but all his life declan had walked away from the safe thing that was his instinct as he lay in the huge double bed smoking one cigarette after another watching dawn creep through the curtainless windows maud slept peacefully beside him her red hair spilled over the rosepink pillow case the whole of the darkblue duvet was wrapped round her hips and her breasts fell sideways on to a palegreen bottom sheet nothing ever matched in their house reflected declan he longed to make love to her to ease the panic and tension but there was no way shed wake before ten oclock she was as obsessive about sleep as he was about work tony had told him to roll up at eleven but knowing work was the only way out of his black panic declan decided to go in early he was expecting a pile of johnny friedlanders cuttings from america thank god for taggie he thought as he put on a beautifully ironed black and green checked shirt grace the housekeeper who also never rose before ten had an ability to singe or iron buttons off everything she touched as he went into the kitchen to pick up his car keys taggie came barefoot and holloweyed down the back stairs in her nightgown daddy you shouldnt be up yet couldnt sleep thought i might as well go in you must have some breakfast or at least a cup of coffee when he shook his head she put her arms round him itll be ok i know it will remember youre the best in the world declan reached the corinium television building at a quarter to eight just as the night security man on the car park was about to go off seeing a pair of vaguely familiar eyes looking over the halfopen window of the absolutely filthy mini he raised the horizontal pole and having waved declan through went back to enjoying page three of the sun walking through the revolving front door absolutely sick with nerves declan found the place deserted except for a cleaner down the passage morosely pushing a mop and a young man in pink trousers arranging roses on the marbletopped reception desk aware that every other girl who worked in the building was at home washing her hair putting on her prettiest clothes and emptying scent bottles over herself in anticipation of declans arrival the receptionist had just nipped down to makeup to redo her eyes before the hordes started arriving at nine declan therefore waited a few minutes admired the framed awards on the wall which seemed all to have been won by cameron cook then still finding no one at reception took a lift to the fifth floor where he eventually discovered a coffee machine and an office with his name on it at the end of the passage it was a splendid office with a thick blue carpet a huge bare desk with empty drawers two empty filing cabinets a radio cassette two television sets a video machine and a large bunch of red roses which had obviously been arranged by the pinktrousered youth out of the window was a marvellous view of the close and the water meadows still white with dew but even more marvellous on the virgin sheet of pink blotting paper lay a pile of mail including two fat airmail envelopes lighting a cigarette sitting down at his desk declan was soon totally immersed in johnny friedlanders cuttings most of them highly speculative and fictitious because johnny never gave interviews the great bell of cotchester cathedral had tolled the hour three times when suddenly a redfaced middleaged lady reeking of devon violets and with tightly permed hair barged into his office gave a squawk of amazed relief and shot out again shrieking down the passage hes here lord b hes here next minute tony baddingham erupted into the room absolutely purple with rage where the fuck have you been declan sat back in his chair sitting here since about eight oclock why the hell didnt you tell anyone there was no one here to tell with a colossal effort tony gained control of himself and shook declans hand well welcome anyway look ive got most of the national press outside waiting to witness your arrival we nearly had the police out they said youd left home at seventhirty said the lady reeking of devon violets who was tonys secretary miss madden we thought you might have had a car crash or second thoughts said charles fairburn head of religious programmes shimmying in and giving declan a great kiss on both cheeks youre not to be bloody to him on his first day tony first days in an office are like birthdays no ones allowed to be bloody to you fuck off charles snarled tony see you later darling said charles whisking out again nearly colliding with an ashen cyril peacock theyre getting awfully fed up tony where the hell can the stupid fucker have got to hes been here all the time said tony nastily you just didnt look cyril another classical peacockup oh hello declan welcome to corinium said cyril his false teeth rattling even more violently with nerves marvellous to see you theyre all waiting for you in the car park getting very hot uhuh declan shook his head looking mutinous ive got nothing to say to them well for a start you might like to refute that piece in the guardian claiming you joined corinium merely to clear your overdraft and not as a vocational choice said tony with a cold smile i interview people i dont give interviews said declan not budging the press made enough fuss when we arrived at penscombe staking us out all bloody night tony tried a different tack itll be such a thrill for all the staff he said suavely all we want is pictures of you driving into the car park for the first time and having a glass of champagne in the board room afterwards and then we can all get down to work declan suddenly decided he needed a drink all right ill go and get my car you cant do that theyll see you said tony give cyril your keys hell drive it round to the front then you can drive in again its a mini parked in the far corner said declan as declan drove his absolutely filthy mini into the parking slot with his name on which was between tonys maroon rolls royce with the silver corinium ram on the bonnet and camerons green lotus there was absolutely no reaction from the crowd of reporters and cameramen the next minute however there was a furious banging on the roof declan wound down the window half an inch he could see a beaky nose and a predatory mouth yes he said you cant park here asshole said an enraged female voice why not cant you read you fucking dumbass this slots reserved for declan ohara is it indeed said declan softly then ive come to the right place winding up the window he got out towering over cameron cook who gasped and stepped back as she instantly recognized the tousled black curls the brooding dark eyes and the familiar face as battered as the irish coastline shock made her even more hostile where the fuck have you been you should have been here at eleven its nearly twenty past so i was crosspatch in my office nobody thought to look there was a shout as the press recognized declan and surged forward their cameras clicking away like weaving looms hugely enjoying the contrast between declans rusty banger and tonys gleaming rolls from every window female staff their clean hair flopping screamed and cheered with excitement declan grinned up at them and waved in the gents james lowered the venetian blind a quarter of an inch and was delighted to see how old declan was looking and that he was not even wearing a suit or a tie tony would not like that at all outside there was almost a punchup as the corinium camera crew battled to get the press out of the way so they could get their own cameras in and film declans arrival for the lunchtime news bulletin inside the building everyone surged forward to say hullo to declan the corridor was swarming with midsummer nights dream fairies coming back from their midmorning coffeebreak as declan fought his way through them shaking hands bottom took off his asss head to have a better look next minute titania struggled to declans side her crown askew and kissed him on both cheeks darling marvellous youve arrived we must lunch later in the week love to maud wish wed never started this fucking production said tony punching more fairies out of the way mercifully he kept the press conference short we are all absolutely delighted declans joined corinium he said when everyone had been given a glass of champagne we feel he has a tremendous contribution to make and has just the right kind of incandescent talent to revitalize our current affairs schedule declan suppressed a yawn why dyou move declan asked the very young girl reporter from the cotchester times well to misquote dr johnson said declan we werent tired of life but we were a bit tired of london this dr johnson persisted the reporter earnestly is he a private doctor hell crucify her thought cameron waiting for the kill but declan merely laughed no definitely national health he said the press conference in fact was affability itself compared with the meeting that followed in tonys office as tony declan and cameron trooped past the tiny outer office where cyril peacock waited grey and sweating for tonys reprisals after the disaster of declans arrival they found simon harris controller of programmes lurking apprehensively in miss maddens office im terribly sorry i wasnt here when declan arrived said simon following tony into his office fionas had to go into hospital so i had to take the kids to school couldnt the nanny have done it snapped tony shes had to take the baby to the clinic simon scratched at his eczema mindlessly im so sorry declan turned to simon is your wife ok multiple sclerosis said simon helplessly shes in for new tests im so sorry said declan again we met briefly at the beeb he held out his hand the hand that limply gripped his was wet and trembling christ hes aged thought declan appalled simon looked awful his eyes were unbecomingly frightened the shoulders of his grey suit were coated in scurf well sit down said tony irritably deliberately waving cameron and declan towards the squashy darkgreen leather sofa which lined two walls of his vast office simon harris had to make do with a hard straightbacked chair right in front of tony despite the rooms size the plethora of television sets video machines and huge shinygreen tropical plants plus tonys massive empty desk and vast carved chair made it seem unpleasantly overcrowded a bowl of fleshcoloured orchids on tonys desk and despite the warmth of the day central heating turned up like the tropical house at the zoo increased the jungle atmosphere any moment declan expected a leopard to pad out from behind the filing cabinet as hed already downed a couple of glasses of champagne he wanted to go on drinking but it was at least half an hour until lunchtime after lunch declan said tony ill hand you over to cameron but i thought id like to be in at the kickoff declan looked at cameron in her sleeveless orange tshirt and her short black leather skirt her hair was greased back her eyes fierce she looks like a vulture whos spent the morning at vidal sassoon thought declan he loathed meetings he wanted to get back to his johnny friedlander cuttings furious at having made an idiot of herself in the car park cameron was determined to regain the whip hand and weighed straight in my goal is to give your programme more pizazz she said weve chosen several possible signature tunes once weve decided on the right one we can go ahead and cut a disc which should go straight to the top of the charts with a nice profit for corinium but we ought to get it recorded at once could you listen to them this afternoon declans eyes which never left the face of the person he was listening to seemed to darken i know what tune im having he said flatly the opening of the first movement of schuberts fifth symphony too upmarket the programmes upmarket its a great tune and its in the public domain so we wont have to pay copyright all we have to do is to record a jazzedup version and pay the arranger am i hearing you right exploded cameron this isnt fucking radio no agreed declan but its what i want so were having it cameron was spitting but she particularly didnt want to lose face in front of tony and simon so she tried another tack which would certainly have worked with james vereker i keep hearing the same complaint about your programmes what said declan softly the viewers dont see enough of you we want to feature you much more in the interview thats why weve designed a terrific set with book shelves and some really good abstracts and this jadegreen sofa no interrupted declan sharply i only interview people face to face confrontational tvs kind a dated taunted cameron simon harris opened his mouth to protest and shut it again im not using a sofa said declan firmly well well argue about that later said cameron we will not well decide now i want two charles rennie mackintosh chairs facing each other six feet apart on pale steelyblue circular rostra steely blue screeched cameron steely blue said declan firmly so they rise like islands from a floor of darkblue gloss then carrying on the dark blue up the bottom of the cyclorama into a limitless white horizon this is insane outraged cameron swung round to tony for help well but tony was calmly doing his expenses its declans programme he said smoothly he knows by now how to get the best out of people how does he know until hes tried a sofa sofas make it look like any other chat show mumbled simon no ones asking you dumbass hissed cameron shes like a hawk not a vulture decided declan she prefers her victims alive he imagined her cruising the hillside scanning the ground for prey or darting down a woodland ride scattering terrified small birds squaring her shoulders cameron turned back to declan and were scrapping the introductory package she said we want you talking to camera for two or three minutes about the guest to replace all those dreary stills and clips with a voice over the point of those dreary stills and clips with a vo said declan dangerously quietly is that they concentrate the viewers minds on the guest and set the tone of the interview i get uptight enough as it is without having to ponce about making a long spiel on autocue this way i can concentrate on the first questions i must disagree on this one said tony putting down his red fountain pen the point is declan that you have immense presence its you the viewers turn on for you should open the programme talking to camera in a really decent suit he added raising a disapproving eyebrow at declans scuffed leather jacket check shirt and ancient jeans itll be up to cameron to make you relax and be less uptight through halfclosed eyes declan looked at cameron who was now pacing up and down through the rubber plants burning up the calories no wonder she was so thin she said declan incredulously she make me relax weve got to be different from the beeb snarled cameron or theyll just say were serving up the same old garbage anyway weve got three weeks to kick the idea around said tony and to cheer you up declan i know camerons had a great time dreaming up people for you to interview weve checked out on all their availability said cameron well you can just uncheck them again said declan harshly i decide who im going to interview cameron stopped in her tracks glaring at him they may not be hot enough declan then stunned the three of them he was kicking off with johnny friedlander on september he announced followed by jackie kennedy the week after frantic now to keep her end up cameron snarled that jackie kennedy would just rabbit on about her boring publishing job she may indeed said declan but shes also going to talk about her marriages and her life as a single woman in new york you and she should have much in common cameron said tony bitchily cameron ignored him but a muscle pounded in her cheek isnt it going to overextend your budget flying her over she demanded declan suddenly relaxed and gave cameron the benefit of the wicked gaptoothed schoolboy grin shes coming over on a private visit and shell probably stay with us he said fifteen love to declan thought simon harris joyfully then it was game and first set when declan announced that in subsequent weeks hed be doing the french foreign secretary who was in the middle of a gloriously seamy sex scandal followed by mick jagger and the most controversial of the royal princesses desperately fighting a rearguard action cameron said she had lined up a couple of ace researchers whod better get started on johnny friedlander and jackie kennedy at once there was a long pause very slowly declan got out a cigarette lit it inhaled deeply and only just avoided blowing smoke in camerons face i do my own research he said softly for chrissake screamed cameron you cant cover subjects like this singledhanded i have done for the past ten years for better or worse what youve bought is not my face but my vision what i can get out of people its a team effort hissed cameron good said declan amiably then i suggest we put your researchers on to finding some decent footage and stills weve got an excellent library said simon tugging his beard shut up howled cameron tony was lasciviously fingering one of the fleshcoloured orchids glancing round declan tried to analyse the expression on his face hes enjoying it he thought with a shudder hes excited by seeing her rip people apart noticing the disapproval on declans face tony looked at his watch that was a very stimulating exchange of views he said getting to his feet but i for one need some lunch then deliberately excluding simon he added cameron and ive booked a table at a little french restaurant a couple of miles outside cotchester we hope youll join us declan and we can carry on the er discussion he smiled expansively declan didnt smile back thanks but im lunching with charles fairburn we worked together at the beeb he added by way of slight mitigation tony was about to order declan to cancel then decided there would be oodles of time later to get heavy besides the clash of wills had turned him on so much he had a sudden craving to take cameron back to hamilton terrace for a quickie what are your plans for the afternoon cameron asked declan sulkily im going home said declan ive got johnnys cuttings and all my reference books are there i trust youll do most of your research in the building and report regularly to me and tony she said this is a group effort ok we want to be fully briefed at all times cockups occur at corinium when no one knows what anyone else is doing as she flopped down again on the green leather sofa declan immediately got up as if he couldnt bear to share the same seating from the depths of the sofa he seemed to cameron almost to touch the ceiling his massive rugger players shoulders blocking out the light his face bleak and uncompromising she never dreamed hed be so dauntingly selfconfident i have to be left alone he said speaking only to her its the only way i can operate im producing this programme she said furiously yes but its my programme youre producing for a second they glared at each other then a knock on the door made them start round it like the rising sun came charles fairburns red beaming face are you through sweeties he said blithely because ive come to take declan to dindins they lunched at a very pretty pink and white restaurant off the high street pretty waiters in pink jerseys and pinkandwhite striped bowties converged on charles weve got your usual table they said sweeping him and declan off into a dark corner good boys said charles you know how i detest windows they show up my red veins now get your little asses into gear and bring me a colossal dry martini and my friend here would like whisky is it still declan bad as that is it asked declan three minutes later as charles drained his dry martini and asked the waiter for another one well i dont want to slag off the company on your first day dear boy but things are a shade tense cameron cook said declan tearing his roll savagely apart got it in one whats her position in the company usually prostrate shes tonys bit of crumpet officially shes head of drama particularly appropriate in the circs as shes always making scenes but shes also got a finger up to the elbow in every other pie thats how she talked tony into letting her produce your programme simon harris has aged twenty years he used to be such a whizzkid well hes a waskid now and totally castrated hes been threatening to have a nervous breakdown since cameron arrived unfortunately he cant walk out because hes got a second mortgage on his house an invalid wife three young children and two to support from his first marriage quite a burden makes one feel like midas by comparison doesnt it not quite said declan thinking of his tax bill well cameron as you no doubt observed jackboots all over simon and every time he or anyone else queries her behaviour she bolts straight to tony the food is utterly wonderful here charles went on smiling at the prettiest waiter ill have liver and marmalade and radicchio salad ta duckie declan who liked his food plain ordered steak chips and some french beans and wed like a bottle of no and bring us another whisky and a dry martini while youre about it said charles hasnt he got a sweet little face he added lowering his voice as soon as the waiter had disappeared to the bar however charles returned to the subject of corinium the entire staff are in a state of revolt theyve all been denied rises and theyre forced to make utterly tedious programmes in order to retain the franchise james verekers ghastly roundup is just a wank for local councillors and tonys business chums and the reason why midsummer nights dream is taking so long is that you cant get a carpenter to build a set theyre all up at the falconry building an indoor swimming pool and a conservatory for tony when theyre not installing a multigym and jacuzzi for cameron declan grinned charles he remembered from the bbc had always had the ability to make things seem less awful nor added charles draining his third dry martini and beckoning to the pretty waiter to pour out the claret are the staff overjoyed that youve been brought in at a vast salary yes they all read the guardian yesterday to wow the iba gorgeous georgie baines the sales director whos stunning at his job incidentally and whose expenses are even larger than mine went straight in and asked tony for a rise this morning tony refused of course said they were paying you the market price depends what market you shop in shouted georgie and stormed out thank you duck he added as the waiter placed a plate of liver reverently before him declan stubbed out his cigarette suddenly he didnt feel remotely hungry any more anyway said charles cheering up as the martinis began to take effect the staff like the idea of you declan christ this liver is ambrosial ive told them youre a good egg thanks said declan dryly they all admire your work and they cant wait to see the fireworks when you tangle with ms cook i already have said declan watching the blood run out as he plunged the knife into his steak tell me about tony complete shit but extremely complex one never knows which way hes going to jump believes in deride and rule plants his spies at all levels so really were all spying on each other but he does have alarming charm when it suits him because hes so irredeemably bloody most of the time when hes nice its like a dentist stopping drilling on a raw nerve whats the best way to handle him well he claims to like people who shout back at him like cameron does but unfortunately after a row you and i cant make it up with him in bed which i bet is where he and cameron are now things were so much more peaceful when he spent all his time in london but the ibas warning him to spend more time in the area neatly coincided with his falling in love though thats hardly the word with ms cook so hes down here making a nuisance of himself most of the time now charles suddenly looked contrite youre not eating a thing dear boy have i upset you yes but id rather know the score my budget has been so slashed said charles pinching one of declans chips that i intend to interview two rubber dummies in dog collars on the epilogue tonight not that anyone would notice will tony leave monica i doubt it any scandal even a piece in private eye is the last thing he wants with the franchise coming up the pity of it lago is that ms cook is very good at her job once you dispense with all the cripcrap about checking out on your availability ive acted as her walker at the odd dinner when she had to take a man and didnt want to rouse tonys ire and she can be quite fun when she forgets to be insecure if she had someone really strong to slap her down thered be no stopping her there doesnt seem much stopping her at the moment said declan gloomily if she gets on the board were all in trouble said charles pinching another chip but we have great hopes youre going to rout her declan now lets have another bottle and you can tell me all about poor bored maud and that ravishing son of yours back at corinium james vereker fingered the prettiest secretary from the newsroom with one hand as he reread todays fan mail for comfort with the other i do really think he said petulantly tony might have had the manners to introduce me to declan a fortnight after declan started at corinium his younger daughter caitlin went back to her new boarding school in oxfordshire and his elder daughter taggie disgraced herself by being the only member of the family to cry caitlins last week at home coincided with her mother maud discovering the novels of p d james as a result maud spent her days curled up on the sittingroom sofa holding p d james on top of a pile of games shirts shorts and navyblue knickers when anyone came into the room she would hastily whip the clothes over her book and pretend assiduously to be sewing on name tapes the same week grace the housekeeper discovered the local pub as well as getting the house straight therefore and feeding everyone and coping with grace grumbling about the incessant quiet and imagined ghosts and having to drag dustbins to the end of a long drive the task of getting caitlin ready for school fell on taggie it was not just the gathering of tuck the buying of lacrosse sticks laundry bags and the new english bible which declan hurled out of the window because it was a literary abomination and which had to be retrieved from a rose bush and the packing of trunks which got taggie down worst of all was scurrying from shop to shop in gloucester cheltenham cotchester stroud and finally bath trying to find casual shoes and a wool dress for chapel which caitlin didnt think gross and the school quite unsuitable caitlin spent the morning of her departure peeling glow stars off her bedroom ceiling and sticking large photographs of gertrude the mongrel wandering aengus the cat rupert campbellblack and smaller ones of her family into a photograph album and dressing for school on the first day back girls were allowed to wear home clothes by two oclock she was ready are you auditioning for waiting for godot asked declan as she walked in wearing slashed jeans and an old darkblue knitted jersey shed extracted from gertrudes basket by twothirty the car was loaded only then did maud decide to wash her hair and glam herself up to impress the other parents they finally left at four by which time caitlin was in a frenzy they were going to be late goodbye my demon lover she cried blowing a kiss to rupert campbellblacks house as the rusty mini staggered down the drive keep yourself on ice until i come home again no one spoke on the journey declan with his first interview in a weeks time could think of nothing but johnny friedlander maud was deep in p d james taggie and caitlin sat on the back under a pile of lacrosse sticks radios records teddy bears with the trunk like a coffin behind them after threequarters of an hour they reached the undulating leafy tunnels of oxfordshire and there high on the hill surrounded by regiments of pine trees rose the redbrick walls of upland house caitlins new school my head ought to be filled with noble enid blyton thoughts about comradeship grumbled caitlin to herself as they were overtaken by gleaming bmws and volvos bearing other girls and their belongings but all she could think was how embarrassing it was to turn up with such famous parents in such a tatty car as they arrived so late all the beds near the window in caitlins dormitory had been bagged and caitlin had to be content with the one by the door which meant shed be the first to be caught reading with the huge torch that her mother had given her as a goingback present while taggie her fingers still sore from sewing on nametapes unpacked the trunk maud drifted about wafting scent and being admired by passing fathers declan sat on caitlins bed gazing gloomily at all those glass cubes full of photographs of black labradors ponies and doublebarrelled mothers looking twenty years younger than those in the dormitory he wondered if hed been mad to let maud persuade him to send caitlin away he also thought how incredibly glamorous the other fourteenyearolds looked drifting about with their suntans and their shaggy blonde hair and how excited they would have made johnny friedlander with his penchant for underage girls as they left with all the girls surreptitiously gazing out of the window to catch a glimpse of declan maud did nothing to endear herself to caitlins housemistress by calling out dont worry caitlin darling you can always leave if you dont like it bye tag said caitlin cheerfully dont cry duckie ill be ok keep your eyes skinned for rupert i wont look while you drive away its unlucky shell be all right sweetheart said declan reaching back and patting taggies heaving shoulders until he had to put both hands on the wheel to negotiate the leafy tunnels once more and was soon deep in thought again dont be silly taggie snapped maud irritably im caitlins mother im the one who minds most about losing my darling baby but im able to control myself and she went back to p d james going to bed that night taggie felt even worse in caitlins bedroom she found a moth bashing against a window pane and the needle stuck in the middle of a wham record and she realized there was no one to leave the light on in the passage for any more to ward off the ghosts and hobgoblins up in her turret bedroom which was like sleeping in a tree top and which creaked and leaked and yielded in the high winds like an old ship she looked across the valley and saw at long last a light on in ruperts house caitlin would have been so excited oh please god she prayed look after her and dont let boarding school curb her lovely merry nature the ohara children having been dragged up by a lot of housekeepers and frequently neglected by their parents were as a result absolutely devoted to one another taggie in particular had never enjoyed an easy relationship with her mother whom she adored but who intimidated her ten days late when she was born taggie had been a very large baby labour had been so long and agonizing maud had nearly died declan insane with worry thanked god he was a protestant and not faced with the painful catholic preference for saving the baby rather than the mother both survived but the doctors thought later that taggies dyslexia might be due to slight brain damage sustained at birth maud shattered and weakened never took to taggie the same way as she had to patrick whod been born with such ease as a child taggie developed normally except that she walked and spoke very late and even when she was four was only able to manage single syllables and might have been talking japanese at school in dublin the staff eagerly awaiting another dazzlingly bright pupil like patrick were disappointed to find that taggie couldnt read or write she was also very clumsy and hopeless at dressing herself putting shoes on the wrong foot clothes back to front doing up the wrong buttons and quite unable to tie her laces because she couldnt tell the time and had no sense of direction she always ended in the wrong classroom bringing the wrong books and because she was so tall people automatically assumed she was older than her age and dismissed her as even more lazy and stupid patrick two and a half years older was constantly fighting her battles but he couldnt help her in class when the other children teased her and the teachers shouted at her nor during those agonizing sessions at home when maud lost her temper and screamed but in the end got so bored that she sometimes ended up doing taggies homework for her patrick never forgot those pieces of homework smudged with tears of frustration sweaty from effort and later peppered with red writing and crossingsout from the teachers early detection of dyslexia and special teaching can quickly put a child within reach or even on a level with the rest of the class taggie was left to flounder constantly losing confidence until at eleven she came to england with the family and was about to be put in a school for backward children in the end it was patrick who got a scholarship to westminster with ease and who acquiring a friend there with a dyslexic older sister persuaded his parents to have taggie tested by an educational psychologist he pronounced taggie severely dyslexic and said she should be sent immediately to a special school maud now felt even more ambiguous about taggie she never told anyone what the psychologist had said to her in that brief bitter exchange after hed seen taggie nor would she ever admit that she felt desperately guilty for not seeking help for the childs problems earlier nor was there any way once the condition was diagnosed that maud would ever have the patience and routine to spend each evening helping taggie with her reading and learning of the alphabet declan was always too busy so it was patrick and later caitlin who came to her rescue five years of specialist teaching produced dramatic improvements at sixteen taggie wrote her first essay she still wasnt confident in the order of the alphabet she still read slowly and hesitantly following the text with her finger she had never really mastered joined up writing and punctuation was a closed book her spelling was atrocious and she still didnt automatically know her left from her right and had to think back to the kitchen in fulham and patrick saying window on the right tag aga on the left it still took her ages to write letters or recipes and when they moved to the priory it took her much longer than the others to find her way round all the rooms she also always doublechecked telephone numbers asking people to repeat them ever since the nightmarish day when one of mauds lovers had rung from america and asked if maud could ring him back taggie had taken the number down wrong and hed never rung again occasionally when she was drunk maud would bring this incident up how taggie had lost her the one great love of her life but at the end of her school career although taggie only managed olevels in cooking and needlework she left with an excellent final report taggie is a dear girl wrxgote her headmaster kind hardworking responsible she deserves to do very well in life offered a place at a catering college she preferred to learn the hard way and worked in a restaurant belonging to a friend of her fathers after two years coinciding with the familys move to penscombe he regretfully told taggie that although he would do anything to keep her there was nothing else he could teach her she cooked he said by instinct by pinches a pinch of this here a pinch of that there given a barrel of selfconfidence he told declan taggie could be another escoffier inspired taggie was longing to start her own cooking business there must be hundreds of people in gloucestershire who needed someone to do dinner parties or fill up their deep freezes at christmas or at the beginning of the school holidays but so much of her time lately had been spent looking after the family or crying herself to sleep at night over ralphie henriques maybe now caitlin had gone back and patrick was on his way to trinity via three weeks in france she could get started the following morning did little to raise taggies spirits she missed caitlin and her acid asides dreadfully the morning post brought no letter from ralphie and when patrick rang from france where he was staying with ralphies family to report he had arrived safely he made no mention of him when taggie finally steeled herself to ask how he was patrick had replied that he was fine doing a lot of waterskiing and drinking but honestly duck i think youd do better to cut your losses and find yourself a nice rosycheeked gloucestershire farmer taggie was protesting that she didnt want a gloucestershire farmer when maud swanned in enraged that taggie hadnt told her that it was her beloved patrick on the line and seized the telephone as the alternatives that afternoon included picking apples making green tomato chutney or getting on mauds nerves taggie decided to take gertrude for a walk and explore the village in an attempt to beat her dyslexia she tried to learn a new word every day and use it todays word was abhorrent there was certainly nothing abhorrent about penscombe that afternoon the wind that shook her turret bedroom last night had dropped while the little beatrix potter cottages covered in velvety purple clematis were white in the afternoon light a lot of bovver boys on their motorbikes by the war memorial eyed taggie with great interest a nice farmer who lived down the valley asked her how they were all getting on and said they must come and have supper when the long nights began at the village shop mrs banks gave her a mutton bone for gertrude and the new tv times with declans picture on the front and an old lady with a blue greyhound stopped outside and exhorted her to look after the badgers who lived in the sets at the top of the priory wood cheered up by their friendliness taggie set out for home she could feel the heat of the road through her espadrilles thistledown drifted idly and the sky was brilliant blue except for a few little violet clouds on the horizon if only ralphie were here with his hand in hers turning down the drive of yews hollies laurels which almost hid the priory from the top road she remembered her promise to keep her eyes skinned for rupert she glanced across the valley then gasped with horror as she saw a huge mushroom of brown smoke rising into the sky and realized that two of ruperts fields on the far side of the house were on fire she ran down the drive to the priory dashed into the kitchen and unearthed the gloucestershire telephone directory oh god she must keep calm when she panicked her reading went to pieces and she had even more difficulty with the alphabet callan calvay cam auto repairs camamile with agonizing slowness her finger moved down the column there were two campbells one in gloucester another in nailsworth then the list moved on to cambridge and campden no campbellblacks rupert must be exdirectory like her father out of the window great clouds of smoke were belching from ruperts redhot flickering fields the flames spreading ever nearer to the house taggie dialled all the fire engines were out explained the man at the other end but theyd ring cotchester dont worry my love well get one over as soon as possible all the same thought taggie shed better rush over and warn rupert he might not be able to see the fire from the house although hed probably be able to smell it it would be so awful if any of the horses got trapped in their stables she raced across the lawn with gertrude slithered down the beech wood bumping on her bottom most of the way and ran across the water meadows then she leapt the bustling frogsmore before starting the steep climb up the other side ripping her clothes on barbed wire oblivious of stinging nettles and brambles tearing at her bare arms and legs losing an espadrille on the way she panted on past surprised horses knee deep in lush grass past ancient oaks and beeches skirting the lake tearing across ruperts lawn in through the french windows into a beautiful paleyellow drawingroom by which time she was so puffed she couldnt even shout fire although the front door was open no one was about returning to the garden through the french windows her breath coming in great painful gasps taggie was about to run towards the stables when she heard shrieks of laughter coming from the tennis court on the left of the house which was completely hidden by a thick beech hedge as she raced down a gravel walk putting up red admirals gorging themselves on the white buddleia on either side she heard another shriek of laughter i cant hit a bloody thing i should never have had so much to drink at lunch said a girls voice titfault your tits were at least six inches over the line said a mans voice a clipped light flat very distinctive drawl cock fault then said the girl giggling hysterically you must be at least ten inches over the line you flatter me said the man i wouldnt be if you didnt excite me so much fire gasped taggie to the beech hedge but no sound came out the man was laughing now well finish this set and then ill finish you off upstairs taggie raced round the beech hedge until she came to a gap fire she croaked then very slowly she realized to her utter horror that a tall blond lean very suntanned man and a beautiful girl with catkin blonde hair tied up in a pink ribbon and a golden body like distilled sunflowers were playing tennis with no clothes on at all the man was serving his body rippled with muscle as the ball scorched across the net dropping her racket the girl gave a shriek and rushed to the side of the court breasts flopping everywhere and covered herself with a palepink shirt the man proceeded to serve the second ball very hard into the far netting then sauntered almost insolently towards the net near taggie over which was hanging a darkblue towel fire mumbled taggie clapping her hands over her eyes what did you say shouted the man its ok you can look now very gingerly taggie lowered her hands he had wrapped the darkblue towel round his loins now with his sleek blond hair broad brown shoulders and long wickedly mocking eyes as cornflower blue as the great expanse of sky behind him he was quite unmistakable from caitlins photographs as rupert campbellblack acutely aware of her heaving breasts and sweating red face taggie muttered your fields are on fire theyre meant to be said rupert whatever for quickest way to get rid of the stubble after the harvest but its the most aaabhorrent thing ive ever heard whispered taggie utterly appalled what about the rrabbits and voles and field mice and moles and all the poor birds rupert shrugged theyve got legs they can run away not that quickly said taggie furiously youre a murderer i suppose snapped rupert thoroughly nettled that you want me to stop ploughing my fields because its cruel to worms earwigs beetles woodlice and all the poor bugs he was mimicking taggie now do you want me to give them a state funeral the blonde girl giggled she was very young only a few years older than taggie oh shut up screamed taggie losing her temper how would you like someone to set fire to you when you were in bed rupert nodded at the blonde she frequently does dont be disgusting youre utterly abhorrent the sort of person who always has to be killing something hunting fishing shooting at that moment a lot of dogs back from their walk with one of ruperts grooms swarmed barking on to the court there were jack russells spaniels a black labrador and a beautiful shaggy blue lurcher which bounded joyfully up to gertrude who bridled and curled her tail up even tighter taggie pointed to the lurcher i bet you use that for coursing she said furiously why dont you take that ugly brute back to its pigsty said rupert picking up a green tennis ball and hurling it at gertrude and stop interrupting other peoples innocent afternoon pleasures dont you ddare be beastly to gertrude reaching for his racket rupert let his towel drop forty love wasnt it darling the blonde girl giggled again but next moment the pussycat smile was wiped off her face as with a manic jangling of bells three fire engines roared up the drive fucking hell screamed rupert taggie gave a sob and fled back across the valley her face flaming as much as her poor torn stung legs beastly horrible abhorrent man looking up in front of her she could see the priory except for declans twelve acres all the land in the valley belonged to rupert now thought taggie with a shudder it seemed to curl round the priory like a man trapping a woman at a party putting his hands on the wall on either side of her so she couldnt escape back home she found maud sitting outside wearing a big black hat to protect her white skin from the early evening sun which had just crept round the side of the valley to admire her she was drinking vodka and tonic and immersed in p d james ive just met rupert campbellblack said taggie maud glanced up and saw taggie was puce in the face with her black cloudy hair standing up on end in a tangled mess her red dress ripped and her long legs and arms scratched and bleeding and covered with white nettle stings my god said maud roused out of her usual languor i know hes got a fearful reputation but surely you didnt let him get that far the following sunday monica baddingham gave a lunch party at the falconry to welcome maud and declan to gloucestershire and launch the new conservatory built by coriniums studio carpenters accustomed to going out to lunch in london where people seldom ate before two oclock or even twothirty maud and declan didnt leave home until half past one declan tried to persuade taggie to come too but she blushingly refused when she heard rupert might be there im sure monica said left at the dog and trumpet said maud applying a second layer of coral gloss to a pouting bottom lip declan was in a vile temper not only had maud made him late yet again by washing her hair at the last moment but he had spent all morning trying to cut their hayfield of a lawn with a mower that kept choking on gertrudes shredded mutton bones now they seemed to be driving half way round gloucestershire why the hell cant you take directions down properly he snarled hes your boss you should have taken down the directions anyway it was you who wanted to move to the bloody country lets go home theyre giving the focking party for us why the hell dont they put names on their houses in the country you dont thats because i dont want anyone to come and see me declan was also aware that although his wife was looking a billion dollars in a very lowcut black silk dress a green shawl which matched her eyes black stockings and black high heels with her shiny red hair piled under the big black hat she was quite unsuitably dressed for sunday lunch there it is said declan at last as he drove through two lichened gate posts topped with rather newer stone rams christ people are leaving already as a darkgreen bmw passed them coming the other way the woman who was driving wound down the window love your progamme frightfully sorry weve got to go to a christening welcome to gloucestershire you must come to dinner better hurry or there wont be any drink left jesus muttered declan the baddinghams splendid queen anne house lay in a hollow surrounded by lush parkland the stable clock was always kept twenty minutes fast so that people might worry they were late and be encouraged to leave early in huge gold letters against a black background above the second door of the porch was written peaceful is the country that is strongly armed in the hall stuffed heads of deer tiger stag and buffalo gazed down glassily my headll be up there next muttered declan as tony came out of the drawingroom plainly in a bait cant you ever get the time right declan weve been trying to have lunch for threequarters of an hour im terribly sorry said maud in her most caressing tones declan and i are used to london hours well youd better acquire a few rural habits the pimms has run out what dyou want to drink oh there you are monica swept in wearing a blue cotton shirtwaister and opentoed sandals on her big bare feet taggie said you were on your way pity you didnt bring her ive got so many spare men have a quick drink and then well have lunch its probably the last time well be able to eat outside this year she added wistfully thinking how much shed prefer to be dividing the regale lilies having given maud a drink she led her through the vast tapestried drawingroom out to the new conservatory which stretched the entire back of the house at ground floor level and was crammed with statues of goddesses iron seats painted white lilies palms aspidistras and plants still wrapped which people had brought as conservatorywarming presents beautiful murmured maud taking a huge slug of whisky everyone gathered on the lawn turned round and stared come into the garden maud bellowed charles fairburn who was already tight mistiming his kiss his round red shiny face cannoned off mauds like a billiard ball looking beautiful as usual he said drawing her aside youre not to monopolize her charles said monica bossily i promise ill introduce her to everyone said charles your husbands certainly been stirring things up at corinium he added lowering his voice really said maud only mildly interested shed never been wild about charles he knew too much about her and with such fantastic men around she didnt want to waste her first party on one who was both drunk and gay is that very goodlooking man over there rupert campbellblack she asked unfair to rupert said charles thats james vereker coriniums most popular presenter drinking perrier and working the room hes fearfully put out by your husband joining corinium james was in fact absolutely furious hed arrived as late as he dared in order to make an entrance then declan had swanned in even later now he was trapped by three of monicas friends who did an enormous amount for charity silly old bags who all wanted him to open their autumn bazaars and christmas fayres for nothing to look at monicas toe nails thought james in disgust youd have reckoned she weeded the garden with her feet and paul stratton whod put on a hell of a lot of weight looked ludicrous in those tight new jeans and a denim shirt undone to the waist to reveal scanty grey chest hair james whod nearly worn jeans and an unbuttoned blue shirt was so glad hed put on instead a new grey jersey with a pink elephant on the front knitted by one of his adoring fans come and meet maud ohara james yelled charles fairburn james extracted himself from the old bags and wandered over maud ohara was certainly extraordinarily beautiful is that pink elephant on your bosom meant to reproach the rest of us for not drinking perrier said charles if the cap fits charles smirked james dont you think its a nice sweater maud sent me by a fan he smiled engagingly charles peered at the sweater not sure about the collar it might look better if you wore a brooch said maud james suddenly decided he didnt think maud was beautiful at all hullo said lizzie vereker coming over and hugging maud lovely to see you im so pleased youve met james thank you for all that lovely whisky the other day are you straight yet dont ever ask me that question said charles with a shudder whats all this about five fire engines rolling up at ruperts house and catching him playing nude tennis with a blonde talk about wobbledon lizzie giggled ruperts convinced some animal rights freak called the fire brigade because she thought he was cruel to burn his stubble who was the blonde asked charles beattie johnson no that finished months ago rupert wont say the on dit is that shes the girl playing mustard seed in midsummer nights dream have you heard that titanias so petrified of getting aids shes refusing to kiss bottom until hes had a blood test said charles is rupert here asked maud who was not interested in corinium gossip somewhere probably wandered off down one of those garden glades in which everyone except monica behaves badly said lizzie speak for yourself said james disapprovingly it was certainly a beautiful garden rising out of a sea of lavender roses coming up for a second palepink innings rampaged up the walls of the house pastel drifts of delphiniums japanese anemones and michaelmas daisies were sheltered from the bitter winds by yew hedges nine feet high two plump labradors panted on lawns as smooth as an oxford quad beyond was a fish pond and a water garden fed by the same winding river fleet that flowed through cotchester what are you going to do about the priory garden asked lizzie get a donkey to keep down the lawn said maud i hope to god we eat soon said a harassedlooking man with a motheaten yellow beard and a sleeping baby hanging from a baby sling he was also hanging on to two frantically struggling children by the scruffs of their necks there is a limited amount of time one can entertain ones kids feeding tonys fish he added helplessly lizzie introduced simon harris all his skin seemed to be flaking in the open air thought maud hows fiona asked lizzie still in hospital for another three weeks its the nannys day off or id never have brought this lot said simon as the two hyperactive horrors strained at their collars like bull terriers after a cat if they get at monicas meissen im finished i just couldnt resist a square meal he added pathetically lizzie opened her mouth to ask him to supper then closed it again simon was so boring at the moment and she knew james who was convinced simon was about to get the bullet would think it a waste of time the panting labradors struggled to their feet waving their tails as monica appeared at the conservatory door lunch she said you stay outside with the children she added firmly to simon ill get someone to bring you something out i like children normally but simons two will keep pulling the dogs ears and they keep knocking over my new plants she added in an undertone to maud as maud walked into the diningroom declan came towards her looking really happy for the first time that week darling you must meet rupert he knows johnny very well hes given me some great stuff about him its added a totally new dimension to his character maud caught her breath how could i ever have mistaken james vereker for that she wondered rupert and declan were both tall and broad in the shoulder but there the resemblance ended declan with his heavily lined brokennosed shaggyhaired splendour was like a battlescarred charger returning from the wars rupert was like a sleek capricious thoroughbred rippling with muscle and breeding about to win the derby at a canter yet in their great fame and their intrinsic belief despite declans current selfdoubts that they were still the greatest in the world at what they did they were the same and therefore separate from the rest of the party at that moment both james and maud felt a bitter stab of envy that declan had been admitted so effortlessly to the same club to which johnny friedlander and rupert belonged welcome to penscombe rupert kissed maud on the cheek im sorry i wasnt at home when you moved in but ive been frantically busy so we hear rupert said charles archly whats this about fire engines and a burning bush fuck off fairburn said rupert grinning come on dont hold up the queue said monica beckoning from behind a long white table youre getting coronation chicken again im afraid maud stood in front of declan and rupert gulping down her third glass of wine and feeling totally unnerved i know your house very well rupert told her i remember pursuing something that wasnt a fox across your haha at one party ended up ripping the front of my trousers off on the barbed wire hows the garden a groundsel estate and the nettles are on the warpath said declan better get those tackled professionally said rupert or youll never get rid of them ive got a man wholl do it for you what about the wood asked declan forestry commissionll give you a grant for that theyll whip out all the dead stuff and plant you new young trees as a quid pro quo for the firewood how wonderfully positive you are murmured maud perhaps you can give me advice on redecorating our bedroom redecoratings never been a priority of mine not in bedrooms said rupert tuck in maud said monica impatiently and you havent met my brotherinlaw bas hes dying to meet you bas was about five inches taller than tony and decidedly attractive in a sleek wicked latin way he kissed mauds hand then turned it over and buried his lips in her wrist calêche he murmured i adore it do you wear it all over maud laughed are you local near enough as the helicopter flies i can land on the palm of your hand ive got a wine bar in cotchester high street he went on most of my evil brothers staff gather there to plot against him no doubt your famous husband will shortly join them you must get him to bring you in one day dont be silly bas said monica briskly you havent met paul stratton maud our mp for cotchester nor his wife sarah she looks more like his daughter thought maud with his anxious lined somewhat petulant face and his brushedforward bluegrey hair paul looked like one of those oncefamous television personalities who eke out a middleaged existence advising housewives to buy soap powder in television commercials even maud who had a dismissive attitude to the charms of her own sex had to admit that the wife was ravishing ah the newlyweds said bas kissing sarah on the mouth when are you going to start being unfaithful to paul were in beaufort country here you know high fences and low morals basil snapped monica do stop holding up the queue and you havent met freddie jones our electronic whizz kid have you maud oh my goodness you are smashing said freddie in wonder i ear ruperts going to provide your usband with an orse maud felt marvellous it was such a long time since shed been admired by so many attractive men so much more macho than all those wimps in london and for once people were paying more attention to her than declan this dress always worked come along mrs ohara said rupert who while maud was busy fascinating had loaded up two plates acquired a bottle of white and two glasses and put them on a tray dyou want to be indoors or out indoors said maud joyfully i freckle so easily rupert found them a window seat in the conservatory monicas done this rather well he said looking round i gather its cost corinium even more than your husbands first weeks salary you want to avoid this house in winter its the sort of place eskimos send their children as punishment on cue simon harriss two hyperactive monsters roared past sending an aspidistra flying ten seconds later they were followed by simon harris with coronation chicken all over his beard the baby in the sling was bawling its head off did they go this way asked simon frantically there was a crash from the drawingroom im afraid so said rupert maud wrinkled her nose as he rushed out that baby needs changing rupert laughed all his children do id take the lot back to harrods if i was him rushing almost as fast in the opposite direction came paul stratton searching for sarah who was sitting on a wall giggling with bas pauls jeans appear to be castrating him even more than his new wife said rupert forking up chicken at great speed if he bends over his eyes will pop out maud admired the length of ruperts palebrown corduroyed thighs after four large glasses of wine she suddenly had an irresistible urge to touch one of them shes beautiful his wife said maud shes a tramp said rupert and pauls living in cloud cuckold land whats bas like asked maud putting her chicken down on the floor untouched divine said rupert one of my best mates runs a phenomenally successful wine bar dabbles in property hunts four days a week in winter plays polo all summer and screws all the prettiest girls in four counties cant be bad he doesnt look like tony said maud they had different fathers after twentythree years of utter fidelity to lord poppop tonys mother fell for an argentinian polo player the result to everyones amazement was bas hence the name of the wine bar the bar sinister maud laughed many men had told her that her laugh was beautiful low musical joyous tell me about your children said rupert whod finished his chicken ive got a son patrick im not interested in him and a daughter of just eighteen seeing ruperts eyes gleam maud added hastily but shes shy and retiring doesnt go out much and one of fourteen whos madly in love with you shes kept her binoculars trained on your house ever since we arrived thats nice theyre adorable at that age shes got a brace on her teeth and going through a very plain stage said maud even more hastily tell me about freddie jones hes a saint because he buys your horses not entirely ive offered declan a horse if ever he wants a days hunting declan rides very well said maud he grew up on a farm whos that little woman whos bending his ear at the moment who keeps making silly faces he looks as though he needs rescuing rupert glanced round not by me he doesnt thats freddies wife valerie the lady of the mannerism wont rest till shes queen of england freddie unfortunately thinks she is already keeping down with the joneses is an eternal problem round here youre very black and white arent you said maud noticing his long fingers and wishing they were unbuttoning her silk dress i like people or i dont looking up maud gave rupert the benefit of her most bewitching smile the great expanse of white eyeball and the beautiful teeth unfairly even and white after so few visits to the dentist really did light up her face at the same time her hair escaped from its jewelled comb and cascaded down her back i hope you like me she murmured i dont know yet said rupert slowly looking at her mouth and then her breasts i like your husband very much but youre certainly too disturbing to be living across the valley glancing through the conservatory window at mauds pale rapt face declan thought she looked far more exotic than any of monicas orchids and felt a sick churning jealousy rupert had his back turned maud was weaving her spells again you need but lift a pearlpale hand declan quoted to himself despairingly and bind up your long hair and sigh and all mens hearts must burn and beat oh christ if only he could get away from this party and spend a few hours on his yeats book and in three days hed got to interview johnny hed done his duty at this party hed talked to the appallingly pompous paul stratton and asked simon harris about his wife and answered questions from fearful boneheaded locals about the famous people hed interviewed and listened to at least three women who had daughters reading english at university who wanted to go into television and now he was trapped by this monstrous dwarf its so wonderful to be able to stand at the bottom of ones drive said valerie jones and not be able to see ones house she was wearing a cricket sweater and white flannels and rabbited relentlessly on like an obnoxious player who wouldnt stop bowling when the umpire said over we couldnt be happier with green lawns she went on smugly we looked at the priory you know it was on the market for ages but its awfully cold and i really couldnt live in a property that didnt get sun until the evening i must have sunshine she held her silly face up to the sun declan longed to clout a six into it he could see maud was running her hand through her hair now shaking it out her body was arched towards rupert unnoticed by either of them the fatter of monicas labradors was busy gobbling up mauds chicken even freddie was nervous about meetin you valerie was saying ay said dont be silly fredfred famous folk are just like everyone else most of them are on drugs and very lonely because all their friends have deserted them i wish some of ours would desert us said declan grimly thats why we moved to the country in the hall tony was throwing out simon harris the elder monster had just smashed a ming bowl was it very old stammered simon whitelipped only just over six hundred years hissed tony out out ill pay for it it would take you two years salary which i dont think youd like from the way youre always whining about money now bugger off before those little bastards break the whole place up i must go said rupert oh said maud put out she wanted the afternoon to go on for ever it was as though the sun had gone in ive got to pick up my children from my ex how old are they eight and ten you must bring them over to see us taggie my daughter dotes on children shed keep them out of our hair has your exwife married again yes said rupert getting to his feet to my old chef déquipe malise gordon he used to manage the british team when i was show jumping bit of a tartar so i feel their twin rays of disapproval if i roll up late at that moment freddie jones rolled up with two overloaded plates of pavlova ullo my darlings brought you some sweet not for me im off said rupert hows my horse getting on said freddie bloody well i think well run him in a twomile chase at cheltenham hes ready for it they were interrupted by frantic tapping on the window pane valerie jones was glaring in no dessert fredfred she mouthed lizzie vereker took valeries place beside declan dyou need rescuing i did said declan i dont any more she nails your feet to the floor but im trained to cut across wafflers he shook his head hows the book going backwards said lizzie are you nervous about your first programme yes i shouldnt be allowed out before a series starts i get so wound up i cant talk to anyone good luck with johnny said rupert pausing on his way out come and have dinner with us after the programme said declan cant im off to ireland i know were both hellishly pushed but lets get together soon ill come and look at your wood bye darling he gave lizzie a kiss as he crossed the deserted hall sarah stratton came out of the downstairs loo reeking of anaïs anaïs glancing back towards the garden rupert saw that james was nose to nose with paul stratton each mistakenly assuming he was furthering his own career come and feed the fish said rupert taking sarahs hand he led her down a grassy ride flanked on either side by yew hedges to the fish pond stuffed to bursting by simon harriss monsters the carp didnt even bother to ruffle the surface of the water lilies any repercussions asked rupert sarah shook her head it seems funny belting away from your tennis court with a pink dress over my head the entire gloucestershire fire brigade will recognize my bush but not my face rupert grinned and pulled her inside the thick curtain of a weeping ash after hed kissed her he said when are we going to finish the set very soon please her smooth golden face was green in the gloom she looked like a water nymph how was maud ohara she asked seemed pretty unmoored to me said rupert looks as though shed like to tie herself to you were you jealous sarah nodded pity your husbands summer recess coincides with mine hes never away moaned sarah as ruperts fingers moved between her legs why dont we nip into the gazebo got to pick up the children im late already when am i going to see you gasped sarah as ruperts other hand slid down underneath her pants at the back come to ireland with me im leaving on wednesday afternoon i cant my ghastly stepchildren are coming for a couple of weeks on a trial visit i know who its going to be a trial to as well pauls going to gatwick on tuesday to meet them thatll give us at least five hours ring me at home the minute he leaves hulloo called a male voice frantically straightening her dress sarah shot out through the ash tree curtain and bent once more over the fish pond to hide her flaming face wiping off her palepink lipstick rupert followed in a more leisurely fashion sarah and i were talking about horses he told an apoplectic paul if youre going to fork out for a groom feed and grazing for two hunters youre talking about at least fifteen thousand a year better if sarah kept something at my yard well discuss it in our own time thank you spluttered paul we must go sarah back in the conservatory maud was being heavily chatted up by bas shove off bas monica told him declan wants to go and i want two minutes with maud ill come and see you said bas blowing maud a kiss hes very attractive thought maud dreamily but not in ruperts class im sure youre a joiner said monica who was now busily deadheading a paleblue plumbago growing up a whitewashed trellis no said maud im an actress very firmly but charmingly she managed to resist all monicas urging that she should get herself involved in any kind of charity work the children come first said maud simply but two of them are away protested monica and taggies eighteen but still dyslexic sighed maud she needs her mother and of course declan needs his wife but you must do something for charity persisted monica its such a good way of meeting new people and its awfully easy to get bored in the country i never get bored lied maud theres so much to do to the house i cant pass a traffic light at the moment without wondering whether yellow would go with red in one of the childrens bedrooms driving home maud put a hand on declans thigh edging it upwards pixillated by ruperts interest and bass extravagant compliments hazy with drink she felt wildly desirable and alive again lets go straight to bed what about taggie said declan say were both tired declan curled a hand into the front of her black dress they all wanted you did you like that whispered maud i know how hard ive got to fight to keep you he said harshly and felt her nipples hardening back in their bedroom at the priory he undressed her slowly down to her suspender belt and stockings so black against the soft white skin when did you get those bruises she said sharply as he took off his shirt this morning the focking mowing machine kept stopping and i didnt gertrude the mongrel was walked off her feet in the next three days when maud wasnt drifting up and down the valley in a new lilac tshirt and matching flowing skirt hoping to bump into rupert declan was striding through the woods trying to work out what questions he would ask johnny friedlander and driving cameron cook crackers because he was never in when she wanted to talk to him camerons patience was further taxed by her pa getting chickenpox and having to be replaced by daysee butler easily the prettiest girl working at corinium but also the stupidest why dyou spell daisy that ludicrous way snarled cameron because it shows up more on credits said daysee simply like all pas that autumn daysee wandered round clutching a clipboard and a stopwatch wearing loose trousers tucked into sawnoff suede boots and jerseys with pictures knitted on the front its just like the tit gallery with all these pictures floating past grumbled charles fairburn programme day dawned at the priory with declan roaring round the house whatevers the matter asked taggie in alarm i have absolutely no socks no dont tell me ive looked behind the tank in the hot cupboard and in all my drawers and in the dirty clothes basket utterly bloody patrick and utterly bloody caitlin swiped all my socks when they went back so i have none to wear ill drive into cotchester and get you some said taggie soothingly indeed you will not said declan im driving into cotchester and im buying thirty pairs of socks in such a disgossting colour that none of you will ever wish to pinch them again he was very tired he hadnt slept panicking johnny might roll up stoned or not at all and yesterday he and cameron had been closeted together for twelve hours in the edit suite putting together the introductory package rowing constantly over what clips and stills they should use daysee butlers inanities hadnt helped either nor had declans dismissing as pretentious crap an alternative script cameron pretended one of the researchers had written but which she in fact had toiled over all weekend she couldnt run to tony who was in an allday meeting in london but got her revenge while declan was recording his own beautifully lyrical script by making him do bits over and over again because of imagined mispronunciations or technical faults or hangings outside they parted at the end of the day not friends having bought his socks declan arrived at the studios around five a game show was underway in studio the floor manager was flapping his hands above his head like a demented seal as a sign to the audience to applaud midsummer nights dream had ground to a halt in studio because cameron dissatisfied with the rushes had tried to impose an outofhouse lighting cameraperson on the crew who had promptly downed tools the rude mechanicals with no prospect of a line all day were getting pissed in the bar deferential gladtobeofuse deirdre kilpatrick the researcher on cotswold roundup as dingy as daysee butler was radiant was taking a famous romantic novelist to tea before being interviewed by james vereker james will ask you your idea of the perfect romantic hero ashley deirdre was saying earnestly and itd be very nice if you could say you are james which would bring james in i only go on tv because my agent says it sells books said the romantic novelist oooh isnt that declan ohara now he is the perfect romantic hero declan slid into his dressingroom and locked the door a pile of good luck cards and telexes awaited him he was particularly touched by one from his old department at the bbc saying sock it to them daglo yellow sock it to them said declan chucking thirty pairs of socks in luminous catsick yellow on the bed there was a knock on the door it was wardrobe dyou want anything ironed declan peered gloomily in the mirror only my face he gave her his suit light grey and very lightweight as he was going to be under the hot lights for an hour she hung up his shirt and tie then squealed with horror at the yellow socks you cant wear those they wont show said declan in studio two technicians were sitting in declans and johnnys chairs while the crew sorted out lighting and camera angles crispin the set designer whisked about in a lavender flyingsuit the set was exactly as declan had wanted except the charles rennie mackintosh chairs had been replaced by wooden celtic ones with the conic back of declans rising a foot above his head like a wizards chair a symbol of authority and magic as a gesture of defiance on the steelblue tables which rose like mushrooms at the side of each rostrum crispin the designer had placed blueandredstriped glasses and carafes i want plain glasses snapped declan oh theyre so dreary crispin pouted i want them and get rid of those focking flowers cameron ordered them specially declan picked up the bouquet threateningly are you trying to bury me all right no flowers said crispin sulkily at sixthirty there was a very scratchy runthrough cant you ad lib us through your line of questioning asked cameron no you must know your first question depends on his mood may be looped you mean your bloody fault asking a junkie on the first programme declan went off and shook in the mens lavatory for half an hour when he returned to the studio the crew were lining up their four cameras before the meal break have you heard the latest irish joke the senior cameraman was saying there was this paddy who went into a chemist for his heroin fix the crew gathered round grinning at the prospect of more hibernian idiocy halfway though the story the senior cameraman realized hed lost his audience next moment he was grabbed by the scruff of the neck you may be the best focking cameraman in itv roared declan but youll not work on my programme if youre going to tell irish jokes you dont dare tell jokes about jews and blacks or cripples any more why pick on the poor bloody irish with a final shake which threw the senior cameraman halfway across the studio he stalked out ill report you to my shop steward screamed the senior cameraman rubbing his neck in the bar they were gathering to catch a glimpse of johnny friedlander and to support declan by watching his programme there was still a latent esprit de corps at corinium someone had deliberately changed the colour on the bar television so james verekers face looked like a jaffa orange whats your idea of a romantic hero ashley he was saying you are james thats very sweet of you ashley james smoothed his streaks whats romantic about me well youre so caring james and youve got an inner strength like leslie howard turn the sound down screamed a rude mechanical hurling a handful of peanuts at the screen anyone seen declan asked daysee butler putting her top half which had goofy appropriately knitted on the bosom round the door to a chorus of wolfwhistles it was getting perilously close to transmission time in the bog said charles fairburn im surprised he doesnt move his dressingroom in there cant even keep down a brandy declan shouted the senior cameraman you can stop worrying daysees too embarrassed to come in ere but johnny friedlanders people have just phoned to say theyve come off the m and theyll be wiv us in twenty minutes thank christ for that groaned declan and eres a letter for you a piece of writing paper appeared under the door dear declan it said were sorry we was telling paddy jokes we wont any more you was quite right all the crew had signed it ps have you heard the one about the englishman the welshman and the scotsman declan grinned then he glanced at his watch and nearly threw up again hed be on air in less than an hour johnny friedlander arrived in a black limo which seemed to stretch the length of cotchester high street he was accompanied by a publicity girl and four security men in a second limo were four lawyers looking at the bulges in the security mens suits the press allowed johnny to be smuggled into the building without too much hassle from the start johnnys visit to corinium went off with a bang taking one look at the ravishing daysee he pulled her into his dressingroom and locked the door the four security men stood outside with folded arms whos she asked johnnys publicity girl in horror a piece of ass said one of the security men are you quite sure shes not a reporter couldnt report a burglary said charles fairburn whisking past thoroughly overexcited by so much security muscle in his dressingroom a pretty makeup girl with sheep in a field knitted on her bosom fussed around declan he wished he could lie down in her field and go to sleep at least let me paint out the dark rings and give you a bit of base youre so pale she murmured and well have to do something about the beard area you really ought to shave im shaking so much ill cut myself ill shave you next moment cameron stormed in johnny friedlanders barricaded himself into his dressingroom with daysee best place for him said declan at least if hes having a bang hes not snorting coke in his fifthfloor office tony baddingham even more nervous than declan was dispensing krug to his special guests who included several big advertising clients the mayor and mayoress of cotchester and freddie and valerie jones by a ghastly mischance they had also been joined by the reverend fergus penney a former prebendary of the church of england a fearful old prude constantly inveighing against sex on television he had recently become a member of the iba board and was currently on a tour of the independent television companies now primly sipping perrier he kept peering across the corridor to the board room where the press assembled to watch declans first programme on a big screen pulled down against the far wall were getting drunk and stuffing their faces with quiche and chicken drumsticks in a corner of the board room as disapproving as the exprebendary sat johnnys four lawyers also sipping perrier and fingering calculators at the prospect of litigation why the fuck dyou ask so many press tony hissed to cyril peacock who knew hed have been equally roasted if only a handful had turned up nor did the fact that tony had been entirely responsible for hiring declan stop him now blaming everything on simon harris you ought to be able to control declan simon thats what youre here for he hasnt even given cameron a running order all she needs now is a prayer sheet said charles declans my favourite telly star the lady mayoress was saying excitedly to valerie i cant wait to meet him later oh we know him quaite well said valerie jones on the strength of last sundays lunch party he always singles me out because ay tell him the truth ay think famous folk get so bored with flattery a curious tension was building up through the building declans just cut me dead complained james vereker going into the bar awfully uncool to get so uptight daysee came out of johnnys dressingroom looking as though shed found the holy grail hes having a quick shower she said then he wants makeup well send in a boot said cameron we dont want him banging her as well it was five minutes to blast off the four security men had taken up their positions in the studio in the control room the production team sat at a desk like a vast dashboard gazing at two rows of monitor screens on four of the monitors which came direct from the studio cameron could see johnny friedlanders carved beautiful degenerate face with its hollow cheek bones and californian suntan his fair hair was the redgold of willows in winter the irises of the deepset oxfordblue eyes were almost as dark as the pupils thin almost to the point of emaciation he lounged easily in his threethousanddollar suit with the sleeves rolled up to the elbow but the air of relaxation was false why the hell did i agree to do this shit he drawled im sorry said declan meaning it aw thats ok i just dont feel ive got proper lines when theyre my own rupert called by the way he said you can trust this guy hes one of us in his earpiece declan could hear daysee saying the pink strapless is more dressy but my holiday tans nearly gone can we have some level asked the floor manager what did you have for breakfast johnny johnny laughed you want to get me arrested on camerons left daysee was checking different stopwatches the moment they were on air she would forget pink strapless dresses and become as cool as a computer timing the programme to the second on the right sat the visionmixer in a red tshirt hands at the ready over regiments of square buttons lit up like spangles ready to punch up the correct picture when cameron demanded it good luck everyone said cameron crossing her fingers stand by studio stand by opening titles stand by music one minute to air said daysee clenching her stopwatch and glaring at the leaping red number of the clock twenty seconds ten five four three two one and in schuberts fifth symphony started on its jolly jazzedup course on the screen a rocket exploded in coloured stars above a nightlit cotchester and then cascaded down to form the word declan a great cheer went up in the bar tony puffed on his cigar i want another gin and tonic said an already drunk reporter from the mail on sunday shut up said johnnys four lawyers in unison who were listening to the opening package like hawks in the hope of finding something defamatory as daysee cued declan in as a concession to cameron he swung round to talk directly to camera for a moment his throat went dry hes forgotten his first question thought cameron in anguish then he said i welcome my first guest in this new series with the greatest humility he is simply the best actor to come out of america in the last fifteen years but this is the first interview youve ever given he turned to johnny why i hate publicity drawled johnny if all journalists were exterminated life would be just fine up in the board room a howl of protest went up from the press who stopped filling up their drinks and started listening the press detest success went on johnny and they screw up your sex life however much you try not to get fed up it pisses you off when you read lies that your latest girlfriends been twotiming you with some greek masseur every day my exes are offered millions to tell all how dyou cope said declan i dont read press cuttings any more i just weigh them if theyre light i start worrying by deliberately avoiding publicity arent you actually courting it dont give me that crap said johnny lightly and they were off sparring laughing fooling about almost like two old friends discussing someone they knew and liked but frequently disapproved of johnny was being absolutely outrageous now about his exploits with his leading ladies but he drawled out his answers so honestly and engagingly that the press quickly forgave him for his earlier sniping the lawyers were clutching their heads but they were laughing and even the exprebendary was looking moderately benign its going to be all right thought cameron ten minutes to the commercial break declan she said into his earpiece following a tipoff from rupert declan then said and youre about to face your greatest acting challenge johnny raised an eyebrow playing hamlet at stratford next year said declan johnny looked startled upstairs the board room was in an uproar no one knows that screamed the lawyers the goddammed contracts havent been fucking exchanged yet i figured i ought to have a crack at it said johnny women dont get taken seriously as actresses these days until they allow themselves to look ugly and sweaty and get raped on screen guys still have to play hamlet and i like the guy i mean he had a stepfather problem i dont figure claudius bumped off hamlets father at all that was hamlets fantasy he hated his stepfather i hated mine why he married my mother i was jealous he was a basstard why tony drew on his cigar the lawyers fingered their calculators even the press were still declan paused waiting unbearably long on his paleblue island in a sea of dark blue johnny suddenly seemed terribly vulnerable he groped my baby sister the whole time he said so i quit my stepfather called to say my mother was dying of cancer i didnt believe him so i didnt go home johnny put his head in his hands but she did die the next day she topped herself i aint never told no one that why did she commit suicide asked declan quietly johnny looked up his eyes cavernous she was jealous because my stepfather preferred my sister christ what a mess out of order screamed the lawyers apoplectically the prebendary was looking equally outraged are you worried being american you wont be taken seriously as hamlet asked declan relieved at a change of subject johnny fast recovered his poise he was a dane for christs sake he didnt speak like leslie howard in the bar james and the lady novelist exchanged caring smiles its the acting that matters went on johnny i could play him like jr he launched into to be or not to be in broad texan it was so funny the cameramen could hardly keep their cameras still halfway through johnny slid into prince charless accent which was even funnier then for the last ten lines he played it straight and was so good that declan felt his hair standing on end at the end johnny said thatll be five hundred pounds please in a camp cockney accent youll be taken seriously said declan i can switch moods thats why im a good movie actor said johnny but to be on stage four hours thats something else but then ive always lived dangerously declan took a deep breath is that why you went back to america to face trial that is definitely out of order screamed the lawyers positively orgasmic now at the prospect of lucrative litigation we agreed he wouldnt talk about that i went back because i missed the states said johnny he still appeared relaxed but his knuckles were white points as he gripped the arms of his chair have you always fancied very young girls sure if theyre pretty most men do this one was very pretty did you know she was only fourteen the prebendary was about to have a seizure i think you ought to have a word with the control room he spluttered to tony sure i guess it was wrong but she was so sweet i really cared for her i know i screwed her but i dont figure i screwed her up shes very happily married with a baby now how dyou get on in prison johnnys eyes were cavernous again its not a very nice place to be but if youre a famous movie star youre trapped anyway going to gaol is just exchanging one kind of captivity for another and i learnt a lot i could burglarize your place tonight while you were in it and im shithot at insider trading declan stretched out his legs extraordinary coloured socks said the girl from the mail on sunday pouring herself another gin did they give you a hard time inside declan asked johnny not really one guy who couldnt count he thought the girl was four not fourteen worked me over a bit but i made some good friends have you never fancied older women johnny thought for a minute then he smiled wickedly no they have droopy asses droopy asses are so cold in bed the telephone rang in the control room for christs sake get him off sex yelled tony the lawyers are going to take us to the cleaners and fergus penneys having a coronary well lose the franchise if you dont shut him up its a fucking good programme said cameron and hung up then she took the telephone off the hook five seconds to the cue dot intoned daysee five four three two one she flicked the cue switch to warn people all over the network to get ready in sixty seconds to roll in the commercials which were after all the lifeblood of the station as the endofpartone caption came up johnny shot out of the studio saying he must have a leak you stay here cameron screamed at daysee well done declan johnny may not have been able to have daysee in the break but he had certainly taken something in the second half he was even more outrageous but utterly relaxed declan in his wizards chair had only to prompt him here jog his memory there and curb his amazing honesty when he looked like going over the top the floor manager thrust the back of his hand with splayedout fingers towards declan to indicate five minutes more i was on location in texas johnny was saying as he waved his cigarette around staying in my hotel was this glorious german girl she gave me her room number told me to come up in half an hour i must have been looped when i hotfooted upstairs later and banged on her door someone let me in but the room was in darkness oh christ thought cameron whats he going to say well i undressed and got into bed and i reached out and i felt a boob like a wrinkled fig i figured this was odd then moving down i found i could play griegs piano concerto on her ribs so i groped for the light and there were her teeth grinning at me from a glass beside the bed i dont know which of us screamed the louder i mean she must have been ninety if she was a day i mean underage girls are one thing gerontophilias quite another johnny smiled helplessly disgusting spluttered the prebendary and valerie jones in unison anyway i shot down the bed as the security men broke in and the old sweetie didnt give me away i sent her a whole roomful of flowers the next morning and johnny paused wickedly oh christ thought tony as the prebendary turned even more purple she still sends me christmas cards the floor manager was waving a couple of fingers at declan for two minutes more now youre going to play hamlet have you got any ambitions left i guess id like to make a happy marriage said johnny seriously i went to see my grandma the other day shes been married sixty years now that is achievement like building a cathedral brick by brick a real lifes work i guess i wont achieve it but thats what id like aaaaah said daysee butler so moved that she flicked the cue switch too early now declan was smiling and thanking johnny for coming on the programme on came schubert jauntier than ever up rolled the credits but alas because of daysees early cue just as cameron cooks name was about to come up at the end the screen went royal blue and the corinium television logo appeared with the little red ram seeming to hold his horned head even higher than usual a second later they were into the commercials another great roar went up in the bar and the board room even the crew broke into rare spontaneous applause and crowded round declan and johnny upstairs the press raced for the telephones i must talk to declan about those yellow socks im definitely going to do a fashion piece said the girl from the mail on sunday pouring herself another gin great said freddie jones really great congratulations the lawyers came up and pumped tonys hand we were shitting bricks at the end but johnny came across great a really nice guy an attractive guy valerie jones was nose to nose with the prebendary disgraceful she was saying my daughter sharon is only fourteen and when one thinks screw the prebendary said tony five minutes later as he came off the telephone in his office lady gosling thought it was terrific it was said miss madden declan wants a word that was a terrific programme well done said tony picking up another telephone thanks said declan dyou mind if we dont come up johnny doesnt want to see anyone hes reached a stage when he might go right over the top im taking him home for a quiet dinner through the door tony could see the press and even the lawyers getting drunk the prebendary was still nose to nose with valerie corinium had walked a tightrope that evening and got away with it understood said tony ill talk to you tomorrow but congratulations anyway as cameron went into the board room everyone cheered tony even forgot himself sufficiently to march over and hug her his eyes were blazing with triumph lady gosling rang to say how much she liked it she sent special congratulations to you but cameron felt utterly drained and despairing not just because of her lost credit but because she had produced and directed a programme in which shed had no part it had lived and fortunately not died with declan declans first programmes for corinium were a colossal success the press agreed that johnny friedlander was the best interview hed ever done that the ones with jackie kennedy and the princess were even better and the ones with mick jagger and harold pinter even better than that the programmes sold everywhere abroad and there was even talk at the network meetings of moving the series to seventhirty on thursday in an attempt to knock out eastenders declan sweat shirts mugs and posters were selling faster than bikinis in june and schubert must have looked down from heaven and been surprised but delighted to see his fifth symphony galloping up the charts once the first programme was over declan was much less aggressive and uptight and even drank in the bar with the crew but he was no less intransigent about wanting his own way cameron smouldered and bided her time tony was besotted with declan at the moment but knowing the nature of the two men cameron realized it wouldnt last meanwhile although the flood of resignations at corinium had been arrested by declans arrival simon harris was getting nearer his nervous breakdown and the staff were muttering even more mutinously into their glasses of sancerre at the bar sinister that cameron was about to be put on the board but to stop cameron getting smug tony ever the bubblepricker finally invited the ravishing sarah stratton to lunch and arranged for james vereker to interview her in the behind every famous man series early in november cameron was livid and vented her rage on the rest of the staff the same week sarah was due to be interviewed tony summoned declan to his office hows your cold declan asked miss madden as he walked through the outer office much better said miss madden flushing how amazing of you to remember better hurry camerons in there already cameron was lounging menacingly by the window wearing a black polo neck black leather trousers and spiky high heels declan wondered if she walked all over tony in bed in them the room was full of cigar smoke tony was drinking a brandy but didnt offer declan one sit down congratulations to both of you he said briskly ive just heard off the record that we got our highest local rating ever for your interview with the princess declan sank into one of the low squashy sofas which with his long legs were desperately uncomfortable unless one was lying down tony leant back in his chair cameron and i have decided its time you spread your wings declan declan looked wary wed like you to interview maurice wooton this week hes not big enough said declan flatly lord wooton was a highprofile cotchester property developer but of little interest nationally and im already doing graham greene this week thats ok said cameron do lord wooton as a special after the ten oclock news on friday night why cant james do him james is already doing sarah stratton in the famous man slot on cotswold roundup besides we want you im only contracted to do one interview a week dont worry said tony well pay you extra we just want you to get really involved in the station i dont have the time it was so hot in tonys office that declan could feel his shirt drenched in sweat thats what researchers are for said cameron as though she was explaining to a twoyearold deirdre kilpatricks been working on maurice wooton all week shes come up with some terrific stuff after all she added tauntingly a guy as great as henry moore wasnt too proud to employ studio assistants like a dog struggling out of a weedclogged pond declan heaved himself up from the squashy sofa i do my own research he said coldly and walked out hooray thought cameron its begun to work on thursday morning cameron rang declan at home it was his official day off hed stayed up until four in the morning reading graham greene inspired he was determined to spend the next two days on his yeats biography and here was camerons horrible rasp ordering him to come into a meeting tomorrow at eleven oclock so we can kick some ideas around about the line you might take with maurice wooton declan hung up on her when he hadnt shown up by eleventhirty the following morning cameron rang the priory in a fury she got maud who said she was sorry but declan was in bed at this hour is he ill not at all said maud hes reading put him on declan told cameron to go and jump in the river fleet and that hed no intention of coming in for any meeting tony then rang declan and ordered him to come in that evening and interview maurice wooton declan having just received an eightythousandpound tax bill which he had no way of ever paying unless he went on working at corinium said hed be in later but wouldnt submit questions beforehand he slid into corinium around two oclock when he knew cameron and tony would still be at lunch and went down to the newsroom to talk to sebastian burrows the youngest brightest and therefore most frustrated of the reporters deirdre kilpatricks been working like mad on your maurice wooton interview said seb deirdre killprogramme said declan seb grinned you can say that again maurice is emerging as a total sweetie you got any dirt on him asked declan hes one of tonys best friends isnt that enough not quite anything concrete sebastians thin face lit up ive got enough to send him down for ten years but i darent use it give it to me said declan im going out on the same friday rupert campbellblack having spent all week in meetings with the fa and the club managers trying to thrash out some suitable compromise on football hooliganism decided he felt like a pit pony who needed a day off and went hunting with basil baddingham scent was very bad however it rained all day and the foxes sensibly decided to stay in their earths having reboxed their horses rupert and bas got back to ruperts darkblue astonmartin to find the windscreen covered with leaves like parking tickets removing their drenched red coats and hunting ties and putting on jerseys they drove home through the yellow gloom who shall we do this evening said bas who was feeling randy no one sighed rupert ive got my red box to go through and ive got to look in at some fundraising drinks party pity said bas slyly i was going to show you the most amazing girl thats different said rupert where does she live penscombe priory thinking bas meant maud rupert said isnt she a bit long in the tooth for you no im talking about the daughter said bas shes absolutely stunning back at the priory grace the housekeeper who was making ridiculously slow progress sorting out the attic stumbled on a trunk of mauds old clothes maud who had just finished her last p d james and was suffering from withdrawal symptoms wandered upstairs and started trying them on now she was parading round in a blackandredstriped mini which fell just below her groin and showed off her still beautiful legs i remember walking down grafton street in in this she said and an american clapping his hands over his eyes and screaming oh my gard can they go any higher my hair was down like this maud pulled out the combs so it cascaded down her back i was only twentyfour you dont look a day more than that now amizing said grace oh i adored this dress too maud tugged a sapphireblue mini with a piefrill collar out of the trunk i wore it to patricks christening i wonder if i can still get into it fits you like a glove said grace who was trying on a maxicoat amizing as maud admired herself in an ancient fulllength mirror propped against the rafters she heard gertrude barking not displeased with her appearance she went downstairs then paused halfway below her in the hall she could see two heads one very dark the other gleaming blond her heart missed a beat maud yelled bas are you in im up here said maud with the light behind her bas looked up caitlin he said i thought youd gone back its me maud came slowly down the stairs grice and i were being silly trying on my old clothes how old were you when you first wore that about twentyone you look about sixteen today said bas kissing her flattery will get you an enormous drink i assume thats what youve come for grice maud yelled up the stairs can you come down and fix some drinks ill go and change dont said rupert i bet declan fell in love with you in that dress im quite safe he went on also kissing maud some bloody hunt saboteur sprayed me with antimate this afternoon wheres declan asked bas as they went into the kitchen ordered in to do an extra programme said maud getting a bottle of whisky out of the larder my evil brother got the screws on him already asked bas have you got anything to eat im absolutely starving theres some chocolate cake and a quiche in the larder said maud splashing whisky into three glasses have a look and see what you can find rupert prowled round the room there was a huge scrubbed table in the centre of the room with chairs down either side poetry and cookery books crammed the shelves in equal proportions a rockinghorse towered over gertrudes basket in the corner aengus the cat snored on some newly ironed shirts by the aga on the walls were drawings of maud in juno and the paycock and a corkboard covered with recipes and photographs of animals cut by taggie out of newspapers apart from a television set on a chest of drawers every other available surface seemed to be littered with letters bills colour swatches photographs waiting to be stuck in dog and cat worming tablets biros that didnt work newspapers and magazines nice kitchen said rupert its like the room described by somerville and ross when they were packing up before moving said maud under everything theres something valerie jones who dropped in half an hour later didnt think it was a nice kitchen at all she was shocked to find maud showing at least six inches of bare thigh and rupert and basil with their longbooted legs up on the table all getting tanked up on declans whisky rupert was eating bread and bramble jelly and reading the problem page in jackie bas was finishing up the remains of a mackerel mousse with a spoon gertrude eyeing the remains of the quiche and the large chocolate cake was now sitting drooling on the table on a pile of unironed sheets which would no doubt go straight back on the beds thought valerie with a shudder valerie herself natty in a ginger tweed suit and a deerstalker said she had just been to a distressed gentlefolks committee meeting with lady baddingham and deciding to straike while the iron was hot had looked in to see if maud had any jumble for the xmas bazaar next month having just moved you must have lots of old junk to throw out only her husband said bas starting on the quiche hush reproved maud softly funnily enough ive just been trying on all my old clothes this was the dress i wore at patricks christening the priest gathered up my skirt with the christening robes by mistake and all the congregation were treated to the sight of my red pants valerie didnt want to hear about mauds pants then you must have lots of jumble she said i never throw clothes away said maud well ive brought you a brochure of our autumn range said valerie determined to turn the visit to some advantage kind said maud chucking the brochure into the débris on the welsh dresser have a drink aym driving have you got anything soft said valerie not round here with maud wearing that dress said rupert cutting himself a piece of chocolate cake ill have a tea then said valerie and id love a piece of that gâteau and those bramble preserves look quite delicious taggie picked the blackberries down your valley we ought to give you a pot maud said to rupert as she put the kettle on she felt wildly happy at that moment grace walked in wearing mauds red and black mini this is amizing grice said maud amizing said grace gazing at rupert in wonder im just off to that lecture on glassblowing at the womens institute maud she went on see you later i didnt know there was a wi meeting tonight said valerie perplexed straight up to the pub explained maud as the front door banged its not a very good idea to be on christian name terms with ones help said valerie reprovingly we dont really do it in gloucestershire you know bye grace have a good evening yelled rupert valeries small mouth tightened watching maud pouring boiling water over a teabag she hoped the mug was clean this quiche is seriously good said bas and for christs sake leave some of that chocolate cake rupert did grace make it enquired valerie maybe grace was more of a treasure than she had at first appeared grace cant cook a thing said maud taggie made all this she wants to break into catering and do peoples dinner parties shed better come and work at the bar sinister said bas darling i wondered where youd got to he swung his feet off the table and stood up as taggie came in she was very pale with her hair in a thick black plait down her back and wearing one of declans red shirts above long long bare legs hullo she said in delight to bas then embarrassed that he aimed straight at her mouth turned her head slightly so he ended up kissing her hair at that moment over his shoulder she saw rupert she gave a gasp of horror and turned as red as her shirt to valeries equal horror maud removed the teabag from valeries tea with her fingers then she introduced taggie to everyone smiling at valerie but totally ignoring rupert taggie took a tin of baked beans out of the fridge and started to eat them with a spoon im sure weve met before said rupert puzzled youre not a young conservative are you then suddenly he twigged and started to laugh i remember now it was at a tennis party taggie blushed even deeper brilliant quiche stunning mousse marvellous chocolate cake said bas with his mouth full oh it was for daddys supper began taggie distressed then stopped herself sometimes she could murder her mother she was about to go upstairs when bas grabbed her hand and sitting her down beside him tried to persuade her to work for him at the bar sinister its really kind of you mumbled taggie but i worked in a restaurant for two years i want to branch out on my own you can come and cook my breakfast any day of the week said rupert she looked so different from the angry child whod screamed at him about his stubble you were quite right he added to basil again taggie ignored him its very good of bas said maud with a slight edge to her voice most girls would leap at a job like that i always had to deemphasize my career for declan she added fretfully taggie however was totally thrown she couldnt take in what bas was saying she was only conscious of this horrible monster whod haunted her nightmares for weeks whom shed last seen oiled brownskinned erect in every sense of the word and as totally unselfconscious of his nakedness as a zulu chief and who was now drinking her fathers whisky and laughing at her across the table out of sheer nervousness she leapt up and turned on the television pratt yelled rupert as james vereker appeared on the screen over at corinium television sarah stratton sat in hospitality going greener perhaps that was why it was called a green room and wishing shed never agreed to go on jamess programme the appalling deirdre killprogramme as everyone called her now had visited her at home earlier in the week and worked out lots of questions that james could ask sarah to promote discussion and bring in jamess caring nature paul furious that sarah had been asked on and not him went on and on about how her high profile wouldnt help his career at the moment he was also furious that shed spent a fortune for the occasion on a new black mohair dress with daisies embroidered on the front and huge padded shoulders which she was not sure suited her thank god rupert was at some tory fundraising bash at the moment and wouldnt watch the programme earlier james had paid a fleeting visit to hospitality to say hullo rather like a famous surgeon in an expensive hospital popping in before he removes half your intestine ushered into the studio during the commercial break sarah was now sitting on the famous palepink sofa beside him catching sight of herself on the monitor she wished she hadnt worn the mohair it was much too hot and the padded shoulders made her look like an american footballer on rushed the makeup girl to tone down her flushed face collar up james said wardrobe i did it deliberately tessa said james thought it looked more casual remember to look at me not the camera sarah she was desperately nervous which didnt help glancing round at the idiot board to find out what question he was supposed to ask her first he saw chalked in large letters james vereker cant do his programme without having a bonk first turn it over hissed james as a burst of cotswold roundup theme music signified the end of the commercial break sarah who had also seen the idiot board screamed with laughter and it was thus that the viewers had their first glimpse of her sarah stratton said james reading from the turnedover board youve been married to paul stratton our member for cotchester for nearly nine months now how do you see your role as the wife of an mp sarah sarah straightened her face to support my husband in every possible way she said gazing straight at the camera in the oharas kitchen rupert turned up the sound isnt that lizzie verekers husband said maud i like lizzie shes lovely said rupert if she lost three stone id marry her james is hell said basil put him in front of a camera you cant get him down with a gun some viewers may find the following scenes disturbing said rupert sarahs nervous look at the way her eyes are darting and shes licking her lips looks bloody good though whatever she thought to the contrary sarah looked stunning on camera she was now saying how hard it was falling in love with a married man i put no pressure on paul to leave his first wife she said demurely bollocks howled bas she carried a chisel round in her bag for years trying to chip paul off like a barnacle but because he did eventually leave her for me went on sarah and he made the decision im branded a scarlet woman with some justification said rupert and her husband is as mean as the grave its so hard to get a drink in his house the pm ought to make him the minister for drought which is not something anyone could accuse you of maud darling he added as maud splashed the last of the whisky into his glass taggie who was ironing sheets was as perplexed as rupert had been earlier im sure ive seen her somewhere before she muttered then once again went absolutely scarlet as she realized that sarah was the beautiful blonde whod been playing nude tennis with rupert shes quite excellent at ball play said rupert reading taggies thoughts and youre going to burn that sheet furiously taggie went on ironing fortunately a diversion was created with valerie asking how caitlin was getting on at upland house it seems more like st trinians than enid blyton said maud caitlin says they all smoke like chimneys and have bottles of malibu under the floorboards but i had a nice halfterm report from her house mistress saying caitlin was a dear girl whod settled in well but was too easily satisfied not something her future husband is going to grumble about said rupert who was watching taggie he liked making her blush caitlins like taggie said maud watches too much television sharons only allowed to watch occasionally at weekends said valerie smugly when i was young my sister and i made our own amusements so did i agreed rupert until nanny told me it would make me go blind ignoring him valerie thought how much more attractive was james with his charming boyish smile than rupert who was always leading freddie astray and making risqué remarks james winding up sarahs interview asked her if she had any plans for a career you must know as a very famous man yourself sarah answered admiringly that wives of famous men have to take second place it is possible to be famous and caring sarah said james huskily of course said sarah im just saying if you marry someone whos been married before youre just that little bit more anxious to make the marriage work to not put your own career first to prove everyone wrong who said it wouldnt last so you just try harder taggie was shocked how could sarah say that when she was busy having an affair with rupert it was only after a few minutes taggie realized that valerie was telling her all about the boutique you must pop in some time said valerie i know its difficult dressing when youre so tall but im sure i could find something lovely for you thats really kind said taggie gratefully rupert watching taggie decided she really was very beautiful it was as though someone had taken a fine black pen and drawn lines along her lashes and round the irises of those amazing silvergrey eyes her nose was too large but the curve of the soft pink mouth emphasized by the very short upper lip was adorable and hed like to see all that lustrous black hair spilling over a pillow she must be nearly five foot ten he reckoned and most of it legs and she had the gentle apologetic clumsiness of an irish wolfhound who cant help knocking off teacups with its tail noticing rupert observing taggie with such lazy almost lustful affection maud felt a stab of jealousy go and get another bottle of whisky from the larder tag she said sharply and clear away all these plates but its daddys last bottle protested taggie furious maud turned on her as if your father would deny a guest a drink in his own house trembling taggie switched off the iron fetched the bottle from the larder and dumped it on the table with a crash gertrude was whining by the back door ill take you out darling said taggie pulling on a pair of black gumboots do wrap up warm said valerie and if you want to get on in the country you should wear green wellies she added kindly if you really want to get on in the country drawled rupert you should get that dogs tail straightened it was the final straw giving him a filthy look taggie went out slamming the back door behind her whats up with her asked bas in love said maud unscrewing the bottle of whisky some friend of patricks who hardly knows she exists you know how moody teenagers are outside it was deliciously mild the wind was shepherding parties of orange leaves across the lawn and sighing in the wood the stream after the recent rain was hurtling down the garden above russet clouds like stretched cotton wool didnt quite cover the sky every so often through a chink glittered a brilliant star still shaking taggie tramped down the rose walk that so often in the past must have been paced by nuns like her praying for deliverance oh please god get that horrible horrible man out of the house she couldnt stop thinking of ruperts lean oiled body under the darkblue jersey and mudspattered white breeches it was obvious her mother was wildly attracted to him shed seen the rapt expression the flushed cheeks the wild drinking so often before and rupert was leading her mother on making those beastly salacious there at last shed used her word for the day remarks and drinking all her fathers drink and eating all his supper despite the mildness of the night she shivered as she contemplated the rows ahead if maud started one of her things she taggie would get dragged in to provide alibis well she wouldnt cover up for her mother this time she wouldnt she wouldnt her father didnt want hassle at the moment he needed keeping calm turning towards the house its great battlements and turrets confronting the shadowy garden with a timeless strength she felt slightly comforted surely the house would look after them after cotswold roundup james and sarah both feeling rather elated were soon cut down to size what did you think of the interview cameron asked james id rather watch slugs copulate snapped cameron sarah in turn rang paul was i ok she asked eagerly you were very clear said paul have you seen tony yes said sarah sulkily did he say anything about putting me on the board no said sarah come and have a drink said james as she slammed down the receiver yes please said sarah soon after taggie took gertrude out valerie went home maud basil and rupert carried on carousing going into the kitchen much later taggie was relieved to find only bas and maud daddys interviewing lord wooton in a few minutes she said my husband maud told basil always becomes the person hes interviewing when he did margaret thatcher he spent the week wearing power suits talking about circumstarnces and calling me denis in bed noticing taggies look of disapproval basil patted the chair beside him and said the interview should be interesting as tony was pulling out every stop to get maurice wooton to join the corinium board rupert returned from the downstairs loo waving the new statesman dont tell me declan reads this he said in outrage maud nodded and actually believes it but he cant be a socialist when he earns such a vast salary i know sighed maud hes utterly inconsistent i expect hed like to give some of it away protested taggie angrily if everyone didnt spend it all if you cant keep a civil tongue in your head snapped maud youd better go to bed shed never known taggie answer back like this over in studio declan always went into himself before a programme but he nodded when tony came on to the floor reeking of brandy and waving a huge cigar tony was in an excellent mood two of coriniums news stories had been used with a byline by itn hed just had an excellent dinner with maurice wooton and now hed got his way about declan doing this interview it was the thin end of the wedge declan couldnt refuse to do other specials now freddie jones next week perhaps maurice is just having a pee hes been madeup he said to declan give him a nice easy ride he may have a reputation as a hatchet man but he runs a huge empire hes devoted to his grandchildren and does an enormous amount for charity hes also delightful if you get him on to opera or his cats just show his caring face declan said cameron from the control room and camera can you try to avoid lord wootons bald patch tonights vision mixer sitting in front of her row of litup buttons massaged her neck and opened a kit kat it had been a long day daysee butler fingered her stopwatch in his earpiece declan could hear her talking about her boyfriend hes cooking supper for me tonight cod in cheese sauce out of a packet hes got such charisma lord wooton was now being ushered in by the floor manager he had plainly had too much to drink with tony but makeup had toned him down with green foundation and blacked out his greying sideboards his revoltingly sensual face with the big red pouting lower lip was just like one of tonys orchids thought declan as he rose to his feet to welcome him very warm night said lord wooton very said declan the introductory package which cameron had written was full of nice stills and clips of lord wooton romping with cats visiting children in hospital playing cricket with grandsons watching the first bricks of various buildings being laid and collecting an obe at the palace he was plainly delighted dont know where they dug up all those old photographs he said untruthfully ten seconds to end of opening package declan said daysee from the control room surreptitiously declan removed his earpiece and put it in his pocket his first question was sycophancy itself as the leading property developer in gloucestershire probably the whole of the west country you must be proud of your achievement maurice wooton put his hands together happily one is only as good as the people who work for one declan he said smoothly you must know that i have firstrate people handpicked of course pity you dont take better care of them said declan amiably he then proceeded to carve maurice wooton up starting with one of his managers whod been sacked while he was in hospital recovering from openheart surgery then proceeding to another whod been given no compensation when he broke his back falling off some scaffolding tony rang cameron in the control box what the fucks going on he roared tell him to ask maurice about his fucking grandchildren i cant get through to him yelled cameron hes taken out his earpiece well tell the floor manager to tell him to put it fucking back in again ignoring all maurice wootons spluttering denials declan moved on to illegal takeovers shady deals and then produced a justpublished secret town hall report which claimed that despite a huge grant from the council his firm had built a block of flats cheap to faulty specifications temporarily speechless now maurice wooton was mouthing like a great purple bull frog another even more unattractive aspect of your business career went on declan relentlessly was the way you bribed three labour councillors in the housing department at cotchester town hall to give you the contract for the tower block development on bankside this is preposterous exploded maurice wooton you deny it of course i do out of the corner of his eye declan could see the floor manager making frantic signals for him to replace his earpiece ignoring them he said why then do councillor bridie councillor yallop and councillor rogers have five thousand pounds entered on their bank statements paid in by you from a swiss bank account here are the photostats of the bank statements the cheques and your letters to them declan brandished them under maurice wootons hairy expanding crimson nostrils then threw them down on the table thank god there are some town hall officials left with integrity cameron was so insane with rage she stubbed her cigarette out by mistake on the hand of the vision mixer who screaming pressed the wrong button which ran in telecine of a lot of very fat schoolgirls doing an eightsome reel go back to one take fucking one screamed cameron the schoolgirls disappeared in middance to be replaced by maurice wooton standing up and shouting at declan that the whole thing was a trumpedup pack of lies and he was going home to ring his lawyers next moment hed stormed out leaving the studio in uproar declan sat turned to stone in his chair to their great disappointment coriniums viewers were then treated to soothing music and a film showing closeups of cotchesters wild flowers so they missed tony roaring into the studio so angry he could hardly get the words out ive spent five years courting that man he spluttered he was just about to join the board and put fifteen million into our satellite project declan rose to his feet towering over tony you should have given me time to research him properly he said coldly i might have found something nice to ask him but i doubt it and with that he walked out of the studio back at the priory rupert wiping his eyes turned to maud that was the best television programme ive seen for years and free schoolgirls thrown in too after tony baddingham maurice wooton is without doubt the biggest shit in england and your husband is the first socialist ive ever really admired the corinium switchboard must be absolutely jammed or preserved as dear valerie would say with congratulatory calls at that moment the telephone rang rupert picked it up brilliant programme said a voice its the western daily press is declan in what did i tell you said rupert handing the receiver to maud dont look so cross he added to taggie ill nip home in a minute and get your father another bottle after rupert had returned with the whisky and he and bas had left taggie watched her mother go to the hall mirror fluff up her hair on top and smooth the dress over her hips before sitting down at the drawingroom piano she must be very drunk thought taggie judging by the number of wrong notes what on earth could she give her father for supper she wondered wearily as she started to load the washingup machine perhaps she ought to accept bass offer of a job and get out and meet people she couldnt eat her heart out for ralphie for ever she heard the front door bang going into the hall she saw declan gazing into the drawingroom at maud playing schumann in the dress shed worn when they were first married living blissfully on no money in ireland her hair almost touched the piano stool putting his hands on her shoulder he said why did you put that on grice and i were tidying away some of my old clothes you look beautiful schumann halted abruptly as declans hands slid under the piefrill collar lets go to bed as maud walked upstairs in front of him his hands slid up between her bare thighs christ youre wet maud smiled sleepily ive been thinking all evening about your coming home tony would have sacked any other member of his staff for savaging maurice wooton like that as it was he spent the weekend poring over declans contract with the lawyers unfortunately there was no clause about not presenting his victims with unpalatable truths so in the end tony merely wrote declan a sharp note accusing him of misconduct and warning him that if he stepped out of line a second and third time hed be out on his ear tonys guns were further spiked by the government immediately ordering an investigation into cotchester town halls housing policy and by the very favourable press coverage of the programme and corinium in particular corinium show their teeth at last wrote the western daily press corinium prove theyre no longer a tory poodle wrote the guardian hardest for tony to take was an enthusiastic telephone call from the iba splendid stuff tony no one can accuse you of political bias now the following wednesday there was a corinium board meeting tonys temper was not improved when one of the nonexecutive directors old lady evesham vice chancellor of the local university arrived on her bicycle in the pouring rain just as tony rolled up in the rolls why did the stupid old bag always arrive an hour early and go nosing round the office talking to staff and stirring up trouble hoping shed go away tony cringed behind the financial times next minute she was tapping on the window grudgingly tony lowered it a few inches congratulations said lady evesham thrusting her wrinkled whiskery muzzle towards him that interview with maurice wootons the sort of thing we should be doing all the time routing out injustice mans a rogue i shall seek out declan and tell him so in person tony however had other things on his mind in the same telephone call praising declans interview the iba had complained that corinium still wasnt giving sufficient attention to the southampton end of the area charles fairburn has just finished a programme on isaac watts tony had countered swiftly whos he asked the ibas head of television famous philosopher poet teacher tony hastily consulted the advance programme notes watts square in southampton is named after him wrote oh god our help in ages past thats not much help in ages present said the iba people in southampton will hardly regard one hour on the sunday godslot as good enough were talking about news coverage there was nothing for example about hms princess michael of kent catching fire at the docks on friday the bbc devoted seven minutes to the story ill look into it said tony as a result of this conversation tony summoned his two most valuable executive directors who usually worked in london but who had come down for the board meeting into his office beforehand known as beauty and the beast georgie baines and ginger johnson looked after sales and finance respectively gorgeous georgie who had big brown eyes and even bigger expenses was up to every single fiddle and lived in the big advertising agencies pockets which he lined as effectively as his own he also made vast sums of money for corinium ginger johnson the beast was a thug with carroty hair and a beetroot face like a particularly unappetizing winter salad as financial director he saw that the vast sums netted by georgie were administered as remuneratively as possible all the most important business on the agenda was always done by the three men before the board meeting going into tonys office that wednesday georgie and ginger found him looking at a map of the area if were going to hang on to the franchise said tony weve got to be properly represented so said georgie whod heard this all before were going to build a studio here tony jabbed the red dot of southampton with his finger cost a fortune said ginger aghast even a small studioll set us back five million we dont need a studio there nor do we want to make any more programmes said georgie programmes cost too much money the iba will love the idea said tony happily more programmes more employment better coverage we dont have to actually build the fucking thing but if we wave board sanction and some provisional architects plans under the ibas nose itll keep them quiet until the franchise is in the bag im sure the board wont wear it when were slashing budgets everywhere else said ginger leave it to me said tony tony was at his best and his most urbane at board meetings on his right and left sat georgie looking beautiful and ginger looking ugly beyond them sat simon harris who never spoke and miss madden taking the minutes beyond these two down the long elm table sat members of the great and the good including an mp for stroud a winner at badminton a famous composer who lived in oxford an educationalist from stratford a bishop a famous footballer and several industrialists who lived in the area and of course lady evesham as the meeting got under way everyone expressed great satisfaction at the kudos declans programmes had given corinium resolutions were then passed budget cuts agreed lady evesham then held up the meeting for at least twenty minutes first she handed round marmite sandwiches having risen at six to write her biography of emily pankhurst she was very hungry then she raised a complaint from an unnamed young woman researcher actually deirdre kilpatrick whod been denied the right to breastfeed in the newsroom oh christ thought tony glaring at simon harris typically it was simon who had given deirdre the goahead to bring her baby in because he thought bonding was all important deirdre had then proceeded to whip out great grey tits all over the building as the coup de grâce baby kilpatrick had regurgitated milk into one of the newsroom word processors just as charles fairburn was showing the bishop of salisbury round the building charles had promptly fainted and tony had banished the baby now tony cleared his throat i told the girl not to bring her baby in any more he said to lady evesham it was quite old enough to go on the bottle and shes got a perfectly good nanny at home it distracted my reporters in the newsroom surely they should be above that kind of distraction said lady evesham frostily this is the twentieth century if one girl is allowed to bring her baby in they all will the famous footballer who was given to ribaldry then said it was always the ugly old feminist boots who wanted to breastfeed in public if the pretty ones wanted to do it none of the blokes would mind he received a stony glare from lady evesham tony who thoroughly agreed with the famous footballer but had to pretend to look disapproving thought it was high time lady evesham resigned and cameron who wouldnt stand any truck with breastfeeders took her place on the board saying hed look into it tony moved briskly on to the subject of cutting costs he then proceeded to bore the meeting rigid with details of expenditure on stationery and calculators and whether it was really necessary to supply the sales staff with portable computers everyone glazed as he compared the merits of endless different models it was two minutes to one hearing the chink of bottles in the directors diningroom next door everyone perked up a delicious smell of boeuf wellington drifted under the door well thats all for the day said tony then as everyone dived for their bags and briefcases he added except for one item that may not be on everyones agenda the proposed new studio in southampton the question of our not giving sufficient attention to the southampton end of the territory has been raised before hear hear said the footballer whod once played for the saints youve all agreed the idea of a new studio in principle went on tony the directors scratched their heads had they they were instantly distracted by another waft of boeuf wellington the building of the studios will create a lot of employment in the area said tony briskly weve got a costing which can be easily accommodated within the budget ginger he cocked an eyebrow at ginger johnson easily said ginger and youre for it georgie very much so said georgie who was lost in admiration simon simon harris had been so unnerved by the breastfeeding incident that he nodded even before tony got his name out oh look its snowing said the footballer distracting people even further everyone else in favour tony smiled down the table lady eveshams was the only dissenting hand good said tony gathering up his papers come and have a drink everyone and meet declan ohara any further thoughts about studios evaporated as they surged next door there was great excitement at corinium the following wednesday when dame nellie finegold a friend of lady evesham and one of the last surviving suffragettes whod agreed to come on declans programme that evening dropped dead from a heart attack even greater excitement was caused when the prime minister who was in gloucestershire opening a new hospital and later dining with the cotchester regiment graciously agreed to step into dame nellies shoes to balance declans extremely favourable interview with the leader of the opposition the previous week the prime minister appreciating the value of preaching to eighteen million viewers thought she could handle declan her one condition which tony leapt at was that declan should submit questions first and make an undertaking not to depart from them this is our chance to nail him tony told cameron gleefully if he submits questions today we can insist he does the same for all future interviews then we can manipulate him to our own advantage youve seen how lethal he can be with maurice just think what havoc he could cause in an election year declan looked tired and tense as he walked into tonys office waving a sheaf of the prime ministers cuttings tipping back his chair tony stretched his legs and gazed consideringly at him for a moment this is a big day for you declan declan grunted im very much looking foward to shaking her by he paused the neck now now said tony lets keep it all sweetness and light the pms only coming on the programme if she knows exactly what youre going to ask her and no funny business said cameron dont be ridiculous snapped declan why should she be treated differently to anyone else because shes the pm dumbass and the iba is ultimately answerable to her so shes got to be kept sweet not by me she hasnt dont be so fucking pigheaded screeched cameron an almighty row followed ending in declan flatly refusing to do the interview and walking out cameron and tony exchanged glances of joy and horror what the hell were they going to do the prime minister was already in the area she was due at the studios at sevenforty to go on air at eight the network had been trailing declans dramatic change of guest since lunchtime james will have to do it said tony but we wont announce the change of plan until just before transmission or well lose the audience in his office having just rewritten his links for cotswold roundup james switched off the wireless because he was fed up with hearing declans signature tune turning to his fan mail he found a letter from sarah stratton thanking him for his standard letter thanking her for coming on the programme nice bold handwriting thought james he was sure those huge loops to the ls meant something during their drink at the bar hed decided she was very attractive and wondered by what ruse he could see her again but a second later as cameron burst into his office his thoughts were only for one woman the prime minister deirdres working on your questions at the moment said cameron weve got to rush them over to the pm at gloucester so she can look at them while shes changing we should be able to let you have them about five if youve got any questions to add let deirdre know heres a brief of what the pms been up to in the last two months but youre pretty well briefed anyway arent you james blushed it was the first compliment cameron had ever paid him i thought declan was doing this interview declans sick said cameron seriously said james trying to look suitably caring not nearly seriously enough said cameron viciously as soon as shed gone thanking god hed had his hair streaked last week james rang lizzie ill be late ive got to interview the pm my god ask her when she last got laid dont be silly this is for real im sending a driver over for my blue suit and could you put in my jadegreen silk shirt and the sapphireblue tie and could you phone the strattons and ask them to record the programme he wanted sarah to witness his hour of glory i dont trust our machine one hundred per cent you mean you dont trust me to remember thought lizzie cameron popping in to the studio later on her way to the control room was nearly knocked sideways by aramis shes arrived tonyll bring her through in a minute are you nervous not yet said james replumping cushions on the pastelpink sofa nice change from declan said cameron good luck perhaps hed maligned cameron thought james as he combed his hair for the hundredth time and removed the shine on his nose with nouveau beige creme puff he used to use gay whisper but had decided the name had rather unfortunate connotations the prime minister like most women had a weakness for charming handsome men seeing her appearing through the black curtain radiant in darkblue taffeta being guided over the cables and uneven surfaces by tony james leapt to his feet for a second diorella fought with aramis aramis won easily welcome to cotchester prime minister i cant tell you how privileged i feel to meet you said james giving her the benefit of his beautiful aquamarine eyes now subtly enhanced by the jadegreen shirt and the sapphireblue tie then when she offered him her hand he bowed his streaked head and kissed it reverently silly cunt muttered the senior cameraman come and sit down said james down came the famous bottom on the pastelpink sofa ill leave you in good hands prime minister said tony indeed lord baddingham said the pm in her low voice the interview was pure barbara cartland aware no difficult questions would be forthcoming the pm was at her most relaxed and charming and unbent to james as shed never done before on television prepared only to see the steely side of your character prime minister some people make the ridiculous mistake of thinking you dont care about the unemployed or the old and povertystricken mr vereker the prime ministers voice dropped an octave if only you could realize the sleepless nights we spend worrying about hypothermia particularly with another winter coming on how many more times is the stupid asshole going to use the word caring snarled cameron to tony whod stayed with her in the control room hush shes really unbuttoning purred tony during the commercial break the pm became positively skittish theyll be into heavy petting in a minute said cameron as james leant forward in sycophantic ecstasy at the end of the second half the prime minister even shed tears as she talked of her worries as a mother but you are a mother to all of us said james handing her his aramisscented handkerchief pass me the motion discomfort bag groaned cameron its good said tony should win her a lot of votes ten seconds to out james said cameron flicking on the key switch close the programme thank you prime minister for showing us your caring face said james and please come back to cotchester again soon as the credits went up they could be seen laughing and joking together im going to frow up said the senior cameraman come back declan muttered the floor manager nothing needed to be forgiven i would love a tape of that programme mr vereker said the prime minister outside a second corinium camera crew filmed her departure lethargically cheered by a handpicked crowd of corinium staff i hope we get overtime for this said charles fairburn waving a union jack as a jubilant james cameron and tony accompanied the pm down the steps settled in her car ready to depart to a late dinner with the cotchester regiment the pm wound down her window i hope mr ohara feels better soon she said earnestly this flu virus can be very pulling down about time the mighty mr ohara was pulled down from his seat said cameron as soon as she had driven off what a caring lady sighed james he woke next morning to find himself temporarily famous both the bbc and itn picked up the interview which was fulsomely praised the next day by the tory press only the mirror and the guardian grumbled that james had let the pm get away with murder by friday the story had got out that declan hadnt been ill at all but had simply refused to do the interview with the prime minister the rows begin again said a huge headline in the sun at the bbc and around the network people smirked knowingly theyd known the honeymoon wouldnt last declan was having a row about money with maud in the kitchen when the telephone rang yes he snapped this is valerie jones said an ultrarefined vaguely familiar voice yes said declan who was no wiser we met at lady monicas buffet luncheon i was wearing a cricket jumper oh yes declan twigged the extremely silly midon fredfred and i were wondering if you could come and dayne on december th thats tomorrow week just a few close friends tony and monica baddingham declan had heard enough he was sorry he said but they had a previous engagement maud was absolutely furious we never go out she stormed how dare you refuse for me i might have wanted to go it was that horrendous dwarf we met at the baddinghams bound to have been hell there might have been other amusing people there how can we ever meet anyone if you turn down everything mauds sulk lasted all day declan was trying to get to grips with the volatile volcanic personality of john mcenroe who was coming on the programme on wednesday mauds black mood permeated the whole house and totally sabotaged his concentration at dusk unable to bear it any longer he went downstairs and apologized im sorry it was selfish of me i must work but you go on your own i hate it but ive got to get used to it are you lonely he went on as maud clung to him dyou want to go back to london she shook her head violently i just miss my friends i was wondering if we could give a tiny party for patricks birthday on new years eve declans heart sank not really not this christmas we simply cant afford it its his twentyfirst pleaded maud hes always had such lousy birthdays having them so near christmas just the tiniest party half a dozen couples taggie can do the food itll be good training for her shes not getting any response from those cards declan was about to say they still hadnt paid for the fulham farewell when the telephone rang again taggie picked it up in the kitchen five minutes later she rushed pinkfaced with excitement into the drawingroom the most ppprodigious her word for the day thing has happened valerie jones got one of my cards and shes asked me to do her dinner party next friday isnt it prodigious it is indeed said declan disentangling himself from maud and hugging her she asked us said maud fretfully what are you going to cook for her that we wont get ive got to go over tomorrow and discuss menus said taggie maud seized her chance daddys agreed we can have a little party for patrick on new years eve said maud ignoring declans look of horror so you can start thinking up some nice food for that taggies already euphoric face lit up even further what a prodigious idea upstairs in her turret bedroom she clutched herself pressing her boiling face against one of the thin cool ecclesiastical windows if patrick was having a party how could patricks best friend not be there she was going to see ralphie again cooking for valeries dinner party was taggies first big job but her nerves were nothing to valeries valerie was livid with freddie for asking rupert who was coming down to gloucestershire for a constituency meeting and to present the cup at the cotchester bristol football derby originally he was supposed to be bringing some french actress but shed got stuck on location in scotland so valeried had to find a spare woman at the last moment she settled for cameron cook who had just won an american award for a documentary about arranged marriages which shed produced last spring having talked to her briefly at declans first programme valerie had no idea she was tonys mistress and now valerie wouldnt stop flapping round the kitchen tasting and criticizing everything taggie was making a soupçon more cayenne in the cucumber sauce agatha or fretting whether they should have cheese before pudding or who should sit next to whom it says she announced poring over the etiquette book that the most important man should sit on my right thats me said freddie roaring with laughter dont be silly fredfred snapped valerie and dont pick that fish pâtés champion said freddie whod only been allowed a small salad at lunch are you going to be all day with that dessert agatha said valerie beadily looking at the huge ice cream and meringue castle around which taggie was curling whipped cream to simulate pounding waves the place is a fraightful mess i promise ill clear up in time everythings done but this people were due at eight to eightthirty to dine at nine the pheasants simmered with cranberries and ginger had to go in at six fortyfive youve still got the menus to write out one for each end of the table said valerie it would be naice to have them in french taggie went pale she couldnt even spell them properly in english shed always had trouble with pheasant she started to shake im going to check the rest of the house said valerie the lounge looked beautiful shed got florists in to provide two beautiful pink arrangements the diningroom was also a symphony in pink with a centrepiece of roses valerie adored pink it was so feminine and went so well with her mauve velvet evening gown with the flowing skirt and the trumpet sleeves she was glad they werent having soup freddie drank it so noisily shed worked out where everyone was going to sit now standing at the end of the table valerie practised her commands bring in the appetizer please agatha take away the entrée agatha bring in the dessert then there was the tricky bit catching all the womens eyes she glanced at alternate chairs shall we go upstairs what happened if that awful rupert read the message wrong and followed her upstairs too he was quite capable for safety shed better say shall we ladies go upstairs weve got a right one ere said reg the hired butler who was already well stuck into the mouton cadet yakking away to herself in the diningroom what am i to do about this menu said taggie helplessly ill help you im doing french for olevels said sharon the daughter of the house whod inherited her fathers bulk and his sweet nature im sure the french for pheasant is payson mrs makepiece valeries daily whod come to help with the washing up was just raking the shagpile in the lounge flicking away nonexistent dust when valerie rushed in and realigned the tatlers and harpers leaving the gloucester and avon life specially open at a picture of herself at the nspcc fashion show in cheltenham it was seven oclock shed better take a bath and change in the kitchen taggie finished the pudding and put the pheasants into the oven she must remember to add chopped dill to the prawn sauce she wished valerie hadnt wanted things quite so elaborate everything was going swimmingly until valerie came down dressed and insisted taggie put on a maids black dress and a white apron which came miles above her blackstockinged knees and then made her put her hair up even taggie baulked at the white maids cap i expect you to answer the door said valerie supervise everything in the kitchen and wait at table youre in the army now sung reg the hired butler now on his third bottle will you come and watch dynasty with me sharon asked taggie youre not watching rubbish like that sharon youre to hand round nibbles and make yourself pleasant snapped valerie nearly jumping out of her skin as music blared out from the speakers all over the house its daddys signature tune said taggie in delight turn that horrible din down fredfred screamed valerie monica loves classical music said freddie oh well leave it on then the doorbell rang go and answer it agatha put the mens coats in the downstairs toilet and the ladies coats upstairs in the master bedroom and then direct them towards the lounge where mr jones and i will receive them it was paul and sarah stratton for a second taggie and sarah stared at each other remembering their previous encounter on ruperts tennis court then with a wicked little smile sarah took off her red velvet cloak her tan had gone but a black taffeta dress offtheshoulders and with a bustle showed off her beautiful opulent figure never having seen paul before taggie thought he looked dreadfully old and careworn to be married to such a glowing overexcited young girl the next arrival was cameron cook who taggie recognized from declans description and tried not to hate declan had omitted to say she was so beautiful and wonderfully dressed this evening in a darkred smoking jacket and black tie with a wing collar her hair sleeked back to show off her smooth white forehead and thick black brows she looked straight through taggie and having no coat to take stalked past her into the drawingroom she was shortly followed by tony and monica tonyd been away at a conference and for once because he was cleaning up coriniums act hadnt taken cameron with him now he was unflatteringly unpleased to see her the big smile he switched on like a light bulb switched off as though thered been a mega powercut he always felt twitchy when cameron and monica were in the same room and even worse cameron it seemed had been invited for rupert his old rival and there was declans bloody signature tune blaring out he was still extremely off declan but his hopes of having a good bitch about him this evening had been foiled by the presence of declans stupid daughter this music is wonderful exclaimed monica come and see it in action said freddie bearing her off to witness the electronic wizardry in his study have you got any wagner said monica next moment to valeries horror siegfrieds funeral march pounded deafeningly through the house what the hell are you doing here hissed tony to cameron i was asked said cameron coldly we must be very careful of course said cameron holding her glass out to reg for an instant refill we mustnt jeopardize the franchise valerie was telling paul about the house we replaced those dreary old mullioned windows with picture windows how on earth did you get planning permission said paul in horror i thought this was a listed building grade said valerie smugly fredfred has friends in high places please god dont let the sauce curdle prayed taggie in the kitchen as she added egg yolks and vinegar door love said reg giving her a pinch on the bottom you look much the sexiest of the lot it was lizzie and james whod plainly had a row because of lizzies catastrophic navigation james loved making an entrance but not arriving half an hour after his boss who was looking bootfaced and standing as far away from cameron as possible talking to paul stratton james immediately gravitated towards sarah and thought how nice it was to see cameron out of her depth socially and for once rather insecure lizzie who looked awful shed worked too late on her novel again and had not had time to wash her hair had brought some bantams eggs for freddie and valerie and was thrilled to see taggie i know itll all be delicious dont worry valerie looked at her watch yet again quarter past nine and no rupert doesnt matter said freddie filling up everyones glasses nice to relax on a friday freddies equipment is quite staggering said monica returning from the study sarah caught lizzies eye and giggled mashing the potatoes in the kitchen taggie was going frantic everything would be ruined unless they ate soon off you go said reg as the doorbell rang crimson with rage and embarrassment bending her legs to make her maids dress look longer taggie answered the door grinning rupert walked into the hall called any good fire engines lately would you like to take off your coat said taggie stiffly id much rather take off your dress said rupert you look like the object of all redblooded mens fantasies im late id better go and make my peace valerie hid her rage less well than taggie rupert where have you been cameron choked on her champagne having never actually met rupert and having been poisoned by tonys almost pathological jealousy shed expected him to just be another loudmouthed upperclass english shit in the flesh he was glorious and much more americanlooking than english having apologized to valerie rupert turned to kiss monica you havent met cavendish cook have you rupert said monica how do you do sir said rupert admiring camerons smoking jacket cavendish works for tony went on monica i gather you won another prize last week cavendish jolly good show i meant to watch the programme last summer but unfortunately they were doing meistersinger on bbc the same night and i was videoing that as well as watching it james was in ecstasy cavendish cook there were some advantages in monicas addiction to bbc after all seeing sharon sneaking through the hall towards the kitchen valerie gave an eldritch screech sharon sharon come in here and give auntie monica some nibbles she keeps sloping off to watch dynasty she added to monica i wont have my kids watching soaps oh i love dynasty said monica smiling at sharon do tell me whether blake and crystal have made it up rupert walked over to james who was still talking to sarah that was a bloody good interview you did with the pm he said and she thought you were marvellous asked me for your address so she could write to you james whod always hated rupert melted faster than a snowball in the microwave then rupert turned to sarah kissing her white shoulder evening my darling thats an incredibly sexy dress i dont know why you bother to wear any clothes at all bloody cold outside i think its going to snow i can never get home if it snows grumbled james im thinking of installing a putyouup in my office seeing tony was still talking to paul rupert said tony baddinghams got a putyoudown in his office cameron laughed james who was not going to be egged on to bitching about tony in front of cameron said i always feel tony is much maligned i entirely agree said rupert draining his whisky but not nearly enough sitting next to rupert at dinner sarah found herself talking gibberish the awful thing about adultery she thought was that one had to remember in public that one hadnt heard things that ones lover had told one in private i saw your behind every famous man interview with james said rupert as he unfolded his napkin very good were you nervous desperately said sarah blushing as they had discussed the whole thing and how ghastly james had been at length in bed yesterday afternoon and because under the table ruperts hand was already creeping up between the slit in her skirt sarah found it impossible not to giggle i think ive found you a horse went on rupert giving her his blank blueeyed stare then he solemnly proceeded to describe it down to its last fetlock as hed also given her the same details yesterday she found it even more difficult to keep a straight face particularly as paul pretending to listen to valerie had ears on elastic trying to hear what they were saying fortunately distraction was provided by taggie bringing round the fish mousse not remembering her left from her right having served monica she moved backwards to serve james clockwise screeched valerie there was another awful moment for taggie when she saw rupert and lizzie having hysterics over the menu gingered french peasant cravat sauce and desert château translated rupert our hostesss french is slightly stratford atte bowe whispered lizzie whats that said valerie sharply from the other end of the table for a second lizzie caught taggies anguished eye and instantly identified the author of the menu just saying how good your french is she said to valerie valerie nodded smugly crusty bread anyone she cried waving the basket i will not have white bread in this house i love it said freddie wistfully so do i said rupert ill send you a loaf for christmas sitting opposite tony trying desperately not to catch his eye cameron longed to be able to sparkle and scintillate but how could she with paul stratton on one side watching his wife like a warder and james on the other talking about himself hows your series on caring for the elderly getting on she asked james brightened we think weve found a presenter at last a mrs didbody shes a seventyfiveyearold coloured lady a widow with a daughter of fifty which makes her a single parent added james triumphantly a real franchise grabber said cameron who was watching rupert he was easily the most attractive man shed seen since she came to england probably ever it was a combination of elegance deadpan arrogance and a total inability to resist stirring things up he was plainly having it off with sarah stratton what exactly are electronics monica was saying to freddie in her piercing voice what exactly dyou do cameron saw a look of fury on tonys face but freddie seemed delighted by her interest i make everythink really videos televisions synthesizers compact disks floppy disks silicon chips i always muddle up silicon with cellulite said monica with my computers went on freddie proudly scientists on the ground can place satellites in orbit all satellites now carry my computers on board good heavens said monica she could see now how useful freddied be to tony tony was not enjoying himself it was one of lifes ironies he thought that at dinners like this monica always sat next to all the brilliant achieving men who usually didnt interest her at all although she did seem to be having fun with freddie and he got stuck with their unachieving wives lizzie vereker on his left looked a complete mess that was delicious she said taking another piece of bread to wipe up the last vestiges of prawn sauce did you make it she asked valerie slyly yes said valerie as taggie was out of the room hows archie lizzie asked tony doing business studies for alevels said tony with a grin which he thinks allows him to tell me exactly where im going wrong in running corinium the only time hes nice thought lizzie is when he talks about his children sharon is doing the dream for her olevels said valerie ringing a bell taggie who was chopping parsley for the courgettes threw down the knife and ran into the diningroom tugging down her horribly short dress can you clear away the appetizer agatha said valerie returning to the kitchen with the plates taggie found reg the butler very drunk now carving the pheasants she wished he wouldnt cut quite such huge slices there might not be enough to go round tender as a womans kiss said reg helping himself to a slice youre another mrs beeton agatha oh it does look yummy can i have a bit said fat sharon have some later said taggie as she poured the sauce over and scattered parsley over the courgettes i must take it in ill take round the courgettes said sharon who wanted to gaze at rupert taggie took the pheasant round the right way this time she noticed rupert still had his hand inside sarahs slit skirt the revolting man but had to remove it to help himself to pheasant was she imagining it or was he deliberately rubbing his black elbow against her breast as he did so when she took round the potatoes she stood as far away as possible arching over him like a street light as she moved down the other side of the table his wicked dissipated blue eyes seemed to follow her making her even more hot and bothered reg was taking round the mouton cadet now and had reached valerie we had sharon in she was telling paul and we were married in er watch it said reg giving her a great nudge rupert grinned broadly sarah and lizzie giggled valerie knowing one must behave with dignity at all times ignored the innuendo that will be all reginald and agatha ill ring if anyone wants second helpings were televising midnight mass at cotchester cathedral this year said tony as he put his knife and fork together im reading the first lesson are you reading the second he asked paul knowing he wasnt no said paul looking very put out well be away i wonder who is reading it then said tony i am said rupert you said you were going skiing said an unguarded sarah i mean she added looking thoroughly flustered you said youd be away at christmas there was an awkward pause this pheasant is wonderful said lizzie ill give you the recipe if you like said valerie dont pick your bones fredfred she snapped then stopped hastily as she saw that rupert was picking his all the same it was going wonderfully well reflected valerie later as taggie cleared away the cheese board everyone was talking like mad and seemed to enjoy the novelty of the men moving two places on it was a good thing rupert was sitting next to cameron now whod seemed rather out of it earlier in five minutes taggie would bring on the moated castle turning to cameron rupert thought how different she was to sarah as lean and hungry as sarah was replete and voluptuous im dying to have a pee he murmured just for an excuse to prowl round and see what a ghastly cockup our hostess has made of a onceravishing house i used to come to childrens parties here i cant imagine you as a kid i always cheated at doctors and nurses across the table he noticed sarah deliberately flirting with james to make him jealous perhaps or to put paul off the scent to valeries disapproval cameron got out a cigarette picking up a pink candle rupert lit it for her you hunt with the same pack as tony she asked sometimes said rupert softly sometimes after the same quarry looking round at his suddenly predatory unsmiling face she felt a quivering between her legs christ she wanted him dyou want a lift home he said no she could have wept i brought my own car the lotus said rupert she nodded nice corinium perk said rupert instantly returning to his former flippant mood i see james has finally got himself a porsche ill have to get rid of mine i dont know much about horses murmured cameron frantic to hold his attention except my bosss wife looks like one you wont oust her by bitching said rupert then aware that tony had suddenly stopped talking to sarah and they were both listening he said there are three things you need in a horse balance quality and courage same as a woman really id add intelligence said cameron i wouldnt dont you like achieving women i dont like ballbreakers there was a chorus of oohs and aahs as taggie came in with the moated ice cream castle it was the last lap once shed served this and cleared away she could relax what dyou do at corinium rupert asked cameron as he idly watched taggie moving round the table she was bright pink in the face her tongue clenched between her teeth in her efforts to hold the pudding steady any makeup had sweated off her dark hair was fighting the pins that held it up but nothing could disguise the length of leg or the long dark eyelashes or the voluptuous swell of her breasts she was going anticlockwise again but most people were too plastered to notice i produce declan said cameron why dont you come on the programme what said rupert dragging his thoughts back from taggie come on the programme im sure you and declan would strike sparks off each other i dont want to said rupert flatly i dont need that kind of wank and youd never hear any chat above the rattle of skeletons tumbling out of cupboards having just served valerie taggie was moving slowly round towards him how dyou get on with declan he asked cameron wickedly utterly obnoxious said cameron he really pisses me off rupert watched taggie to see if shed rise very pretty he said examining the pudding feel i ought to get planning permission before i dig into this thanks angel he added helping himself to a piece of battlement and a dollop of cream ignoring him taggie moved round to his other side to serve cameron how on earth does declans wife put up with him asked cameron youd better ask taggie said rupert mauds her mother cameron paled visibly noticing taggie for the first time she tried to remember what ghastly things shed said about declan im sorry i didnt realize in embarrassment she helped herself to too much pudding the whole thing swayed rupert could smell taggies body could feel how hot and nervous and trembling she was her skirt was so short almost without thinking he put a leisurely hand between her thighs the next moment taggie gave a shriek and dropped the very considerable remains of the pudding all over camerons sevenhundredpound smoking jacket and black satin trousers you stupid bitch screamed cameron forgetting herself what the fuck dyou think youre doing in tears taggie fled to the kitchen remembering one must behave with dignity at all times valerie swept an almost hysterical cameron upstairs lizzie turned on rupert you bastard she yelled dont you realize this was her first job shes been trying to break into catering for months she cooked like an angel and you had to fuck it up with looks like that said rupert retrieving pieces of broken plate from the floor i wouldnt have thought a career was that important dont be so fucking insensitive didnt you know poor darling taggies dyslexic cant you imagine how ghastly it is being the only unbright one in such a brilliant family oh christ said rupert truly appalled i simply didnt know it was entirely my fault freddie i couldnt resist goosing your cook but really you shouldnt have dressed her in such sexy clothes id better go and apologize leave her bloody alone said lizzie rushing out to the kitchen to comfort a sobbing taggie who was being ineffectually patted by a swaying reg go and get a cloth and a dustpan and brush and clear up the mess lizzie told him and give everyone another drink there there duck she hugged taggie im so sorry i wanted everything to be perfect for mrs jones sobbed taggie you mustnt worry it was the most marvellous food anyones had in years lizzie pulled off a piece of kitchen roll to dry taggies eyes ruperts a bastard he just cant resist a beautiful girl cameron is changing into one of my geowns said valerie sweeping in im so sorry mrs jones said taggie in a choked voice i was just telling her how brilliantly she cooked said lizzie valerie was livid shed been shown up as not doing the cooking at all pull yourself together agatha she said sharply go and collect the rest of the plates and see if lord baddingham and miss cook would like some fresh fruit as they didnt get any dessert cameron got her just dessert giggled lizzie i cant go back in there said taggie aghast you will said valerie if you want to work for me again in the diningroom james was furious with lizzie for making such a fuss over declans idiot daughter and sarah was furious with rupert for so openly groping taggie shed tried to be laid back about her affair with him but now all she could feel was a redhot lava of jealousy pouring over her tony on the other hand was delighted by the turn of events childs clearly overemotional and unbalanced like her father he kept saying bloody good cook said freddie and when taggie very tearstained and head hanging brought in a bowl of peaches and grapes monica leaned out and squeezed her hand delicious dinner my dear ive got a girls lunch next week perhaps youd like to help me out with that nothing elaborate very cosy ill ring you tomorrow gulping gratefully taggie said shed love to attention was then taken off her by the return of cameron wearing one of valeries black geowns it was perfectly frightful with a bow on the bum and much too tight i prefer you as a bloke said rupert wiping a blob of cream off her chair im desperately sorry mumbled taggie as she passed cameron ill pay for it you couldnt begin to hissed cameron dont be a bitch said rupert sharply putting a hand on taggies arm he said im really sorry angel it was all my fault taggie didnt say anything but seemed to shrink away james sidled up to valerie one of my programmes is on in a minute would anyone mind if i slipped upstairs and watched it of course said valerie in fact i think ladies well all go upstairs cameron got her own back by flatly refusing to go and staying to drink port with the men little good it did her tony got freddie in a corner and persuaded him to have lunch immediately after christmas to discuss his joining the corinium board and leaving cameron with the frightful paul rupert went off to the kitchen here he found taggie loading the washingup machine and making coffee go away she sobbed youre the most mmmmalefic man ive ever met ere ere groaned reg from underneath the kitchen table the following monday declan stormed into camerons office without knocking you were at valerie joness dinner party right said cameron coolly inside she quailed wondering if taggie had told declan how shed screamed and sworn at her and how earlier shed bitched about declan to rupert i gather taggie tipped the pudding over you im sorry said declan if you cant get the marks out ill be happy to refund you it was no big deal said cameron absolutely weak with relief i took them along to the cleaners on saturday theyll be just fine then well pick up your cleaning bill rupert can bloody well do that declans face hardened the bastard poor little tag she was distraught she did really well protested cameron feeling she could afford to be generous the food was terrific and monica asked her to do a lunch for her i know monica rang on saturday that cheered taggie up it was all ruperts fault said cameron deciding to put the boot in wait till i get my hands on the bastard why dont i ask him on to your programme said cameron idly thatd be a much more subtle way of burying him declan paused in his prowling and thought for a minute it was violently against all his principles to ask someone deliberately on to the programme in order to do a hatchet job he really screwed her up insisted cameron who wanted an excuse to ring rupert all right said declan even tony was temporarily roused out of his antideclan mood bloody good idea if declan does a maurice wooton on rupert ill double his salary cameron rang rupert im just checking out on your availability over the next few months you should have come home with me on friday said rupert because he was horrendously busy and not given to introspection and would much rather spend any spare second in gloucestershire on constituency work or with his children or his horses or in bed with sarah stratton rupert then told cameron he had no intention of going on declans programme cameron played her trump card ill tell declan youre too chicken that nettled rupert dont be silly all right ill think about it and with that cameron had to be content as christmas approached declan grew more depressed he was totally disillusioned with tony he felt like a damsel in distress who having been rescued from the bbc by st george had promptly been put on the game not a day passed without some loaded request to open monicas christmas bazaar for the distressed gentlefolk or draw the raffle at the nspcc ball tickets seventyfive pounds each or take part in coriniums pantomime to help the aged or turn on the lights in cotchester declan refused them all which increased tonys animosity and enabled james vereker to step caringly into his shoes the implication was the same if you bothered to make use of our excellent research team you could pull your weight as a member of the corinium team sapped by endless rows declan was aware his programme was losing its edge he was still very high in the ratings but he knew people were beginning to turn on in the hope hed be better this week desperate for some kind of intellectual satisfaction he was getting up at five every day to spend three or four hours on his yeats biography but was too drained to make any real progress he was also grimly aware that he wasnt paying enough attention to maud after a long bout of lethargy excited about caitlin and patrick coming home for christmas she was having one of her spates of frantic energy which invariably involved spending money she came to the office christmas party and charmed absolutely everyone patrick arrived the next day walking through the door slightly drunk with four suitcases of washing is this the priory laundry why did you come by taxi asked maud flinging her arms round his neck because i wrote off the golf yesterday at that moment caitlin rang from school patricks home said maud in ecstasy well he can come and collect me in the golf the minis too shaming christmas eve saw scenes of frantic revelry at corinium the whole building thrummed with lust seb burrows from the newsroom scaled the front of the building when drunk and placed charles fairburns russian hat on one of the red horns of the corinium ram another joker put rainbow condoms on the horns and tail of the bronze corinium ram in the board room just before tony ushered in the local representative from the iba for a christmas drink secretaries with tinsel in their hair ran shrieking down the passage blowing squeakers just as james vereker passed the board room door carrying a pile of christmas presents from caring fans out to his car four shrieking secretaries converged on him and unzipped his flies his trousers dropped to reveal seasonal boxer shorts covered with santas just as tony was ushering the iba man out tony was absolutely livid but not so livid as cameron whod opted to work over christmas for want of anything better to do when she discovered tony had dispatched miss madden to choose christmas presents both for her and monica i bought two diamond bracelets whispered miss madden conspiratorially i thought you might like to choose first ill take the bigger one said cameron grimly james was even more annoyed to find that declan had ten times more christmas cards than he had and that the christmas tree in reception completely obscured jamess framed photograph declans photograph had been deliberately left unhidden for all to admire despite being horribly broke declan sold a first edition of trollope and gave everyone who worked on his programme including cameron a christmas pudding and a pep pill for christmas he also took them out to a splendid lunch at the dog and trumpet outside cotchester whose manager subsequently barred anyone from corinium television from ever crossing the threshold again as the senior cameraman pointed out you dont need directions to go to one of coriniums christmas parties just follow the blue flashing lights afterwards they all congaed down cotchester high street back to the office where declan found charles fairburn who was meant to be organizing the live transmission of midnight mass from cotchester cathedral that evening drinking cointreau and doing his expenses russian hat wrote charles dinner with dean and chapter dinner with chapter the trouble with you declan he said shaking his head is that youre not creative enough in your expenses in the newsroom the corinium weather man leant out of the window at sunset just to check that the forecast he was about to give on air of a very fine evening was correct next moment he received a bucket of cold water over his newly washed hair its raining you berk shouted a voice from above declan took a box of chocolates up to miss madden whod always been nice to him after shed thanked him profusely she confided that her nephew who was a chorister had been chosen to sing a solo at midnight mass my heart felt like bursting with pride and i wanted to cry at the same time she said cotchester by midnight with the golden houses and the great cathedral floodlit was at its most beautiful the huge blue spruce just inside the cathedral gates which was normally a glorious sight festooned with fairy lights at christmas was sadly bare this year because the conservationists headed by simon harris had claimed the lights were harmful to it the church which was lit by candles white fairy lights on the christmas tree and television lights was absolutely packed with people hoping both to appear on television and to catch a glimpse of declan ohara tony read the first lesson and stumbled twice to his entire staffs delight rupert read the second in his flat drawl and hardly a girl in the congregation except taggie didnt long to have him in her stocking the following morning please god if you think its right give me ralphie prayed taggie caitlin taking communion couldnt stop thinking about aids but she knew one had to swallow three pints of saliva before one caught it as she clumped down the aisle in her new black suede brothelcreepers and her wildly fashionable daglo catsick yellow socks she could have sworn rupert was looking at her in the long wait while everyone else took communion patrick also wearing wildly fashionable daglo catsick yellow socks held out a cracker and caitlin pulled it with a loud bang i wonder if aengus and gertrude knelt down at midnight to honour the birth of christ said patrick as they drove home far from honouring anyones birth sulking at being left behind aengus had knocked off and smashed several balls from the christmas tree and gertrude had opened three presents from underneath and also chewed the label off a small parcel for taggie inside was the most beautiful silver pendant inlaid with amethysts on a silver chain she gasped as she slowly read the note darling taggie im sorry ive been such a sod have a lovely christmas see you on new years eve all love r oh its beautiful she said with a sob and fled upstairs clutching herself in ecstasy outside the stars and the new moon seemed to be shining just for her ralphie had remembered after all and in seven days shed see him again by new years eve the christmas decorations at the priory were sagging the evergreens had brewers droop and wandering aengus having smashed every coloured ball on the christmas tree had taken up crashlanding in the christmas cards outside a force five gale hurricane fiona as patrick had called her was rampaging up the valley rattling the windows and howling down the chimneys on the lawn a huge pinkandwhitestriped marquee heated by gas burners wrestled with its moorings perhaps we could enter it for the americas cup said caitlin we can line all the drunks round the bottom to hold it down said patrick taking another slug of moët youll be one of them if you dont stop knocking back that stuff said caitlin reprovingly its my birthday everyone is entitled to behave appallingly on their birthday oh ive got the keyheehee of the door never been twentyone before he was extremely happy because unknown to his father his mother had given him a new golf for his birthday as maud had gone off to the hairdressers and to pick up a new dress that was being altered patrick and caitlin carried on doing the seating plan she had started taggie had tried to write names on some of the cards but was in such a state of excitement about ralphies arrival that her spelling had gone totally to pot worried about the marquee coming down she had gone off to ring the firm whod put it up her arms ached from mashing the potato for a dozen enormous shepherds pies she seemed to have put crosses in a million sprouts and peeled a billion grapes for the fruit salad the garlic bread lay like a pile of silver slugs in its aluminium foil the turkey soup only needed heating up the kedgeree for breakfast was in four huge dishes on top of the deep freeze with cucumber prawns and hardboiled eggs ready chopped to add at the last moment patricks birthday cake in the shape of a shamrock rested in the fridge an extension lead still had to be found for the disco a bulb was needed for the outside light and caitlin still hadnt written out large cards to show people where the loos were and where to hang their coats but things were gradually getting under control taggie had never felt so tired in her life she had cooked herself into the ground but she kept telling herself that if she got through everything and didnt grumble god would reward her with ralphie back in the marquee caitlin was hastily rewriting new name cards for people taggie had seriously misspelt monknicker baddingham she giggled do lets leave that one put monknicker on daddys right ill put joanna lumley on his left he needs some fun said patrick although as its my birthday i ought to have her next to me look screeched caitlin utterly bloody mummys put rupert campbellblack next to her im bloody sitting next to him removing the card from mauds right she bore it off and placed it reverently beside hers three tables away and behind a huge flower arrangement so her mother couldnt spy in fact she scribbled ruperts name on to a second card im going to put him on both sides of me so theres no slip up looking at his place patrick noted that he was sitting next to lavinia his current girlfriend and someone called sarah stratton oh ill swap her said caitlin seizing sarahs card shes ancient at least twentysix i was rather excited by the sound of her said patrick mum said she was very beautiful and voluptuous with a rich crumbling husband my only answer is to marry a rich wife i wish pa would cut me out of his will if i inherit all his debts im finished oh well ill swap sarah back again said caitlin ive put tag next to ralphie patrick shook his head i wouldnt he and georgina harrison have been inseparable all term hes bringing her tonight well why did he send tag that amethyst pendant then and apologize for being such a sod sounds most unlikely last week he couldnt afford to buy his mother a box of handkerchiefs for christmas and he still owes me fifty pounds are you sure it was ralphie quite sure the twotiming shit shut up shes coming i got through to the tent man hes coming over he says theyre going all round gloucester doublechecking their erections said taggie with a giggle then turned pale as the doorbell rang but it was only two young pink and white old etonians who were doing the disco and maud back from the hairdressers with her hair set in a mass of snaky curls it looks lovely mummy said taggie it looks gross muttered caitlin the telephone rang it was bas baddingham darling maud may i bring my new new lady of course said maud more the merrier damn she added as she put down the telephone another really attractive spare man paired up who the hells going to dance with cameron cook you havent asked her said taggie in horror thinking of the wrecked smoking jacket daddy cant stand her how many dyou reckon are coming said patrick giving a glass of moët to each of the pink and white etonians who were both staring at taggie about two to three hundred said maud airily but we havent hired nearly enough plates or knives or forks or anything said taggie aghast or got anywhere to seat them maud turned to patrick pop across the valley to ruperts and borrow some she said i didnt know he was coming too whispered taggie even more horrified i thought he was away skiing hes come back specially for the party said maud dreamily it was too windy for him to land the helicopter but ive just seen him driving through penscombe well if theres nothing else for me to do im going upstairs to paint my nails as she went out running her eyes over the table seating she caught sight of ruperts cards on both sides of caitlin tearing one up in a rage she put the other back on her right you will not sit next to rupert caitlin youre going to sit next to archie baddingham and like it she turned back to taggie has grace made up the beds for all patricks friends someone insulted her in the pub at lunchtime said taggie introduced her as declan oharas scrubber so shes gone to bed in a huff well get her up snapped maud at least youve got valerie joness char and her two children and that butler reg and his friends coming to help but you better make up some more beds they can all sleep in armchairs said patrick soothingly as he gathered up his new car keys ill go and borrow those plates from rupert ive made up a bed for ralphie in the spare room said taggie blushing at sixthirty declan returned home having recorded an interview with the bishop of cotchester which he was aware was totally lacking in sparkle he had been wracked with increasing foreboding during the day as one person after another charles fairburn james vereker simon harris daysee butler and then horrors cameron cook and tony baddingham said theyd see him this evening maud had obviously got tighter than hed realized at the corinium christmas party but he never expected the frantically billowing pink and white tent on the lawn or the tables laid for two hundred people or the disco boys checking acoustics or the three hundred bottles of moët on ice in various baths round the house roaring upstairs he found maud lying on the bed naked except for a face pack and an optrex eyepad what the fuck is going on do you want to ruin me he slammed the door behind him in the drawingroom below a group of patricks glamorous friends whod just arrived and were having a drink could see the mistletoe hanging from the chandelier trembling beneath declans demented pacing then they heard maud screaming oh dear sighed caitlin daddy doesnt seem in a party mood upstairs taggie was frantically making up beds for patricks friends perfectly happy to sleep together in the narrowest of beds all term at trinity dublin now they were sleeping in the house of one of their friends parents all the girls overcome by a fit of morality said they wanted separate rooms the din was increasing in her parents room maud was careful not to be too provocative she didnt want her eye blacked eyeshadow and mascara were more becoming peace on earth and mercy mild god and sinners reconciled sang caitlin outside the door shut up you two youre upsetting gertrude taggie could hear another lot of patricks friends arriving downstairs crying happy birthday running to the banisters she could see patricks exquisite girlfriend lavinia giving him a present she was followed by a beautiful dark girl and behind her taggie caught her breath just under the mistletoe in the hall stood ralphie he seemed to have got even more beautiful with his big blue eyes and blond curls in a panic she rushed back into the spare room put another log on the fire and rearranged the christmas roses in the blue jug beside the bed at least they had curtains in this room and a really comfortable bed for ralphie and perhaps her taggie clutched herself she must not be presumptuous there was a knock on the door come in croaked taggie hanging on to the mantelpiece for support the beautiful dark girl shed seen in the hall came through the door she was very slim and tiny not more than five foot one oh what a lovely room she said dumping a squashy bag and a black ruched dress on the bed and a fire too you are kind will i be able to have a bath of course stammered taggie but it may not be a hot one you must be taggie said the girl you look just like patrick oh look at the lovely christmas roses you shouldnt have bothered taggie blushing so hard she felt she could fry an egg on her face said actually this is ralphies room and mine said the girl happily im georgina harrison ralphies girlfriend patrick had never seen such grief taggie seemed almost deranged her whole body shuddering and shuddering with sobs i cant bear it i cant bear it i love him so much angel i know you do but really its not on hes frightfully shallow and youre simply not his type its not anything youve done youre just too large for him its like expecting a chihuahua to mate with a wolfhound well not quite but being small he feels daunted by tall girls he said to me last summer your sisterd be absolutely heartbreaking if only she were tiny i cant shrink go off and nibble a mushroom dont make jokes sobbed taggie sweetheart youve got to pull yourself together and get dressed mum and dad have stopped rowing but theres no way they can organize the grub mrs makepiece has arrived with two frightful teenage children and grace and reg the butler and his friends are all getting stuck into the moët you must go down and supervise them now be a good girl and dry your eyes im not twentyone every day maud had the ability to make houses look beautiful there were no curtains on the windows but huge fires crackled in all the downstairs rooms which were lit by hundreds of red candles and decorated by huge banks of holly yew and laurel she was also totally unfazed by being a hostess or by the frightful row shed just had with declan she had certainly never looked more beautiful the medusa curls had dropped a little after her bath and framed her pale face to which the heat from the fires had given a touch of colour she was wearing a very lowcut ivygreen taffeta dress with a bustle which brought out the witchy green of her eyes and clung to her figure shed lost seven pounds hardly eating a thing over christmas pearls gleamed at her wrists her ears and her throat if she couldnt ensnare rupert tonight she never would new dress snarled declan tying his black tie in the drawingroom mirror oh this old thing said maud mockingly the old things in the dress said caitlin sourly pinching some of her mothers scent she had seen the bill for the dress and really thought her mother had overdone it this time why did she need to spend that much money on clothes when shed already got a man caitlin was worried that her father was deliberately setting out to get drunk and even more worried about poor old taggie but at least at a ball with hundreds of people taggie might meet someone new pretend its a job pretend its a job taggie told herself through gritted teeth as she stirred the great vats of turkey soup could you possibly ask caitlin to make sure aengus is locked in one of the bedrooms im afraid he might get under a car she said to mrs makepieces daughter tracey who dressed in the tightest of black skirts and a white tricel shirt and pearls was upwardly mobilizing her spiky hair in the kitchen mirror tracey was plainly avid to have a crack at one of patricks friends outside mrs makepieces punk son kevin was directing cars into a nearby field and coming in frequently to fortify himself against the cold with slugs of wine reg and his two friends were doing sterling work drinking and circulating drink grace was already pissed goodness you look tired she said to taggie what ave you been up to gertrude grew hoarse with barking as more and more people poured in the party was plainly a success maud had produced a splendid mix lots of london friends who were knocked out by the beauty of the house and how good maud was looking many of them had brought teenage children who were borne off upstairs for malibu and coke in caitlins bedroom then there were patricks glamorous friends from trinity a large contingent from corinium television and all maud and declans new friends from gloucestershire who were thoroughly overexcited to see so many london celebs with two hours hard drinking before dinner most people were soon absolutely plastered bas baddingham stunned everyone by turning up with a most beautiful wife somebody elses she left alistair on december th and was out hunting the very next day said valerie jones in a shocked voice valerie could also be heard saying repeatedly that she was simply exhausted after so many parties fredfred and ay simply longed for a poached egg in front of tv tonight but we felt we couldnt let the oharas down she said to lizzie vereker what a crush i hope we daine soon did you have a good christmas lizzie asked freddie amizing said freddie got some triffic presents the staff gave me a firemans helmet cos im always rushin about and rupert sent me a loaf of mothers pride lizzie giggled typical said valerie her lips tightening and those bantams eggs you gave us were triffic too you can taste the difference i ad one for my breakfast this morning freddie beamed at lizzie nonsense fredfred said valerie with a little laugh that egg came from tescos james whod skipped lunch because he was having his roots touched up was drinking more than usual and thinking what a lot of amazingly beautiful women there were around joanna lumley over there and patricia hodge and pamela armstrong and selina scott and ann diamond maud was looking sensational too and there was sarah stratton not looking as good as usual there were black rings under her eyes but she still exuded wantonness sarah was in fact in a foul mood she hadnt had any lunch either because shed been hunting for a dress to wear this evening she had missed rupert horribly over christmas he obviously couldnt ring her as paul had been home all the time but she hadnt even had a postcard and then in nigel dempsters column that morning thered been a picture of rupert skiing with his arm round an incredibly glamorous french actress called nathalie perrault shed kill him when she saw him where the hell was he anyway who could she flirt with to irritate him the most attractive men in the room sarah decided were declan who was already drunk and declans son a raving beauty who was going to be very formidable in a few years time when he filled out sarah shimmied out to the marquee and finding ruperts place card moved it next to hers how dare the bastard dally with nathalie perrault bloody paul had read dempster too and made sly little digs about it all day tony to his amazement was thoroughly enjoying the party shrewd enough to appreciate his vanity maud was treating him as the guest of honour keeping him constantly plied with celebrities mostly beautiful women and introducing him to them as declans gorgeous boss you must get him to ask you down to corinium darling tony was soon purring like a great leopard let loose in a goat farm archie tonys beloved son was getting plastered upstairs with caitlins friends poor fat sharon jones was desperately shy caitlin had introduced her to boy after boy ordering them to look after her but within seconds sharon had waddled back to her increasingly irritated mother i told you go and make some friends of your own age hissed valerie furiously mrs makepiece sidled up to maud miss taggie says we ought to eat everythings ready we cant till rupert arrives said maud firmly tell her to wait ten minutes the doorbell rang perhaps this was him she went into the hall but declan got there first and it was only simon harris barging in with the two hyperactive monsters and the baby in a carrycot hullo declan panted simon sorry were late nice of you to invite the whole brood then seeing declans look of horror he explained i talked to someone called grace who said itd be quite all right looking around deciding that this was the sort of nice messy house that wouldnt mind children simon let go of the two little monsters where shall i put the baby at that moment rupert sauntered through the open door with snow on his dinner jacket and in his hair the dingy grey pallor of simon harris throwing his gstaad suntan into even greater relief rupert said maud joyfully you made it she looked so beautiful glowing under the hall mistletoe that rupert kissed her on the mouth you look sensational he said not nearly as sensational as you whispered maud you must have had wonderful weather i can feel the temperature dropping here said rupert as declan turned on his heel and stalked off towards the kitchen whats up with him oh hes just in a bait maud turned to the passing reg bring mr campbellblack a bucket of whisky going back to the kitchen via the marquee caitlin put her place card back on ruperts right and removed wandering aengus who was sitting on valeries plate wonderful party she said to taggie who was grimly pouring turkey soup into bowls on trays ruperts arrived looking like a red indian so mummy says we can eat now and daddys terribly drunk daddys not the only one said taggie you should see reg and his friends both tracey and kev have already buggered off upstairs and good old grace is singing this joyful eastertide tony baddingham was even happier at dinner sitting between joanna lumley and sarah stratton i know by rights you should be on my right maud had whispered in his ear but i thought you deserved a treat freddie and ayll be leaving early said valerie as she went into dinner the west cotchester are meeting at green lawns tomorrow theyre not meeting anywhere said rupert its frozen solid outside so we can all get frightfully drunk he wondered what had happened to taggie he couldnt find her name on the seating plan youre over here next to me maud called to rupert patting the seat beside her and next to me beamed caitlin bolting up to the table and whipping away cameron cooks place card which was on his other side maud could have murdered caitlin but she didnt want a scene in public you better say grace giggled caitlin whod been at the malibu and shell come running in singing this joyful eastertide it was obvious reflected tony with satisfaction that maud and declan had had the most frightful row probably about money earlier in the day declan had very forcibly stressed that it was a tiny party just a few friends but there must be at least three hundred people here and by the way the moët was being splashed about nothing had been stinted which was good because the broker declan got the more dependent hed be on corinium and the more tony could torment and manipulate him then looking across the room at mauds enraptured face turned towards rupert her elbows pressed together to deepen her cleavage her turkey soup untouched he decided it was more likely that declan was upset because his wife had a thumping great crush on rupert this suited tony even better because it meant declan would crucify rupert even more when he interviewed him in the new year sarah stratton whod stopped to say hullo to rupert on the way in was looking rather bleak as she sat down beside tony im glad were next to each other he said i wanted to talk to you have you made any new years resolutions said sarah picking up her soup spoon yes said tony his swarthy pirates face suddenly looking as though he was going to fight off a flotilla of rival clipper ships to keep the franchise ill drink to that said sarah i wouldnt mind said simon harris across the room helping himself to a seventh piece of garlic bread but tony came roaring in today saying im not having fucking language like that on any fucking programme going out from my fucking station sorry to bother you mr harris said mrs makepiece but your babys crying it was not surprising the baby was upset surrounded as it was upstairs by scenes of petronian debauchery as teenagers smoked drank necked and screamed with laughter as they opened another packet of tampax and shot the cotton wool out like cannons archie was sharing a bottle of moët with caitlin who had briefly abandoned rupert at dinner to smoke an illicit cigarette what has an upland house girl in common with a tampax archie asked her dunno said caitlin theyre both stuckup cunts caitlin screamed with laughter have you got a girlfriend i did said archie but she went off me because of my zits you mustnt worry about zits said caitlin kindly it means youre producing lots of testosterone and will make a wonderfully vigorous lover later piss off you snotty little buggers she screamed as simon harriss monsters raced up and down giggling at the necking teenagers and threatening each other with one of ruperts borrowed knives my father said all your family were weirdos said archie but i think youre cool declan whom maud had put deliberately between monica and valerie so he couldnt make a scene was so drunk he was in danger of seriously jeopardizing his career he didnt even realize monica was talking about otello until she got onto iago hes an even more evil character than scarpia she was saying much more agreed declan very like your husband in fact garlic bread either of you said valerie unable to believe her ears your husband is an absolute shit said declan i know said monica calmly as she tore off a piece of garlic bread however i have three children and i dont believe in divorce nor do i said declan filling up both their glasses valerie was absolutely livid when the farmer on her left said you live at long bottom court dont you she didnt want to talk to him at all she wanted to listen to what monica was saying to declan you wont try and wind tony up too much at work will you went on monica youre very good for corinium they need people with integrity id like you to stay im not sure your husband would i think wed both better stop discussing tony said monica gently or we might become very indiscreet this is a very good party mauds looking so beautiful has anyone ever told you youre a beautiful woman said declan monica went pink thats jolly well overdoing it you really ought to eat some of this shepherds pie its frightfully good but declan was looking at maud who was gazing at rupert o heart o heart he murmured if shed but turn her head youd know the folly of being comforted said monica finishing the quotation for him dont worry about rupert she went on briskly bertie berkshire once described him as a particularly nasty virus that ones wife caught sooner or later but we all get over it declan looked back at her startled even you monica sighed even me although rupert had no idea don giovanni must have been very like him he cant resist the conquest and i think although he wont admit it he still misses showjumping desperately and its a question of constantly filling the aching void hes usually filling other peoples wives aching voids said declan bitterly at last maud had to stop monopolizing rupert and turn to declans old boss at the bbc johnny abrahams who was sitting on her left lovely party darling he said hope you can pay for it whats up with declan not working out with tony baddingham i did warn him dont be silly said maud you know declan always has rows wherever he is but look at him now getting on like a house on fire with tonys wife you can talk to me now said caitlin to rupert how dyou do i saw you at midnight mass said rupert he liked her merry face and her bright beady eyes tell me he went on lowering his voice is your sister ever going to forgive me ah said caitlin well you havent been very nice to her i heard about the groping at the dinner party which was pretty crass and the row over the stubble burning taggie probably overreacted there shes so soppy about animals she spends her time prising frozen worms off the paths in this weather what really pissed her off was that you were so unkind about gertrude gertrude said rupert bewildered our dog you may think gertrude is very plain but were all devoted to her taggies led such a sheltered life shes never left home like patrick and me and she and gertrude have never been parted rupert grinned perhaps i should have sent gertrude a pendant instead oh my god said caitlin in horror it was you because you signed it r we all assumed it was from ralphie taggies mad about him you see glad i gave her a happy christmas said rupert acidly but shes not happy now because ralphies turned up with another woman which is he that blond over there taggie likes blonds so if you give her time caitlin said maud very sharply go and tell taggie to clear away the fruit salad plates we must have patricks cake or well be still sitting here at midnight she turned to rupert weve managed to get tickets for starlight express the week after next dyou want to come dont talk about things that happen after i go back grumbled caitlin getting up taggie taggie she squealed racing into the kitchen mummy wants the plates cleared then we can have patricks cake there isnt anyone to clear them said taggie in despair both the makepiece children have vanished and i cant find mrs makepiece or grace or reg or either of regs friends never mind that now said caitlin this is far more exciting it was rupert who sent you that pendant because he was sorry about goosing you at valerie joness theres no way were going to get slices out of this taggie nearly dropped patricks cake what did you say rupert sent you the pendant he couldnt have whispered taggie i hate him no you dont hes really nice go and sit next to him ill try and find reg and his mates to carry the cake in and people can eat it on their fruit salad plates go on tag never never gasped taggie she was deathly pale now im going to send it back mauds plans had gone seriously awry she had wanted them all to be dancing and she and rupert to be standing under one of caitlins hundred bunches of mistletoe at midnight but they were still sitting at the tables waiting for patrick to cut his cake why on earth couldnt taggie be more efficient at five minutes to midnight declan got somewhat unsteadily to his feet and tapped the table with his knife im very pleased to see you all here tonight he said and id just like to drink my son patricks health hes a good boy and hes given us a lot of pleasure over the years and me too piped up patricks girlfriend lavinia and everyone laughed and sang happy birthday and said speech speech as reg and his mates staggered in very perilously carrying the cake patrick stood up speaking in public didnt rattle him in the least he had all declans assurance id like to thank my father and mother for having me he said and giving me such a wonderful party and for my sister taggie for doing all the work and making this wonderful cake for a second maud looked furious at the loudness of the cheers thank you all for coming and for all your presents which ill open later when i get a moment there were more loud cheers then just as caitlin finished lighting the candles like the dark stranger coming over the threshold cameron cook walked in she was wearing an extremely tightfitting strapless black suede dress which came eight inches above her knees threeinch crosslaced gaps on either side from armpit to hem made it quite plain she was wearing nothing but fracas and mantan underneath there was a heavy metal chain round her neck and among the heavy silver bangles worn over her long black suede gloves gleamed tonys diamond bracelet anyone else would have looked tarty in that dress but cameron with her marvellously lean sinuous rapacious beauty succeeded in looking both menacing and absolutely staggering holy shit said patrick into the microphone everyone screamed with laughter blow out your candles said caitlin still gazing at cameron patrick blew them out with one puff then turned to declan who the hells that the biggest bitch in television said declan bleakly she may well be your future daughterinlaw said patrick christ i can just see her with a whip muttered bas to rupert perhaps thats what gets your brother going basil turned to daysee butler did you know your boss was heavily into sm whos she said daysee sorry im late said cameron fighting her way through the crowd to mauds side weve had a lot of hassle at work lovely to see you at any time said maud caitlin she added pointedly terrified that caitlin might start monopolizing rupert again will get you something to eat she needs a drink said patrick goodness hes pretty thought cameron like declan but purerlooking somehow arent you going to cut your cake she said to him ive got to wish said patrick never taking his eyes off her he slowly plunged the knife into the cake right up to the hilt i didnt have time to buy you a present said cameron you brought yourself said patrick slightly mockingly just what i wanted filling up his glass with champagne he handed it to her thanks taking it cameron drained the glass just at that moment from speakers all round the tent big ben boomed out the twelve strokes of midnight as everyone started kissing everyone else and cheering patrick drew cameron into his arms and kissed her on and on and on at last they broke away the coup de foudre said patrick softly ive waited twentyone years for this to happen look at tonys face whispered lizzie vereker to charles fairburn with a shiver as the last notes of auld lang syne rang out declan could be heard saying bloody january again plates were being cleared away tables pushed back and the marquee cleared for dancing as the women drifted upstairs to do their faces telling cameron he wouldnt be a second patrick went off to the kitchen to thank taggie oblivious that monica might be watching tony fought his way over to cameron and seized her arm what the hell are you playing at cameron winced celebrating christmas it hasnt been great so far i couldnt get away i guess not that dress is deliberately provocative snarled tony well if it deliberately provokes you its doing a great job why are you so fucking late titanias four months gone shit how dyou know wardrobe told me said cameron and shes admitted it sure whos the father shes not sure it could be bottom or theseus or even peter quince jesus well just have to shoot round her patrick never made it to the kitchen declan dragged him into the library for christs sake camerons out of bounds why shes tony baddinghams mistress so are you frightened of losing your job for a second patrick thought declan was going to hit him its not that youve no idea of the evil of both of them he may be shes not she just needs someone of her own age to play with for a change hes taught her some very unpleasant habits said declan heavily like arguing with you i suppose said patrick shes out of your league i dont give a fuck said patrick walking out you dont have to take your clothes off to have a good time oh no sang jermaine stewart from the disco you can dance and party all night still arguing with tony seeing both monica and patrick bearing purposefully down on her cameron escaped to check her face after patricks kiss she certainly couldnt have any lipstick left upstairs in the only bedroom that didnt seem to be inhabited by necking teenagers she found sarah stratton brushing her hair good party said sarah it seems so im glad i bumped into you said sarah tonys offered me a job at corinium ought i to take it sure said cameron coolly you dont think hes just after my body no way said cameron who was having difficulty applying lipstick her hands were trembling so much i just wondered sarah dropped her head brushing all her hair downwards tony and monica are an awfully weird couple you know pauls exwife winifred used to be monicas best chum ive often wondered if they werent a bit dykey sarah tossed her head back so her hair rose then cascaded wildly onto her shoulders monica evidently told winifred she went on that tony made such incredible sexual demands on her that she had to move into a separate bedroom he wanted it two or three times every night now she restricts him to once a week like church perhaps thats why hes so lecherous as if in a dream cameron watched sarah spray anais anaïs between her breasts then behind her kneecaps and finally pulling out her pants on her blonde bush did tony make a pass at you cameron said in a frozen voice not exactly but he was terrifically complimentary said sarah and i must say for an older man hes not unattractive as they came downstairs james vereker was hovering deliberately ignoring cameron he asked sarah to dance oh well thought sarah anything to make rupert jealous how did you get on with tonys mistress asked james oh my christ is she gasped sarah appalled and she told james what had happened id better not take that job at corinium after all she said finally shed certainly have it in for you said james she has it in for any beautiful woman and man for that matter he nearly added if you came to corinium his arm tightened round her id look after you and show you the ropes isnt television frightfully difficult not if youve got a teacher who really cares said james ill kill tony ill absolutely kill him thought cameron as seething with rage she went into the marquee both tony and patrick were waiting patrick was quicker come and dance he said taking her hand im not going to let you go for the rest of the evening probably not for the rest of my life dyou always move in so fast said cameron laughing no i wished for you when i cut my cake you mustnt tell wishes they might not come true mine always do said patrick calmly taggie was mindlessly washing up in the kitchen when simon harriss little monsters returned and saying they were hungry broke through the clingfilm over the kedgeree and started eating it with their hands something finally snapped inside taggie bugger off you little horrors she screamed talking to me said a voice rupert was standing in the doorway he was as brown as hed been last summer when hed had no clothes on taggie went scarlet rupert grinned your mother was only telling me the other day how much you adore children then turning on the monsters go on fuck off you little sods out out muttering venomously the monsters sidled out cramming birthday cake into their mouths as they went it was the most lovely dinner said rupert gently noticing taggies reddened eyes will you please stop playing cinderella and come and dance ive got too much to do thank you and thank you for the pendant i didnt realize she stumbled on the words at that moment simon harris came in with spewedup rusk all over his dinner jacket carrying a bawling baby could you possibly hold her for me while i heat up a bottle he asked taggie of two evils taggie chose the prettier theres a saucepan over there she said and feeling ruperts hand close over hers she followed him into the marquee im a very very bad dancer she muttered doesnt matter said rupert we can sway in a dark corner never seen you look so lovely as you do tonight sang chris de burgh never seen you shine so bright taggies hair smelt of shepherds pie as he drew her to him rupert could feel the substantial softness of her breasts compared with the incredible slenderness of her waist her body was rigid with tension and embarrassment she had absolutely no sense of rhythm at all it was like a very slim elephant dancing at the circus did you have a nice christmas asked rupert yes did you get nice presents yes come on my angel relax his hands moved over her back gentling her as though she was one of his young horses look gertrudes followed us she knows im a rotter and she wont let you out of her sight catching gertrudes disapproving eye taggie gave a half laugh half sob rupert reached down and stroked gertrude good gertrude beautiful gertrude see i am trying lady in red lady in red sang everyone as they swayed round the floor which were the only words they knew rupert took taggies face in his hands she was so tall her eyes were only just below his dont be so sad he murmured youll get over him taggie started how dyou know caitlin told me you thought the pendant was from him im sorry it was very kind said taggie stiffly i just dont accept presents from men i see only from boys as chris de burgh finished and wham started he gripped her waist knowing she was about to bolt last christmas i gave you my heart sang george michael but the very next day you gave it away across the room taggie could see ralphie and georgina dancing together he was stroking her cheek with his hand with a low moan taggie tugged herself away from rupert cannoning off startled couples she fled from the marquee upstairs to the loo to cry her eyes out once again patrick danced on and on with cameron they didnt talk much because they were easily the best dancers in the room tony grinding his teeth down to the gums didnt dare move in with monica looking on thats the best thing ive seen in years said james vereker who was dancing on and on with sarah what said sarah cameron getting off with declans son at best itll screw up tony and cameron at worst itll put tony even more off declan although paul was hovering looking thunderous sarah carried on dancing with james until she saw rupert going past breaking away she screamed out to him to keep her quiet rupert bore her off to dance paul could see them rowing all the way round the floor in that rigidjawed way as though theyd had too many injections at the dentist why have you been deliberately ignoring me i havent its just that paul has been watching us like a wimbledon linesman never put you off in the past did you have a good christmas of course i didnt you obviously did if the daily mails anything to go by i dont require fidelity from my husband said sarah hysterically but i do from my lover then youve picked the wrong guy sweetheart weve had a good time sarah looked up aghast is it over then no not necessarily im just not prepared to offer you an exclusive bastard hissed sarah i thought you were serious you were wrong and frankly angel i dont think you make a very good mps wife paul looks a shambles in the kitchen surrounded by undergraduates and dirty plates and glasses declan was declaiming yeats and the flame of the blue star of twilight hung low on the rim of the sky has awaked in our hearts my beloved a sadness that may not die cameron stood listening to him her hand in patricks he recites best when hes drunk whispered patrick loses all selfconsciousness he should do a programme on yeats marvelled cameron hardly of local interest we could do it for channel four upstairs maud was arranging her breasts in the green dress and putting scent on her hair and applying coral blusher to her pale cheeks her freckles were like a sprinkling of nutmeg tonight im not middleaged she whispered to herself im still young and beautiful i get no kick from champagne sang the disco pure alcohol doesnt thrill me at all the message was all in the music thought maud go forth and multiply and seek love going downstairs she could hear declan declaiming in the kitchen she was safe for half an hour or so screams and shouts were coming from the direction of caitlins room the berries of the mistletoe gleamed brighter than her pearls under the hall light it was three in the morning soon taggie would be serving kedgeree as if in answer to her prayer maud heard ruperts voice darling i was looking for you taking her hand he led her into the study where caitlin taking no chances had hung more mistletoe ruperts hand felt so warm and dry and the ball of his thumb was so pudgy noticed maud that was the fortunetellers clue to a passionate highlysexed nature it was certainly the only spare flesh on his body mauds heart was pounding she must try and be distant a little mysterious as he turned towards her her eyes were on a level with his black tie she longed to caress the lovely line of his jaw its going to happen she thought in ecstasy as rupert shut the door to blot out the screams and raucous laughter and coming towards her gazed deeply into her eyes angel ive been wanting to ask you something from the moment we met certainly from the moment i came over here with bas after hunting you wont be cross with me no no whispered maud she was having difficulty breathing you probably think im the biggest shit in the world i dont i dont i just think people misunderstand you she could smell the faint lemon tang of his aftershave as he moved nearer im absolutely mad began rupert go on stammered maud about little taggie and she cant stand me could you possibly put in a good word for me taggie said maud in outrage taggie she might have been lady bracknell referring to the famous handbag for christs sake she screamed taggies eighteen youre thirtyseven shes dyslexic which makes her seem even younger how dare you you revolting letch how dare you how dare you and bursting into tears she fled upstairs and locked herself in her bedroom she couldnt bear it she whod always got anyone she wanted being spurned under the mistletoe by the biggest rake in gloucestershire and for taggie of all people which made it far far worse almost pathologically jealous of taggie there was no one in the world maud would less like to lose a man to was that to be her fate growing older and less attractive until no one wanted her an hour later in the kitchen declan was still declaiming to an enraptured group christ i wish i wasnt too tight to make notes said ralphie you see why he cant go on doing crappy interviews with the bishop of cotchester said patrick to cameron cameron nodded a woman of so shining loveliness declan was saying that men threshed corn at midnight by a tress a little stolen tress he looked up and saw maud a little stolen tress he repeated slowly for a minute they gazed at each other there is grey in your hair he began very softly young men no longer catch their breath when you are passing maud turned away her face stricken declan dropped his cigarette into the sink and stepping over the enraptured seated undergraduates caught up with maud on the stairs not having had anything to drink for a couple of hours he was sobering up whats the matter did he turn you down maud nodded tears spilling out between her eyelashes ive seen it coming since september i wanted to warn you why didnt you then declan sighed has there ever been any point hes no good for you hes a traveller it might have lasted a week a month then hed have dumped you he put his huge hands round her neck above the pearl choker im sorry she mumbled hes just so attractive i know hush hush he raised his thumbs to still her quivering mouth lets go to bed we cant in the middle of a party what better time ive spent so much money doesnt matter said declan as they went up the remaining stairs i love you he said softly and im the only one of the lot of them who understands you i know whispered maud declan shut the bedroom door behind them caitlin going past heard the key turn removing the sign outside the loo on which she had earlier written ladies caitlin turned it over wrote do not disturb sex in progress and hung it on her parents door downstairs the party showed no signs of winding down i love yew said lizzie looking at a dark clump of greenery in the corner as she danced round with freddie i love you said freddie giving her a squeeze honestly on my life and at least a bottleandahalf of moët it was obvious that tony wasnt going to be able to prise cameron away from patrick for even a second we must go he said bleakly to monica all right said monica reluctantly i havent seen archie for hours where is he upstairs i think said caitlin monica swayed up the stairs hanging onto the banisters she hadnt drunk so much since she was a deb it was really rather fun finding several rooms heavily occupied by couples she finally tracked down her elder and beloved son on a chaiselongue on the top floor absolutely superglued to tracey makepiece his hand burrowing like a ferret inside her white tricel shirt archie thundered monica drop archie dropped were leaving said monica at once downstairs she told tony what archie had been up to christ exploded tony he might put her in the club get him out of this bloody house as fast as possible i dont know where declan and maud are we ought to thank them said monica as archie shuffled sheepishly down the stairs having witnessed the incident valerie gave her little laugh one must learn to be democratic aym afraid these days monica sharon of course gets on with all classes evidently said caitlin sliding down the banisters and beaming at valerie shes been wrapped round kevin makepiece for the last two hours giving a screech close to death valerie bolted upstairs caitlin turned to monica tony and archie with a beatific smile on her face i bet kev a pound he wouldnt neck with sharon i suppose ill have to pay him now are your parents around said monica im afraid theyve gone to bed said caitlin well if youd just tell them how very much we all enjoyed it said monica you may have enjoyed it hissed tony slipping on the icy drive in his haste to get to the rolls and the frozen chauffeur but frankly it was the most bloody party ive ever been to and that child caitlin is a minx shes sweet protested archie with a hiccup if you have anything more to do with any of the ohara children ill disinherit you about five in the morning having behaved just as badly as everyone else rupert came back into the drawingroom looking for the whisky decanter and saw a black and white tail sticking out from under the piano gertrude he said the tail quivered crouching down rupert found both gertrude and taggie what on earth are you doing a drunks passed out in my bed said taggie with a sob every other bedroom in the house is occupied a bloody great party including ralphie and his blonde are in the kitchen so i cant wash up the disco people havent been paid mummy and daddy have gone to bed and i dont want to be a wallflower and cramp everyones style you wont cramp mine come on rupert dragged her out an empty champagne bottle rolled out at the same time you drink all that nearly rupert threw a couple of logs on the dying fire and then sat taggie down on the sofa beside him gertrude took up her position between them its been a wonderful party he said it hasnt said taggie despairingly its been a disaster patricks got off with lord baddinghams mmistress whichll make lord baddingham go even more off daddy and mummys got a terrific crush on someone she blushed remembering it was rupert and added hastily im not sure who and poor daddys got to pay for it all i tried and tried to keep the cost down but then mummy went off and ordered all that champagne and invited hundreds and hundreds of people your father must earn a good screw from corinium said rupert reasonably he does taggie cuddled gertrude like a terrified child clutching a teddy bear but its not nearly enough hes got a massive overdraft and we still havent paid for our leaving party in london and he got another huge tax bill yesterday and he hasnt paid the last one yet and mummy and caitlin and patrick wont take it seriously they think daddys a bottomless pit wholl always provide to produce his best work she went on hes got to be kept calm thats why we moved to the country for some peace and for him to finish his book and he loathes lord baddingham he thinks hes dreadfully cor cor she blocked on the word corrupt said rupert thats right and shouldnt be running corinium at all daddys so headstrong im sure hell walk out if there are any more rows and he says the bbc wont have him back despite being drunk rupert appreciated it wasnt at all an ideal setup of course the bbc would he said your fathers a genius hes got everything going for him except us said taggie with a sob were all a drain on him youre not said rupert i am ralphie doesnt love me no one will ever love me rupert let her cry for a few minutes then made her laugh by putting his black tie on gertrude im so sorry stammered taggie wiping her eyes on someones discarded silk shawl im being horribly ssselfindulgent youre not suddenly rupert felt very avuncular and protective as he did when one of his dogs cut its paw he wished a visit to the vet and a few stitches could cure taggies problems im going to get that drunk out of your bed and then you can go to sleep i must pay the disco but no one seems to want them to stop and the makepieces ive got the money she got a large wad of tenners out of the george v coronation tin on the desk ill pay them said rupert taking the money youre going to bed up in taggies turret bedroom with some effort rupert lifted charles fairburn out of the bed and lugging him down the winding stairs put him on the chaiselongue recently vacated by archie and tracey makepiece as taggies room was like the north pole he returned with a duvet hed whipped off a fornicating couple in the spare room taggie had got into a red flannel nightgown and cleaned her teeth lady in red thought rupert she had huge black circles under her eyes she looked about twelve everythingll work out all right he said tucking her in youve been so kind stammered taggie im sorry i was so rude to you before and thank you for the pendant but as rupert put out a hand to touch her cheek gertrude still in her black tie growled fiercely you may have forgiven me said rupert but gertrude hasnt at seventhirty the disco was still pounding all over the house patricks friends with ultrafashionable catsick yellow socks over their eyes like aeroplane eye masks had crashed out on arm chairs and sofas charles snored happily on his chaiselongue in the small sittingroom watched balefully by gertrude still in ruperts black tie cameron and patrick opened patricks presents throwing the wrapping paper into the fire to ignite the dying embers cameron had never seen such loot gold cufflinks rolex watches diamond studs a leica camera a picasso drawing a matthew smith a redandsilverstriped silk turnbull and asser dressinggown patrick was like the prince in the fairy story thought cameron whom each of the neighbouring kings was trying to win over with more and more extravagant presents she thought bitterly back to her own twentyfirst birthday neither of her parents had even bothered to send her a card youll never remember who gave you what thats neat she added as patrick drew out a copy of the shropshire lad from some shiny red paper very said patrick first edition what have you got there silver hip flask from someone called all my love lavinia shes had it engraved whos she my ex said patrick collapsing onto the sofa to read the shropshire lad how ex about two minutes before midnight last night listen when i was oneandtwenty i heard a wise man say give crowns and pounds and guineas but not your heart away hope thats not prophetic i wish housman hadnt used the word lad so often so appallingly hearty whos that from cameron pulled a long darkbrown cashmere scarf from a gold envelope georgie and ralphie i bet georgie paid for it kind of them though he got up and wound the scarf round camerons neck holding on to the two ends and slowly drawing her towards him its yours everything i have is yours he said kissing her only breaking away from her because the telephone rang he grinned as he put down the receiver it was the vicar of penscombe asking if they could turn the disco down for an hour so he could take early service i must go said cameron you must not ill tell those disco boys to go and have some breakfast and then you and i are going to watch the sun rise wearing three of patricks sweaters a pair of taggies jeans rolled over four times at the ankle caitlins gumboots and a very smart darkblue coat with a velvet collar left over the banisters by bas baddingham cameron set out with patrick ive shaved so i wont cut your face to ribbons he said the windll do that grumbled cameron the wind in fact had dropped but a vicious frost had ermined all the fences roughened the surface of the snow and turned the waterfall in the wood to two footlong icicles gertrude charged ahead leaping into drifts tunnelling the snow with her snout wow its beautiful said cameron as the valley stretched out below them how much of its yours to the bottom of the wood the rest of the valley belongs to rupert campbellblack christ its a kingdom thought cameron looking across at the white fields the blanketed tennis court ruperts golden house with its snowy roof and the bare beech wood rearing up behind like a huge spiky white hedgehog were trying to get him on your fathers programme why bother pa could interview him by morse code across the valley hes the most awful stud evidently resentful husbands all over gloucestershire bear scars on their knuckles from trying to bash down bedroom doors he was there last night said cameron was he said patrick i only had eyes for you they had reached the water meadows at the bottom of the wood here the snow had settled in roots of trees in the crevices of walls and in sixfoot drifts anywhere it could find shelter from yesterdays blizzard the blizzard had also laid thick white tablecloths of snow fringed with icicles on either side of the stream which ran with chattering teeth down the valley it was deathly quiet except for ruperts horses occasionally neighing to one another but it was getting lighter nice scent said patrick burrowing his face in her neck what is it fracas very appropriate who gave it to you tony why hasnt he got a neck patrick hurled a snowball into the woods gertrude hurtled after it youd have thought with that much money he could have bought himself a neck shut up said cameron tell me do your mother and father always slope off to bed in the middle of their own parties its a very odd marriage said patrick pointing his new leica at her look towards the stream darling my father has always seen my mother as maud gonne the woman yeats was fixated on right yeats fell in love with her at exactly the same age my father fell in love with my mother look badger tracks patrick bent down to examine them maud gonne was a rabid revolutionary yeats knew he wouldnt impress her with poetry so he got caught up in a political movement to unite ireland then she married john macbride another revolutionary broke yeatss heart but it made him write his best poetry he claimed maud gonne was beyond blame like helen of troy but your mother isnt a revolutionary for christs sake and she hasnt married someone else no but she has maud gonnes tremendous beauty and my father has an almost fatalistic acceptance that shes above blame and will have affairs with other men doesnt your mother care for him in her way i once asked her why she messed him about so much she said that with every woman in the world after him she could only hold him by uncertainty cameron digested this but if he only loves her and doesnt want all these women why cant she stop playing games and love him back thats far too easy shes convinced that once hes sure of her his obsession would evaporate so the games go on i wish they wouldnt said cameron it sure makes him cranky to work with she sat on a log and watched patrick write patrick loves cameron in huge letters in the snow then he got out his hip flask now filled with brandy and handed it to her you warm enough cameron nodded taking a sip do you have a drinking problem she asked as patrick took a huge slug patrick laughed only if i cant afford it whiskys twelve pounds a bottle in dublin will you come and stay with me at trinity next term its crazy thought cameron hes utterly unsuitable and eight years younger than me but the snow had given her such a feeling of irresponsibility she hadnt felt so happy for years the only unsettling thing was that he reminded her so much of declan they had the same arrogance the same assumption that everyone would dance to their tune patrick seemed to read her thoughts dont worry im not at all like my father being capricorn i have a very shrewd business head i may be overexacting but im also cool calculating and calm whereas my father is very highly strung and overemotional capricorns also have excellent senses of humour and make protective and loving husbands he grinned at her the violet shadows beneath the brilliant dark eyes were even more pronounced this morning but nothing could diminish the beauty of the bone structure the full slightly sulky curve of the mouth or the thickness of the long dark eyelashes not a very artistic sign capricorn cameron said crushingly what about mallarme said patrick one of the bravest most dedicated of poets he was capricorn he knew what slog and selfnegation is needed to produce poetry he understood the loneliness of the writer look heres the sun hand in hand they watched the huge red sun climbing up behind the black bars of the beech copse on the top road blushing at its inability to warm the day looks like charles fairburn spending a night inside for soliciting said patrick god i wish i had a crew said cameron dyou realize you can only afford to film sunrises in winter in this country in summer it rises at four oclock in the morning thats in golden time when you have to pay a crew miles over the rate for working through the night christ i hate the british unions patrick turned towards her i only like americanirish unions let me look at you her dark hair no longer sleeked back with water was blown forward in black tendrils over her cheek bones and in a thick fringe which softened the slanting yellow eyes and the beaky nose her skin and her full pale lips were amber in the sunshine patrick sighed and took another photograph even the suns upstaged youre so dazzling hell have to wear dark glasses to look at you cameron laughed hed be terribly easy to fall in love with she was shocked to find herself thinking how many more terms have you got she asked as they wandered back two what are your future goals to take you to bed when we get home dont be an asshole apart from that get a first then write plays just like that just like that ive started one already whats it about intimidation by british soldiers in ulster youre crazy neither the bbc nor itv would touch it particularly in an election year nor will the west end broadway would and a success there would come here very selfconfident arent you not particularly i just know what i want from life he moved closer putting his hands inside the three jerseys warming them on her small breasts i want you most back at the priory people were beginning to surface bas having put so many alka seltzers in a glass of water theyd fizzed over the top was trying to find his overcoat caitlin was eating alpen and reading lady chatterleys lover taggie was serving breakfast to simon harriss monsters trying to give the baby its bottle and comfort simon harris who was sobbing at the kitchen table with his face in his hands oh patrick thank goodness youre back she said could you possibly ring the doctor about she nodded in simon harriss direction no said patrick backing out of the kitchen sorry darling im busy im going home to call the office and get some sleep said cameron no said patrick suddenly frantic if we go to sleep it wont be my birthday any more and well break the spell he took her up the winding stairs to his bedroom in the east turret which was painted dazzlingly white as though the snow had fallen inside there were no carpets or curtains and the only furniture was a desk a chair a green and white sofa piled high with books and a vast redcurtained oriental fourposter with bells hanging from the tops of the posts the view however was magnificent straight across the valley and up to penscombe you could see the weathercock on top of the church spire glittering in the sunlight a volume of keats lay open on the bed the pages were covered with pencilled notes picking it up cameron crawled under the duvet and tried to decipher patricks writing looking up she saw the ceiling was painted dove grey with little stars picked out in white if only shed had a room like this when she was young she thought bitterly patrick went off to get them some breakfast he took longer than anticipated taggie was on the telephone ringing up some doctor about simon harris but she ran after him and buttonholed him as he was going back upstairs with a tray dragging him into the sittingroom distraught that he had cameron in his room shes tony baddinghams ccconcubine is that your word for the day said patrick coldly no thats what daddy calls her do you want to ruin his career tony b couldnt be that petty firing a megastar like pa just because i took his mistress off him he could hes really evil well if hes that evil pa shouldnt be working for him now get out of my way sweetheart the coffees getting cold and ive had enough of entertaining your friends taggie screamed after him bicker bicker said caitlin looking up from lady chatterleys lover pity it isnt spring then cameron could festoon your willy with forgetmenots oh my god she screamed as an ashen daysee butler shuffled downstairs in a white towelling dressinggown its the priory ghost upstairs patrick found cameron wearing his new red and silver dressinggown and reading keats the sun shining through the stained glass of one of the windows had turned her face emerald ruby and violet like a nymph of the rainbow patrick felt his heart fail he had brought up croissants taggies bramble jelly a bunch of green grapes a jug of bucks fizz and some very strong black coffee cameron whod had no dinner the night before was starving and ate most of it it was astonishing thought patrick that she looked desirable even with croissant crumbs on her lips but even the black coffee couldnt keep her awake for long patrick didnt sleep he sat making notes on keats which was one of his set books but spending more time gazing at her in sleep her face lost all its aggression it was almost dark when she woke up for a second she looked bewildered and utterly terrified its all right said patrick gently youre safe now she got up and looked out of the window orion the swaggering voyeur was looking in at her the great yews and cedars were black against the snow she could hear an unearthly strangulated croaking whats that foxes barking its a love call come here not till ive cleaned my teeth grabbing her bag she went down the landing terrified of bumping into declan instead coming out of the bathroom she found caitlin and maud having a row im nothing like lady chatterley maud was screaming good evening cameron nothing at all youre so lucky to have a family said cameron as she slid back under the duvet beside patrick he was still wearing a jersey and trousers how many times have you been home since you came over here he asked i havent why not one must see ones family occasionally if only to fight with them the argument outside was growing more clamorous my parents are divorced my fathers married again my mother lives with someone i dont want to talk about it said cameron shrilly suddenly she was trembling her teeth chattering her eyes darting and frightened you must said patrick how can i love you properly if i dont know everything about you no it was almost a scream come on itll help i promise they argued for some minutes before she gave in suddenly he reminded her again of declan he had the same gentle but relentlessly probing voice the same way of never taking his eyes off her face and almost hypnotizing her into telling him everything my mother walked out on my father when i was fourteen said cameron tonelessly decided she wanted to be her own person she dabbled in a lot of things peace marches consciousness raising but she wasnt sufficiently focused and when the money ran out she moved to a female commune took me with her but left my dog behind because it was male cameron gave a bitter choked laugh i never forgave her for that my father got married again and got all tied up with his new wife then mom shacked up with mike your stepfather there was a long pause you could call it that mike was a dyke my mother wrote a piece about coming out in the village voice all her friends thought she was real brave my classmates just sniggered and nudged each other you poor little baby patrick took her trembling hands then mike and mom moved to cincinnati and mike got the job of city editor on the local paper i could have put up with her being gay but she was a real bull dyke more macho than a guy really with a skin like the surface of the moon and hip measurements in treble figures and a beergut spilling over her leather belts cameron shuddered she had a huge motorbike and she used to take mom on the pillion they joined a crazy organization called dykes on bikes and roared round the country in black leather going to gay parades patrick drew her to him he could feel the pouring sweat the terrible fits of shivering sweeping over her go on darling he whispered i prayed mike would crash and kill herself then as a last straw mom decided their union should be blessed and went off and got pregnant by aid mike was mad about the idea at first strutted round as though she was the real father then when the baby arrived it was a boy poor little sod and she got jealous mom was over forty she had a terrible labour she was in hospital for ten days i was alone in the house with mike every night she came home plastered then one evening i remember she spent about ten minutes getting her key into the lock i was trying to work in my room i cant tell you ive never told anyone this she was suddenly frantic like a cat struggling and clawing to escape patrick held onto her its ok youve got to trust me come on sweetheart come on mike yelled for me to come downstairs and fix her some supper camerons voice was toneless again and so quiet patrick could hardly hear her i was frying her eggs and bacon when suddenly she came up behind me and started to grope me ripping my clothes off trying to kiss me ugh she was terribly strong i swung the pan round and hit her with it then i ran out into the night cameron put her fingers in her hair rubbing the ball of her hand over and over again against her forehead as if to blot out the memory patrick waited i went to some neighbours i lied that mike had tried to beat me up they said theyd expected it for months they called dad in washington he came the next day and took me to live with him hed been dying to get something on mom and mike and the court ruled i should stay with him what happened then it didnt work said cameron wearily the honeymoon wore off my stepmothers a lawyer my fathers a diplomat they had a young baby theyre very civilized people and very busy they couldnt handle a savage like me i disrupted their lives i made awful scenes stayed out all night they couldnt see i was crying out for someone to care i ran away from them too in the end i got a scholarship to barnard worked in the vac to support myself got a job on the new york times and finally moved to television the rest is hysterics she gave her bitter mirthless laugh again you poor darling patrick pulled her back into his arms again kissing her forehead no wonder she was screwed up and aggressive and desperately insecure after that hed never felt so sorry for anyone in his life didnt you have a boyfriend to look after you oh i screwed around like crazy just to prove i was heterosexual then the aids scare started in the states then tony came along hardly the ideal father figure said patrick im not dependent on him snarled cameron too quickly im not dependent on anyone the only time i feel i belong is when my credits come up on the screen she was shuddering violently now furious with herself for dropping her guard and revealing so much i guess youll run to declan now and tell him the whole thing so you can have a good laugh dont be childish snapped patrick im going to look after you ill blot out all the bad memories even if it takes a lifetime never taking his eyes off her face he started to unbutton his shirt its too soon she whispered im not going to fuck you said patrick im just going to hold you close youve got to learn that someone loves you for other things besides your heavenly body and your skills as a career bitch patrick was as good as his word gradually the shuddering stopped and he soothed all the tension out of her exhausted by so much revelation she even slept again at midnight she insisted on going back to her house he was very loath to let her go let me get dressed ill run you home ive got my car i want to see your house thats tonys patch not any more tonys past history cameron sighed i guess its a bit more problematical than that i feel like demeter letting persephone go back to the underworld said patrick as he fastened her seat belt for christs sake drive carefully the roads are like glass ill ring you tomorrow i love you hell thought cameron as she drove up to the house i must have left the livingroom light on she glanced in the hall mirror not a scrap of makeup despite the sleep the circles under her eyes were darker than her eyebrows patrick had really seen her in the raw yet she felt strangely cleansed and at peace at having told him everything tomorrow theyd make love she knew it would be wonderful the slow lazy smile of anticipation was wiped off her face when she went into the livingroom and found tony the videos of her programmes lay scattered over the floor the ashtray was filled with cigar butts the whisky bottle which had been halffull was empty now tony was a slow drinker he must have been there hours cameron shut the door and leant against it her heart crashing with a particularly unpleasant smile on his face tony picked up some papers lying on the table ive been looking at your contract he said amiably dyou want to leave now or work out your notice it was as though the last twentyfour hours had never existed here was reality her whole career her only security was crashing round her ears in ruins i havent done anything you cant fire me she whispered in terror i dont have to your contract runs out in six weeks such a pity you blew it he examined his square beautifully manicured fingernails i came round to tell you that simon harris gave in to his nervous breakdown and was carted off to a loony bin this afternoon on extended leave but you know what i feel about unpunctuality and twentyfour hours is a little late to come home from the ball but i never normally see you on a sunday said cameron illogically she seemed too stunned to take anything in that doesnt mean i dont expect you to be here smiling he picked up his glass of whisky you bloody little whore he said softly the next moment hed hurled it in her face for a second she was speechless as the liquid dripped down on to the suede dress how odd she said in a strained high voice every time i buy something new and expensive some jerk spills something all over it then she lost her temper you bastard she screamed i havent taken a weekend off in three years im always at your fucking beck and call thats what i pay you for said tony his eyes were sparkling with pleasure now you bloody dont if you paid me golden time for the hours i put in for you id be howard hughes by now you frig around doing exactly what you like expecting me to behave like a fucking nun except when you require my services well its not bloody good enough she sprang at him trying to claw his face but he grabbed her wrists he was not bullnecked and thickarmed for nothing as his grip tightened cameron gasped with pain id put up with it she said through clenched teeth if the relationship was remotely even you raise hell if i date anyone else but youre quite free to take darling sarah stratton out to lunch and make passes at her and offer her a job tonys eyes gleamed so thats it who told you that she did yelled cameron desperately struggling to get away and she said you still sleep with monica tony grinned she must have an excellent spy system the old bag system monica told winifred who told paul who told sarah that as you were always pestering her monica restricts you to once a week and you told me you hadnt laid a finger on her for years you bloody liar its rather exciting sleeping with monica mused tony theres a rarity element about it so thats why you sent madden tripping out to james garrett on christmas eve to buy us both diamond bracelets jesus christ starting to laugh tony let go of her wrists you discovered that too did you poor little cameron you must have been festering over christmas jealousy is the most destructive of emotions you know it hurts only oneself i hate you screamed cameron wrenching off the bracelet and hurling it at him missing him it hit the window slithering scratchily down the glass like a fingernail on a blackboard get out ill move out tomorrow but leave me alone now she collapsed sobbing on the sofa regurgitating her past with patrick earlier had only underlined how terrifying it was to have no security she was a panicstricken sixteenyearold again racing through the night away from mike with nowhere to go tony poured two fingers of brandy into a glass then moved towards her until she could feel the solidness of his thigh against hers she resisted the temptation to cling on to it as a child might fling its arms around a tree for comfort you were jealous really jealous purred tony was that why you led that boy on sure he caught her hair yanking her head back did you sleep with him yes she muttered then terrified he was going to hit her or throw the brandy into her face but not the way you think i was so goddam tired i hadnt slept for nights worrying about everything i crashed out on his bed and nothing happened nothing nothing hes just a kid oh please make him believe her did declan know you spent the night there no i never saw him he never came out of the bedroom with the franchise coming up this year tony decided he didnt really want to lose her but he was going to enjoy torturing her a bit more and you promise never to see the boy again i promise said cameron wearily but he may try to see me well have to put pressure on declan to stop him then wont we said tony silkily as he took off camerons jacket that is a very disturbing dress id rather you didnt wear it in public again putting his hand under the skirt he jabbed two fingers up inside her cameron winced i cant tony not tonight im really pooped you can said tony softly if you want to be controller of programmes three days after patricks party taggie was gingerly testing her heart and finding that the ache for ralphie was much less acute than shed expected it to be when the doorbell rang in the doorway stood rupert his suntan was already beginning to fade hullo he said soulfully gazing into her eyes since your wonderful party i havent been able to eat a thing oh my goodness stammered taggie her heart beginning to thump rupert grinned could i possibly have my knives and forks and plates back taggie was used to unrequited love patrick however was not hopelessly spoilt by his mother accustomed to attracting girls effortlessly he couldnt believe cameron didnt want to see him any more despite declans tirades and taggies pleading he continued to pester her with letters and telephone calls then when these were not answered he hung round the corinium studios and outside her house cameron in fact had hardly had time to think as well as producing declans programme and coping with her new job as acting controller of programmes she had to face a virtual palace revolution from a staff outraged by her appointment the afternoon before he was due to go back to trinity patrick rang cameron at the office expecting a call from rupert about coming on declans programme cameron unthinkingly picked up the telephone instead of leaving it to her secretary can i speak to cameron said patrick cameron froze putting on a cockney accent she said im afraid shes not at her desk at the moment where is she snapped patrick lying with the managing director under his desk cameron hung up the telephone was ringing again as she got home that evening running into the hall she snatched up the receiver it was rupert answering her call we were talking about a date for you to come on declans programme she said with a confidence she didnt feel i was just hoping to firm you up rupert laughed extraordinary terminology you use in television his diary was ridiculously full but to her amazement he said he could make a wednesday in february which turned out to be st valentines day hed been so adamant he wouldnt do the programme and in case i dont bump into declan beforehand can you ask him if hes free for dinner afterwards cameron didnt say that after declan had taken rupert to the cleaners she thought it most unlikely that was a good party on new years eve said rupert i saw you bopping in your suede dress i hoped youd jump out of your skin the next moment cameron nearly did jump out of her skin as she felt a kiss on the back of her neck patrick had walked in through the unlocked door get out hissed cameron clapping her hand over the receiver shaking his head patrick sauntered into the livingroom she caught a blast of whisky as he passed talking gibberish furious at having to wind up her conversation with rupert so abruptly she said goodbye and went into the livingroom where she found patrick hurling darts at the dart board nice place youve got here i can see why you wouldnt want to give it up in a hurry get out screamed cameron not until you tell me why you didnt ring back he went up to the board and pulled out the darts his hands were shaking his eyes were black hollows in a deathly pale face he must have lost pounds he looked terrible there was no reason to call back we had a fun day a fun day he asked incredulously was that all it meant to you after the sunrise and all you told me about your mother and mike and you falling asleep in my arms shut up hissed cameron looking round in terror expecting tony to pop up from under the piano patrick picked up a huge bunch of anemones which hed left on the dentists chair i bought you these for christs sake i love you cant you understand that in answer cameron snatched the flowers from him and hurled them into the fireplace patrick winced and turned back to the dart board the first dart missed crashing into the wall the second hit the glass in the frame of one of camerons awards the third hit a plate pack it in said cameron more calmly if tony turns up hell kill us both hes a fiend ive been checking up on him said patrick sitting down at the piano hes so avaricious he went on between crashing chords even the bags under his eyes have got gold in them and hes corrupting you too turning you into his pet rottweiler to savage any of his staff he wants to reduce to jelly youll never get out of the underworld if you stay with him tony suits me said cameron over the din weve been together for three years ok my careers the only thing that matters so you agreed to drop me if he made you controller of programmes you flatter yourself what can you offer me patricks hands came down in a jumble of discords i being poor he said bitterly can only offer you my dreams stop talking like a primetime soap you should know you make enough of them can i have a drink youve had enough snarled cameron tonyll be here in a minute and hell settle you in that dentists chair said patrick scornfully and say open wide and then its wham bam thank you mammon my christ he slammed the piano lid down and got to his feet dont be obnoxious hissed cameron on new years day when shed sobbed in his arms hed seemed so strong suddenly now he looked terribly young and frightened cameron was too insecure herself to be drawn to frailty im truly sorry he muttered it hurts loving you thats all look ill do anything ill chuck trinity get a job itll be easy with pas connections always fall back on daddy dont you taunted cameron you bitch about his philistine programme but youll bleed him white when it suits you well im not having you bleeding me white cant you get it into your neanderthal skull that i dont want you around guilt at the way shed treated him made her even more brutal i cant help myself said patrick going towards the door la belle dame sans merci has me totally in thrall he went to the nearest pub and drank until long after closing time the landlady felt sorry for the beautiful obviously desolate young man sitting there quietly gazing into space at midnight patrick parked his car four houses down from camerons and got out it was a punishingly cold night cotchester slumbered beneath her eiderdown of snow in a sky russet from the streetlamps huge stars flickered icicles glittered from camerons gutters in front of the house beside camerons green lotus was parked tonys bloody great darkred rolls royce with the corinium ram on the bonnet there was a light on in the top of the house camerons bedroom guessed patrick he imagined tony brutally clambering over her lovely body the sunday before last shed lain in his arms pliant as a child he wanted to plunge one of the icicles into tonys heart wearing only a jersey and an old pair of cords he was shivering violently now then he noticed that tonys car keys were still in the dashboard trying the car door he found it open the lecherous bugger had obviously been in such a hurry to get at cameron hed forgotten to lock it easing open the door pulling out the keys patrick chucked them into a nearby flower bed they landed deep in a lavender bush hardly scattering the snow at four oclock in the morning tony looked at his watch i must go cameron didnt dissuade him she was utterly shattered to eradicate any memory of patrick tony had recently insisted on indulging in sexual marathons four times that night he thought smugly no one could accuse him of losing his touch cameron darent complain she was also twitchy that patrick might do something insane to rock the boat hearing tony let himself out she was just falling asleep when she heard a key turn in the door it was a sound that always unnerved her reminding her of mike for a wild moment of dread and longing she thought it might be patrick did i leave my keys here shouted tony by the time theyd upended the entire house the car and the drive screamed at each other and nearly frozen to death the lights had come on in the houses opposite and curtains were twitching in the houses on either side there was no way tony could start the rolls or get someone to help push it out of the way if he rang percy his chauffeur it would be round the entire network in a flash so he spent the next three hours frantically and abortively ringing round the country trying to find another set of keys in the end he had to order a taxi from the station his temper was not improved by the driver recognizing him and slyly my lording him all the way home arriving at the falconry he had to provide monica with a ridiculously convoluted explanation that hed decided to come home that night but that his car had gone into a skid on the motorway and hed had to abandon it he then had to keep her in bed in the morning so she wouldnt drive into cotchester and see his car parked outside camerons house as it was poor loyal cyril peacock tracked down a key and removed the rolls by midday but by then almost the entire corinium staff had seen the car on their way in to work and had had a good laugh that afternoon cameron passed the staff noticeboard beneath the card announcing her appointment as acting controller of programmes someone had added the words and mistress of the rolls later that day patrick rang cameron from birmingham airport to say goodbye did you steal tonys keys she shouted tell him to look under the lavender on the left of the front door cameron let patrick have it you stupid asshole if monica had come by and seen the car youd have landed tony in a divorce court i thought thats what you wanted dont be so fucking infantile i couldnt help it patricks voice faltered i cant bear to think of that great toad in bed with you get out of my life screamed cameron you dont know the rules i love you patrick was almost crying well i dont love you youre a fucking nuisance piss off and try and do something worthwhile with your life she was dead scared of telling tony about the keys but was amazed to find that he was grimly pleased what a very silly little boy to put such a very large nail in his fathers coffin at the end of january the iba formally asked for applications for the new franchises these applications which had to be provided not only by the fifteen incumbent independent companies but also by any rival consortium who sought to oust them often ran to hundreds of beautifully bound pages giving details of finance staffing policies plans for future programmes and proposed boards of management after the applications were handed in in early may the iba would study them and then conduct a series of public meetings around the country attempting to find out whether the public felt wellserved by their particular local television company after private meetings between the iba and all the individual contenders in october and november the franchises would be finally awarded in december anticipating a long year full of lobbying and hustling tony baddinghams immediate task in the new year was to strengthen the corinium board knowing the iba and particularly lady goslings penchant for women he intended to make cameron a director but he wanted to punish her as long as possible for stepping out of line with patrick and as the staff were still in a state of mutiny over her appointment he didnt want a strike on his hands in franchise year the staff however had short memories cameron had found simon harriss affairs in such a shambles that tony had quite enough excuses to dispense with his services when he came out of hospital but that would have to be done discreetly too then he could appoint cameron to the board just before the applications went in tony also had his lunch with freddie jones who heavily pressured by valerie was poised to join the corinium board his only reservation was whether with his electronics empire and his race horses and his hunting he would have sufficient time if he were a director he wanted to do some directing as an added incentive to valerie however tony invited freddie shooting the last saturday in january and asked some extremely grand people to shoot as well never having shot with freddie before tony issued a warning to the other guns beforehand freddie jones is a bit of a rough diamond but exceptionally able hes going to be very useful on our board if you know what i mean but im not sure how good a shot he is so bring your tin hat in the master bedroom at green lawns freddie jones lay beside his wife in the vast suede oval bed covered with dials for quadraphonic stereo radio dimmer switches razors and vibrators which valerie used to massage her neck they had to leave for tonys about nine it was now only six fortyfive which left plenty of time for sex thought freddie hopefully they had already drunk two cups of tea from the teasmade reaching across freddie put his hand on valeries bush fingering her clitoris from time to time as a doortodoor salesman not very hopeful of entrance might press a doorbell valerie sighed she knew no wife should deny her husband his conjugal rights but one of the joys of freddie getting up early to go hunting every saturday meant that she could pretend to be asleep as she did every weekday when he left for work at sixthirty valerie did everything to avoid sex she had already taken back to jollys of bath the absurdly sexy black lingerie an everhopeful freddie had bought her for christmas and replaced it with some peach satin sheets for the guest bedroom she always wore woollen nightgowns buttoned up to the neck if only she could sew up the bottom as well the pressing finger was getting more insistent dyou want to come fredfred do you not really i want to be fresh for tony and monica will you help me then valerie sighed again kneeling she raised the red woollen nightgown so freddie could admire her candy pink nipples and her neatly clipped bush she loathed watching him but at least it stopped her getting messy youre so beautiful sighed freddie youve got the body of a little girl heres some tissues dont waste a clean towel fredfred he had barely finished his lonely act before valerie had reached up to press another switch on the bedhead which instantly sent boiling water gushing out of the caratgold mixer taps into the vast onyx and sepia marble double bath next door then remembering she didnt want a flushed face valerie twiddled another knob to lower the temperature snowdrops spread in a milkwhite blur on either side of tony baddinghams drive the guns in their dungcoloured clothes gathered outside the falconry pulling on gumboots and bellowing at excited dogs that whisked about lifting their legs on monicas aconites at ninethirty just as it stopped raining freddies freshly cleaned red jaguar roared up the drive oh dear said freddie leaning out of the window and roaring with laughter at the other guns filthy landrovers i forgot to chuck a bucket of mud over my car before i came out amizing those snowdrops he said clambering out just like a big fall of snow he was wearing a red jersey a barbour and no cap on his redgold curls next minute valerie emerged from her side in a ginger knickerbocker suit with a matching ginger cloak flung round her shoulders and a ginger deerstalker christ muttered tony to sarah stratton its sherlock lovely homes said sarah making no attempt not to laugh all she needs is a curved pipe and a spy glass whats that asked valerie gaily we were admiring your er outfit said sarah quickly all from my spring range said valerie looking smug better hurry its selling like hot cakes tony oozed forward exuding charm you both know sarah and paul stratton of course and my brother bas he said smoothly and when he went on to introduce valerie to the lordlieutenant henry hampshire two peers and a duke from the next county valerie nearly had the orgasm freddie had so longed to give her earlier fredfred must definitely join the corinium board thought valerie it might be a prince or even a king next time hullo valerie said monica who was wearing a green souwester over a headscarf would you like a cup of coffee naughty chided valerie waving a tan suede finger i said you must call me mousie no i wont have a coffee thank you she didnt want to have to go to the toilet behind a hawthorn bush midmorning in front of all the gentry they were about to set off when the phone rang loudly in freddies car ullo mr ho chin how are fings said freddie in delight grite grite fifty million did you say yeah that seems about right look ave a word with alfredo and see if e wants to come in too and phone me back yes ill be on this number all day the guns exchanged looks of absolute horror as freddie extracted the telephone from the car all set to bring it with him tony sidled up dyou mind awfully leaving that thing behind might put off the pheasants course not said freddie putting it back in the car if chin cant get me ere hell ring my office dyou take your telephone hunting too asked an appalled paul always said freddie they started off up an incredibly steep hill behind the house it was one of those mild january days that give the illusion winter is over a few dirty suds of travellers joy still hung from the trees no wind ruffled the catkins it was hellishly hard going valerie wishing she hadnt worn her long johns tried not to pant as it started to rain she put up her ginger umbrella which kept catching in the branches on the brow of the hill the guns took up their position which theyd drawn out of a hat earlier except for freddies distracting redgold curls the flat caps along the row were absolutely parallel with the gun barrels shooting in the middle of the line between tony and the duke freddie jumped from foot to foot swinging his gun through the line like ian botham hooking the duke who had three daughters and was hoping for a son so the title wouldnt pass to a younger brother was not the only gun looking at freddie with extreme trepidation im ot said freddie shedding his barbour seeing the dukes and tonys looks of horror at freddies red jersey and bas laughing like a jackass valerie whod been yakking nonstop to sarah stratton about puffball skirts sharply told freddie to put it back on for once freddie ignored her suddenly the patter of rain on the flat caps was joined by the relentless swish of the beaters flags come on little birdies cooed paul caressing the trigger i hate him for being him and not rupert thought sarah despairingly a lone pheasant came into view high over freddies head bet he misses said paul the duke and tony raised their guns in case he did but a shot rang out and the pheasant somersaulted like a gaudy catherine wheel and thudded to the ground next moment a great swarm appeared some steeply rising some whirring close to the ground there was a deafening fusillade and the air was full of feathers as birds cartwheeled and crashed into the grass the whistle blew the first drive was over dogs shot off to retrieve the plunder it was plain from the number of brace being amassed by freddies loader that hed shot the plus twos off everyone else freddie jones seems a bloody good shot said bas beginners luck snapped paul who had easily shot the least for the next drive the guns formed a ring round a little yellow stone farmhouse with a turquoise door and a moulting christmas tree in the back yard once more the shots rang out once more the sky rained pheasants to left and right freddie the duke and the lordlieutenant were bringing down everything that came over tony fared less well valerie was standing behind him with monica and her endless chatter put him off at the end of the drive tonys loader knowing the competitive nature of his boss pinched a brace from bas on one side and another from the lordlieutenant who was gazing admiringly at sarah those are mine said the lordlieutenant sharply sorry said tony smoothly my loaders very jealous of my reputation jealous loader indeed muttered the lordlieutenant the next drive was a long one with the guns dotted like waistcoat buttons down the valley valerie was bored only the birds and the chuckling of a little stream interrupted the quiet monica who found shooting as boring as corinium television was plugged into the sony walkman archie had given her for christmas now she was transfixed by the love duet from tristan und isolde eyes shut dreamily waving her hands in time to the music and tripping over bramble cables sarah was equally uncommunicative weekends were the worst she reflected because knowing paul was at home rupert would never ring shed only come out today for something to do spring returns she murmured looking at the ruby and amethyst haze of the thickening buds but not my rupert he had been so keen but suddenly after valeries dinner party he had lost interest was it nathalie perrault or cameron cook or even maud ohara he was running after now perhaps he was just busy and would come back a diversion was provided by the arrival of hermione hampshire the lordlieutenants wife who looked like a sheep had a ringing voice and appeared to be on so many of the same committees as monica that she even merited having the walkman turned off freddies been shooting wonderfully said monica kindly and then started rabbiting on to hermione hampshire about shooting lunches valerie listened to them one could pick up lots of tips about pronunciation from the gentry but it was confusing that monica said eyether and hermione said eether in the next field she was somewhat unnerved by some black and white cows who cavorted skittishly around startled by the gunfire she edged closer to monica and hermione dyou know monica was saying i never spend less than forty minutes on a cock valerie was shocked to the core shed always imagined monica was somehow above sex i agree said hermione hampshire in her ringing voice i never spend less than thirty minutes on a hen theyre talking about plucking whispered sarah with a giggle and i dont think either of them have heard of rhyming slang it was the last drive before lunch freddie like a oneman bofors was bringing down pheasants with relentless accuracy got my eye in now he said grinning at the lordlieutenant he raised his gun as another pheasant flew towards him then swore as it crashed prematurely to the ground sorry said tony who couldnt bear being upstaged a moment longer thought you were unloaded this time it was carnage the air was raining feathers dogs circled loaders went round breaking the necks of the wounded lucky things thought sarah i wish someone would put me out of my misery i love your dog she said to henry hampshire i saw a beautiful springer the other day with a long tail good god said henry hampshire appalled and strode off leaving her in midsentence i thought you said you hadnt shot before said tony as they walked back to the house not pheasant said freddie but i was the top marksman at bisley for two years entering the garden they passed two yews cut in the shape of pheasants you couldnt even hit those today could you paul said tony nastily after so much open air and exercise everyone fell on lunch there was spanish omelette cut up in small pieces on cocktail sticks and a huge stew with baked potatoes and a winter salad and plum cake steeped in brandy and stilton with masses of claret and sloe gin freddie was in terrific form his curls had tightened in the rain looking more like a naughty cherub than ever he kept his end of the table in a roar with stories of his army career and his first catastrophic experiences out hunting henry hampshire who had a lean face and turneddown eyes shed his gentle paternalistic smile on everyone even sarah dyer really think springers look better with long tails he asked her sarah had a lot to drink at lunch she looks like a renoir thought tony all blonde curls huge blue eyes and languor have you made up your mind about joining corinium he asked her yes id love to ill come in and sign the contract tomorrow only a three months trial said tony who never took chances but i think youll love it this will be a very exciting year christ id like to take her to bed he thought cameron was being very uptight at the moment not too worried about me getting you on the telecasting couch he added lowering his voice sarah went crimson cameron must have told you about that i picked her brains i didnt realize you and she im sorry dont give it a thought said tony pouring her some more sloe gin no more stilton fredfred chided valerie what a lovely meal monica taggie ohara did the whole thing said monica i cant thank you enough for putting me on to her shes going to fill up the deep freeze before the children come home at halfterm valerie who was feeling a little out of things because everyone was laughing at freddies jokes turned to the duke after two glasses of claret shed be calling him your grouse in a minute we have a lovely home she said complacently green lawns i hope we shall receive you there one day the hunt was supposed to gather there on new years day do you ride to hounds well a bit said the duke who had his own pack freddies been asked to hunt with the belvoir thats the smartest pack in the country boasted valerie everyone except valerie knew that belvoir was not pronounced as it was spelt everyone except tony was wellbred enough to keep their traps shut buy tony was fed up with her stupid chatter if you were really smart valerie you wouldnt call it belvoir its pronounced beaver there was an embarrassed pause how long have you lived in gloucestershire asked the duke who was a kind man the women went off to various loos freddie went off to take a telephone call from tokyo what a very amusing fellow freddie jones is said the lordlieutenant and very very bright said tony thats why i need him on my board cable and satellite isnt just about technology or delivery systems you know its about marketing programmes freddies a genius at marketing shame we couldnt include his jumpedup bitch of a wife as part of the bag not on a cocksonly day said bas everyone laughed the guns were waiting to start off for the last two drives of the day freddie was still on the telephone to tokyo valerie was admiring the azaleas in monicas conservatory it was unfortunate that when freddie came into the hall he found sarah stratton in valeries deerstalker giggling frantically and brandishing valeries tan mackintosh cape at which basil was pretending to charge like a bull olé said tony who was grinning in the doorway its selling laike hot gâteaux squealed sarah then seeing freddie she went very pink and asked him if he thought the deerstalker suited her at that moment valerie came into the hall you look delaightful she said excitedly ive got identical ones in stock ill set one asaide for you i really feel ive made a breakthrough with sarah stratton valerie kept telling freddie as they drove home having done her stuff in the morning and during lunch monica felt justified in staying behind in the afternoon and doing some gardening before she got stuck into pruning she popped into the kitchen to thank taggie but found her looking absolutely miserable standing on one leg what on earths the matter said monica alarmed everything was wonderful taggie hung her head im desperately sorry lady baddingham but i didnt realize it was a shooting lunch i know it sounds pppriggish but i dont apppprove of shooting i think its very cruel all those poor pheasants and id rather not cook for those kind of lunches any more you probably wont want me to do any more cooking now im so sorry as i like working for you so much monicas face softened dont give it a thought it was very brave of you to stick up for your principles the shooting seasons virtually over now anyway i quite understand as long as you go on doing other lunches and dinner parties for me and filling up the freezer when tony came out of a meeting on monday morning miss madden greeted him with the news that freddie had rung get him for me would you said tony he smiled expansively as he was put through freddie hullo you shot bloody well everyone was most impressed thank you very much for asking us said freddie we must make it a regular thing next season tony made a thumbsup sign to cameron i dont fink so said freddie coldly im not joining your board why ever not said tony astounded i dont like people patronizing valerie i know you was all laughing at her it was a joke protested tony were all devoted to mousie i dont mind anyone laughing at me but no one puts er down and freddie put down the receiver the tragedy was that valerie was absolutely livid with freddie who was not prepared to hurt her by telling her why hed backed off valerie over whose head the cracks about the belvoir and the boutique had gone completely ranted on and on about how monica had become such a good friend and tony had promised to film the boutique and put her on behind every famous man and what amusing people the duke the lordlieutenant the strattons bas and even the oharas were and now she supposed all theyd do was mix with boring businessmen even when tony dispatched sarah to the boutique to buy the cloak the knickerbocker suit and the deer stalker freddie didnt relent tony couldnt directly blame declan for freddie joness defection but he blamed him for everything else for inciting rebellion in the newsroom with his subversive lefty attitudes for egging charles fairburn on to put in larger and larger expenses for camerons bad temper which was no doubt caused by declans handsome son patrick for declans trouncing of maurice wooton which had made tony so anxious to get freddie on the board and waste so much time and money wooing him only to be rejected it was generally agreed at corinium that tony had never sustained a mood of utter bloodymindedness for quite so long and the only way declan could redeem himself would be to crucify rupert campbellblack when he interviewed him on st valentines day a massacre declan looked forward to with grim relish as he researched the programme declan found himself increasingly fascinated by the complexities of ruperts character he was obviously very good at his job the ministry for sport when rupert was offered it had been merely a pr post answerable to the ministry of the environment with the home office dealing with any major disasters like football riots rupert however had refused to take on the job unless he was given sole responsibility for all sport in the country and any trouble that ensued the gamble paid off he had had spectacular success in curbing football hooliganism he had raised a vast amount of money for sport particularly the next olympics he had had rows with the teachers unions over the decline of competitive sport in schools with the football association rows with fellow ministers even rows with the pm but he got things done and he cut through waffle utterly sure of his own judgement he was sometimes too arrogant and having been a great athlete himself he tended to side with the players rather than the management but when he went against officials it was always because hed discovered a weakness in their argument he was extremely lucky in gerald middleton his private secretary declan also noted ruperts appallingly deprived childhood not of material things but of love and stability his beautiful mother was on her fifth marriage his fathers fourth marriage had just come unstuck then there was his taking over of the family home at penscombe with its four hundred acres when he was only twentyone and just making the big time in showjumping and soon having it running at a thumping profit there were the frequent rumblings in the press about his cruelty to his horses or at least ruthlessly overjumping them there was the compulsive womanizing that hardly stopped with marriage or divorce even today when he should be setting a good example far too many women appeared only too anxious to say yes minister declan had spoken to ruperts best friend billy lloydfoxe now head of sport at the bbc who had nothing but praise for the way rupert had helped him in the past curing him of alcoholism and virtually saving his marriage he also talked to malise gordon ruperts old chef déquipe now married to ruperts exwife helen who said ruperts urge to win was the strongest motivating force in his character whatever he does hell get to the top he talked to numerous exes who all described rupert as impossible but irresistible not least because he made them laugh and to several cabinet ministers who spoke of him with respect rather than affection everyone cited ruperts phenomenal energy after the punishing hours of showjumping he took the gruelling work load of sports minister in his stride accustomed to adulation and easy conquest on the showjumping circuit he had been unaffected both by the reverence and sycophancy which surrounds mps and the brickbats thrown at them by the press and in the house because he was fearless and not short of money he made a surprisingly good mp happy to kick up a fuss on behalf of his constituency whenever necessary chalford and bisley were proud once again rupert had put them on the map this therefore was the man that declan read every word written about and became obsessed with as he strode through the frozen gloucestershire valleys or tossed and turned in his bed at night this was the man he thought as he worked out his questions with a black churning sickening hatred who could at any moment take maud or taggie or even caitlin off him on the surface maud seemed to have got over her passion for rupert she had discovered anthony powells novels and was steadily reading her way through the twelve volumes of a dance to the music of time aided by rather too much whisky of an evening she was very listless but this could be attributed to the length and severity of the winter she showed no interest in his interview with rupert st valentines day dawned causing the usual flutter of excitement at corinium television and giving hernias to the postmen staggering up cotchester high street under sackfuls of coloured envelopes none of these envelopes however were addressed to cameron not that she really noticed since shed taken over simon harriss job she was working herself into the ground not only was she still producing declan and overseeing the production of a new series of four men went to mow but she was now in sole charge of corinium programmes and seemed to spend her time scheduling commissioning arguing about budgets or going to meetings with other programme controllers in london patrick bombarded her with increasingly anguished letters to which she didnt reply only that morning hed sent her a huge valentine bunch of lilies of the valley at home darling cameron said the accompanying letter i am going into a decline decline ohara ive lost so much weight my friends are convinced ive got aids having been told by you to make something of my life you will be pleased that i have given up drink almost and am writing my play and working hard the play is no longer about british intimidation in ireland but about a young boy in love with an older woman who cant tear herself away from an absolute bastard dont worry about libel ive given lord bad hat red hair i suppose i ought to thank you for making me experience unhappiness in love did you know james joyce actually encouraged his wife to have affairs so he could find out what it was like to be a cuckold jim isnt that a ghastly let down wrote mrs joyce wants me to go with other men so he can write about it stupid pratt he couldnt have loved her my mother says my father is incredibly ratty are things going very badly at corinium before you tear this letter up remember it will be worth something one day and might well keep you in lonely old age when your ancient lover baddingham has croaked i love you and remain in darkness patrick as she left for the office cameron put the lilies of the valley outside the back door in case tony came home with her after declans programme not that that was likely their relationship had deteriorated they fought less but formerly their rows had been the snapping of foreplay now when tony made love to her there was a brutality and coldness never there before to make matters worse sarah stratton in all her radiant beauty had joined corinium as a prospective presenter and her pussycat smile her blonde halo of hair her soft angora bosom and her wafts of anaïs anaïs had affected the men in the building like zuleika dobson james vereker wearing a different pastel pullover every day and behaving like a lovesick schoolboy had been nicknamed hankerman by the newsroom the head of news was taking the task of initiating sarah very seriously indeed even tony chose every opportunity to see if she was all right summoning her to drinks in his office after work or to join boardroom lunches to impress visiting bigwigs cameron consequently got more histrionic and ratty with the staff if simon and cameron are anything to go by observed charles fairburn control is the one ingredient unnecessary for the job of controller of programmes james had so many valentines he decided to do a little item on cotswold roundup to thank his fans and conduct a studio discussion as to whether men were more romantic and caring than they used to be sarah received one valentine card postmarked penscombe with no writing inside having never had a letter from rupert she couldnt be sure the flashy blue scrawl on the envelope was his but she was almost certain declans valentines arrived by the sackful but he was too preoccupied with rupert to open them taggie had a trying day no one sent her any valentines she was doing dinner for the lordlieutenant that evening and had made a huge ratatouille and left it to cool overnight in the larder only to find that declan had put the whole lot out on the lawn for the badgers whod refused to touch it declans only distraction these days apart from birdwatching was putting food out at night and crouching in a dimlylit kitchen waiting for the foxes and badgers to turn up now he was roaring round the house in bare feet complaining once again that his utterly bloody children had swiped every single one of the daglo catsick yellow socks that he had made so fashionable looking for a pair under caitlins bed he found a vodka bottle empty except for a cockroach and said once again that they really must sack grace absolutely not said maud firmly i need my greek chorus declan was just leaving for the studios weighed down with poisoned rapiers to stick into rupert when taggie came rushing into the kitchen speechless with excitement and brandishing a vast valentine covered in hearts which had just arrived by special delivery and which played the white cliffs of dover on the xylophone every time you opened it what the hells that its from rupert hes sent gertrude a valentine whatever for snapped maud he once said she was ugly he must have changed his mind how gratuitously taggie brought out her word for the day in triumph kind of him bloody hell thought declan as he went out into the dank february drizzle not content with groping taggie and ensnaring maud hes now trying to seduce my dog taggie ran after him you wont give rupert too hard a time will you throughout the network declans interview with rupert had been trailed every hour on the hour during the day makeup had drawn lots as to who was to attend to him declan tried to snatch a quiet couple of hours in his office sharpening his poisoned rapiers but was interrupted by one member of staff after another trooping in to grumble about tony he bollocked me for not giving the reps extra bonuses in january said georgie barnes the sales director if i had hed have bollocked me for squandering coriniums resources last week he shouted at me because my desk was a mess moaned cyril peacock so i had a big tidy out then when he came in this afternoon and found me with an empty desk he bawled me out for doing nothing charles fairburn was furious because for the seventh week running his request for a hundred pounds to replace the fur hat seb burrows had put on the corinium ram at christmas had been crossed off his expenses sarah stratton wearing a clinging palegrey angora dress sat in the newsroom with the head of news who was showing off his muscle by demanding why the bbc had had a story at lunchtime which his reporters had missed of course cotswold roundup is the companys flagship he told sarah we lose or retain the franchise according to whether or not the programme truly represents local news and views we have to be consistent questioning responsible and entertaining its the one area where interference from cameron or tony isnt tolerated the autonomy of the newsroom is undisputed beside him the internal telephone rang taking his hand off sarahs knee the head of news picked up the receiver and turned pale of course lord b i quite understand ill put someone on the story right away sarah smiled into her paper cup and said nothing on the air now james vereker having thanked all his fans ver ver much for their caring valentines was interviewing a local witch whod just made a record she was wearing a black mini and crinkled black boots and had huge bare mottled thighs which she kept crossing and recrossing so james could see everything im sure youre a very caring person tamzin said james averting his eyes but dont you think the general public has a rather more sinister idea of witches turn him into a toad screamed seb burrows in the newsroom throwing a paper dart at the screen wish shed make an effigy of tony and stick pins into it said charles fairburn we could market a baddingham pin cushion said seb itd sell even better than declan tshirts sarah wasnt listening rupert will be here soon she thought shed warned paul she might be late because tony wanted her to help at some pr party tony in fact had asked her up to the board room to watch ruperts interview and impress a couple of big advertisers rupert was bound to pop in after the programme i know he sent me the valentine thought sarah wriggling in ecstasy he must want to come back rupert in fact had had a very tough day he had had an acrimonious meeting with the uefa committee who were still refusing to let english soccer teams play in europe next season hed had to smooth over the scandal of a chinese pingpong player caught shoplifting in an ann summers sex shop hed tried to persuade the advertising institute that there was no very good reason why a large condom manufacturer shouldnt sponsor the rugby league cup final next year and coped with the health authority up in arms because a famous racing driver had gone on wogan in a marlboro tshirt because all these meetings ran late he had only had half an hour to harangue a group of headmasters on the decline of competitive sport in schools which had been exacerbated by the teachers strike finally just as he was leaving for cotchester the pm had summoned him wanting him to lean on the british lions to cancel their tour of south africa to encourage the athletes to boycott the european games next month rupert lost his temper politics shouldnt be brought into sport he snapped im not going to pressure anyone to boycott anything youve absolutely no idea what its like to be an athlete how would you have liked it if the day you became prime minister someone had ordered you to refuse the job and youd been almost certain youd never get another chance you cant force people to abide by principles you wouldnt dream of sticking to yourself and the prime minister had dismissed rupert very frostily saying she hoped hed have second thoughts on the matter i feel like a football at the end of the cup final said rupert as he collapsed into the black government car beside sydney his official driver everyones having a go at me today who won the threethirty they discussed racing until the heathrow exit then rupert fell asleep sydney liked working for rupert he enjoyed the glamour and ruperts erratic hours brought him spectacular overtime gerald middleton ruperts private secretary sat in the back with the light on going through ruperts red box streamlining as much as possible pencilling in little notes on what action to take glancing at the sprawled elegant figure in front with the head fallen sideways gerald fought the temptation to stroke the sleek blond hair rupert would never know the selfcontrol gerald had to exert day after day never to betray his feelings it must be some death wish that made him pour all his energies into ruperts career ensuring ruperts rapid escalation up the political scale to the head of a far grander ministry away from gerald that is unless rupert did something silly like going on declans programme tonight gerald looked at his watch they were cutting it very fine just as well rupert wouldnt have time for too many whiskys in hospitality beforehand cameron went to the control room early she liked to have half an hour before the programme to take a deep breath and think about what she had to do as she closed the door the jaws theme belted out from the sound room next door this joke had been going on ever since she was made controller of programmes she found it very unfunny but looking though the glass windows and the vertical blinds at the guffawing sound men on one side and the vision controllers on the other it obviously creased up everyone else ruperts cool unsmiling face stared out at her from every single monitor screen except those that would feed in stills telecine and video tape to illustrate aspects of ruperts life during the programme on the studio floor they were checking the order of the stills up on the monitor came pictures of rupert winning the world cup and standing on the olympic rostrum with his arm in a sling of his beautiful exwife helen of beattie johnson and nathalie perrault and amanda hamilton wife of the foreign secretary there was jake lovell ruperts archrival on the circuit and his chef déquipe malise gordon whod ended up with helen they looked like characters in some glamorous hollywood miniseries declan was clearly hell bent on carnage the rest of the crew drifted into the studio after their dinner break daysee butler weighed down with stop watches and blue mascara and wearing a new palepink jersey with a large grey cat knitted on the front took up her position on camerons left rupertll be here in five minutes go and meet him daysee and take him straight to makeup said cameron on the monitor she could already see declan slumped in his wizards chair flicking the key switch she warned him of ruperts arrival are you going to have a drink with him beforehand i am not he looks shattered thought cameron hed lost so much weight recently his black hair was even more threaded with grey the violet shadows under his eyes reminded her of patrick but she mustnt think of patrick just do a maurice wooton on him dec and tonyll die happy as long as he dies growled declan i dont care if hes happy or not rupert sydney and gerald waited in reception looking at photographs of declan charles fairburn and james vereker who was no longer obscured by the christmas tree fuckin ell its farah fawcett major said sydney as daysee swayed down the royalblue steel staircase giving them the benefit of her bouncing strawberryblonde hair and undulating figure can i take you straight to makeup minister said daysee cant you and i go to the cotchester arms instead said rupert daysee looked at her watch i dont think theres time she said seriously youre on in fifteen minutes i dont want any makeup all i need is a vast whisky said rupert gerald handed daysee some photographs here are the pix of the olympic games oh thanks said daysee ill get graphics to softmount them sounds like a contradiction in terms said rupert softmounting means sticking a photograph on a background from which it can easily be peeled off explained daysee patiently definitely farah fawcett nco muttered rupert to gerald as they follow daysee upstairs youre lovely and brown said the makeup girl applying a touch of nouveau beige to the shine on ruperts nose and forehead skiing last weekend said rupert he wondered for the millionth time why the hell hed agreed to do this interview partly he knew it was cameron taunting him about being afraid of declan but in between frantic hard work and cavorting in bed and on the ski slopes with nathalie perrault he had kept remembering taggie in floods at patricks party over her fathers catastrophic finances daysee brought rupert a dark mahogany whisky which gerald immediately took to the makeup department wash basin and diluted with water you havent eaten all day minister yes nanny said rupert id better take you down said daysee gerald straightened ruperts blue spotted tie for christs sake be careful if he asks you anything you dont like just say you didnt come on the programme to discuss personal matters dont bitch up other ministers try not to lose your temper rupert grinned anyone would think i was off to my first term at prep school gerald didnt smile you behave like it sometimes large orange letters outside the studio said no entry when flashing i should think not said rupert draining his whisky and giving the glass to daysee do they want me to expose myself on air christ hes photogenic said cameron in the gallery as she watched rupert sit down opposite a tense unsmiling declan look at that jawline and the way his eyes lengthen when he smiles declans nervous said the vision mixer as the sound man tested both men for level listen to the quiver in his voice in his earpiece declan could now hear daysee discussing a boyfriend who was coming to dinner tomorrow the recipe says lots of garlic but i think ill leave it out that ruperts dead attractive isnt he declan looked at rupert lounging so relaxed radiating élitism and privilege with his red indian suntan his beautifully cut suit and his blue silk shirt matching his insolent blue eyes he thought of taggie sobbing with humiliation after valerie joness party and of maud sobbing in his arms the night of patricks twentyfirst and his resolve hardened either of you need a touchup asked the makeup girl whisking on with her steel basket id love to give you one said rupert the makeup girl blushed rupert leaned forward and looked at the nametape on one of declans odd socks it said charlotte websterlee shes a friend of caitlins snapped declan i think i used to know her mother very well said rupert is charlotte blonde with blue eyes cant he let up for a second thought declan savagely trouble ahead decided rupert as he chatted idly with the crew about cotchesters chances against wandsworth united on saturday this mans out to bury me one minute to air declan said the floor manager good luck said cameron stand by tape said daysee the floor manager raised his hand to cue declan the red light flashed on and he was off my guest tonight needs no introduction he has been described as the greatest show jumper in the world the handsomest man in england the icing on the cake of the tory party he is of course the minister for sport and the mp for chalford and bisley rupert campbellblack dispensing with the introductory package declan weighed straight in do you mind being described as the handsomest man in england why should i youre not frightened of being dismissed just as a pretty face no of being dragged into the tory party just to add an element of muchneeded glamour no because its not true for what other reason could you possibly have been brought in said declan dismissively i know more about sport than anyone else in the party said rupert simply having lasted in show jumping for sixteen years on what must be the most gruelling circuits in the world i can cope with the pressures one day youre king of the castle in show jumping next day youre bottom of the heap its helped me to be resilient about the ups and downs of politics do you find politics as satisfying as showjumping of course not but it has its compensations what are they the olympic fund has just passed four million and weve still got eighteen months to go soccer violence is down by seventy per cent comprehensive schools are gradually upping competitive sport and rupert grinned nastily england trounced ireland at rugger last saturday gerald sipping perrier in the board room winced that was a cheap point rupert shouldnt have made it the government makes two hundred million pounds a year from tax on football pools accused declan and yet youre asking the clubs to spend two million this year tightening up their security to reduce football violence why dont you give them some help with footballers earning one hundred thousand pounds a year and stars like garry lineker changing hands for over a million i think the football clubs can put their own houses in order some people feel youre taking a strong line on soccer violence because its electorally attractive do they said rupert politely shit thought declan i walked right into that one rupert relented just because something is electorally attractive doesnt make it wrong i want to clean up the terraces and make them safe places for fathers to take their families again or the gamell be drained of its support and future talent declan changed tack i see from the evening paper that youre backing the british lions tour of south africa thereby giving your blessing to a corrupt and evil regime rubbish said rupert wondering if the pm was listening sports outside politics athletes are so briefly at their peak they should be allowed to compete where and against whom they like its bloody easy to have principles when youre not making the sacrifices and so the programme went on with nice bitchy repartee flashing back and forth but on the whole rupert deflected declans needling easily then declan said youve been described as the prime ministers blueeyed boy boys pushing it im thirtyseven said rupert but as ive got blue eyes i dont see how i could be anything else she seems to prefer goodlooking men shed need her head examined if she didnt said rupert coldly do you prefer dogs yourself youve always got on well with women said declan wasnt it amanda hamilton a large glamorous picture of the foreign secretarys wife appeared on the screen who drew you into politics and her husband rollo said rupert quickly they both encouraged me despite repeated probing from declan rupert refused to give an inch on the subject of amanda hamilton it was mrs hamilton said declan pointedly who drove you down to your first meeting with your constituency do you find a conflict between your ministerial and constituency duties of course snapped rupert i dont have enough time to devote to my constituency they come first theyre the people who voted me in ive lived in the area all my life and i dont want a bloody great motorway half a mile from penscombe any more than they do gerald put his head in his hands tony purring with pleasure was pacing up and down the boardroom carpet rupert is beginning to lose his temper he said softly i cant help it thought sarah i still love him was it merely lust for power that drove you into politics asked declan dismissively it certainly wasnt the money or the free time snapped rupert most ministers are hopelessly overworked the civil service want control and pile work on to keep us quiet sometimes you get home at three in the morning after a session in the house then still have to go through your box thats when the trouble starts youre so zonked you ok a nuclear power station in your constituency and six months later you realize to your horror what youve done im very lucky i have an exceptional private secretary in gerald middleton he does all my donkey work and wraps my knuckles if i go too far im also lucky went on rupert yawning ostentatiously because on the circuit i learnt to grab sleep at any time with anyone said declan he was taunting rupert now no drawled rupert ive always been selective thats not what your press cuttings say a still of samantha freebody the starlet whod told all about sleeping with rupert while he was married appeared on the screen followed by a succession of beauties including amanda hamiltons daughter georgina beattie johnson and nathalie perrault coming to we must catch ruperts reaction after this lot said cameron take but ruperts face was expressionless declan picked up a cutting from the table one gloucestershire peer has described you as rather a nasty virus that everyones wife caught sooner or later if youd seen his wife its definitely later said rupert lightly but there was a muscle going in his cheek with the advent of aids dont you feel you should mend your ways sure said rupert im giving up casual sex for lent tony was getting restless and picking up a telephone dialled the control room tell declan to stop farting around and put the boot in tony says put the boot in declan cameron told declan get him on to cruelty declan squared his shoulders over the past two years youve expressed sympathy for the football hooligans rupert stared at his shoes most of them probably lead appallingly dull lives during the week many are out of work or just turning lathes in a factory the terraces are their stage their chance to vent the frustrations of the week they generally riot because theyre losing or theres been a bad penalty at halftime you were a bad loser werent you said declan gently it was the voice of torquemada the pale intent face of the grand inquisitor rupert looked wary whats the point of competing except to win even to the extent of beating up your horses ruperts eyes narrowed but he just stared back at declan saying nothing look at this picture said declan showing a still of a horse so thin it was almost a skeleton this was one of your horses macaulay you beat him up so badly he wouldnt jump for you so you sold him to the middle east where he ended up in the stone quarries that was bad luck said rupert i sold halfadozen horses to the same sheik one of thems at stud in america now two of them are still with him the horse didnt click with him so he sold it on and your deadly enemy jake lovell nursed the horse back to health and then entered it in the world championship and in the finals when you all had to ride each others horses macaulay wasnt very keen on having you on his back remember this on the screen came a clip of rupert being finally bucked off then being chased round the ring by the maddened horse before taking refuge in the centre of a vast jump coming to take screamed cameron frantic once again to get the reaction on ruperts face but once again it was completely blank only his long fingers clenched round the glass of water on the table betrayed any emotion hes going to walk out said tony happily youd beaten up that horse so badly said declan almost in a whisper that it remembered and went for you what dyou feel seeing that clip today there was another long pause that i was in the wrong sport said rupert slowly with me running that fast neither seb coe nor ovett would have had a chance against me in the metres for a second the two men glared at each other then rupert grinned and declan started to laugh have you got any regrets you treated your horses so badly i didnt treat them all badly or they wouldnt have jumped so well of course i regret it but it helped me understand the football hooligans poor sods out of work their fathers out of work often their grandfathers too out of sheer frustration at not winning they resort to violence you were in work i know there was really no excuse you treated women very badly in the past rupert shrugged helplessly i liked winning there too jake lovell went on declan remorselessly was your arch rival because you bullied him at school are we having oranges at halftime protested rupert shaking his head declan smiled slightly jake lovell finally got his revenge by running off with your wife helen in the middle of the olympics how did you feel at the time rupertll kill declan in a minute thought gerald in panic no ones ever dared ask him these questions i was principally outraged that she should distract me and jake when we should have been concentrating on a team gold said rupert but you still got your medal despite dislocating your shoulder and riding with one arm that was just to show them that even riding one man short and one man injured we could beat the whole world prompted by declan rupert went on to talk about the olympics and rocky the horse hed won a gold medal on who still lived at penscombe im so cruel to rocky drawled rupert that he has the entire run of my garden and spends his time trampling over the flower beds and peering in at the drawingroom window i like this man why i am trying to crucify him thought declan i like this man even though hes trying to crucify me thought rupert tony went into the nextdoor office to ring cameron so the advertisers wouldnt hear him declans gone soft for christs sake tell him to fucking nail him what did you feel declan was asking now when helen split up with jake and married your old team manager well i didnt let off fireworks it was like ones childhood sweetheart marrying ones headmaster do you mind her being happy now not at all said rupert in surprise its better for the children anyway she deserved it she had a rough time with me in what way showjumping and marriage dont mix i was never there when she needed me when she was having marcus i was stuck on an alpine pass she was an intellectual and i hardly know oscar wilde from kim wilde then the dogs were always getting in the bed yes said declan people say you were fonder of your black labrador badger than of helen i had him first said rupert flatly he lived with me six years after she left me he never criticized or tried to improve me is that what you want from women uncritical adulation rupert grinned probably the questions were still barbed but the animosity had gone your names been linked since your divorce with some dazzling women have you ever thought of marrying again just because i enjoy flying on concorde doesnt mean i want to buy the plane these questions are giving me earache grumbled rupert out of the corner of his eye declan could see the floor manager holding up his hand for three minutes when you get any free time whats the thing you like doing best rupert put his head on one side i thought this was supposed to be a family programme you must have some hobbies said declan hastily hunting shooting fishing said rupert all the blood sports declans lip was curling not all i didnt include being interviewed by you on television touché said declan laughing who are your heroes if you could choose who would you like to meet in an afterlife for a second rupert seemed to have difficulty in speaking id like to see badger again he muttered oh how sweet said daysee who was now revving up for her most important moment pressing the cue switch the floor manager was making windup signals to declan looking back on your sixteen years in showjumping can you remember the hardest thing you had to do was it getting the first bronze winning the kings cup three years running clinching the team gold in or finally winning the world championship there was another long pause what was the hardest thing declan urged him just for a second the despair showed through on ruperts face the thing that nearly killed me he said bleakly was giving it up as schuberts fifth symphony pounded out and the credits came up declan most uncharacteristically could be seen getting out of his chair and shaking rupert by the hand as soon as they were off air cameron came down onto the studio floor maybe it was because she was blinking in the unaccustomed light after the darkness of the control room but for once her yellow eyes seemed to have lost all their aggression great programme declan best youve done for us and you were marvellous flushing slightly she turned to rupert declan threw you some really tough questions and you handled them so well i hope my boss thinks so said rupert coming on your programmes rather like being interrogated by the ira i was expecting electrodes any minute cameron had amazing legs he noticed as she walked upstairs in front of them up in hospitality tony baddingham was feeling far from hospitable but had to restrain himself in front of his two big advertisers who were terrific fans both of declan and rupert and who felt they had just witnessed a great gladiatorial contest with a shaking hand the normally teetotal gerald helped himself to a triple whisky wasnt it wonderful said sarah busily powdering her nose and undoing another pearl button of her little grey dress declan brought out a really vulnerable side of rupert im sure he just needs the love of a good woman and the attention of a whole harem of mistresses as well thought gerald he had disapproved very strongly of ruperts affair with sarah regarding it as political dynamite he hoped it wasnt going to start again but as rupert walked in with declan and cameron sarah rushed up and flung her arms round his neck giving him the benefit of unsupported breasts and half a bucket of anais anais darling you were wonderful so honest not much else i could do without walking off the set when am i going to see you murmured sarah thank you so much for your valentine but before rupert had time to answer her gerald muscled in im sorry minister i never dreamed decland go that far rupert raised an eyebrow at geralds glass of whisky are we in trouble i dont know said gerald the press are going berserk already i told the switchboard to say youd left well have to smuggle you out by a side door tony having introduced the big advertisers to rupert went and vented his fury on declan i thought i told you to fucking well crucify him i tried to said declan coldly but he was too good for me and turning on his heel he headed towards the drinks seeing tony coming to give her an earful cameron grabbed a plate of quiche and took it over to rupert who to sarahs fury turned away from the group to talk to her after the tension of the interview he was gripped by the lust that always used to overwhelm him after a big showjumping class in the old days he would have screwed a groom or a showjumping groupie in the back of his lorry tonight he was sure he could choose between daysee sarah or cameron daysee was too thick sarah too possessive cameron on the other hand had a reckless scrawny nymphomania and pulling her would have the added charm of irritating the hell out of tony well he said icily i had to box bloody clever to get out of that one i suppose tony put declan up to it im sorry said cameron glancing up she found she couldnt tear her eyes away being sorry isnt enough said rupert softly im going to get my own back cameron gasped she could see tony bearing down on them i was wondering if youd like to come on another programme its the third thursday in march she stammered and have openheart surgery all over again without an anaesthetic no thanks besides its cheltenham its not until the evening said cameron quickly all wed want you to do is to judge miss corinium television with declan there are some beautiful girls entered i might just be able to drag myself away said rupert as long as you promise me a night in the cotchester arms with the winner as second prize whats the first prize said cameron knowing the answer a night in the cotchester arms with you said rupert and my god id make you walk differently in the morning it was several seconds before they both realized that a tenselooking gerald was tapping rupert on the arm telephone its the pm oh christ said rupert back benches here i come well done said the prime minister in her rich deep voice that always sounded like carnation milk pouring out of a tin we were very proud of you you were said rupert in amazement well what else could you have done faced with that spiteful little pinko you handled him very well that interview will do us a lot of good in the opinion polls good god said rupert putting down the telephone she actually liked it was that really the pm said one of the big advertisers in awe did she mention me said james whod rolled up from a savetheaged fundraising party ive booked a table for us at the horn of plenty at ninethirty said cameron casually to rupert the cars are waiting downstairs despite her offhand manner rupert noticed she was quivering with expectancy like a greyhound ordered to sit when the woolly rabbit sets off round the track then he caught a glimpse of declan looking grey and utterly shattered once again he remembered taggies tears on new years eve sweet of you he said to cameron but declan and i are going back to penscombe weve got things to discuss aware of tony watching her cameron hid her bitter disappointment being very young sarah had no such reserve you cant go she wailed well be far too many girls james can come instead said tony smoothly thats if he hasnt got to rush home to lizzie of course not said james thats rather uncaring of you said sarah sulkily work comes first said james sanctimoniously and you havent told me what you thought of my valentine sarah i thought it was rather nice that it was sold to raise money for the cats protection league back at penscombe two jack russells a young black labrador two springer spaniels and a blue lurcher threw themselves on rupert in ecstasy once inside rupert whisked gerald and declan past tapestried hunting scenes and portraits of ancestors only pausing to point out a huge oil painting of badger into the kitchen which was lowbeamed with a flagstone floor and a window looking over the valley as gerald found a bottle of whisky and three glasses and rupert investigated the fridge and the larder declan looked at the pictures on the wall they were mostly paintings of dogs and horses and framed photographs of two incredibly beautiful children thats tabitha said rupert pointing to a little girl on a pony festooned with rosettes shes magic said declan shes doing bloody well in junior classes already does the boy ride said declan looking at the sensitive nervous face and the huge eyes no he gets asthma but he skis well and hes extremely clever there was a slight edge to ruperts voice can i have a look round asked declan go ahead said rupert as he wandered through beautiful pastel room after pastel room admiring the incredible pictures a romney a gainsborough a lely a thomas lawrence and two stubbs for starters and the lovingly polished furniture he thought the whole house was like a museum beautiful but crying out for someone to live in it or like a horse constantly bridled saddled and groomed to perfection but with no one to ride it finding the library declan was lost in admiration hed never seen such books in a private house first editions of scott dickens trollope wordsworth keats and shelley and a whole set of oscar wilde and other books so rare there couldnt be more than halfadozen copies in the country half an hour later rupert found him oblivious of time immersed in a first edition of middlemarch supper christ you cant read in this light can i come and live here said declan shaking his head in bewildered reverence borrow anything you like whenever you want to no one else reads them helen pretended to but never seemed to get beyond the first chapter laid out on the kitchen table was smoked salmon brown bread gulls eggs and half a heatedup chicken pie gerald had also made a tomato salad and fried some potatoes its very good of you mumbled declan i couldnt have faced dinner with tony not up to taggies standard im afraid said rupert adding casually how is she very pleased with gertrudes valentine oh she got it said rupert ironic that the first valentine i ever sent in my life should be to a dog they talked about politics horses and sport and then rupert filled declan in on local gossip and some of the early history of penscombe i hope penscombe waits for me sighed declan ive been so busy since weve lived here ive never had a chance to explore it i havent even been into the local pub yet it was not until theyd both got pretty drunk and gerald had gone to bed that rupert asked how things were at corinium bloody awful said declan tony declan nodded wearily i seem to go from baddingham to worse he didnt look very happy after the programme he wasnt he wanted me to carve you up rupert grinned you had a bloody good try i know why tony was out for my blood but why you just because im a tory no for screwing up tag at valerie joness dinner party ah and i thought you were after her at patricks birthday party suddenly declan didnt want to mention maud rupert inhaled deeply on his cigar would that have been so bad shes eighteen and desperately insecure said declan roughly shes simply not equipped to cope youd break her like a moth caught in the typewriter keys ouch said rupert wincing i saw them all slavering this evening went on declan sarah cameron that imbecile daysee you could have had any of them just spare taggie rupert however was reluctant to drop the subject but she seems incredibly competent she cooked brilliantly for valerie and she coped with your party on new years eve virtually singlehanded oh shes competent enough said declan you mustnt assume people with dyslexia are thick just because they have difficulty reading and writing albert einstein leonardo da vinci and thomas edison were all dyslexic so was general patton he could never learn the alphabet or his tables by heart good god said rupert in alarm so we can expect to see taggie commanding the third army at any minute declan grinned rupert filled up their glasses with brandy is tony really giving you a hard time septic tankwise im up to here declan drew a finger across his throat he got up and wandered slightly unsteadily towards the window beautiful house this wheres the priory from here rupert pointed to the left where through a spiky fuzz of trees a light was burning taggies still awake thats her bedroom he added without thinking then when declan instantly looked bootfaced its all right i had to bodily remove some drunk from her room the night of your party because taggie wanted to go to bed alone as rupert joined declan beside the window dogs sprawled all over the floor sleepily thumped their tails dyou know what ive always wanted to do said rupert idly buy that wood below your house pretty useless piece of land said declan fifty yards to the right of the stream you could make the most perfect dry ski slope you wouldnt see it from the road itd be hidden by trees on both sides how much dyou reckon its worth about thirtyfive grand lied rupert seems a helluva lot said declan stroking jack russells with both hands you could still walk through the rest of the wood if you wanted to said rupert but declan wasnt listening thirtyfive grand would get me off the hook for the moment with the tax man he thought and pay the electricity bill and caitlins school fees think about it anyway said rupert you also need a day off come out hunting on saturday week ill lend vou a horse when declan finally got back to the priory he left all the car lights on flattened several purple crocuses on the edge of the lawn and drove slap through a flower bed waiting for him on the stairs both looking equally disapproving were taggie and gertrude why said taggie were you so gggratuitously beastly to rupert on the third monday in march cameron cook had the sadistic idea of summoning the entire corinium staff to a power breakfast in studio i at eight oclock in the morning while they blearily consumed croissants and muesli and orange juice scrambled egg was considered to contain too much cholesterol tony gave them a rousing pep talk on how each one of them could personally help retain the franchise this is a very exciting time said tony heartily dorothy dove and four men went to mow have yet again been nominated for bafta awards our new series on the elderly young as you feel starts next week and were delighted to announce that our new presenter is going to be naomi hargreaves who as you know climbed everest last year at the age of sixtyfive our new networked quiz master dog to find the canine brain of britain starts recording on wednesday the new series of four men went to mow starts at the end of april and a performance of michael tippetts midsummer marriage will be recorded in cotchester park in early june james verekers and sarah strattons new afternoon programme starts on monday week tony smiled warmly at sarah and received a black look from cameron and we all wish them the best of luck finally midsummer nights dream tony added with a sigh of relief is virtually in the can we anticipate two days reshooting tomorrow and wednesday leaving studio i free for miss corinium television on thursday to put declan down tony had deliberately not mentioned his programme but now looking round the packed studio he discovered to his fury that declan didnt appear to be present declan in fact was at home having got up at five to wrestle with his yeats biography looking at the pile of scribbled notes and typed pages on his desk he felt like vidal sassoon confronted by the wild woman of the west with fifty years of burrs and tangles in her hair he wished he had vidal sassoons skills he was so tired he hadnt had an original thought for weeks matters had not been helped by grace finally walking out at the weekend because declan had bawled her out for drinking all his whisky maud furious at losing her ally and sparring partner blamed declan for the whole thing and was refusing to talk to him his black gloom was interrupted by ursula ringing up to say she had flu poor thing stay in bed said declan can i bring you anything no but im terribly sorry i forgot to remind you about camerons power breakfast said ursula at corinium tony was winding up his peroration i have no doubt that corinium will retain the franchise but i cannot remind you too strongly that this year we are on show the iba will not only be monitoring our programmes more closely and examining our finances and our staff relations but they will be looking to see how we conduct ourselves both as individuals and as a company any complaints from a local body pressure group or a restaurateur will count as the blackest mark seb burrows twentyfirst birthday party last week for example completely broke up the beaufort room at the cotchester arms if you ever have another twentyfirst birthday seb tonys big smile flashed on youll be fired realizing some sort of joke had been made the staff tittered feebly finally i must warn you that that scourge of violence and particularly sex the reverend fergus penney exprebendary of the church of england will be visiting the station tomorrow so for christs sake behave yourselves and make him feel welcome and remember above all appearance does matter exactly on cue declan walked in deathly pale hair unbrushed stubble blacking his jaw and his jersey inside out im sorry tony he said forgot weve just finished said tony coolly im afraid youve missed the boat but thats nothing unusual where are you going shouted cameron as declan turned towards the exit home snapped declan ive got a lot of lying down to do the next day st march was the first day of spring the head of news sent a crew off to photograph lambs playing in a field james wore a new primrose yellow tracksuit to urge viewers to join his new sponsored slimforspring campaign to raise money for heart research and declan came in to interview guilini the programme for once was being recorded as guilini was flying to new york for a concert straight afterwards the fair daysee butler keen to do her bit for the franchise accepted an invitation to lunch from someone almost as grand as guilini as it was programme day she only sipped perrier and ate one course of chefs salad her very distinguished companion however departed from his usual perrier and put away a large whisky before lunch a whole bottle of claret during and a large brandy afterwards he hardly touched his monkfish but was charmed that daysee should peel his mediterranean prawns for him as she told him admittedly rather monotonously how she got every programme out on time on the drive back from the restaurant which was several miles outside cotchester daysees very distinguished companion mindful that it was the first day of spring pulled into a side road to admire some leaping lambs and leapt on poor daysee by the time he had torn half the buttons off her yellow angora jersey with the picture of donald duck on the front and grabbed goatily at her thighs laddering her stockings daysee was so frightened she dashed out of the car and taking off her high heels ran sobbing across cotchester water meadows across the tarmac of the car park and in through the back door of corinium television here she collided with tony who had lunched not wisely but too well the sight of poor daysee with her blonde hair awry her mascara streaked with tears her stockings muddy and laddered and her yellow jersey half torn off her beautiful body melted even tonys stony heart my dear child what is the matter someones just tried to rape me wailed daysee next minute she was whisked up in the fast lift to tonys office and ensconced on the squashy leather sofa sobbing her heart out while tony poured her a vast brandy there drink this i mustnt sobbed daysee ill never be able to count declans programme out on time nonsense one glass of brandy wont hurt you anyway its only some tinpot conductor getting out his red silk handkerchief smelling of paco rabanne tony dried daysees eyes she was really very very pretty now tell me who it was i cccant come on you can trust me he sat down on the sofa beside her it was such a shock whispered daysee i thought he was just interested in our programmes i wanted to help corinium win the franchise i know you did said tony warmly thats what makes it so reprehensible just give me his name id truly rather not someone connected with work daysee gulped and nodded better and better thought tony mentally rubbing his hands how wonderful if it were declan or even james if we dont get him for rape well clobber him for sexual harassment he said trying not to sound too eager daysee shook her head in bewilderment i was convinced he was just interested in my mind noticing the ten inches of thigh and the glorious depth of cleavage revealed by the torn jersey tony sidled down the darkgreen squashy sofa and said of course he was daysee looked up her huge eyes spilling over once more with tears tony put an arm round her shoulders come on my dear we cant allow animals like him to roam at large he may strike again and succeed next time think of your female colleagues dont worry ill see your names kept out of the papers now tell me who it was gently he stroked her silky hair it was the prebendary murmured daysee what exploded tony the reverend fergus penney from the iba whispered daysee miserably instantly the solicitous smile was wiped off tonys face his arm jumped off her shoulders as though they were red hot i dont want to hear any more about this business he said chillingly if you value your job dont blab about it to anyone and i hope youve learnt your lesson not to wear such short skirts or tight sweaters to the office in future with that he slammed his door in poor daysees face still trying to be a loyal corinium employee daysee tried to keep her trap shut but declan noticing her reddened eyes and lack of bounce during the afternoon and being infinitely more skilled at getting confidences out of people than tony soon had the whole story from her with the help of a few whiskys from his office bottle lord baddingham said the prebendary was so against sex and violence sobbed daysee only on television said declan grimly its fine in real life as he was intending to take thursday off to go to the gold cup with rupert declan went into the office on wednesday to wade through a mountain of post after the row with maud about the telephone and drink bills which shed hidden behind the recipe books in the kitchen corinium with all its ructions seemed the quieter place the tax man had also called the day before to collect twenty thousand pounds and being told declan was out said he would call again next day which was another reason for not hanging around at home he was beginning to think there was no alternative except to sell rupert the wood the only thought that sustained him was that he was due for a twomonth break at the end of april but as things were going hed have to spend the time off doing programmes in america to raise some cash he was also aware that his programmes had been very lacklustre recently the one on rupert had attracted huge ratings and newspaper coverage but declan in retrospect was bitterly ashamed of it knowing that initially hed let personal animosity overwhelm his detachment since then the programmes had had the bite of a rubber duck god he was tired he looked at the mountain of post a lot of it probably bills ursula was still away he could smell todays special boeuf bourguignon flavoured from a packet no doubt drifting down from the canteen as could the contestants of master dog who were barking hungrily in studio he picked up the first memo the gay and lesbian subcommittee of the actt has been renamed the sexuality subcommittee on cue charles fairburn drifted in having just collected his expenses come and have a drink at the bar sinister declan shook his head got to deal with all this never grumble about fan mail chided charles think of poor me going off to southampton first thing tomorrow to supervise holy communion for the deaf have you been asked to tonys bash for badminton hes put the little red ram logo on the corner of all the invites so he can offload the whole thing on expenses he wont ask me said declan grimly no you are a bit out of favour poor dear said charles sympathetically and you work harder than any of us im expecting to get the old queens award for lack of industry any minute thats better at least youre smiling and ill tell you something else to cheer you up even more in studio youll find a lot of lovable mongrels rummaging for choc drops which have all melted under the lights on caring jamess pastel sofa james is going to be livid when he gets back from another threehour lunch with mrs stratton the telephone rang corinium waifs and strays said charles picking it up oh hi madden dear all right ill send him along tonys leaving for london in twenty minutes thank god he told declan but he wants a word with you first id take the slow lift hes in a vile mood tony in fact seemed in an excellent mood purring away like a great cat about to enjoy an extended game of mousetaunting ah declan shut the door behind you and sit down as usual the central heating was turned up so high declan felt he was having a hot flush i wonder if youd explain this tony threw declan a picture postcard of a huge crocodile with gaping jaws on the other side was scrawled in huge black writing heres a picture of your boss bloody hot here if i dont talk to you before ill pick you up at the priory at eleven oclock rupert there was no address or stamp who the fock opened this asked declan we open all mail during franchise year said tony smoothly just to check whether any of our staff are being propositioned by other franchise contenders this place gets more like the kgb every minute declan made no attempt to hide his rage i also see youve taken up elitist sports went on tony happily handing declan the daily express which was folded back at a picture of rupert and declan out hunting burying the hatchet after their recent encounter on declan read the caption tony shook his head youre not keeping very good company declan then why has rupert been asked to judge miss corinium tomorrow thats a slipup of camerons it wont happen again theres also a piece in yesterdays standard quoting you as saying youve given up hope for lent not a very positive attitude be a bit more careful when you talk to the press in future tony got up and wandered towards the drinks cupboard like a drink declan shook his head just as well said tony pouring himself one i gather you were plastered when you interviewed guilini yesterday then as declan opened his mouth to protest he went on i saw your old boss johnny abrahams from the bbc last night he said theyd let you go at just the right time that you were burnt out the bastard said declan furiously hes got a bloody nerve i hoped youd take it like that said tony softly because i am very worried about your ratings only ten million for the week ending nd march cameron was at a network meeting yesterday and theyre now considering what was unthinkable a few months ago shifting your programme from peak time to shallower waters perhaps a tenthirty or even an eleven oclock slot thats insane said declan we only got ten million because the bbc have moved dallas against us well get it back i doubt it said tony brutally quite honestly youve lost your authority declan there was a time when every interview made the front page of every newspaper now even the critics ignore them you didnt make a single national last week i will next week bob geldofs coming on bit old hat all that aid stuff tony tipped back his chair stretched his legs and gazed at declan considerately im so sorry he said i know how depressing it is for stars when they drop down from number one i do hope youre not overdoing things why are your hands shaking he looked complacently down at his own beautifully manicured hands mine dont shake declan stood up thats because you dont have to work with people like you he snarled out of the window he could see a posse of lovable mongrels scampering across the water meadows after an aniseed trail being pursued by a panting camera crew tony also rose to his feet im trying to be sympathetic he said in a voice that froze even declans blood and all i get is abuse he pressed a button miss madden appeared so quickly she must have been listening at the door declans leaving said tony imperiously back in his office trembling from head to foot declan got a bottle of whisky from the cupboard and pouring two inches into a paper cup drained it the first thing that really registered in his post was a typescript and a letter from patrick he had finished his play and sent it to declan to read dearest pa ive been poisonous enough about your stuff in the past now im going to get a taste of my own medication as cameron would say please read it and tell me the truth give my love to cameron if youre still speaking see you next week love patrick patrick declan reflected was a bloody sight better at getting down to things than he was he was about to start reading when there was a knock on the door it was miss madden puce as a beetroot bringing him a cup of coffee and two rounds of roast beef sandwiches you dont eat enough you mean im drinking too much thats terribly sweet of you darling how much do i owe you its a present said miss madden blushing even more deeply as lord bs gone to town and ursulas sick i thought you might like some help with your mail i can polish off that lot in no time i expect its mostly from fans i doubt it dont take lord bs remarks too much to heart hes only trying to goad you please dont walk out we need you here declan was touched and dutifully sat down and went through his post when miss madden had taken it away he felt unable to settle down to bob geldofs cuttings wandering down the corridor he found james and sarah recording their first afternoon programme in front of a small geriatric audience james was interviewing a large woman in a pinstriped suit and a monocle who looked not unlike thomas the tank engine insufficiently briefed having spent far too long lunching with sarah he was frantically leafing through his notes to find out something about her at last he turned up deirdres list of questions christ she was a fucking composer james was tonedeaf a very good afternoon and welcome to dame edith spink he said the audience clapped lethargically may i call you edith you may but my names actually enid said the lady composer flustered james consulted his notes hed kill deirdre after the programme id like to say enid how much i personally have enjoyed all your symphonies ive only written one snapped dame enid from the darkness by the door declan was beginning to enjoy himself dame enid spink was an extremely distinguished musician who lived on the borders of wiltshire and gloucestershire and was probably only second to michael tippett as a composer in britain a notorious lesbian and a feminist she was already furious that corinium were doing michael tippetts opera this year rather than one of hers youve just visited the states enid ploughed on james to conduct your newest opera er what do the americans think of your work bloody stupid question said dame enid i didnt ask them all there are about twohundred million you know bitch thought james furiously ill fix her many critics he read from deirdres notes say this latest opera of yours isnt up to standard crash came dame enids hands down on her wideapart pinstriped thighs name four she thundered pardon stammered james name four of those critics persisted dame enid james couldnt dame enid stalked off the set james mopped his brow thanking christ the programme wasnt live he was lucky that it was not until ten minutes later that cameron put in an appearance and therefore entirely missed the encounter now it was sarahs turn her task was to interview some female rugger players and a group of lady buyers in suits with pussycat bows on whether it was still a mans world followed by a studio discussion in which james would whizz round the audience with a roving mike although there was already an extremely competent director cameron in her role as programme controller couldnt resist sticking her oar in making an already nervous sarah fluff her introductory patter over and over again now cameron had come down on the studio floor thank you so much for spending march with us she told the tittering audience after the tenth take sarah fluffed her patter again this is really an elaborate way of handing in your notice sarah taunted cameron to more titters sarah looked imploringly at james who sitting on the yellow sofa suddenly seemed very interested in his cuticles sarah fluffed the patter again if you dont pull your finger out cameron told her well be going out live declan had seen enough stop being a fucking bitch he yelled marching up to cameron the crew grinning broadly gave him a round of applause the audience wildly excited to see such a megastar and thinking it was part of the show started to clap and cheer too how dare you lay that number on me screamed cameron over the din im going home put the kettle on the floor manager shouted after her well all be round for tea in half an hour down the steps swarmed the audience crowding round declan clamouring for his autograph youre very like yourself said one lady thank you so much declan said sarah tearfully now you can get on with the programme said declan beating a hasty retreat utterly dispirited after his outburst declan returned to his office and getting out the whisky bottle settled down to read patricks play as he finished it he was equally consumed with pleasure and despair because the play was quite simply marvellous incredibly original funny very moving slightly over the top but possessing all the vigour and fearlessness of youth reading it made declan realize once again what an utter cockup hed made of his own career emptying the bottle very drunk now he wandered into the corridor ending up in the big studio where they were shooting the last retake of midsummer nights dream even the cardboard trees seemed to pulsate with midsummer heat and enchantment declan stood in the shadows tears pouring down his face impossibly moved by the poetry would he ever write anything good again feeling a tap on his shoulder he jumped violently it was cameron rubbing his eyes frantically he followed her out into the corridor im sorry i came on strong this afternoon she said four men went to mow starts again next month i guess im uptight i guess you are said declan ungraciously pick someone your own weight next time sarah could be very good if you dont frighten her off too soon he stalked into his office rather laboriously gathered up the pages of patricks play and chucked the whisky bottle into the wastepaper basket with a clang as tonys opening peoples post i suppose hes frisking wastepaper baskets as well he snarled at cameron that should really convince him im drinking too much i imagine it was you who told him i was drunk on the programme yesterday cameron blushed no way well i wasnt he went on gathering papers together whats that said cameron anxious to change the subject patricks play any good exceptional youll be sorry one day you passed him up im sure you wont be snapped cameron no declans brooding eyes looked at her contemptuously i cant imagine anything that would have filled me with more horror he sent his love by the way cameron tried again look i know its screwing you up working here im surprised you talk in the present tense growled declan going towards the door dont forget youre judging miss corinium television tomorrow we want you and rupert here by seven said cameron about all im fit for said declan wearily and walked out declan was not a vain man but if anything could have boosted his selfconfidence it was that day at cheltenham whenever he put his nose out of freddies tent to have a bet he was mobbed and the combination of him and rupert together among that horseloving strongly irish crowd caused almost as much excitement as the returning winner of the gold cup to add to everyones high spirits freddies horse danced home an effortless winner in the second race nor was it anyones fault that as a result of a freak snowstorm the gold cup was postponed for an hour or that rupert had a monkey each way on the winner consequently rupert and declan got unbelievably drunk and didnt reach cotchester until seven fortyfive is this the forest of hardon said rupert as he tripped over a lot of stackedup cardboard trees outside studio wrong play said declan they were supposed to represent greece cameron tony and james who was compèring the programme in a midnightblue dinner jacket with a dinky rosepink bowtie were all absolutely livid they were so late its a bloody disgrace stormed cameron theres no time to brief you go into my office and youll have a chance to meet the other judges and the fifteen finalists before transmission the other judges were a male pop star called big lil the mayor of cotchester the head of the local tourist board and a naval officer called ron whod just returned from sailing round the world singlehanded after a girlless ten months whispered rupert hell have to be lashed to his chair were now selecting the last seven cameron told the judges you should look for the kind of girl you can take anywhere in the broom cupboard under the mulberry tree said rupert as each girl sidled in tony and cameron fired questions at them miss bisley came from cotchester miss painswick from bisley miss chipping sodbury was so well stacked she could have won a national front award when miss wottonunderedge said her ambition was to run a home for homeless pussies rupert and declan got serious giggles fortunately the room was illlit they all talk like valerie jones said rupert having selected the last seven they all adjourned to studio which was now organized with tables at which sat the socalled invited audience and the contest was on air the fifteen contestants then teetered on in bathing dresses and fourinch heels although the judges had already preselected their last seven as far as the audience the contestants and the viewers were concerned they were picking them now seeing the girls in bathing dresses for the first time however declan and rupert realized some of the ones they hadnt chosen had much better figures and legs and noisily tried to change their minds youre supposed to be picking the first three now hissed cameron and stop making that bloody awful row as declan and rupert rushed out to have a pee in the commercial break rupert grabbed a bottle of champagne from one of the tables shoving it under his coat cameron waiting in the corridor as they came out of the lavatory shoved them into an empty dressingroom big lils going to sing his new single while the last seven change and you two can bloody well stay in here and behave yourselves rupert put on bottoms head which was hanging on a hook and read out a notice on the wall we apologize to all artistes for any inconvenience caused by accommodating them in a temporary dressingroom i am a pees arteeste said declan taking a swig from ruperts bottle totally forgetting they were miked up they starting discussing the contest whys james vereker wearing red shoes asked rupert must be the blood running down from all the people sticking knives in his back said declan what dyou think of miss bisleys bottom said rupert from the furry depths of his asss head terrific said declan what dyou think of miss chipping sodburys tits wonderful but not as good as miss wottonunderedges crotch which one dyou think tony baddinghams fucking said declan the whole lot said rupert collapsing on the bed with laughter declan leant against the wall shaking and daysee butler will get it out to the second next minute a chalkwhite sound man erupted through the door to tell them they were being overheard by everyone in the control room including cameron and tony after that declan found events became slightly hazy miss bisley was crowned miss corinium television and even wept a few tears but not enough to streak her waterproof mascara ill see you in my office in half an hour hissed tony to declan as he ushered the mayor and a lot of visiting vips upstairs i wont be long declan told rupert wait in the car he got his contract out of the filing cabinet in his office and took the lift to the fifth floor he felt curiously elated as he stood in the doorway of the board room he heard miss bisley saying to miss painswick that miss cotchesters trouble was that she had an unphotogenic crotch tony was talking to his vips who included the prebendary and who were all ogling the girls declan went up and tapped tony on the shoulder id like a word now piss off now in your office said declan unless you want me to tell these creeps exactly what i think of you do be careful said miss madden who was sitting at her typewriter in a mauve satin dress sauntering after tony declan blew her a kiss you look beautiful he told her how dare you thundered tony as declan slammed the door behind them because youre rotten said declan so rotten even maggots throw you up tony went purple youve flouted my authority at every opportunity he spluttered slowly declan walked towards him huge cavernouseyed and menacing violence isnt the answer he said softly but its a bloody good start tony backed up against the wall licking his lips eyes darting hand edging towards the intercom button dont touch me he croaked ill get you for gbh the h would be so fucking g said declan that youd never open your big mouth again you bastard as he raised his hand tony cringed away until his head crashed against the framed photograph of himself and the queen then he realized that declan was holding a foldedup piece of paper this is my contract said declan grimly slowly and with great relish he tore it into tiny pieces and sprinkled it over tonys head then he turned towards the door for a second tony was struck dumb but as declans hand touched the door handle he said can i take it youve resigned indeed you can said declan ive prostituted myself for he counted up on his fingers seven months too long and tonight im going to have the first nights sleep since i started working for you has it occurred to you that youre breaking your contract i dont give a fuck said declan opening the door im not staying here till you break me like you broke cyril and simon and half the poor mentally crippled sods in this building the moment hed gone tony pressed the rewind button on the tape recorder and poured himself a huge glass of brandy miss madden he shouted extracting the tape from the cassette can you transcribe this at once make a dozen copies then sweep up these bits of paper and put them in an envelope marked declan oharas contract what the fuck are you crying for he was a nice man sobbed miss madden he always asked me about my life as though it mattered to him outside in the car park the wind had dropped and the moon was shining dimly through the clouds like a tenwatt bulb rupert still wearing bottoms head had finished the bottle of champagne sorry to keep you said declan getting into the car how did it go im out christ rupert pulled off the asss head i thought you had a watertight contract unfortunately it wasnt whiskytight said declan lets go and get seriously drunk taggie slept fitfully worried about her father disturbed by a restless gertrude who imagined every creak and rattle of creeper blown against the turret windows was declan returning waking at five taggie glanced out across the valley as she always seemed to be doing these days and saw that ruperts lights were on she tried not to envy her father spending a whole day with him hed had such a ghastly time at work lately he deserved a break going downstairs to check if the car was back she froze with horror to see it once more parked across a flowerbed with all the lights on rushing outside she found it empty and stealthily started to search the house declan was not in the bedroom her mother sprawled diagonally across the bed as though denying him access nor in the spare room he wasnt in patricks room or the kitchen or either of the drawingrooms or the diningroom she was beginning to panic that hed gone for a walk in the wood and fallen down the ravine when she heard an excited squeak from the library gertrude had found him still dressed passed out cold over his desk in his hand he still held the pen with which he had been writing his yeats biography he had knocked over a glass of whisky which had spilt over the open page of the notebook blurring the drunken scrawl taggie wrapped a couple of blankets round him and put a cushion under his head but he didnt stir he woke six hours later with a debilitating hangover and an even worse sense of foreboding staggering groaning into the kitchen he found maud reading anthony powell upsidedown and looking bootfaced without being asked taggie tore four alkaseltzers from their blue and silver metal wrapping and dropped them into a glass declan took a gulp retched and fled from the room well said maud when he came back even more white and shaking what kept you i dont remember growled declan the telephone rang and he clutched his head groaning it was the scorpion the most seamy of the tabloids could they speak to declan hes not here said taggie quickly i gather hes resigned from corinium dyou know where i can get hold of him taggie went pale are you sure quite the press office confirmed it no hes definitely not here taggie slammed down the telephone declan glared at her with bloodshot eyes sensing trouble what am i supposed to have done taggie looked nervously at her mother come on said declan ggiven in your notice kerist did i really you bloody idiot hissed maud ring up tony at once and apologize say you were drunk at that moment ursula arrived looking pale from her flu but very overexcited by events joyce madden had rung her in tears in the middle of the night and told her what had happened i was just telling declan to ring tony and say hes sorry said maud theyre bound to take him back hes such a big star the contempt was undeniable im not sure they will sighed ursula sit down said taggie pulling out a chair ill make you a cup of tea declans got a contract said maud and he was far too plastered to put anything in writing last night ursula turned to declan who was sitting with his head in his hands dont you remember anything i remember a lot of girls in bathing dresses who were rather ugly and rupert dressed up as a horse and i think i remember having a row with tony he muttered you did said ursula you gave him an earful then you tore up your contract and scattered it all over him and resigned oh jesus declan opened a bloodshot eye did i really and tony taped the entire conversation and joyce madden transcribed it at once and no doubt copies are winging their way to the iba and the itca and god knows who else at this moment you stupid idiot whispered maud fear is the parent of cruelty having found declan impossible to live with for the past few months she had considerable sympathy with tony declans career albeit meteoric had always been peppered with rows she was totally unable to appreciate the pressures hed been under she proceeded to be blisteringly unsympathetic well im not going back said declan at the end of her tirade you have no choice the bbc wouldnt touch you with a barge pole youll have to crawl for once oh mummy protested taggie putting heavily sweetened very strong cups of tea in front of declan and ursula declan warmed his shaking hands round the mug which had a picture of a girl whose bikini disappeared when the mug was filled with boiling liquid like my career thought declan its all your fault went on maud taking days off to go hunting going on the bat with rupert before a programme youre like a couple of schoolboys all the animosity she harboured after rupert had rejected her and embraced declan seemed to pour forth like scalding lava i rang up personnel and resigned too said ursula importantly im not working for a police state any more oh christ thought declan that means ill have to pay her salary myself until she gets another job but he put a hand on her arm thanks darling that was very loyal of you everyone jumped as the telephone rang maud picked it up it was the star maud could never resist journalists were a bit hazy this end she said declan hasnt told us anything what happened the reporter enchanted by mauds soft caressing tones told her i see said maud grimly wheres rupert well he arrived in london ten minutes late to chair a seminar on alcoholism in the exathlete looked like a prime target but he refused to comment thanks said maud well ring you back when he comes in how could you she rounded on declan slagging off tony when you were miked up i thought you were supposed to be a professional declan hardly heard her well have to sell the house he said bleakly the telephone rang again declan got up and seized the receiver will you fucking go away he screamed charming said a shrill voice this is caitlin your daughter if you hadnt forgotten and why hasnt someone come to pick me up oh god said taggie in anguish catching the gist i thought she broke up this afternoon well youd better go and get her snapped maud who had forgotten to pass on the message im going out said declan whatever for screamed maud to do some thinking well youd better come up with something pretty quickly i have no intention of selling this house with four anadin extra four alkaseltzers a cup of strong tea and the remains of last nights whisky churning uneasily inside him declan set out a mild and sunny day with a gentle breeze had followed yesterdays torrential rain freak snow storms and razorsharp winds everything sparkled for the first time in months the birds ignored declans birdtable and were busy singing and courting in the trees down the frogsmore in one day spring seemed to have arrived primroses nestled on the bank coltsfoot exploded sulphur yellow beneath his feet celandines arched back their shiny yellow petals in the sunshine even the most uncompromising spiked red blackberry cable was putting out tiny palegreen leaves in the fields above he could see ruperts horses pounding round in their new zealand rugs tails held high like children let out of school in the woods he found the first anemones and blue and white violets far above him the woodpecker was rattling away at a tree trunk he could almost hear the buds bursting open why the hell had he blown it all in his fucking intellectual arrogance all hed had to do was to endure working at corinium until the end of april then in the break look around for another job now that hed left in a blaze of drunken publicity with plummeting ratings no one would want him he crushed a wild garlic leaf between his fingers the smell reminded him of lunches in soho and endlessly plotting with his cronies to make a better world at the bbc hed loved london but he didnt want to go back it was so hot that on the way home he took off his coat and sat down on the bank of the stream for a long time watching the water as it glittered and squirmed with pleasure beneath the sunshine gertrude splashed about and picking up a stick bounced up to declan hoping hed pull the other end then when he wouldnt dropped it and licked his face an old man walking his ancient jack russell back from penscombe stopped for a chat his grandfather used to be the gamekeeper at the priory he said a hundred years ago when the land stretched for three hundred acres across the north side of the penscombe chalford road hed kept the place like a new pin it was sad to see the state it had fallen into the rotting trees and collapsing walls everywhere declan felt ashamed you can tell springs come at last said the old man because all the blackbirds are singing but not for me any more thought declan in despair then the old man peered closer didnt you used to be declan ohara he said by late afternoon taggie was shattered ursula having parried the press all day had gone home after another terrible row with maud declan had barricaded himself into the library refusing to talk to anyone caitlin sat on the kitchen table with her arm round gertrude both watching taggie stuffing a chicken with a mixture of apricots sausage meat breadcrumbs and garlic used to the central heating and constant chatter of upland house caitlin was shivering like a whippet and gabbling away nonstop there are going to be no more balls against boys schools she announced last friday we danced against rugborough and one lot of boys took some fifth formers up on the garage roof and they were all smoking and drinking and telling the teachers to fuck off and miss lovettstanding think of being saddled with a name like that the gym mistress found three condoms in the rhododendrons next morning i came top in the exam on the mayor of casterbridge went on caitlin then seeing taggie struggling to understand a recipe for potatoes lyonnaise her lips moving slowly as she read she added kindly but a sixth former who did the same paper last year told me all the answers beforehand and two girls in the upper sixth are having abortions this holidays thats nice said taggie absentmindedly taggie youre not listening im sorry im so worried about daddy hell be ok someone will snap him up i dont know hes lost all his confidence ive never known him so down thats hangover said caitlin her ability to spread mess everywhere was even greater than mauds her open trunk lay in the hall and lacrosse sticks tapes posters rolledup art work wet towels coloured files a teddy bear and a squashy bag overflowing with underwear were scattered in a trail all the way to the kitchen she was wearing a very expensive pink tshirt pinched from maud at halfterm over which all her friends had written messages in biro a puffball skirt laddered tights and black clumpy stompers and was now eating muesli out of a cup with a teaspoon christ this house is cold the telephone rang again for the hundredth time the line was awful can i speak to declan said a male voice he cant talk to anyone said taggie hysterically is that taggie yes its rupert hows your father not great taggie felt herself going very red and turned her back on caitlin he walked out you know it was partly my fault he was in an exocet mood i should have stopped him storming in to see tony but hes better out of it it was killing him are you all right sweetheart the sudden gentleness in his voice made her want to burst into tears im fine she mumbled well tell him ill be over later upstairs declan turned on the five fortyfive news and found tony baddingham with a red carnation in his buttonhole giving a press conference the truth of the matter he was saying is that declan ohara tendered his resignation last night and we accepted it stupid word tendered thought declan there was nothing tender about it at all naturally were very sad to lose declan said tony looking absolutely delighted but quite frankly there have been a series of disagreements and theres a general feeling at corinium that when people get too big for their boots wed prefer them to go off and wear out other peoples carpets declan switched off and looked down at the floorboards he hadnt got any carpets to wear out and probably now he never would have the telephone rang again it was one of the corinium shop stewards fuckin idiot he chided declan you shouldve hung in and let him fire you i know said declan almost apologetically i felt i had to retain some shred of integrity wish youd come to us look the lads want to come out youve only got to ask well black out the ole network for you declan and get you reinstated declan was so moved he couldnt say anything for a minute then he said gruffly that there wouldnt be any point i cant work for tony any more but thanks very much all the same and say goodbye and thanks to all the boys for me it was dark outside now but a robin was singing on the bare honeysuckle outside his window it had turned up at exactly sixthirty for the last week now as if to cheer him on art thou the bird whom man loves best he murmured to himself the pious bird with the scarlet breast our little english robin tears filled his eyes oh god what was he going to do taggie knocked on the door and getting no answer walked in she found him looking so haggard and despairing that she ran across the room stumbling over the piles of papers and books all over the floor and put her arms round him please dont be so sad it doesnt matter if we go back to london we were all happy there youve just got to get your confidence back rupert rang by the way hes coming round going upstairs to her bedroom she was horrified by how awful she looked shed been so busy she hadnt had a moment to wash or even clean her teeth all day she knew she had no chance with rupert that it was appallingly presumptuous but for once she wanted to look her best when she saw him caitlins welcomehome supper could wait she decided she was going to have a bath and wash her hair caitlin wolfwhistled when taggie came into the kitchen an hour later she was wearing a redandblackstriped polonecked jersey which patrick had given her for christmas tucked into black jeans which were in turn tucked into black boots as her hair was still damp shed tied it back with a black ribbon she wore no makeup except smudged black eyeliner which made her silvergrey eyes look huge and almost luminous a hot bath and the hairdryer had given her pale cheeks quite enough colour because you so seldom bother said caitlin critically one forgets how beautiful you are much more so than anyone else i know oh dont be silly muttered taggie in embarrassment putting the chicken into the topright oven of the aga how soon will it be ready about nine good i can watch dynasty who are you going out with no one taggie busied herself with draining the parsnips you like parsnip purée dont you adore it you havent answered my question no one then why are you done up like gertrudes dinner i just felt awful muttered taggie apologetically as she threw the parsnips into the blender i didnt have time to wash all day hum said caitlin beadily as she watched taggie add curry powder then butter then cream to the parsnips as i just got up into yesterdays clothes i felt i must change went on taggie even more embarrassed fee fi fo fumble said caitlin i smell the blood of rupert campbell oh shut up said taggie turning on the blender caitlin waited until she had turned it off i am campbellblack but comely said caitlin giggling rise up my love my fair one and come away for lo the winter is past the rain is over and gone the flowers appear on the earth the time of the singing of birds is come and the turtlenecked sweater is worn in our land oh shut up screamed taggie picking up gertrudes rubber ring she hurled it at caitlin missed and nearly hit rupert who finding the door open had let himself in followed by freddie jones taggie stood rooted to the spot with horror gertrude went into a frenzy of outraged barking that someone had entered the house without her knowing hello gertrude said rupert how extraordinarily good you look today nice dog gertrude well done hurrah what a beautiful curly tail youve got bending down he stroked the bemused gertrude over and over again taggie giggled thats better said rupert he looked a bit pale after yesterdays excesses but seemed in excellent spirits hullo he said to caitlin how are you fine caitlin beamed i was just quoting the bible to my sister to keep her on the straight and narrow caitlin pleaded taggie in despair frantically concentrating on spooning the purée out of the blender to hide her blushes rupert went over to taggie and putting a hand on the back of her neck drew her towards him with most women he would have dropped a kiss on the tops of their heads but taggie was so tall he was able to rest his lips for a second against her temple there angel you mustnt worry about your papa frederico the whizz kid and i will sort him out ill get you a drink stammered taggie what would you like daddys in the library id like a bacardi and coke love said freddie and if rupe ere can keep it down hed like a whisky and soda if there isnt any malibu ill have a vod and ton tag added caitlin fleeing into the larder taggie paused before she got down the bottles unbelievingly she touched her left temple where rupert had kissed it then moving her fingers to her lips kissed them in ecstasy what was happening to her she wondered if caitlins welcomehome chicken would stretch to six ullo declan said freddie as they went into the library and found him slumped at his desk ive just seen that fucker tony on the news youre well shot of the smarmy bastard sitting down on the window seat rupert waited until taggie had brought in the drinks then he shut the door behind her and said look frederico and i have been talking about you for some time to put it bluntly both being hardnosed businessmen we hate to see a hot property like you being wasted weve decided to form our own independent production company said freddie an employ you to make programmes for the network channel and the overseas market it took a lot of tough talking to persuade declan they werent just being kind he looked at his untouched glass for a second then a real gleam of excitement came into his eyes ive got a better idea why dont we pitch for the corinium franchise and boot out tony freddie and rupert looked at each other arent we too late not at all said declan if we step on it the applications dont have to be in until the beginning of may we know all the right people said rupert so there wont be any problems getting our board together and we wont have any trouble getting the backing said freddie jumping up and down with excitement an i can provide you wiv all the technical knowhow and i know the corinium programmes backwards said declan so we can submit better programme plans standing on our heads taggie popped her head round the door anyone want more drinks too excited to be deflected declan shook his head so did freddie whod hardly touched his glass only rupert handed out his please angel he said with a grin and could i have soda this time oh goodness did i give you coke im really sorry and poor mr jones must have had bacardi and soda i dont think hes noticed said rupert as freddie and declan got more and more excited over their plans rupert thought about taggie how shed trembled when he kissed her and how adorable shed looked with her long legs in those black boots and her hair tied back like a boy soldier but he mustnt think about her he told himself grimly she was declans kid daughter totally out of bounds wrenching his mind back he heard declan saying in fact tonys only trump card with the iba is cameron cook and the staff are in a state of uproar about her as it is how would it be if i seduced her on to our side said rupert idly we dont want her declan exploded shes a treacherous evil bitch not once ive sorted her out said rupert i was always good with difficult horses i guarantee to have her eating out of my hand in a few weeks overwhelmed by the days vicissitudes declan went to bed and didnt emerge for thirtysix hours waking on saturday morning to thank god he wouldnt ever have to work for tony again before falling back to sleep on sunday he woke to a glorious day and apologized to his darling maud for being such a bear she apologized for being such a bitch and after he had explained about bidding for the franchise and selling the wood to rupert to raise some cash they vowed that things would be better between them and made passionate ecstatic love replete tranquillized maud wondered why she had ever wanted to look at anyone else taggie as she cooked lunch later listened to her mother singing and playing schubert lieder she found these staggering voltefaces bewildering but felt only relief that the row was over rupert having spent saturday hunting and on constituency business rose early on sunday and tried out each of a new intake of horses that had arrived from ireland earlier in the week one dark bay mare was really exceptional incredibly quick off the mark with a huge wild jump in a couple of years he could have made a worldclass horse out of her he felt as always that reluctance to sell her on that temptation to have one more crack at showjumping then put the thought sternly behind him an election was in the offing this summer and there was the franchise to be won he was seeing declan and freddie that afternoon to work out a plan of campaign they had arranged to meet at freddies house because they wanted to keep their bid secret until the applications went in and because the press were still hanging around penscombe court and the priory hoping to get some juicy story about declans exit from corinium handing the mare back to one of the grooms rupert mounted his old olympic gold medal horse rocky for a ride round the estate as he always did if he was at home on a sunday the pack of dogs raced ahead putting up pheasants chasing rabbits snuffling down badger sets and foxes earths rocky loved these outings and to prove they were both still great rupert put the old horse over the occasional wall and any streams or fallen logs in their path ruperts eagle eye missed nothing a loose wire here a tree blown across a fence there which would have to be repaired before sheep were moved in how poor or good the grass was in each field and how the winter barley was spreading in an emeraldgreen haze over the rich brown earth in the distance he could hear penscombe church bells ringing and the rattle of a clay shoot across the valley the priory was in shadow with the sun behind it the beech trees in front were a crimson blur as the buds thickened soon the leaves would be out and he wouldnt be able to see the house any more taking the muddy track that wound high above the frogsmore he noticed the first primroses blooming happily and safely under wild rose and bramble bushes the spiky branches keeping the predatory grazing horses and cattle away in their sweet pale trusting innocence the primroses reminded him of taggie who he felt could only blossom in life if she were fiercely protected he suddenly wished he could be those spiky powerful branches keeping away anyone who threatened her he imagined putting her on his gentlest horse showing her all over his land pointing out his favourite places then making love to her among the wild flowers as he had done to so many other women before but with taggie it would be different christ he must get a grip on himself and get stuck into someone else very quickly thank goodness nathalie perrault was arriving this evening for a few days and there was still the conquest of cameron cook to be orchestrated back at penscombe stripped for a bath rupert got on to the scales and winced twelve and a half stone at six feet two no one could call him fat but it was a far cry from the honed muscular leanness the eleven stone produced by eight hours in the saddle which hed trained down to before the olympic games and the world championship too many dinners too much booze not enough exercise he was hopelessly unfit if he was going to seduce cameron hed have to knock off a stone first that meant no alcohol and just meat fish and vegetables for the next month when he rolled up at freddies house declan looking ten years younger had already arrived and he and freddie were poring over a book called how to win the franchise the first thing we gotta do is appoint a chairman said freddie better be you said rupert ok said freddie but well need someone respectable like a lord or a bishop or somefing as deputy chairman we must also remember said declan that the iba despite all their pronouncements about quality are looking for applicants who wont go broke in the first eighteen months and wholl be able to produce programmes thatll keep the company in the black over the next eight years thats why we need a very experienced md and a very strong programme controller youd better be md then said rupert but im terrible with money you know about television ill be financial director and ill get hold of a shithot accountant to keep an eye on you sandwiched between him and me and freddie you cant go far wrong ive got just the man for programme controller said declan harold white exitn and bbc currently director of programmes at london weekend hes bloody good ive been doing some sums said freddie well need at least fifteen million to keep the station going for the first two years but before that well need at least two hundred grand up front as burn money to pay for brokers bankers running costs and to launch the publicity campaign which well forfeit if the bid fails said declan right said freddie why dont we put that up ourselves give us some control rupert was about to agree then catching sign of declans twitching face said lets argue about that later now which do we find first board or backing backings easy said freddie lets get the right people first apart from the directors who are actually going to run the station we need some local millionaires and a liberal sprinkling of the great and the good as nonexecutive directors before we approach anyone wed better come up with a name said rupert ive been thinking what about venturer said declan sounds all right said freddie whats it say it means in the dictionary someone whos daring and willing to take risks someone whos prepared to brave dangers or embark on a possibly hazardous journey in declans deep husky voice it sounded wonderfully romantic perfick what we going to use as a logo ive been thinking about that too said declan you know that bronze i admired in your sittingroom rupert he turned back to freddie its of a boy in an opennecked shirt and knickerbockers with bare legs hes shading his forehead with his hand as he gazes into the distance its ravishing and its got the right mix of strength and grace and vision ive seen it its grite said freddie in excitement well get someone to draw it then we can put it on all our stationery and on the front of the application wed better get tshirts and ties and car stickers printed said rupert and posters too just imagine a poster of taggie in a victory for venturer tshirt what about a studio said declan well if tony baddinghams prepared to sell the corinium building it would be much cheaper to take over that said rupert but in case he turns really nasty wed better make contingency plans valerie jones was absolutely livid she never admitted reading the scorpion but the weekend fish had arrived in saturdays edition and valerie couldnt miss the huge headline announcing that declan had resigned from corinium while getting disgustingly drunk with rupert and now they were both closeted together in fredfreds den and the air was thick with cigar smoke and she was sure they were up to no good shed grumbled so much in the past about freddie blasting her out with his music that hed had the room thoroughly soundproofed now she couldnt hear a word that was going on inside even when she went outside and pretended to pull nonexistent weeds out of the flowerbed under the window how could they keep the windows closed on such a lovely day shall i take them in afternoon tea said poor fat sharon who still cherished a longrange crush on rupert no snapped valerie you havent done your religious study yet miss fidduck said at least an hour a day nor have you groomed merrylegs what is the point of your father buying you an event horse as sharon waddled upstairs valerie could bear it no longer afternoon tea she announced ten minutes later barging into freddies den with a tray declan was striding up and down the room scattering cigarette ash freddie was whizzing round excitedly in his revolving chair rupert lounged on the sofa playing with one of freddies executive games which involved clashing huge ballbearings against each other all three of them looked up with illconcealed irritation what a fug said valerie dumping down the tray and throwing open the window so all freddies papers blew around i dont know how you can stay inside i hope you wont be long fredfred were due at sir arthurs for cocktails at sixthirty and you promised to walk round the grounds with me beforehand she turned to rupert and declan were opening green lawns to the public in july all proceeds to the nspcc im surprised youre not opening penscombe court this year rupert she added raising her voice to cover the increasing clash of ballbearings you can hardly expect the public to look at a lot of weeds said rupert but youve got buckets of time to get it shipshape it seems so selfish not to raise the money if you can valerie gave her little laugh im sure the nspcc would prefer a cheque said rupert evenly i dont expect maudll be interested in opening your garden went on valerie turning to declan ive just read all about your exploits in the sunday express tony baddingham is quoted as saying one of the reasons you left corinium was because you couldnt face being knocked out by dallas as freddie gently shooed her out rupert and declan both reflected that not throttling valerie before december would be infinitely harder than winning the franchise the next five weeks were frantic many of the bidders for franchises in other territories had spent several years perfecting their applications raising the cash and getting their boards together to speed up the operation freddie declan and rupert divided the role of recruiting officer between them theres no point enlisting people who wont contribute anything said declan we mustnt confuse celebrity with attainment and they must live in the area once we land a really big fish the rest will follow hubert brenton bishop of cotchester whom luckily declan hadnt bitched up during his new years eve interview and who was currently furious with tony for deciding to televise easter communion at gloucester cathedral rather then cotchester was the first to be signed up declan invited him to lunch at the priory the following week and as it was lent and a friday taggie cooked the most succulent coquille st jacques followed by sole veronique maud with a cross round her neck and her titian hair drawn back in a bun gravely asked the bishop to say grace and pointed out the beautiful spring flowers in the centre of the table which her children had sent her for mothering sunday rupert who as part of his gettingfitforcameroncook campaign was off the booze provided the most exquisite white wine caitlin who unlike poor sharon jones had passed her religious studies olevel was able to converse with the bishop at length about st luke and particularly the prodigal son there was a dicey moment when she dropped her bread butterside down and said shit but by then the bishop was fortunately talking to maud about his recent trip to the holy land fortunately too hed been wandering round the sea of galilee last weekend and missed the newspaper reports of declans exit from corinium over the lemon sorbet declan and the bishop discussed how thrilling it would be to dramatize lytton stracheys brilliant essay about cardinal newman and cardinal manning who had both lived in oxford which was after all within the franchise area after lunch maud taggie and caitlin discreetly withdrew and declan produced ruperts venerable port not drinking asked the bishop as rupert passed the decanter on no my lord said rupert gravely ive given it up for lent the bishop who was very hot on sex and violence had always thoroughly disapproved of rupert but perhaps at long last after such a turbulent past he was trying to shed his jetset playboy image and forge a more satisfying way of life declan and freddie steered the conversation round to corinium television and the appalling poverty of their religious programmes and then raised the subject of their rival bid they very much hoped the bishop would join venturer and become their deputy chairman television today said the bishop warmly is a key factor for the quality of life and for establishing values for the past ten years he went on he had had special responsibilities for communication in the diocese and he saw joining venturer as a way of extending a work that interested him greatly we know busy people dont do fings for nuffink said freddie cosily if we win the franchise therell be a very small directors fee say ten thousand a year which could always go to your favourite charity signing up henry hampshire the lordlieutenant was even easier freddie and rupert wooed him over a very expensive lunch in london henry as it turned out was absolutely furious with tony for flogging a field ten miles from the falconry but only a quarter of a mile from and in full view of henrys house to some property developers he was also a very old friend of ruperts having a wife too plain for even rupert to have had a crack at and had liked freddie when theyd met shooting at tonys any money in it he asked having flogged two stone lions last week to pay a tax bill fucking fortune said rupert wed need a bit up front dont mind that said henry as long as you arrange for me to meet joanna lumley suppose i could always sell a stubbs you neednt go that far said rupert shocked we only want about ten grand what about that minor preraphaelite the one over the chimneypiece in the sittingroom good idea said henry never liked it silly girl lying in the water covered in flowers someone should have taught her the backstroke at the end of lunch henry tried to pay no no said freddie honest its on venturer oh well if you can get it on corsts said henry strong on his homework declan investigated the likes and dislikes of lady gosling chairman of the iba he also discovered that her best friend dame enid spink was the composer interviewed so disastrously by james vereker declan called on dame enid in her rooms at cotchester university where she was director of music and found her ferociously conducting to a gramophone record of her latest opera the persuaders worst programme ive ever been on boomed dame enid as she and declan dipped pieces of stale seed cake into tea the colour of mahogany in fact coriniums whole attitude to music is utterly philistine last time the franchises came up for grabs that treacherous little fart tony baddingham promised to finance a cotchester youth orchestra not a penny have we seen declan said truthfully that venturer wouldnt be prepared to finance anything except television programmes until they broke even but he hoped dame enid would advise them on their music programmes if you get the franchise asked dame enid would you get rid of that little squirt james vereker indeed we would said declan once dame enid agreed it was a piece of cake to recruit professor crispin graystock a rich leftwing english literature don who had dry unmanageable hair like worzel gummidges dipped in soot wild eyes and a wet formless face and who longed to be a television star because he thought it would help sell his slim and unutterably dreary volumes of poetry although he was still smarting over not being included in the new oxford companion to english literature crispin graystock was regarded as a considerable heavyweight in the academic world freddie jones took lord smith the even more leftwing exsecretary of the transport and general workers union out to yet another very expensive lunch where with his mouth crammed simultaneously with lobster and pouilly fuissé lord smith agreed to join venturer and provide a substantial cash investment from union funds doesnt he feel guilty about getting involved with such a capitalist organ as venturer said rupert disapprovingly not at all once i told him the money to be made said freddie he feels television is for the people rupert seeking a shithot money man rang up marti gluckstein arguably the most brilliant accountant just this side of the law howd you like to join our bid for the corinium franchise ive already turned down four other groups said marti in his nasal cockney twang i loathe television youd have to buy a house in the area said rupert he could feel marti shudder all the way down the telephone wires i loathe the country said marti dont have to live here said rupert just buy a place and sell it the moment we clinch the franchise prices are going up so fast in the royal triangle youll double your money by the time you sell it ill find you one the prospect of making such a fast buck clinched it marti glucksteins a crook said declan in outrage when freddie and rupert jubilantly told him the good news dont be antisemitic said rupert primly and he doesnt live in the area hes just bought a cottage in penscombe said rupert blithely he was quickly learning he had to box very carefully round declans integrity bearing in mind the ibas obsession with minority groups particularly ethnic ones declan who knew nothing about cricket recruited wesley emerson a sixfootfive west indian bowler and the hero of cotchester cricket club whom hed met at a sports aid drinks party rupert was as outraged as declan had been about marti gluckstein youre crazy he yelled it was only me and the government stepping in with some very fast talking that stopped wesley getting busted in new zealand this winter he was snorting coke on the pitch and hes the biggest letch since casanova i thought that was your prerogative said declan coldly talk about the kettle calling the pot campbellblack i didnt realize we were talking about minority gropes snarled back rupert it took all of freddies diplomacy to calm them down basil baddingham was the easiest of all to recruit rupert signed him up as they checked on the edge of a beech covert during the last meet of the season dyou really want to infuriate tony asked rupert how much said bas after rupert had explained ten grand cheap at the price youre on said bas having assembled their board of the great and the good venturer now needed some heavyweight production people this had to be handled with great delicacy anyone worth their salt had already been approached by other consortiums two department heads at yorkshire had just been sacked when it was discovered theyd joined a consortium in the midlands most itv companies and the bbc as well had threatened to boot out anyone found having dealings with any new franchise applicants even in another area as declan was only too aware tony was already going through all incoming mail monitoring telephone calls and checking through desk drawers and wastepaper baskets after dark declan therefore proceeded with extreme caution winkling out home telephone numbers and promising total anonymity early in april he rang harold white programme controller at lwt arguably the most brilliant and innovative brain in television harold its declan how extraordinary said harold ive been trying to get your home telephone number all day were bidding for granada you interested in joining our consortium not really but thanks all the same said declan weve just moved here and i couldnt face another move how about joining ours one of the pledges that venturer planned to make to the iba was that if they won the franchise they would take over most of the corinium staff below board level but there were three people declan was anxious to secure for venturer in advance in case they were lured away by another consortium i want charles fairburn he told rupert hed fight with the bishop of cotchester the lazy fat poof said rupert charles knows the area like the back of his handbag said declan and hes very bright hes just bored out of his skull id move him away from religious programming and put him in charge of documentaries declan didnt recognize charles when he rolled up at the priory he was wearing a false nose a ginger moustache a ginger felt hat with a tyrolean feather and dark glasses cant be too careful dear he said whisking into the house james vereker spent three hours at lunchtime getting his hair streaked yet again and tonys absolutely refusing to believe he didnt go to an interview declan was glad he was alone with charles when he asked him to join venturer as head of documentaries because charles promptly burst into tears for an awful moment declan thought hed insulted him im sorry he muttered i had a feeling you were bored with religion i am i am sobbed charles you dont understand the absolute bliss of the thought of getting away from corinium youve no idea how we all miss you it was only then that declan realized despite the quips and the jokey exterior the strain charles must have been under for years tony demoralizes one so much one feels one will never be good enough to work for anyone else again i cant thank you enough declan do you think theres any chance of us getting it declan was touched by the us well a tenant whose record is good he said stands a better chance than a new applicant of unknown potential but tonys record isnt exactly good and were getting together an incredibly strong team now if i tell you who they are will you promise to keep your trap shut because if one word of this gets out before the applications go in tonyll start tarting up coriniums bid and exoceting ours mums the word said charles wiping his eyes mummys always been the word in fact i wish youd met mummy declan now is there anyone else at corinium you want me to sound out declan said he was interested in gorgeous georgie baines the sales director and seb burrows from the newsroom very good choice said charles approvingly both stunningly able sebs in dead trouble he dug up a terrific story about a bent vet in league with one of tonys millionaire farmer friends unfortunately he used hidden mikes and secret cameras without getting clearance and when tony pulled the programme seb handed it over to the bbc if seb wasnt camerons protégé hed be out on his ear by now youre not interested in her are you shes tipped for a bafta this week declan shook his head violently he hoped that rupert had forgotten about cameron rupert rang declan that evening from london we need a really good head of sport how about billy lloydfoxe excellent ive heard nothing but good about billy said declan will you talk to him the following day rupert had a drink with his best friend and old showjumping partner billy who was working for the bbc and very strapped for cash looked tired and pale janey his journalist wife had just had another baby they werent getting much sleep at night he absolutely jumped at ruperts proposition particularly when rupert offered to treble his salary youd have to come back and live in gloucestershire try and stop me you know i hate london might there be something in it for janey course there would said rupert how extraordinary we didnt think of her before the iba are dotty about women she could have her own programme those chat shows she did for yorkshire were terrific tell her not to write anything too outrageous in her column before christmas we wont know whether weve got the franchise until december what happens in the meantime said billy who felt guilty that rupert was buying him large whiskies and only drinking perrier himself id adore to join venturer but until you can pay me a salary and the franchise is safely in the bag i cant really afford to burn my boats with the beeb its all right said rupert georgie baines seb burrows harold white and charles fairburn are all in exactly the same boat all that happens is we attach a strictly confidential memo to our application saying weve signed up a head of sport a sales director a programme controller etc who are all wildly experienced but for security reasons we cant reveal their names until we go up to the iba for the interview in november how very cloak and dagger said billy i must say itll be fun working together again we need some more women said declan janey lloydfoxe is gorgeous and talented but a bit lightweight and dame enids almost a man anyway im going to have a crack at cameron cook im working on it said rupert whod already lost twelve pounds in weight not safe growled declan shed shop us to tony together freddie and rupert raised the money rupert in between his punishing work load as sports minister had several meetings with henriques bros the london merchant bank he found it very difficult not drinking and sticking to his diet over those interminably long lunches but at least it left him with a clear head by the second week in april hed organized a potential sevenmillionpound loan freddies methods were more direct he invited half a dozen rich cronies to lunch in his board room and got taggie up to london to do the cooking with the boeuf en croute he produced a claret of such vintage and venerability that a oneminute silence was preserved as the first glass was drunk christ thats good said the chief executive of oxford motors freddie tipped back his chair his redgold curls on end his merry grey eyes sparkling i can only afford to drink wine like this once a year he said but id like to be able to drink it every day and thats where all you gentlemen come in by the end of lunch having bandied the names of marti gluckstein rupert and declan around the table freddie was well on the way to raising the eight million jubilant he travelled back to gloucestershire by train and seeing a plump lady walking down the platform recognized lizzie vereker and whisked her into a firstclass carriage his mood of euphoria he soon discovered was matched by lizzies thanks to a wonderful new nanny who seemed impervious to jamess advances shed finished and delivered her new novel and the publishers loved it it was an excuse for her to buy him an enormous drink she said but she didnt know if british railways stocked bacardi and coke leave it to me said freddie and came back with two halfbottles of moët hows james he asked as the train whizzed through slough frightfully cross said lizzie people keep ringing him up asking for declans home number because they want him to join their consortiums have you seen declan no lied freddie and wished he didnt have to looking at lizzies round smiling face and capacious cashmere bosom freddie couldnt help thinking how nice it would be if lizzie joined venturer she had just the right emollient quality to keep everyone happy she had three novels under her belt and lived in the area he gave her a lift home although the trees were still leafless the wild garlic and the dog mercury were sweeping like a great emeraldgreen tide over the floor of the woods oh i love spring sighed lizzie the bluebells will be out soon ive only been away two days and its like missing eastenders you suddenly discover natures moved on another instalment without you i know i shouldnt ask said freddie as the red jaguar pulled up outside her house but will you have lunch with me one day i know i shouldnt accept said lizzie but yes please dropping in at the priory on the way home freddie found declan and rupert in the library surrounded by tapes declan was busy writing the section of the application which would tear coriniums programmes to shreds he and rupert were now watching a tape of cotswold roundup sarah was interviewing some old lady who couldnt pay her gas bill and james was sitting on the pink sofa looking caring christ shes pretty said declan shed be dazzling if she were properly produced we do need some more women no no no no said rupert she really is lightweight what would you feel about lizzie vereker said freddie his voice thickening good idea said declan she writes very well and shes so sweet said rupert and it would infuriate james and she lives in the area they all chorused lets recruit her later in the year said declan shes too near to tony and i really dont want him to know what were up to before the applications go in on the second monday in april ursula who was still working for declan although he could ill afford her salary was due to lunch with her old friend joyce madden see if you can find out tonys whereabouts next weekend rupert had asked her on the telephone beforehand ursula who loved conspiracy came back from lunch and half a bottle of sauternes bustling with excitement and rang rupert joyce told me in the strictest confidence that tony and cameron are off on a naughty to madrid this weekend camerons flying out on friday afternoon evidently she wants some peace to polish coriniums application before it goes off to the iba tonys giving a party at the falconry on friday night because its badminton weekend and a nice excuse to ask all his posh friends paid for by corinium then hes flying to madrid on saturday lunchtime theyre staying in the same hotel and on sunday night camerons picking up some award for four men went to mow theyre both flying home on separate planes on monday well done thou good and faithful servant said rupert could you bear at this stage not to mention this to declan later in the day rupert went to a reception to welcome some visiting russian gymnasts during which they gave a demonstration of their skills watching them go into incredibly graceful contortions on parallel bar and rug rupert wondered whether cameron cook was as supple and agile as that in bed how the hell was he to get her on her own to launch his attack then inspiration struck the moment the party was over he beetled out to his government car and rang his friend the handsome duke who lived at badminton could you do me a great favour depends how great said the duke youve got the princess staying next weekend havent you yes could you possibly ask tony and monica baddingham to dinner on saturday night do i have to i dont mind monica but hes such a ghastly snob ill knock half a grand off that irish mare oh all right then im going away this weekend rupert told gerald middleton next morning as they went through the diary i bumped into the secretary of state for scotland last night who reminded me that hearts are playing madrid on saturday and it seemed wrong that no one from our department was going gerald raised his eyebrow theyre the only british team in the semifinal said rupert blandly youre meant to be chairing a meeting opposing the swindongloucester motorway in gloucester on friday night said gerald who didnt approve of dates being broken i know ring them and say im terribly sorry they have my full support but theyll have to get someone else and can you get me a couple of presents for the wives of the british ambassador and the spanish minister for sport i hope youre not overdoing things said gerald reprovingly youve lost an awful lot of weight recently dont forget youve got a second appointment with doctor benson tomorrow gerald was very worried rupert had been edgy for the last month which could at first be put down to his not drinking but this weekend hed been really badtempered and two trips to the doctor in three days seemed ominous particularly when you had screwed around as much as rupert rupert however rolled up at the priory in the highest spirits the following evening to find declan still surrounded by tapes and basil baddingham sitting on the edge of his desk drinking a bloody mary and discussing tactics i was just telling declan that ive found you a possible building in case tony wont let us buy the existing corinium studios said bas cotchester halls coming on to the market in november why are you looking so bloody pleased with yourself rupert waved a piece of paper in front of them i had an aids test this week and im clear christ said bas examining it is there no justice in the world how long did it take you to get the results asked declan fortyeight hours said rupert but i had to bung them id be far too frightened to go said bas i came to tell you said rupert retrieving his piece of paper that im going away for the weekend but weve got our first venturer meeting on sunday protested declan everyones coming even harold white and marti gluckstein christ hes never been to the country in his life said rupert then hurriedly remembering the cottage he was supposed to be buying for marti asked where are you having it at the bar sinister too close to tone said bas freddies earmarked a fantastic little pub in the middle of salisbury plain which no one knows and which has amazing food the landlord just runs it for fun declan was still looking disapproving you ought to be there meetings are essential at this stage to establish some kind of esprit de corps and well all be tossing ideas around you know i never have any said rupert i thought you were chairing the motorway meeting said bas had to cancel it said rupert if i dont spend more time in my constituency other than on venturer business theyre going to drop me burke only visited his constituency once in six years said declan rupert laughed he wasnt such a berk then where are you going asked bas to madrid to watch some soccer balls said bas youre up to something i need a break said rupert man cannot live by bread alone he needs crumpet there is a moment every spring when even the most dedicated workaholic is overwhelmed by restlessness and longs to cast clouts and wander hand in hand with a new love through the burgeoning countryside cameron cook was no exception the weather had suddenly turned so warm as she packed for madrid on friday morning that she was able to wander naked round her bedroom with the smell of newly mown grass drifting in through the wideopen windows the apple trees at the bottom of her backyard were still bare but the long grass round their gnarled grey trunks was filled with bright blue cillas polyanthus and narcissi beyond the fence two mallard had nested in the rushes on the edge of the water meadows and in the distance the willows bowed over the river were fringed with palest green although cameron had read that there was a heatwave in madrid it wouldnt catch her on the hop she had spent several hours a week over the last month on the sun bed baking her body to that dark smooth gold that tony loved she was in great shape too her coach at the gym last night had told her that apart from a few professional athletes her body was the most perfect and finely tuned he had ever handled she admired it every time she passed the long mirror yet only yesterday tony had shattered her confidence once again in order to discuss some change in the running order she had barged into sarah strattons dressingroom yesterday afternoon and found her sharing a bottle of champagne with tony sarahs gold hair was prosaically in rollers and she was sitting in a dovegrey silk petticoat which showed off her cleavage and had got rucked up to show a strip of flesh between the top of her dovegrey silk french knickers and her pale grey stockings she was actually perfectly decently dressed and tony was leaning against the wall six feet away from her but there was something about the way they stopped talking when cameron came in normally cameron would have bawled sarah out for drinking before a programme but she couldnt with tony countenancing it instead she had a row with tony after work tony was quite unrepentant poor darling sarah she was a bit nervous about interviewing the head of the chamber of commerce in case it influenced the franchise after all they are an important pressure group she was asking my advice on her best line of questioning her great strength he went on with a nasty smile is that shes not afraid to show a man shes vulnerable and she is so deliciously feminine and im not i suppose tony shrugged and ruffled her spiky hair no one could call you feminine darling so this morning in a rage cameron who had never worn babydoll nighties or anything underneath her clothes other than the briefest bikini pants rushed out and spent a fortune on matching underwear and nightgowns and negligées in other more subtle ways her selfconfidence had been eroded recently ironically since tony had made her programme controller a role shed coveted for so long shed become less secure because she spent so much time in meetings and was doing less and less of the thing she was really good at making programmes all the prizes she was now winning were for work done last year the new series of four men went to mow starting next week would largely be produced directed and rewritten by other people having clawed her way to the top she realized as many men had realized before her that the view from there wasnt that great in fact it was bloody scary finally she was aware that by flexing her muscles in the office in bed and in the gym she was frightening guys off in the last three years patrick and tony were the only ones whod fallen in love with her and tony was showing every sign of getting bored out on the water meadows and the cathedral close she could see office workers in shirt sleeves and cotton dresses many of them probably from corinium sneaking out to early lunches wandering arm in arm carrying bottles to drink under the willows she glanced at the status symbols littered in ludicrously expensive confusion over her bed the charles jourdan shoes the hermés scarves the filofax the rayban shades the huge rolex watch the backless kingfisherblue jasper conran for sunday nights presentation what was the point of all these spiralist trappings if there was no one to share them with her mood of despair lasted all the way to madrid there however the black limo that met her at the airport and the splendour of her magnificent suite in a hotel paid for by the spanish television authorities gradually cheered her up there were two bedrooms in the suite each with two beds a huge livingroom stuffed with antiques and lit by huge chandeliers and an enormous bathroom with soft and hard loo paper a hair dryer and two beautiful white towelling dressinggowns there was a bottle of champagne in a bucket of ice and a huge basket of fruit with pomegranates persimmons and apples as big as grapefruit pink carnations floated in the finger bowls there were flowers in every room to match the pale pink walls and silver trays of chocolates and this was just her suite tonys suite next door was identical hey diddly dee a plutocrats life for me sang cameron demolishing a tray of chocolates then she started worrying about spots shed better stop there were also telephones everywhere even in the shower tony would be circulating at his drinks party now it brought her up with a nasty jolt that no one else in the world would like to be called by her except patrick and she didnt know where he was she strolled out on to the balcony and saw that there was a little garden restaurant below with a summer house and floodlit lemon trees and a lawn with a fountain the tables were filled with handsome hawklike men with sleek black hair and beautiful women in suits with very padded shoulders who were all talking their heads off and having a wonderful time going back into the livingroom to attack a pomegranate she noticed an etching of the judgement of paris on the wall juno and athene both fully dressed were looking furious as venus who was flashing an ankle and a bare boob was awarded the apple venus looked just like sarah stratton cameron turned the picture to the wall it must be tiredness that suddenly made her feel so unbelievably down again she couldnt be bothered with supper taking two mogadon she crashed out she got up early spent two hours working out camera angles for the first part of four men went to mow then spent the rest of the morning working on coriniums application god it was turgid longer than gone with the wind and infinitely less readable all those brownie points being notched up with promises to employ independent production companies and set up audiovisual workshops or subsidize roving repertory companies and youth orchestras there was also a lot of guff about grassroots involvement and worker participation schemes a few figures had been provided but there was very little talk of profits unable to face tinkering with it any more cameron lunched at the hotel wandered round madrid which seemed to be packed with scottish football supporters then spent two hours restoring her sanity looking at the goyas and el grecos in the prado the telephone was ringing as she let herself into her suite it was joyce madden lord bs terribly sorry cameron could tell madden wasnt hes been trying to get you all afternoon hes sorry but he wont be able to fly out for the awards somethings cropped up the dukes asked him to dine at badminton tonight he says he cant refuse particularly in franchise year hullo hullo but cameron had hung up she was so angry she ate all the chocolates on the silver tray how dare he the bastard standing her up for a bloody dinner party bloody starfucker absolutely on cue there was a knock on the door and in came a valet bringing a huge bunch of roses sorry i cant make it darling said the card good luck tomorrow all love tony cameron was so furious she went out and hurled the roses over the balcony watching them whizz round and round until they landed on a mob of cheering fans bastard fucker asshole screamed cameron at the top of her voice then let out an enormous fart which seemed the only way she could demonstrate her utter contempt for tony hush drawled a voice youll frighten the pigeons cameron swung round and gave a gasp of appalled embarrassment for there laughing his handsome head off on the nextdoor balcony his face as brown as the glass of whisky in his hand lounged rupert what are you doing here muttered cameron watching hearts win a football match never thought id get in here but they had a lastminute cancellation a mr smith he grinned wickedly what an extraordinary coincidence to find you here why are you looking so badtempered i am badtempered the tv doesnt speak english you expecting guests not any more so that bouquet you were bombing the masses with was a peace offering from the oily baron youre so fucking perceptive said cameron sulkily then rage overcame pride madden just called to say he cant make it hes been summoned to dine at badminton probably has said rupert i know theres a dinner party there tonight and the princess is going lets have a drink your place or mine mine said cameron give me half an hour while i take a bath and dress i wouldnt bother said rupert youre overdressed as it is it was all going too fast for her what the hell was rupert doing here it could hardly be coincidence he was the biggest rake in the world no one emerged unscathed so why was she feeling so wildly elated washing her ears when shed washed them that morning and trimming her bush and rubbing fracas into her belly and inner thighs as she slid into her new peach satin underwear it seemed to be caressing her in anticipation for once she didnt need blusher the glow came from within finally she put on a pale apricot tunic very demure and clinging with all the buttons done up but with the hemline six inches above the knee making her legs seem endless all powerful men are attractive men who are powerful and kind are irresistible for once rupert seemed to have abandoned his flip cracks and his sexual innuendoes he appeared to be really really interested in her career in coriniums programme plans and how they were approaching their application for the franchise he was also incredibly well informed shed always thought he was only interested in sport and screwing cameron was enjoying herself so much she didnt notice shed drunk almost an entire bottle of champagne and rupert had hardly touched his glass of whisky as the boat race is usually won in the first two minutes by one crew surging ahead and taking advantage of smoother water so the conquest of cameron was really achieved in that first hour when she was offguard and feeling bruised and vulnerable because tony had stood her up as rupert got up to fill her glass yet again he pointed to the mound of paper on her desk what are you doing working on the final application anyone bidding against you asked rupert idly tonys discovered a group of bristol businessmen calling themselves midwest are having a go they claim were too cotchesterorientated but i dont figure theyre much cop thats three of us pitching thought rupert reflecting that as cameron cook had such wonderful legs spying on her was no hardship at all is tony worried he asked no way but we cant afford to be complacent southern lost their franchises in and they didnt appear to have done anything wrong the iba have to make some changes to be seen to be doing their job properly what about declan tony lost a network slot there hows he going to replace him im not sure declan cost tony so much dough and he really zapped him out tony cant stand not being able to bully people hes much less uptight since declan walked out but he needs a replacement i guess hell poach some top frontofcamera person in the next few weeks just to distract people from declans departure the media are still sniffing round any idea who it might be said rupert no tony loves to surround himself in mystery how are you enjoying being programme controller cameron shrugged not as much as i expected theres so much hassle admin bores me rigid thinking up brilliant ideas which other people promptly screw up i had to sack four people last week you ever done that frequently said rupert christ he thought as cameron rabbited on her mouths like a dumper i could use her to unblock my drains you should get out he said when she finally paused for breath any of the network companies would snap you up cameron looked at the bulky application on the desk id like to see corinium retain the franchise ill probably look around in the autumn although why i hang in with that bastard i cant think is it usual to be asked to dine with royalty at the last moment no said rupert so tony must have known about the dinner party for ages and didnt have the guts to tell me he wouldnt be coming out probably didnt want you to make other arrangements said rupert emptying the bottle into her glass he was shrewd enough to realize that having existed on a diet of tony for three years and having been flaunted at work and on the occasional jolly abroad but ruthlessly excluded from anything else what cameron was missing was a legitimate social life he got to his feet well thanks for the drink im going out to dinner camerons happiness drained away goodbye she said coldly gazing at the plane trees in the square which were turning pink in the setting sun well go on then she snapped a few seconds later stop sulking said rupert youre invited as well to a restaurant no a private house they wont want me yes they will nicky and mary youll adore them im just going to put on a tie next door he extracted a tape recorder the width and size of half a pencil from his top pocket removed the tape and put it in a secret drawer at the back of his brief case thered be too much noise at dinner to isolate anything interesting nicky and mary turned out to be the british ambassador and his beautiful wife whod been a mad success in madrid they lived in a ravishing house a few miles from the centre of the town and the dinner party was just as grand as the one tony and monica were enjoying in england but everyone was so friendly and easygoing and knew all about cameron coming to madrid to accept an award that she instantly felt at home mary who had known rupert at the height of his showjumping career was a good enough friend not to mind his totally upsetting the rigid protocol usually observed in diplomatic circles by bringing an extra guest though it did mean a lastminute arrangement of the placement at dinner cameron sat between the italian ambassador and a spanish duke who both spoke perfect english the gossip about royalty politics and the jet set was sensational but it was generally accepted that nothing would be passed on as cameron ate the most delicious ravioli filled with scallop and lobster she had ever tasted the spanish duke who had slickedback ebony hair and hooded eyes talked to her about the national character as a people we are obsessed with death but indifferent to it as long as the right attitude is struck note the matadors lack of concern for his own life life should be enjoyed now not devoted to working for some distant fulfilment cameron looked at rupert who was seated on the other side of the table laughing with his beautiful hostess reading her thoughts the duke went on rupert in some ways is very spanish very brave very macho very sad underneath sad said cameron amazed rupert the duke nodded you never saw him in the show ring it was magnificent all the grace and courage and apparent effortlessness of the matador it must have been terrible for him to give it up i thought he would drink or womanize himself to death hes made a great success of minister for sport said cameron it would hurt his pride not to make a success of anything but he is still not fulfilled and if the tories lose the election as everyone thinks they will hell be out of a job he needs a great love in his life i ope you are she he raised his glass to her what was his wife like the duke kissed his bunchedup fingers so beautiful but quite wrong nervy and not really interested in him only what she thought he could become you cant change rupert only make him more secure with the cochinillo everyone turned to talk to the person on their left rupert is very lucky said the italian ambassador he has always had beautiful women but seldom so clever i believe you come to rome next month for another prize im having fun thought cameron in amazement tonys virtually kept me in prison for three years for the first time since new years eve with patrick im really having fun rupert took her home just after midnight they sat on opposite sides of the back of the embassy car and he made no attempt to touch her in the darkness she could see his profile spanish too with its thick slickedback hair and forehead which ran down in a dead straight line to his nose the only luxuriance in such a finely planed face were the wicked long blue eyes which she couldnt see in the dark and the fullness of the lower lip i want him she thought helplessly i want to be the woman who brings him fulfilment to their left a lot of drunken scottish football fans were splashing about in a fountain above them soared the statue of christopher columbus can we get out and look at him said cameron after all he did discover america as they got out ruperts hair gleamed in the moonlight rupert screamed one of the scottish fans look its rupert no thank you very much said rupert pulling cameron back into the car furious with herself for wanting him so badly cameron spoke only in monosyllables all the way back to the hotel totally ignoring the two smiling footmen who leapt forward to turn the revolving door for her she shot into the elevator in such a small space you wouldnt have thought it possible to be so far apart but cameron felt her belly button touching her spine falling out of the elevator she set out at a run across the patterned carpet then realizing shed turned the wrong way had to retrace her steps what the hell was the matter with her controller of programmes megaprizewinner woman of substance flapping around like a blackbird trapped in a fruit cage i must be pooped she said in an overbright voice thank you so much she mumbled outside her door and the moment rupert had opened it for her she shot inside rupert made no attempt to retain her good night he said yawning sleep well alone in her mammoth suite cameron nearly went into orbit with frustration in the mirror she could see her eyes glittering feverishly her breath coming in great gasps her nipples sticking through the apricot dress like thimbles she half expected to see a pulse jumping between her legs she was nearly thirty perhaps she was losing her touch and rupert really didnt want to sleep with her she couldnt stand it ripping off the dress and the temptresss satin underwear he hadnt even seen she went into the bathroom and turned on the cold shower letting the icy jet blast away all the fracas and the body lotion and the gel and hopefully the desire she turned it on so hard that it was a few seconds before she realized the telephone was ringing no doubt it was tony establishing his ascendancy so she let it ring just to worry him after two minutes she picked it up i dont see why christopher columbus should have a monopoly said a light clipped drawl i want to discover america too cameron leant against the wall feeling giddy with relief cameron yes who are we fooling i dont want to get hurt or get aids you wont said rupert triumphantly i had a test last week im as clear as one of valerie joness picture windows ive got a certificate to prove it im amazed you havent run off millions of copies on ministry for sports stationery said cameron and circulated them to all interested parties dont be bitchy what about you i had a medical for insurance last month tony must have bonked you since then one could catch something far nastier than aids from him now am i going to have to swing across the balcony like tarzan or are you going to let me in rupert had cleaned his teeth and was still wearing his blue striped shirt and suit trousers without the camouflage of his jacket cameron could see how divinely proportioned he was hunky on the shoulders and lean and streamlined everywhere else the golden meanie she thought as he came towards her she clutched the towel round her looking very young and vulnerable with her hair flat and wet from the shower like a guard dog whos been uncharacteristically caught with its hackles down everyones into prolonged courtship these days she gabbled i dont want you to think im easy i dont very gently rupert took off the huge rolex watch shed forgotten to remove in the shower i just want to see if youve got a designer cunt he stopped her reply by kissing her the towel slid to the floor it was a very good thing he reflected later that hed lost all that weight and been jogging for an hour every morning or hed never have coped with the pace cameron was like an electric eel knew every sexual permutation in the book could twist herself into any position and ordered him around like a sergeantmajor you are incredible he murmured into the back of her head youd make a matchstick feel like a cigar i need a bit more stimulation on my clitoris demanded cameron rupert obliged in england we pronounce it clitteris its clytoris and please be gentle after two hours fairly sustained screwing in both bedrooms on the sofa in the drawingroom under the shower and admiring themselves in every mirror they collapsed onto the carpet and rupert came for the fourth and from his point of view final time i havent come yet said cameron in his ear rupert was astounded what was wrong for christs sake nothing it was the best first fuck ive ever had im too uptight and too pissed i guess well im not jumping ship till you do so you may as well relax and stop fighting wriggling downwards he parted her sodden bush i am after all a member of the clytory party he said in muffled tones waking first cameron reached out and immediately realized she wasnt with tony rupert had the most enormous erection so like a cruise missile that cameron half expected to see lots of greenham women camped round the bed looking disapproving and waving cnd banners getting up she drew back the curtain an inch rupert was certainly the bestlooking man shed ever been to bed with and despite her sniping the best lay once shed let him take over last night everything had been perfect she knew too that in the space of fourteen hours she was a different person shed been dependent on tony for security but never happiness for the first time in her life she was in love and it terrified her the ring of the telephone woke rupert up it was tony all smarm calling from his car so the line wasnt very good this was a good thing as rupert started kissing cameron all over in the middle and so distracted her she couldnt remember anything practical like what time the awards were or when she flew in tomorrow or concentrate on the witty remarks tony had made to the princess its tony she wrote frantically on the telephone message pad so wrote rupert im so sorry gasped cameron i was working very late on the application hows it shaping very well shrieked cameron as rupert grinning broadly lunged cruise into her look ive got to go im off to toledo ill ring you before i leave tomorrow morning youre insupportable she howled at rupert as she slammed down the telephone how was the dinner party cameron grimaced said he only accepted because he felt the duke needed his support and it was always a bit nerveracking entertaining royalty rupert had to bury his face in her neck to stop himself laughing afterwards he wanted to go back to sleep but cameron who felt one shouldnt waste a minute in a foreign country made the mistake of dragging him off to toledo you are now entering the imperial capital read a large sign as they drove through the ancient city gates i can think of things id much rather enter said rupert broodily hardly cyril smith country he went on as the official car rumbled cautiously up incredibly narrow streets where the flowers in the window boxes on either side seemed to bend over to kiss each other beneath a thin blue strip of sky camerons hopes that rupert might like the cathedral were soon dashed he whizzed past the ravishing stainedglass windows the carved pillars and the breathtaking pictures as though he was riding against the clock a velasquez borgia reminded him of tony after gazing at a rubens madonna and child for three seconds he said they both should be dispatched to weightwatchers the el grecos finished him off altogether because they all reminded him of his exwifes husband malise gordon just inside the entrance to the cathedral was a gift shop selling not only religious relics and postcards but also flick knives swords guns thumbscrews and racks was this symbolic of the torture rupert was going to put her through wondered cameron to cheer him up she insisted they stop for margueritas at a nearby bar rupert pronounced them absolutely disgusting neat salt water with added salt water theyll all be at the first venturer lunch on salisbury plain he thought sourly getting drunk and enjoying themselves he wished he were there too as they were leaving toledo cameron suddenly thought wistfully of patrick and how much he would have enjoyed wandering round the city and the cathedral can we just drive up to the top and look back she asked the chauffeur the view took her breath away the whole of toledo sprawled out on the hillside little houses palaces churches bleached and baked over the centuries by the burning sun to the palest terracottas roans corals and ochres with the occasional blackgreen cypress as an exclamation mark on the right flowed the tagus like darkgreen glass going into a flurry of foaming water as it dropped down a level then becoming absolutely still again as though someone had added gelatine christ id like to bring a film crew here said cameron then she looked at ruperts face which was as still and cold as the darkgreen water ive lost him she thought despairingly i should have let him sleep but as they were driving back to madrid his hand along the back of the seat suddenly touched her hair it was as though hed sawn through the ropes and dragged her off the railroad track as the express thundered towards her she melted towards him whats the matter im sorry dont you like culture not a lot its already happened and i hate being trapped the first time helen and i stayed in madrid she went to toledo by herself and raved on and on and on about it i even remember her making malise blush when she told him he was pure el greco she was crazy about sightseeing im afraid the things i disliked in her i dont like any better in other people but you cant expect people always to do what you want i dont but if they want to do something id rather they went off and did it alone and then not gas about it afterwards what were you doing all the time she was sightseeing i was showjumping said rupert when they got back to the room they made love again with less energy but more tenderness can i get down said cameron finally as she straddled him you are able to get down said rupert quoting his old nanny but whether you may is another matter cameron caressed his cheek are you coming with me tonight rupert shook his head not safe therell be too many press despite no sleep cameron looked so seductive in her new kingfisherblue backless that rupert nearly dragged her back to bed again uh uh cameron skipped out of the way ill stagger onto the podium like john wayne as it is i hope i dont fall asleep in the speeches as soon as she walked into the reception she realized that it was a very good thing shed come by herself there was ivor hicks coriniums corporate development controller chatting up a toughlooking spanish woman she also recognized people from granada and tvs and one of robert maxwells henchmen what the hell are you doing here she whispered to ivor tonys after a stake in spanish television said ivor the government heres creating three new channels tony wants twentyfive per cent of one of them maxwell granada and tvs are after the same thing cameron sighed that means less money for programmes but more security for tony in case he loses the franchise said ivor diversification is the name of the game rupert gave cameron half an hour then seeing her going into dinner on television he went systematically through her filofax dictating her future appointments into his tape recorder and a lot of tonys that shed listed then he opened her briefcase and removed the corinium application it was very bulky like smuggling in lady chatterleys lover when he was at prep school at first the pretty girl on the reception desk told rupert the office was closed and there was no way the application could be photostated but spanish guests at the hotel seldom had such blond hair or such blue eyes or such good teeth or waved so many thousands and thousands of pesetas in front of her she would see what she could do she said shed have to secrete the application into the office it might take a little time as the manager was about shed ring ruperts room as soon as it was done sweating he went back upstairs and paced up and down drinking whisky on television the awards were well underway stars were tottering up on to the platform wiping their eyes and thanking every member of the crew and every madre and padre for the help they had given what if cameron had been on already and overcome with lust was belting back to him going downstairs again he met the receptionist very flustered but with the completed copy it was only when he got back to his room that he realized the silly cow had put it back out of order the sections on master dog and dorothy dove didnt follow on and james verekers afternoon programme was in the middle of engineering specifications it was a long and laborious task to get them in the right order and even then rupert wasnt sure hed done it right for the third time he rushed down to get the various chapters stapled together he was just getting back into the lift when he saw cameron coming through the revolving door pressing the button he creaked up to the seventh floor rushed along to her room which hed rashly left open because he didnt have a key and doublelocked it on the inside with trembling hands he shoved the original back in her briefcase hoping it was the right way up snapped the clasp and shoved the copied pages inside his jacket under his arm the next minute there was a tantivy on the door rupert open up said cameron pretending to rub the sleep out of his eyes he opened the door sorry sweetheart i didnt want to be disturbed by maids replacing chocolates and turning down beds how was it scary said cameron ill never never be mean to any frontofcamera people again wasnt it awful when i dried you were sweet lied rupert and they were all so touched you tried to speak spanish fortunately cameron was a bit pissed have you eaten she asked i wasnt hungry said rupert edging towards the door in fact ive got a bloody awful headache ive got some panadol said cameron going to her briefcase ive got something even stronger next door said rupert hastily ill be back in a minute back in his suite he nearly died hed never had nerves like this in the old days when he was show jumping and screwing everyone elses wives with shaking sweating hands he stuffed the photostated application in the secret compartment of his briefcase cameron had kicked off her shoes and was lying on the bed drinking white wine when he got back good thing you didnt come she said there were so many people whod have recognized you i picked up a sunday times thanks rupert turned immediately to the sports page she noticed then the smile was wiped off his face fucking hell he turned to the front page whats the matter riots after both semifinals of the fa cup he howled petrol bombs thrown at the police two policemen stabbed cars overturned and burnt shop windows smashed twenty people taken to hospital fortyfive arrests fucking fucking hell i play hookey for one weekend and this happens in a second he was on to gerald in london ive been trying to get you since yesterday minister there were obviously other people in the room or gerald would never have been so formal is it very serious yes four people are still in intensive care ill fly back tonight im sorry minister after all your hard work its a most tragic setback by one oclock rupert managed to get on to a private jet arranged by the british ambassador he seemed to have forgotten camerons existence until he was leaving im sorry to walk out on you angel im just so pissed off i was so certain id pegged the violence he took her face in his hands look its been great i wont ring you in case i get tony but promise to ring me heres geralds number hell know where to find me and he was gone its a beginning thought cameron hanging over the balcony to see if she could catch a glimpse of him getting into his car it was still warm breathing in the scent of the lemon trees rising from the little garden she had a sudden vision of ruperts beautiful house in gloucestershire and all that wonderful sweep of land and decided the only status symbol she really wanted was a cartier weddingring with r cb and cc engraved inside rupert went back to england slap into a political storm the dramatic drop in football hooliganism had been a high spot of the tory administration now after a sickening day of violence their claims were looking very dubious with an election in the offing the opposition were roaring for blood and in an emergency debate on monday night tabled a motion of no confidence in the minister for sport and howled for ruperts resignation although rupert was certain leftwing militants were behind the riots and hinted as much in the house he couldnt prove it yet and the government won the debate by the narrowest majority some of his own side were not displeased by events rupert had been the pms darling for too long the cup final was not until th may but all ruperts energies were now channelled into seeing the violence wasnt repeated he spent most of the next week trying not to lose his temper with the pack of reporters snarling at his heels as he visited the two devastated football clubs and comforted those whod been hurt in the riots as a result he didnt get down to penscombe until late wednesday afternoon landing the helicopter on the lawn he had only been away a week but already bluebells were flaming like bunsen burners in his woods and the crimson glow of the beeches had turned to a rusty terracotta as green leaves burst out of their narrow brown buds although brilliant sunshine and blue skies welcomed him across the valley he could see an april shower tumbling darkly out of a huge purple cloud on to the priory however angry he was returning to penscombe always soothed him he was greeted by messages from gerald that the two stabbed policemen were now off the danger list and that cameron cook had rung three times leaving a number instead of calling her he had a quick shower and drove over to the priory where the rain had almost stopped leaving a heady smell of wet earth and nettles as he walked through the door he was greeted by an even headier smell of frying garlic and onions taggie must be home which unconsciously soothed him even more hed go and see her when hed reported in in the library he found freddie bas and charles giving a slightly unreceptive declan tips on how to write the application what a focking awful week youre having said declan you poor bastard you must feel like sisyphus i dont know who he is said rupert but im sure i do get him a drink bas said declan only perrier said rupert ive got to fly back and vote after this how did the first venturer meeting go the others looked at each other was the sun shining through the stained glass window or was freddie blushing it was somewhat hazardous said declan did you all fall out asked rupert taking the perrier from bas and trying to find an inch on one of the window seats that wasnt covered with books and tapes to sit on charles and dame enid did said bas with a grin shut up giggled charles you tell him freddie said declan well we all went down to this pub on salisbury plain said freddie sheepishly which i couldve sworn was always deserted and wed just settled into prelunch drinks and managed to stop wesley emerson offering the bishop a joint and got over the fact that charles here turned up dressed as a woman knowing the ibas obsession with the fair sex i thought it fitting interrupted charles demurely when the entire nations press arrived in three coaches to ave a beano before witnessing the launching of a new tank at some army base down the road christ rupert started to laugh did any of them see you billy the kid couldnt have emptied a saloon bar faster said freddie and charles and dame enid got stuck trying to climb out of the ladies it was seriously funny said bas we all hotfooted it back to the priory for a chinese takeaway and the whole thing seemed to bring us closer together i must say id forgotten how stunningly attractive janey lloydfoxe is and belongs to billy said rupert firmly through the window he could see taggie whod gone out into the garden to pick some thyme from the herb garden gazing in rapture at a rainbow she had the most adorable bottom he decided which became even more adorable when she bent over the flower bed in her jeans rupert said bas are you still with us looking at the rainbow said rupert hastily opening his briefcase never knew rainbows were female and five foot ten said bas slyly fuck off said rupert anyway ive got a stunning bit of news to cheer you all up ive brought you an easter present declan triumphantly he chucked the two tapes and the photostat of the corinium application down on declans desk whats this said declan putting on his spectacles two extraordinarily informative conversations with cameron cook and a photostat of the corrected final draft of coriniums application freddie bas and charles were so excited none of them noticed declans look of thunderous disapproval or that hed dropped the application as though it was a waspinfested pear where did you get that asked freddie in awe i spent the weekend in madrid and in bed with cameron basils jaw clanged does my brother know tony was due out there said rupert but i arranged for a chum to offer tony an invite for saturday night he couldnt refuse basil started to laugh to meet hrh at badminton my god was that your doing said charles in amazement tony was boasting about it to everyone so he stood up ms cook said rupert wandering over to the drinks table and splashing more perrier into his glass who was not overly delighted until i suddenly appeared on the adjacent balcony like private lives and took tonys place what was she like asked bas fascinated fucks like a stoat said rupert in fact the endaway definitely justified the means although i had to endure some hellish sightseeing on sunday before she went off to collect her prize that was when i got the application photostated bloody good said freddie you ought to join the cia said bas shell be after your blood your untainted aidsfree blood when she finds out said charles delightedly she wont said rupert she hadnt a clue well he turned to declan for approval but declan was looking infinitely more thunderous than the cloud that had drenched the priory earlier you cant focking do that he exploded why ever not because its bloddy dishonest i must be dreaming said rupert incredulously declan dear were pitching for a business with a hundredandtwentyfivemillionpound turnover not playing fucking tiddlywinks have a read you can find out exactly what tonys up to and preempt it its the most turgid stuff much more effective than mogadon tony seems to be promising an unchecked flow of good causes and elizabethan drama for the next ten years im not going to read it said declan roughly were playing this thing straight now come on declan protested freddie think of the clout itll give us never cast a clout till may is out giggled charles shut up charles snapped declan then turning to rupert who was now absolutely shaking with rage i repeat were playing it straight tony is evil hissed rupert dont you think hed do the same thing to you given the chance i thought you were out to get him not by sinking to his methods said declan coldly then what are you doing asking the bishop to lunch dressing maud up like a nun and asking him to say grace thats different it is not rupert was furiously pacing up and down the floorboards now and what are you doing poaching half tonys staff im amazed you didnt ring tony first and ask his permission thats entirely different yelled declan what youve done is stolen coriniums property its a criminal offence isnt charles coriniums property yelled back rupert ooo said charles looking excited theyre fighting over me shut up screamed rupert and declan both turning on him charles came of his own volition said declan but cameron had no idea what you were up to she certainly enjoyed it snarled rupert dont you go feeling sorry for her and jesus the hassle i went to getting that thing photostated i practically had to bang the receptionist never been a hardship for you said declan icily and picking up the application and the two tapes he chucked them into the wastepaper basket bas freddie and charles winced rupert went very still and if any of you try and retrieve them ill put them in the boiler added declan all my life ive been accused of lacking application drawled rupert then when i actually get hold of one its not a joke roared declan im not laughing said rupert bleakly fuck you declan and screw your bloody franchise now wite a minute said freddie leaping to his feet but rupert had walked out in the hall he nearly sent taggie flying she was carrying a pile of aertex shirts and green skirts upstairs caitlin was going back to school next week what on earths the matter she said in alarm your fucking father whats he done come into the kitchen its what he wont do for a second rupert debated whether to walk out but he was so angry with declan he had to tell someone so he followed her into the kitchen ill get you a drink im not drinking and ill never touch a drop of your fathers liquor again whats happened said taggie bewildered then realizing the steak and kidney she was frying on the aga was catching ran across the kitchen to give it a stir ive just spent all last weekend in madrid screwing cameron cook said rupert furiously to get her on our side and to get information about coriniums application and by sunday night i not only had her eating out of my hand but had secretly photostated the entire application he was so angry he didnt notice that taggies wooden spoon had stopped moving whats daddy objecting to said taggie in a strangely high voice he wont read it he thinks its taking unfair advantage jesus no wonder hes broke at that moment freddie appeared in the doorway but seeing rupert was talking to taggie he decided shed be better at calming him down than any of them and tiptoed back to the library let me make you a cup of tea said taggie by the time the kettle had boiled and the tea had brewed for three minutes and rupert had told her the whole story shed recovered her composure after all rupert was entitled to go to bed with whom he chose and perhaps he just did it with cameron because he wanted to get hold of the application document she thought hopefully although cameron was terribly beautiful and patrick would be absolutely heartbroken if he found out oh god what a terrible muddle rupert leant against the aga looking moodily at a huge vase of bluebells from our wood said taggie trying to lift the conversation arent they lovely rupert was about to snap that they were from his wood now dont try to placate me he said coldly taggie handed him a cup of tea then she took a deep breath i think daddys right she stammered rupert looked up you what he said unbelievingly not you too he wouldnt feel right with himself its like cheating in exams to most people it wouldnt matter but hes got such utter integ taggie stumbled over the word integrity and i havent i suppose of course you have but of a different kind if you won the franchise because hed spied on tony baddingham he wouldnt be able to live with himself well hes not living with me any longer dyou think tony wont wheel out every trick in the book once he finds out were bidding against him your fathers trying to fight a nuclear war with a pop gun its because he disapproves of lord baddingham so much he couldnt descend to his level thats why hes bidding against him not with me he aint said rupert putting down his mug im out oh please not pleaded taggie its so lovely for them having you as part of the consortium youve got such cccharisma is that your word for the day snapped rupert no its my word for always about you said taggie blushing crimson honestly they think youre marvellous funny way of showing it said rupert walking towards the door taggie ran after him her eyes filling with tears oh please daddy really needs you you and freddie were so wonderful when he was down i know he seems terribly clever but hes not street bright like you gazing at her rupert noticed how her tears and the old grey denim shirt of declans she was wearing emphasized the strange silvergrey of her eyes darling taggie he said his face softening how can anyone refuse you anything then youll stay rupert shrugged i suppose so but im extremely pissed off he reached into his pocket and rooted out a crimson leather box i got you an easter egg in madrid i hope youll like it better than the present i brought your father inside the box taggie found a little gold egg speckled with rubies and diamonds she gave a gasp look further said rupert opening the egg she found a tiny gold bird with ruby eyes poor things got conjuctivitis said rupert i cant believe it breathed taggie no one brings me presents like that oh thank you so so much i love it blushing furiously again she leant forward and kissed him on the cheek shes the little sister i never had rupert told himself firmly your steak and kidneys burning he said are you staying for supper no ive got to go back and vote what on capital punishment for terrorists taggie looked horrified theyre not going to bring it back are they daddyd leave the country in the library freddie was tearing a strip off declan this is the big league if youll excuse me saying so ruperts a very clever operator and we cant afford to lose im youve got to learn to argue wivout rancour declan you cant stick your chest out all the time what do you know about it growled declan ive never ad a strike at work said freddie because i dont judge everyone the same i cultivate their individual skills youre always bangin on about giving creative people the right atmosphere to work in then when rupert does somefink really creative you shit on im watched in awed amazement by bas and charles freddie calmly retrieved the application from the wastepaper basket declan gazed at him appalled but its dishonest for focks sake you wouldnt have nicked that document would you wouldnt ave ad the nerve said freddie but now weve got it im certainly goin to ave a little look this is war as rupert said not tiddlywinks you dont want to be too ighminded declan by the time sydney his driver had dropped rupert off at westminster the yellow stone of the house was softened by floodlighting and big ben shone like a great sugar sifter against an inky blue sky only one vote rupert told sydney im paired after that but ive got a hell of a lot of work still to do can you come back about twelvethirty nodding good evening to the policeman on the gate rupert went through the members entrance an expression that usually made him laugh glancing at the monitor he saw that owen davies the labour leader was winding up for the abolitionists time for a large drink he was bloody tired and hed never had any doubts that stringing up was the answer for terrorists but as he headed for the bar he thought fleetingly of taggies horror of capital punishment and declans passionate disapproval and decided to listen to the debate instead as he entered the chamber the ministers of employment and of health moved slightly apart to make room for him on the green leather front bench owens in barnstorming form whispered the minister of health hearing a din behind him rupert glanced round to see paul stratton who was violently prohanging for everything particularly wifepinching looking excited for the first time in months rubbish paul yelled resign check your figures whats the point of having british soldiers out there if we dont support them owen davies a brilliant orator on the dullest subject was on magnificent form tonight what about all those people whod been imprisoned for terrorism he demanded whod later been found innocent how much more terrible if theyd been hanged what evidence was there in any country that the death penalty curbed terrorism and conversely didnt hanging make sainted martyrs out of the most vicious thugs it was great emotional stuff but putting aside the soft cadences the eloquence the welsh voice rupert suddenly knew owen was right every moment you could feel the spirits of the antihanging lobby rising the bringback brigade looked turned to stone the prime minister who was almost more prohanging than paul stratton looked most bootfaced of all owen davies sat down to a storm of applause scenting blood the abolitionists roared for the pm to get up on your feet dont be bashful but the pm wasnt budging instead she let the home secretary who was decidedly ambivalent about the merits of hanging anyway wind up every time he opened his mouth he was howled down but he ploughed on bravely with his prepared speech careful not to emphasize that terrorism was on the increase but droning on about deterrents and the need to support the forces of law and order as ten oclock approached the abolitionists worked themselves into the kind of frenzy only seen at cardiff arms park when theres two minutes to go and the welsh are just in the lead then as big ben tolled ten oclock the noise subsided and the house divided the ayes looking tightlipped and apprehensive shuffled to the right the noes looking elated sauntered to the left without a moments deliberation ignoring the outraged looks of the pm the chief whip and most of the front bench rupert joined the noes owen davies turning in delighted amazement tapped rupert on the shoulder i didnt know you were one of us i wasnt until i heard you said rupert the minister of health a pacific and gentle soul also joined the noes well be on the carpet tomorrow he said shell have to call an election any minute said rupert an even tenner on th june said the minister of health done said rupert feeling suddenly shattered and not wanting a bollocking from the pm rupert beat a quick retreat to his office a small room on the lower ministers floor inside the walls were covered with signed photographs of famous athletes pat eddery ian botham maradona john mcenroe pat cash gary lineker dino and fenella ferranti to name only a few above the filing cabinet was a picture of wesley emerson the local cricketing hero who had joined the venturer consortium and who rupert had saved from getting busted thanks rupe wesley emerson he had scrawled in black pentel across the blue sky behind him i should think so too reflected rupert whenever he looked at the photo having taken off his tie and undone his top button he poured himself a large whisky and soda christ he was tired hed been on the go since five that morning and hadnt had any real sleep for a week making him feel even more tired was the red box full of work the buff envelope on the blotter full of constituency letters to be signed and the even bigger pile of mail to be read which was probably mostly abusive letters about the football riots the admirable gerald had scribbled a note gone to madam butterfly back about onethirty ring if you need me in the corner of the room was a hard olivegreen sofa where rupert was supposed to snatch some sleep during latenight sittings it had never looked more seductive if he had an hours kip he might work better he had another six oclock start in the morning the telephone ringing made him jump rupert its cameron christ hed completely forgotten to ring her back angel you got home safely well im not lying in a pile of wreckage at the bottom of the bay of biscay all the insecurity and truculence had returned to her voice it must have cost her a lot to ring im sorry i didnt ring back its been frantic and i didnt want to tread on tonys bunions when am i going to see you he suppressed a yawn christ knows snapped cameron tonys taking me away for the weekend to buckingham palace cameron didnt laugh to la to close a couple of deals over easter then we fly straight to cannes to meet with our various coproduction partners and firm up existing relationships i wont be back till monday week rupert glanced at the calendar monday week was nd april hed be away until the th and the franchises had to be in on the th that would give him hardly any time after she got back to persuade her to join venturer he ought to establish interim ascendancy over tony by seeing her this evening where are you he asked at home alone yes ill drive down are you crazy dyou know what time it is but it was impossible for her to keep the elation out of her voice ive got at least an hours work said rupert the drive at this time of night should take an hour and a half i cant afford to get done for speeding ill be with you about two thank god hed had a shower and changed at penscombe earlier in the evening it seemed a thousand years ago he trusted sydney but not entirely so he dismissed him and took the ferrari which was parked outside his westminster flat torrential rain on the motorway gave way to moonlight as he reached the outskirts of cotchester the cathedral clock was tolling the hour the shadow of the spire lay thick and black across the watermeadows he was so tired hed never be able to get it up cameron however opened the front door with nothing on i might have been the milkman said rupert reprovingly youre not that late she whispered as her warm oiled and scented body twined round him she was obviously so delighted to see him that miraculously rupert woke up bounding upstairs after her he decided this was one relationship he would have absolutely no difficulty firming up although cameron was kept ludicrously busy selling herself and coriniums programmes she was shattered by how much she missed rupert la was bad enough but cannes seemed so tantalizingly near every minute on the corinium stand or on the front or at the numerous parties or in her hotel bedroom conveniently next to tonys she expected rupert to appear grinning like a cheshire cat on her second thursday away from him however her black mood was caused by rage rather than longing one of tonys myriad subsidiary companies falconry films inc had made a lousy miniseries called stowaway about an aristocratic orphan who disguised herself as a cabin boy on a clipper ship and got off with the pirate captain and now tony had actually sailed a real clipper ship at vast expense into cannes harbour as a publicity stunt and was holding a huge bash on board sourly watching all the fatcat international buyers and their bikinied bimbos stuffing their faces with champagne and caviare cameron felt they were guzzling all the profits shed made corinium from four men went to mow the mediterranean suited tony his olive skin had already turned mahogany as he purred round the clipper ship in his dark glasses and discreetly coroneted black shirt clinching deals and pinching bottoms he looked more like a pirate king than ever cameron had had plenty of time to compare tony with rupert while she was away both were reputed to be absolute shits but while tony was coldly sensual utterly venal eaten up with envy and sadistically dedicated to putting people down rupert cameron felt was only sharptongued because he was arrogant and easily bored apart from the day they went to toledo when hed been reminded too much of helen which showed he was capable of deep feeling he had been angelic and really interested not only in her as a woman but in her career and her programmes she had been so touched that hed driven all the way down to cotchester on that last night and that after hed made love to her he hadnt fallen asleep as most men would but stayed awake pestering her with questions about what she and tony would be doing and selling in la and cannes it was a relief too that he couldnt call her so she didnt go through the roof with expectation every time the telephone rang instead at grave risk shed rung him twice from la and every day from cannes there was no doubt too that she was the flavour of the month at the festival the third series of four men went to mow had already been presold world wide the corinium publicity department had taken a full page advertisement in broadcast that week with a stunning photograph of cameron holding a baby lamb with the caption cameron cook works for corinium meet her on stand then listing all the prizes shed won in the last year everyone wanted to congratulate her and offer her work back at the priory declan was still working on the venturer application only pausing occasionally to pick up the binoculars on the window seat to check on some newlyarrived migrant bird swallows housemartins whitethroats were all winging in now last night he had even heard the first nightingale in the wood our duty wrote declan is to tell the truth to be relevant entertaining and interesting to monitor power and expose its abuse to be nobodys mouthpiece christ it was difficult not to use clichés to be concise to bring the balloon of the mind that bellies and drags in the wind as yeats had so perfectly put it into its narrow shed we will give the area a nationally recognized television identity he wrote this we feel corinium has failed to do in their last application they promised to provide a new studio a new youth orchestra a trust fund for the arts and sciences adequate training schemes and worker participation at board level this they have failed to do they also promised that fifty per cent of their profits after tax would go to shareholders and the rest would be ploughed back into making programmes this they have also failed to do he was about to tackle venturers programme plans when gertrude leapt barking off the sofa scattering papers as rupert and freddie walked in christ youre a slut declan said rupert looking round at the files tapes coffee cups and overflowing ashtrays that covered every available inch of space why dont you let taggie tidy up a bit im superstitious grumbled declan i never tidy up between books in case i throw pages away rupert threw a copy of broadcast open at camerons advertisement down on declans desk we must have her for venturer shes riding far too high to be interested in us said declan quickly shes not shes really pissed off said rupert she was on to me from cannes only half an hour ago grumbling that tonyd blued fortyfive grand hiring a boat to promote some crappy mini series not even made by corinium we need some eavyweight ladies said freddie moving the binoculars and sitting on the window seat think how useful cameron would be for the rest of the year as a mole in the corinium camp said rupert weve got georgie and seb and charles protested declan none of them sleep with tony persisted rupert we can use her to manipulate him more likely tonyll use her to manipulate you no one manipulates me said rupert haughtily i dont mean to sound conceited but i do know when a womans absolutely mad about me you do sound conceited snapped declan she may be mad about you at the moment but its a long long time from may to december and if you get bored or start playing her up shell bolt straight back to tony with all our secrets look said rupert patiently shes tonys only trump card if the iba know from the start shes with us itll totally discredit him its a risk wurf taking said freddie we neednt tell her too much ive got to tell her anyway said rupert flatly if she reads that were pitching for the franchise in the press on tuesday morning shell never forgive me and therell be no hope of ever getting her declan shook his head i want it to go on record he said grimly that i utterly deplore the idea of using her as a mole its unethical and dangerous nor is cameron going to be very pleased when you tell her what youve been up to already freddie scratched his curls i avent told valerie yet he confessed been putting it off dont fink shell be very pleased either valerie in fact was absolutely livid having studied her very good friend monica baddinghams behaviour valerie had decided it was upper class to be keen on gardening and she must therefore channel more of her energy into transforming green lawns into an absolute paradise wearing new gardening gloves and a tan scarf tied at the back of her very clean neck to keep her curls neat and kneeling on a new green rubber mat valerie was now tackling her favourite spot the mauve and pink garden fat mauve clumps of aubretia fell over the walls candypink double cherries danced in the breeze above serried ranks of mauve and pink tulips such a pity sighed valerie that none of them would be out for her opening in july and then freddie had to drop this disgusting bombshell about the franchise we cant do that to monica and tony she shrieked its so unsupportive ayll never hold my head up high on the distressed gentlefolks committee who else is behaind it freddie took a deep breath declan ohara valerie was so cross she weeded up a purple tulip that drunk hes practically ira and sharon nearly got raped at their new years eve party and rupert said freddie quailing rupert screamed valerie as purple now as the tulip she was trying to force back into the earth hes a bounder no female is safe the evil way i saw him looking at sharons legs when she was wearing her tennis shorts the other day even worse i found a snapshot of him in her brassière drawer yesterday and both declan and rupert are enemies of poor tony said valerie monica will be outraged like a small boy plunging into icy water freddie battled on and marti gluckstein and bas both crooks and arfur smiff common little man and a leftie sniffed valerie professor graystock and wesley emerson a black man said valerie incensed his wifes black too she might start poppin into the boutique and dame enid valerie stamped her foot that disgusting old lezzie with sharon in her teens frederick jones have you taken leave of your senses you must have been plottin this for weeks ay insist you drop out and henry hampshire and hubert brenton said freddie and whats more screamed valerie then stopped in her tracks as the names registered who did you say freddie repeated the last two names not the lordlieutenant and the bishop of cotchester yup said freddie grinning dropping her trowel valerie leapt to her feet well that does put a different laight on things if anyone can keep rupert in order they can i havent met the bishops waife but hermione hampshire is charming when can i tell everyone any time after monday lunchtime back from cannes cameron plunged into the first five days of shooting four men went to mow rupert was abroad smoothing the path for the next world cup in south america and playing in a proam tennis tournament to raise money for the olympic fund so he and cameron didnt meet up until late on friday cameron always drove too fast fortunately there was little traffic on the road that friday night as she scorched round corners and shot crossroads in her frenzy to reach rupert hardly a light was on in penscombe village but huge quivering stars and a full moon lit her path the chestnuts lining ruperts drive had reached a perfect pitch of pale greenness to welcome her and as she screeched to a halt in front of the house her headlights floodlit a big white magnolia in full flower on the edge of the lawn a thing of such unearthly incandescent beauty cameron just gazed and gazed i want to marry rupert she thought and be as beautiful a bride as that tree the next moment the front door opened and the pack of dogs swarmed round the car wagging and barking she didnt even mind their paws scrabbling the paintwork rupert followed them blond hair silver in the moonlight wearing a clean pinkandwhitestriped shirt reeking of expensive cologne he had obviously just bathed and cleaned his teeth holding his arms out he swept her off the ground above the tidal wave of dogs but theyre lovely she cried as he put her down in the hall and kneeling she hugged the dogs as they surged forward shoving nudging and licking her bare arms and legs in welcome how strange and how nice said rupert leading her into the drawingroom i never imagined youd like dogs there was a bottle of dom perignon on ice which rupert immediately opened and a huge plate of smoked salmon and some buttered wholemeal rolls on the table after a long hard day i dont believe in screwing on an empty stomach said rupert and im certainly going to give you a long hard night cameron moved up behind him fingering the powerful shoulders feeling the thrust of the muscular buttocks against her belly melting against him with lust how are things at fort knocksoff asked rupert cameron shook her head i feel like a mole rupert nearly spilled the champagne he was pouring how dyou mean if youd been stuck in a studio for twelve hours youd worry youd never see the light again oh i see said rupert relieved and youve got over cannes almost cameron took a great slug of champagne thats better dyou know i was approached by five different groups to join their consortiums very flattering said rupert piling smoked salmon onto a roll and handing it to her anyone interesting not bad unfortunately theyre all pitching against companies like granada and yorkshire who are virtually impregnable and if tony got a sniff of it id be out on my ear how is he rupert filled up her glass appallingly twitchy someone leaked the story of the clipper ship to dempster doubling the cost of the party press always get things wrong said rupert blandly it was he who had fed the story he examined his glass of whisky has the corinium application gone in he asked idly yes thank god said cameron who was shaking hands with one of the springer spaniels tonys handing it in to the iba tomorrow morning rupert heaved a sigh of relief if cameron flipped when he told her about venturer later tomorrow at least it would be too late for her to alter coriniums application slowly cameron was taking in the beauty of the room registering the romney the gainsborough the stubbs and the lely on the paleyellow walls determined not to be impressed she asked almost too aggressively how can you possibly live on your own in this great barn i dont said rupert ive got mr and mrs bodkin who look after me and the children are often here at weekends and theres er usually a house guest i asked for that thought cameron biting her lip dont worry rupert read her thoughts in order not to besmirch the memory of our last blessed encounter ive been holding my own ever since i suppose youve been sating yourself on lord b much less than before said cameron quickly the grandfather clock struck midnight dyou know what day it is now asked rupert st may said cameron glancing at her rolex dyou know our local poem said rupert grinning and putting on a gloucestershire accent first of may first of may outdoor fucking starts today but as usual it do rain so we fucks off indoors again as he moved towards her he stopped smiling will it be too cold for you outside not if you keep me warm whispered cameron outside under the moonlit magnolia he took off her clothes slowly kissing her all over where each garment had been until she was squirming and helpless with desire she could feel the dewdrenched lawn under her back ruperts cock was really incredible as he slid inside her she felt all the amazed joy of a canal lock suddenly finding it can accommodate the qe when she made love to tony she always shut her eyes she didnt want to see the uncharacteristically untidy hair the bulging eyes the clenched teeth the veins knotting on his forehead as he came she liked him sleek and in control with rupert she kept her eyes open all the time because he was the stuff of fantasy and because she didnt want to miss a second deciding the ground was too hard for her he later insisted she went on top youre so beautiful he said watching her transported maenad face ghostly in the moonlight lousy at accepting compliments cameron had to joke didnt your mother tell you off for lying on the grass im not lying said rupert arching his back up into her im telling the truth as cameron opened so did the heavens but as usual it do rain murmured rupert moving in and out of her dyou want to fuck off inside again not for ages gasped cameron at least itll wash off the sweat she woke in ruperts huge jacobean fourposter to find him gone and a note beside the bed saying he was doing a morning surgery at his constituency and would be back around lunchtime looking round the beautiful room with its peachy walls corncoloured carpet yellowandpinkstriped silk curtains on the fourposter and at the windows and rosepink silk chaiselongue cameron felt she was waking in the middle of a sunrise it was an incredibly feminine room for a man then she remembered the paleblue hall and the paleyellow drawingroom and decided it must all be helens taste on the dressing table amid ruperts clutter of betting slips silverbacked brushes cigar packets and loose change were photographs of his children the girl exactly like rupert had the same arrogant blueeyed stare the boy had very dark red hair and large dark wary eyes having met ruperts pack last night cameron felt seven stepdogs might be an easier proposition to take on than two stepchildren helen must have been spectacular to produce kids like that mad on sightseeing she was plainly a sight herself outside through a frame of rampant budding clematis lay the valley pale green except for the occasional wild cherry tree in flower or the blackthorn breaking in white waves over the hedgerows from an ash grove by the lake she could hear the haunting sweet cry of the cuckoo how could helen have walked out on such a view and such a man having showered and dressed cameron went downstairs the dogs lying in the hall thumped their tails and followed her into the kitchen there the housekeeper mrs bodkin was friendly but unfazed by her presence perhaps like people in trains she could afford to be friendly knowing cameron wouldnt be in situ for long she mustnt get jealous and paranoid tony was turned on by rows rupert she suspected would be bored and walk away from them she took some orange juice and coffee out onto the terrace that must be declans house across the valley still just visible through the thickening beech wood she wondered what hed been up to since his fall from grace how strange that on st january with patrick shed looked across at ruperts house and thought what a kingdom and now four months later here she was she stopped only briefly to glance at the library and the first editions which could be examined at length on a less lovely morning then set out with the dogs to explore there was a wonderful untamed beauty rather like maud ohara about the garden green leaves were uncurling on the tangled old roses the peacocks and crowing cocks once clipped out of the yew hedges were looking distinctly shaggy the swimmingpool was full of leaves the beech hedge round the tennis court was in need of a cut the lawns dotted with daisies were still lit along the edges by pools of dying daffodils rupert and this place need a woman thought cameron to cherish and sort them out the stables on the other hand were immaculate and filled with beautiful wellmuscled horses more horses were out in the fields the girl grooms treated cameron with the same weveseenthemallcomeandgo politeness displayed by mrs bodkin ill show them thought cameron as she set out through the beech woods im the one whos going to hang in the ground was still carpeted with bluebells only when she pressed her face close could she distinguish their faint sweet hyacinth scent from the rank sexy stench of the wild garlic the dogs charged ahead but the shaggy lurcher called blue kept bounding back solicitously to check she was all right shoving his wet nose in her hand giving her a token lick it was all so beautiful she had never felt so happy or so right anywhere she had wandered for a mile or two when suddenly she breathed in a sticky sweet familiar scent that made her tremble ahead a copse of poplars rising like flaming amber swords was wafting balsam down the woodland ride towards her evoking the times she used to inhale friars balsam under a towel as a child reminding her all too violently of her mother and mike instantly her euphoria evaporated she glanced at her watch it was half past twelve she must get back grey clouds were creeping over the sun it had become much cooler she even felt a spot of rain as she dropped down the wood towards the house an owl hooted surely it shouldnt hoot at midday through the trees she could see the lake grey and blank now as a smudged mirror and as she reached the big lawn she gave a moan of horror last nights deluge had stripped all the petals from the magnolia scattering them over the grass last nights bride was naked now the dogs converged barking as a car drew up at the front door cameron hoped it was rupert but it turned out to be a youth delivering some boxes of tshirts who gazed at cameron in admiration this is the first lot mr cb wanted them in a hurry he said tell him the stickers the posters and the badgesll be ready by monday cameron couldnt resist having a look the tshirts were a beautiful cerulean blue with a dark bronze drawing of a boy shading his forehead on the front and the words support venturer on the front and the back they must be for some sporting event taking one upstairs cameron stripped off and put it on it fell just below her bush suddenly feeling incredibly randy she hoped rupert hadnt got anything planned for the afternoon as it was much colder she shut the window trapping a tendril of clematis which was already wilting and bruised from being trapped on previous occasions trying to insinuate its way into ruperts bedroom like her and every other woman thought cameron wryly next minute the front door banged very slowly she walked downstairs rupert was looking at the boxes in the hall theyre great she said can i keep one rupert glanced up and froze for a second hullo angel did you sleep well so well murmured cameron seductively that im ready to be exhausted again she lifted the tshirt to show him her bush then when he didnt react as shed expected and come bounding up the stairs she said what is venturer anyway ruperts eyes seemed to have gone a darker more opaque shade of blue and lost all their sparkle come and have a drink he said disappointed cameron followed him into the drawingroom suddenly he seemed incredibly tense and when she refused a drink poured himself two fingers of neat whisky and drank it in one gulp then he pulled her down on to the sofa beside him look sweetheart this is a bit difficult but theres something ive got to tell you cameron went white suddenly in that baggy tshirt she looked as fragile pale and defenceless as one of the anemones that strewed the paths of ruperts woods you want to pack me in she whispered no no quite the reverse very gently he smoothed a tendril of dark hair behind her ear and stroked her rigid quivering cheek but you may want to pack me in freddie jones declan and i are pitching for the corinium franchise weve called ourselves venturer at first she was so relieved that he wasnt trying to end the relationship she couldnt think straight you and declan how long has this been going on since the day after declan walked out so turning up in madrid wasnt only to see a football match no or showing such interest in my career and the goings on at corinium no did you read the application in my briefcase i photostated it she was trembling violently now and her lips were quite white dont worry he reassured her declan was so appalled by my skulduggery he refused to read it so we havent pinched anything and i suppose you arranged those riots as an excuse to fly straight home once youd got what you wanted uhuh protested rupert two stabbed cops twentyfive people injured and a burntdown stand is going too far even for me but driving down to see me before i flew out to la and all those questions you asked me did you give that stowaway story to dempster rupert nodded truth however devastating was the only answer now and christ how much have i already told you this weekend whispered cameron looking at her watch and our applications already gone in rupert had expected rage tantrums having his face clawed but not this numb state of shock i trusted you she said slowly youre the first person ive trusted since i was fourteen i thought you were so caring you bloody judas this is the worst thing thats ever happened to me it isnt as awful as it seems said rupert soothingly i thought you were the sexiest thing on two legs the moment i saw you didnt i offer you a lift home after valeries dinner party i would have moved in both at declans party if young patrick hadnt been making the running and at corinium if tony hadnt been hanging about if i hadnt fancied you to death id never have bothered coming out to madrid i wanted to level with you but i didnt know how youd react we couldnt afford to let you rush back to tony and tell him everything in case he exoceted our bid before it got off the ground cameron leapt to her feet tugging down the tshirt and i figured you were really interested in me what a joke i know how declan detests me he must have cracked up and i suppose patrick and that dumbass taggie were in on it too christ you must have been all laughing yourselves sick she was crying now angry agonized rasping tears and rupert suddenly appreciated her terrible insecurity her paranoia her vulnerability and her terror for the first time his heart was truly touched by her getting up he tried to take her in his arms and comfort her angel youve got it wrong no ones laughing at you i want you i absolutely adore you we all want you to join venturer we were just picking our moment weve got an absolutely alpha lineup but youd be the jewel in our crown and youd be totally free to make the programmes you wanted get out of my way screamed cameron i hate you i never want to see you again and diving under his outstretched arms she bolted out of the door rupert had never felt such a shit in his life shell have to get her clothes and her suitcase from upstairs he thought i can cut her off on her way downstairs but cameron shot straight out of the front door and next moment he heard the wheels of the lotus crunching on the gravel tony was probably still on his way down from london and cameron couldnt rage round to the falconry in nothing but that tshirt but shed be on to him on the telephone in a flash the earlywarning system had gone off it was just a matter of time before the hbomb landed all over the country on sunday nd may the independent companies and those consortiums who sought to oust them were assembling colourcoding and ringbinding forty copies of their application document on a paper complete with attached confidential material to be delivered to the iba headquarters in brompton road by noon the following day corinium to be on the safe side had submitted their application the day before venturer who were pushed for time spent a wildly exciting sunday at freddies house in holland park knocking their final draft into shape everyone agreed that declan had done a masterly job but freddie and marti gluckstein who arrived looking like a costive lizard felt declans bald and somewhat arrogant claim that we can find million just ring henriques bros was inadequate and were therefore considerably extending the financial section freddie and lord smith were going through the technical specifications with a toothcomb while harold white janey lloydfoxe charles fairburn dame enid and professor graystock were having fun jazzing up the programme content bas having provided architects plans for the conversion of cotchester house into studios and offices should tony turn nasty was now playing chemmy with henry hampshire the lordlieutenant who hadnt spent a sunday in london for twentyfive years and with wesley emerson who had nothing really to add to the bid except his illustrious presence the bishop was driving up to london immediately after evensong maud whod come for the ride was playing the piano upstairs ursula and freddies secretary were frantically typing and retyping drafts and then running okayed pages off on the word processor taggie was in the kitchen she had given everyone pâté and cheese for lunch and was now making chicken estragon for the celebration dinner four plump boiling chickens carrots and onions were already simmering in a huge pan on the aga there was an extremely complicated and hazardous sauce to be made later involving egg yolks cream and lemon juice which might easily curdle but at least having tramped the length of notting hill gate that morning shed found some fresh tarragon from the nextdoor room she could hear screams of laughter we must do a series on local studs called dongs of praise janey lloydfoxe was saying we can start off with rupert then we wont have to pay him a fee rupertd screw a fee out of us anyway said charles well the programmes about screwing said janey janey was absolutely gorgeous thought taggie rupert had said she was nearly forty but except for the fine pencilling of lines round her wicked dark brown eyes youd never have known it poor billy her husband was abroad covering the paris tennis tournament for the bbc and janey had turned up with the most adorable baby who was so fat smiling and gurgling that even the men wanted to hold her and janey was so blonde and beautiful and had such wonderful brown breasts after a week in portugal that no one minded her breastfeeding at all ive got a terrific idea for a game show janey was now saying you have a panel and they have to guess who the celebrity is by interviewing the cleaners who work for them we call it daily daily mrs makepiece can give us some wonderful stories about james vereker and mrs bodkin would be riveting about ruperts goings on mrs bodkin used to work for us continued janey shifting the baby to her right breast the first time we got a cordless telephone she found it in our bed and assuming it was some autoerotic device discreetly hid it in my pants drawer then when it started ringing billy who was expecting some summons to jump for britain went frantic trying to find it everyone screamed with laughter dont you think its a brilliant idea declan no said declan who already adored janey the iba would think it otterly undemocratic well what about an english dallas wifeswapping in the royal triangle said janey later said declan when weve got the franchise they were all so bright and clever thought taggie wistfully she had contributed nothing an army marches on its stomach declan was fond of telling her but she was sure that everyone would have been just as happy with an indian takeaway this evening and that her father had only suggested she did the food in order to involve her in the house opposite a lot of young people were sprawled on the drawingroom carpet drinking red wine and reading the sunday papers it all came back to reading thought taggie despairingly if she didnt keep at it shed lose the ability more and more like not talking french she must try harder she pored over the estragon recipe in the book but half the words were in french embarrassed at having to resort to a tape recorder she shut the door so no one could hear she was worried about rupert too hed been edgy and refused to eat anything when hed popped in earlier then furious because hed forgotten to bring up the tshirts hed also taken an instant dislike to professor graystock whom he hadnt met before and who had black straggly hair like a jumblesale crone a wet sensual mouth and a pale waxy formless face whos he in mourning for rupert asked taggie in horror no one i dont think must be look at his fingernails and the inside of his collar then rupert had pushed off promising he and the tshirts would be back later taggie was sure he didnt look after himself properly if she made the chicken particularly nice he might eat something this evening at eight oclock the first bottle of bollinger was cracked as they waited for the final draft to be ready declan had just rewritten the last page to give the whole thing a uniformity of style ursula and freddies secretary were busy collating everything and freddie and declan were now folding up the confidential memos listing harold white georgie baines charles seb and billy as heads of various departments and putting these memos into envelopes pity we cant add cameron cook sighed freddie rupert would have rung by now if he had anything to report said declan who preferred it that way dame enid and maud both well away were now playing duets the lordlieutenant had lost so much money to bas hed probably have to sell another preraphaelite but he couldnt have enjoyed himself more there were so many pretty women to gaze at and they were all such splendid chaps and rupert had promised he should meet joanna lumley very soon janey who was well stuck into the bollinger was breastfeeding again mother and child a lovely sight said the bishop whod just arrived so much prettier than deirdre killprogramme and her disgusting brat said georgie baines to seb burrows please said charles fairburn faintly that babys drinking neat bollinger said bas thats why its so cheerful i hope all our burn money isnt being squandered on bubbly said professor graystock who was on his fourth glass it isnt said taggie quickly ruperts paid for all of it helped by seb she was now putting out big plates of chicken estragon and rice salad shed worried herself sick that the sauce had gone wrong but mercifully it had thickened as it cooled that looks marvellous taggie i wish youd marry me when i grow up said bas who was now comfortably ensconced on the sofa with janey and a full bottle this tomato salad is out of this world said seb carrying the bowl in taggie liked seb he had a good body hunky without being fat thick lightbrown hair short at the back and long at the front very direct slate grey eyes and he was very nearly as tall as she was then as big ben struck nine the applications were ready forty copies of beautifully typed ringbound pages on the front beneath the clear plastic cover was a drawing of a beautiful boy with his hand to his forehead standing on the capitals t and u of the word venturer against a clear cerulean background on the back also protected by a plastic cover was an exquisite watercolour map of the area painted by caitlin including the towns and villages with little drawings of the relevant houses where all the prospective venturer directors lived and with pale blue arrows from each of them converging on cotchester it had cost a lot to print but theyd all thought it was worth it everyone went mad with excitement as they sat round reading and at last holding in their hands tangible proof that it was all really happening dont spill drink over them for christs sake said declan its very good declan said harold white id forgotten how well you write i love the bit about carpets being so thick and offices so soundproofed on the corinium directors floor that all one can hear is the faint rustle of nests being feathered i liked that bit too said declan blushing and i love this bit about coriniums local news programmes being presented by pretentious pastelclad narcissists boomed dame enid that boring little fart vereker wont like that one bit i hope thats not actionable said professor graystock primly and are you quite sure there was a roman camp at whychey quite said declan i like my cottage said marti gluckstein examining the map at the back i must come and look at it some time ouch he yelled as freddie kicked him sharply on the ankle sorry but declan thinks you spend every weekend there whispered freddie i do like your ideas for religious programmes said janey smiling up at the bishop who went very pink declan saw that everyones glasses were full then got to his feet id just like to thank you all for having the courage to join venturer and for all the hard work youve put in already but i must warn you this has been the easy bit once its out in the open that were pitching for corinium tony baddingham is going to do everything to discredit us and rake up dirt about all of us our only hope is to stick together and trosst each other he smiled round at everyone this is a very very proud day for me lets all raise our glasses victory to venturer said henry hampshire and amazingly unselfconsciously everyone followed suit i shall compose a battle song for venturer and well make a record said dame enid i hope its better than the song cycle shes just written muttered seb to taggie it sounded more like a lot of tom cats being garrotted by knicker elastic this chicken is just as much a work of art as your fathers application he went on can i have some more everyone jumped as the doorbell went i cant help thinking its tony with a pitchfork said georgie baines nervously but it was only the man with the tshirts and once again everyone went wild and put them on including the baby and gertrude they were baggy enough having been ordered to caitlins specification to fit dame enid and charles fairburn and even the bishop wore one over his dog collar janey wore hers just over pants to show off her long brown legs and after a lot of persuading taggie did the same theyre much better than coriniums tshirts said seb in delight theyre custard yellow with caring corinium written across the front tony eschewed the symbol of the corinium ram as being too libidinous more champagne was drunk and food eaten then the photographer arrived where the hells rupert said declan irritably i think we ought to get on and get this pickie taken without him said freddie in an undertone lord smiffs shipped enough to float the qe an wesleys on somefink else and hes supposed to drive back to leeds tonight for an eleven oclock start he better go first thing tomorrow said declan we dont want him busted the day the applications go in bas and janey were still nose to nose on the sofa the baby had fallen asleep in bass arms line up for the photograph everyone shouted freddie seb dragged taggie in from the kitchen she loathed group photographs she was always taller than half the men youre as much a part of venturer as anyone else said seb taggie sat on the sofa gertrude on her knee bristling in a childs tshirt with maud on one side and janey and the baby on the other bas stood behind janey taggie suddenly noticed his suntanned fingers caressing the back of janeys neck and hastily looked away straighten your tshirt so i can see all the venturers said the photographer look nice and happy please can you get the little dog to prick up his ears lovely smile please he was still snapping away two minutes later when taggie gave a shriek of pain as gertrude leapt off her bare legs barking furiously as rupert came through the door he had that same look of blazing triumph on his face reflected janey that he used to have in the old days when one of his horses won a big class and he used to ride it out of the ring giving its neck great slaps of joy he hadnt looked like that for years rupert paused in the doorway ladies and gentlemen he drawled may i introduce venturers head of drama taggie gave a gasp of horror harold white went white seb georgie and charles nearly jumped out of the window in terror as rupert turned round and putting his arm around camerons shoulders very much in a gesture of possession drew her into the room she looked very pale and very shy but incredibly beautiful with her face strangely softened by love maud broke the stunned silence for months despite declans denials she had suspected rupert of having a growing preference for taggie it was the one thing she couldnt have stood joyfully she welcomed such a public transferring of his affections to cameron rushing forward she hugged them both congratulations darlings now im convinced venturers going to get the franchise dont look so worried said rupert mockingly to the cringing corinium contingent camerons on the level her names going to be put forward on the confidential memo like the rest of you and shes going to stay working for corinium until december charles decided to make the best of a bad job welcome to venturer sweetie he said kissing cameron fucking hell muttered seb to georgie look at the way shes looking at rupert said georgie hes got her exactly where he wants her as long as he stays wanting her said seb shaking his head janeys baby woke up suddenly and started bawling its head off probably got a hangover said bas soon the champagne was circulating again cameron was sitting on the sofa now flipping through the application document with one hand clinging onto ruperts hand with the other whys taggie crying in the kitchen dame enid asked maud i expect shed like to be able to read her fathers application like everyone else said maud airily shes dyslexic you see poor darling said dame enid shes a bloody good cook im going to have thirds seb put his arm round taggie in the kitchen you ok babes fine she muttered blowing her nose on a dryingup cloth im just tired i guess your applications dazzling said cameron following declan over to the drinks table where he was opening another bottle miles miles better than ours any slight doubts i might have had about joining venturer have been dispelled by reading it i do hope rupert hasnt railroaded you all into accepting me i dont want any bullying said declan glaring at her ones only as good as ones work force and dont you ever forget it im going to have to put in a lot of spade work to win him over thought cameron but all that really mattered was that rupert loved her freddie clapped his hands lets get this pickie finished come on cameron said charles brandishing a tshirt im not sure i ought to appear in it stammered cameron suddenly realizing what compromising evidence it would be put it on snapped declan charles slid the tshirt over her head and once again they all lined up george and seb taking up their position on either side of her with charles standing behind straighten your tshirts look happy everyone said the photographer lets get one thing straight beside tshirts miss cook said georgie out of the corner of his handsome mouth as he beamed into the camera if you shop us to tony well shop you said seb as he also beamed into the camera and dont forget there are well over two hundred shopping days to th december said charles as venturer had called a press conference for the following afternoon declan stayed the night at freddies house and taggie drove her mother and gertrude back to penscombe just after midnight maud was plastered and went on and on about how nice janey was and wasnt it a turnup for the books rupert rolling up with cameron and did taggie think rupert had offered her marriage or to move into penscombe or what taggie answered in monosyllables and fortunately as they passed the reading exit maud fell into a drunken sleep taggie then proceeded to give herself a very good talking to what the hell was she feeling so miserable about rupert was as far beyond her as the huge stars daisying the black lawn of sky above and plainly as impervious to her love it was the stupid sort of crush teenagers had on pop stars or actors someone to dream about when you were tucked up in bed or wandering through the woods rupert had probably been kind to her because he missed his own children the silver necklace gertrudes valentine the little easter egg were all presents you might give a child she told herself firmly and saying that no one could resist her taggie wished she could memorize recipes and how to spell words as easily as she remembered every conversation shed had with rupert was just the sort of thing hed say to any girl cameron was beautiful brilliant sophisticated and tough taggie was sure she only disliked her because shed upset declan and hurt patrick so much but rupert wouldnt stand any nonsense so maybe they were well suited next minute she felt a cold nose nudging her elbow and put out her hand to stroke gertrude who slid forward along the hand brake until she could climb onto taggies knee and settle down with a martyred sigh taggie knew she shouldnt allow gertrude to lie there on a motorway it was particularly dangerous but she needed the comfort she was not someone who regarded happiness as a right but the ghastly shock of seeing cameron and rupert so obviously in love tonight made her realize how happy without being conscious of it shed been since valentines day when rupert began dropping in at the priory whenever he was at home despite the talking to she didnt think shed ever felt so unhappy in her life at noon the lists closed the information office at the iba then had a frantic three and a half hours going through the applications and extracting the names and addresses of those involved for a press release at threethirty down at cotchester three of the four corinium moles made themselves scarce charles fairburn drove to the forest of dean to spend two days in an enclosed order ostensibly interviewing monks georgie flew to manchester to see a big petfood client cameron disappeared to stowonthewold on location leaving strict instructions that she wasnt to be interrupted seb burrows being a true journalist and hating to miss the fireworks hung around the newsroom corinium staff not involved with the venturer bid were also kept busy james vereker slipped home with sarah stratton for an extended lunch hour daysee butler whod been out in the evenings so much recently she hadnt watched any television was reading the soap updates in the mail as she soaked up the sun in her bikini in the cathedral close tony baddingham and ginger johnson were having a celebrity boardroom lunch with the french coproducers of stowaway having just sold it both to nbs and bbc what a relief they all agreed they hadnt killed off the handsome pirate villain as a sequel was already planned how nice it was too thought tony to lunch with europeans who still appreciated a good blowout and decent claret compared with the yanks who seemed totally addicted to rabbit food and perrier by three fortyfive tony was back in his office in half an hour he would have sobered up and be wondering who to bully now he merely felt lecherous all those palegreen trees and pale halfnaked girls stretched out among the buttercups the first flush and flesh of spring always got him going having spent a weekend without cameron he decided to drop in and see her after the chamber of commerce dinner that night an event which had to be endured in a franchise year still feeling randy he was about to summon sarah stratton to discuss her posing with a lamb for a caring corinium poster when miss madden buzzed barney williams from the telegraph lord b he wants to talk about the franchise put him on tony extracted a cigar from the box on his desk and relaxed in his leather chair preparing to be generous about midwests pathetic bid barney williams came straight to the point did you know declan ohara put in a rival bid tony laughed heartily is this some kind of joke im afraid it isnt who else is involved rupert campbellblack freddie jones whaaaat it sounded like a great oak tree crashing to the ground even through soundproofed doors miss madden jumped in the nextdoor office then tony was leaning on the buzzer miss madden he yelled take these names down who else he asked barney henry hampshire the bishop of cotchester marti gluckstein hes never been to gloucestershire evidently he has a weekend cottage there janey lloydfoxe dame enid spink lord smith he cant join hes a union member exmember just crispin graystock wesley emerson hes the only bit of nameplate engineering theyre all pretty heavyweight in fact and oh yes theres your brother bas bit jacob and esau isnt it tony gave a low hiss that was almost a sigh and you had absolutely no idea asked barney none and theyre all friends of yours they were theyre calling a press conference in london at fourthirty will you be doing the same or can i have a quote now ive nothing to say until ive talked to my board tony slammed down the telephone bastards traitors every single one of them theyd all eaten his salt and hed absolutely no inkling what kind of fucking newsroom did he have the maddened bulls roar could be heard all down the passage ginger cyril georgie cameron charles come in here georgies in manchester said miss madden and camerons on location get them back ginger johnson thought tony was going to have a coronary he was magenta in the face veins bulged like huge snakes on his forehead he seemed to be popping out of his darkgreen collar ginger wanted tonys job but not until the franchise was safely in the bag what on earths up tony was so angry as he paced up and down fists clenched froth flecking his mouth he could hardly get the words out to tell him once he lit a cigar from the wrong end then hurled it out of the window without taking the top off he tried to pour himself a stiff whisky then banged the bottle down what have they called themselves asked cyril peacock who was taking down the inevitable notes venturer adventurers more likely every bloody one of them god ill crucify them ill take them to the cleaners ginger went to the drinks cupboard and poured tony a large brandy he was equally shocked at the possible loss of a million turnover but having no personal vendettas with any of the venturer team he didnt feel tonys paranoia or passionate sense of being deliberately ganged up on miss madden buzzed its the sun lord b and just hang on a minute beryl says the mirror are on the other line tell them lord bs in conference and to ring back in half an hour said ginger taking the initiative dont talk to them now he added to tony get your breath back the most important thing at this stage is not to show were rattled leave the mudslinging to venturer weve got seven months to put the boot in the only possible approach now is olympian these boring little pygmies are yapping at my heels but i cant feel it should we call a press conference certainly not theyre not worth it why show them were panicking downstairs in the newsroom seb burrows picked up his telephone it was itn hello seb christ what a story what story said seb innocently itn told him did you know anything about it none of us did christ can you interview tony for us for the five fortyfive news ill try i dont imagine hell be in carnival mood but to sebs amazement tony agreed by the time the crew got up to tonys office every award corinium had ever won including the emmys and the baft as nicked from camerons office had been put on the bookshelf or hung on the wall behind tonys head the earlier storm had subsided tonys rage was ice cold now he had even extracted a salmonpink carnation from the vase on the desk to put in his buttonhole whats your reaction to venturers bid asked seb tony gave a big but slightly dismissive smile well theyre good chaps all jolly good friends of mine im sure theres a lot of merit in their application but frankly im more interested in the things corinium are doing like announcing plans for a tenmillionpound studio near southampton whichll mean about four hundred extra jobs and spending two million on new equipment at cotchester to enable us to make even better programmes and meet with every confidence the challenge of cable and satellite weve won a lot of awards over the last few years he waved airily at the trophies glittering behind him we provide an excellent local news service and make jolly good programmes and there we rest our case im not getting anywhere thought seb people are saying that declan ohara and your brother basil have been deliberately plotting to oust you since declan walked out of here last march in a blaze of publicity tony examined his nails are they he said with another big smile ask a silly question thought seb kicking himself had you any idea they were engaged in a rival bid none i wish them luck it would be a dull race if there were no other contenders but it doesnt dent my confidence which consortium midwest or venturer worries you the most neither i congratulate venturer on putting an application together at such short notice and with such secrecy ill be interested to see whats in it in due course and you feel no bitterness towards freddie jones and rupert campbellblack and henry hampshire who have all enjoyed your hospitality none at all laughed tony as though the idea had never occurred to him nor do corinium have any desire to get involved in mudslinging let dorothy dove who recently won us a bafta award be a symbol of our company noncombative but victorious the moment the camera stopped rolling the smile was wiped from tonys face now bugger off all of you but come back the moment cotswold roundup is over seb and bring james vereker with you cameron ignored tonys summons to return at once and insisted on carrying on shooting until the fourthirty tea break it was vital to be as bolshie as usual or tony would suspect something as she drove through the angelic spring greenness with the roof down she heard a flash on the fivethirty news that declan ohara after a megabustup with corinium in march was now getting his revenge on tony by heading a rival bid for corinium rupert freddie dame enid the bishop wesley lord smith and janey were also mentioned cameron waited in terror for her name to be tagged on at the end she was still in a state of shock after the weekend when shed run out on rupert on saturday shed gone straight home and rung tony at home something hed told her never to do and promptly got monica remembering that tony had the french coproduction people over for the weekend who were probably mon dieuing over monicas fading stretch of daffodils at that moment shed hung up for the next twentyfour hours she crouched shuddering in her bedroom telephone off the hook all doors locked not answering the bell going through every kind of torture at the prospect of life without rupert the craving had got so bad that when on sunday afternoon hed smashed the pane of her french windows at the back let himself in pounded up the stairs and taken her in his arms telling her he couldnt go on without her the sheer relief of having him back made her agree to anything she would join venturer she would stay at corinium and spy on tony a ms is not nearly as good as a mole rupert had told her as hed dropped her off at hamilton terrace at four oclock that morning god knows when either of them would get any sleep but at last the crunch had come all day shed been snapping at the cast for acting badly now she had to give a bafta performance herself at least shed heard the news bulletin so she didnt have to simulate complete surprise when she saw tony but as she drove into her slot in the corinium car park and read the words cameron cook controller of programmes she felt she should cross out the last three and put traitor she reached tonys office just before the main bbc news the commercials with the sound turned down were airing on itv tony ginger and cyril were all watching cameron went straight up to tony and put her arms round him im so sorry i heard it on the radio theyre all traitors but freddie and bas are the worst of all was bas mentioned on the radio said cyril pencil poised what station i dont remember said cameron hastily some local bulletin but i was switching about to see what i could find out christ that was a near one she thought going to the drinks cupboard and pouring herself a stiff vodka and tonic shed have to be careful with the liquor too she was so tired other indiscretions might slip out how the hell had guy burgess kept his communist affiliations a secret for so long if he was always pissed the bbc led on the story beautiful weather apart there wasnt much news after some introductory waffle about the contenders now circling in the paddock they went straight over to the venturer press conference not wanting him to see her face cameron took up her position behind tony leaning against the wall with her hand on his shoulder he seemed calm enough but she could feel the knotted tension of his muscles a tic was leaping in his jaw and the carnation in his buttonhole had already wilted as though poisoned by his venom the venturer team looked splendid declan had been so hostile last night that she hadnt noticed how well he was looking already tanned from gardening and sitting outside writing the application half the heavy lines seemed to have been ironed out of his face and there was rupert laughing with janey who looked amazing bearing in mind the amount shed drunk yesterday rupert had said she was the one person cameron need never be jealous of but she removed her hand from tonys shoulder in case she clutched it convulsively rupert looked marvellous too christ he was beautiful any minute she thought taking such a large slug of vodka that it spilled down the tall glass all over her face shed wake up there was also a massive contingent of press there people were standing on tables fighting for space why have you pitched for the corinium franchise declan asked the bbc we want to create a company that is genuinely local said declan and we want to make some bloody good programmes and a fortune into the bargain said the mirror everyone laughed declan grinned that too then we can afford to make even better programmes soon however the vitriol was flowing freely corinium have lost touch with the public and their region they need a good shakeup said rupert after eight years in business said freddie it seems amazing that tony b has only just decided to build a studio near southampton i appeared on cotswold roundup recently boomed dame enid i was interviewed by some pastelclad pansy she winked at declan who didnt know what the hell he was talking about it was the worst programme ive ever been on what drew you in bishop asked the catholic herald television today is a key factor in the quality of life in the community in the establishment of christian values said the bishop heartily i hope to play a part through venturer in making television more uplifting and more enjoyable he wagged a finger one doesnt exclude the other yknow realizing the bishop was all set to deliver a sermon rupert cut in the bishop feels as i do that theres far too much sex and violence on coriniums programmes fucking hypocrite thundered tony very much so agreed the bishop on four men went to mow young people are continually going to bed with other young people and shown not to be taking precautions coriniums drama record as a whole added janey is abysmal bitch hissed cameron in genuine outrage how dare she there are of course good people working at corinium said declan but theyre hamstrung by a greedy and incompetent management tony puffed on his cigar the knuckles of his left hand whitening as he made a dagger of the silver paper knife on his desk cyrils doodles became more extravagant having worked at corinium for seven months went on declan i know just how bad things are isnt that actionable said ginger furiously but tony held up his hand for silence as the star asked declan who venturer were poaching from other companies declan smiled again we have a string of incredibly talented people who will take over as heads of the various departments the moment we win the franchise he said but as theyre all working for itv or the bbc we cant tell you who they are what dyou feel about your other rival midwest said the sun rupert laughed well they were advertising for ideas for programmes in the local paper last week he said so they must be a bit short on imagination and as their regional trump card is a geography master whos never been to london i cant say we feel very threatened the bbc obviously feeling theyd given venturer enough coverage turned to the wonderful weather tony immediately switched over to cotswold roundup who put out an outwardly impartial report about there being two contenders for the corinium franchise then ran tonys interview with seb in full this was immediately followed by a link from james vereker saying that declan must have got to know rupert when he interviewed him for corinium next the clip was run in from the programme in which declan quoted the gloucestershire peer describing rupert as a nasty virus everyones wife caught sooner or later and rupert replying if you could see his wife itd definitely be later finally came declans questions as to whether rupert was going to mend his ways because of aids and rupert cracking back that he was giving up casual sex for lent without any qualifying comment the programme then switched to a story about playingfields that was offensive said cameron furiously that clip should never have been taken out of context the iba wont like it one bit said ginger shaking his head i didnt authorize it lied tony quickly i cant help it if my newsroom get a little protective and leap to my defence cameron felt sick it was going to be much dirtier and more difficult than shed thought things became worse when seb and james rolled up after cotswold roundup tony utterly businesslike now said their chief object should be to dig up as much dirt on venturer as possible and then get other people to leak the stories weve got to appear whiter than white and above it all heres the list of their consortium tony handed copies to james and seb declan was desperately pushed for cash when he left corinium hows he managed to be in funds again investigate any ira sympathies his wifes a tart see if theres any rift there ruperts a government minister said ginger thats out of order for a start he could influence the pm to lean on the iba to give venturer the franchise excellent said tony ring up paul stratton ginger he detests rupert get him to ask a question in the house about it and find out who ruperts sleeping with seb its bound to be different from yesterday if anything moves or rather stays still hell fuck it sarah stratton used to sleep with him she may still be talk to her seb didnt dare look at cameron suddenly he felt desperately sorry for her lord smith likes the fleshpots far too much for a socialist went on tony hes got his own house with five bedrooms and a very nice car see if hes been using union funds graystocks a pinko too investigate any communist sympathies hes also divorced got a second house and definitely sent his second child to a private school hang round the university seb and see if hes ever fiddled with one of his students or put one in the club ditto dame enid said ginger with his dry mirthless laugh shes probably miffed were doing a michael tippett opera this year and not one of hers thats possible said tony good story to leak to the gossip columns and the bishop of cotchester must have had a choirboy in his time he ran his finger down the list henry hampshires a terrible letch keep an eye on him janey lloydfoxe is a whore she left billy for a bit and went off with one of his sponsors and theyre always broke theres bound to be some dirt there and wesley emersons a cinch hes always stoned or dipping his wick weve just got to pick our moment to leak a really juicy story ginger shook his head got to be careful there wesleys such a local hero the publicll forgive him anything he took five wickets today only person who did send sarah stratton to interview him said tony that should do the trick jamess stomach gave a terrific rumble his extended lunch with sarah today had not included food i think we should be careful about smirching coriniums caring face he said palely i agree said cameron whod also gone very white cant we just as you said stand on our record were better than them it seems so tacky to sink to their level dont be fucking stupid snapped tony this is war i dont believe marti gluckstein lives in penscombe either find out his alleged address and go and bung the neighbours ill do that story said seb quickly charles is a friend of both ruperts and declans said tony he can find out what theyre up to where the hell is he anyway he turned furiously on cyril gone to an enclosed order for two days stammered cyril theyre not on the telephone well drive over and fetch him back sunshine said tony with exaggerated patience if you both value your jobs see that he rings me at home tonight after eleven oclock he opened his briefcase and took out a clean shirt and a tie ive got to go to the chamber of commerce dinner so bugger off all of you i want to talk to cameron after theyd gone cameron couldnt stop shaking its so awful she kept saying i think it might be rather fun said tony softly when the right moment comes ill press the destruct button on the lot of them theyve no idea what theyve taken on as he came towards her his breath was foul as though all the hatred had churned and rotted inside him his body stank of stale sweat trying not to flinch when he grabbed her cameron said i thought you were dropping by this evening id like to but its not safe pressll be hanging round venturer might even put a private dick on to me he was so mad to get inside her he broke the elastic of her panties it was all over in a minute the bastards he groaned theyve all betrayed me then he took her throat between his hands if you ever betray me ill kill you down the high street at radio cotchester the controller of programmes received an irate telephone call from the managing director whod never been near the station since princess michael opened it five years ago ive just heard a very favourable interview with bas baddingham he roared i dont want any more crap like that on radio cotchester tell all our presenters and djs were backing corinium a hundred per cent throughout this campaign after all tony baddingham owns twenty per cent of us up the high street at the cotchester news the editor was reading tomorrows leader tony baddinghams words to declan ohara that people who get too big for their boots should go and wear out other peoples carpets must ring hollow in his ears today when the megastar irishman and penscombe resident headed a bid to oust tony baddingham and walk on coriniums carpets himself after th december venturer as hes called his consortium appears to be soundly based financially rich in talent and determined to grasp the infinite the editor had read enough and buzzed for his leader writer you cant publish this we own twenty per cent of corinium and tony baddingham owns twentyfive per cent of us go back and rewrite it corinium may not be perfect the leader writer retyped defiantly what company is but it has now reached a level of performance far beyond that which any newcomer could achieve in a few years corinium has a massive expansion programme it has won countless awards it has all the expertise it needs and it has cameron cook then he went out and got drunk cameron finally tracked down rupert at the house after hed voted sweetheart are you ok he said hows sledgehammer house of horror has tony had a seizure i hate you and i hate myself stormed cameron how dare janey lloydfoxe say coriniums drama was abysmal and that bloody bishop attacking the morals of four men went to mow that was tactless im sorry but if we dont knock you tonyll suspect something how did he take it fine said cameron very together very positive thats not what barney williams told me he said it really pulled the krug from under tonys feet and that he was quite hysterical all this expansive cripcrap about welcoming competition came much later in the day cameron wasnt interested look rupert im not sure im going to be any good as a double agent whats happened sebs got to trail you to find out who youre sleeping with rupert laughed hes going to have a very boring time then the only person im sleeping or likely to stay awake with is you are you sure camerons voice broke im so confused it all happened so fast i need to see you just to talk i need to fuck said rupert i want you so badly at this moment but itd be madness the press are still baying round weve got to be careful i dont think i can handle it yes you can youre very brave and strong thats what i adore about you youre very tired too take a couple of mogadon and sleep in and sustain yourself with the thought that one day in december well be awarded tickets on the one surviving gravy train i thought we were only interested in making good programmes said cameron disapprovingly oh well that too said rupert within a week the iba had provided the press with précis of all the applications and placed a copy of each application in their library so that the public could come and look at them immediately tony dispatched miss madden to the iba to transcribe venturers application in her neat shorthand going through the revolving doors she met ursula declans secretary on a similar mission im not supposed to talk to you said joyce nor i you said ursula both agreed however that much time could be saved if ursula posted joyce a copy of venturers application and joyce sent ursula a copy of coriniums then they could pretend they had transcribed and typed them themselves and pop over to harrods instead for a lunch of breaded plaice fruit salad and several glasses of sweet sherry before going to the cinema we mustnt discuss the franchise or ill get sacked said joyce but youve no idea how demented lord b was when he heard declan was bidding against him hes really out to get him now its a shame were on different sides i always liked declan he was such a nice man having read venturers application tony launched his counteroffensive it would be foolish to denigrate the competition he told the press expansively and then proceeded to do so he also spent a lot of time playing his staff off against each other having them in individually offering them large drinks and cigars in his most urbane and disarming manner then telling each one they were the one person he really relied on to spy on the rest pinned on the board was a new notice reiterating instant dismissal for any member of staff found having dealings with any of the venturer or midweek consortiums the bishop of cotchester was therefore rather bewildered when every time he walked down the high street or round the cathedral close and tried to pass the time of day with any of the eight hundred corinium staff they bolted like squirrels up the nearest tree the following sunday declan called a venturer meeting at the priory janey and billy couldnt make it nor could wesley emerson but wesley had vindicated himself by already taking twentyfive wickets and wearing the venturer tshirt on every possible occasion georgie seb and charles who was wearing a tin hat and brandishing a riot shield borrowed from wardrobe all turned up giggling hysterically in james verekers very distinctive paleblue porsche the silly bugger left it in the corinium car park and a second set of keys in his office said georgie were going to abandon it outside your house later this afternoon enid then ring up tony and tip him off hows it going said freddie tonys in a vilely twitchy mood said charles bugging everyones telephones youd better watch out declan if our chief engineer rolls up in a yellow van heavily disguised as a british telecom mechanic dont let him in it was such a mild day they all sat outside apple blossom and lilac were both out and wafting their sweet fragrance cow parsley frothed up to meet the trailing young green leaves and white candles of the horse chestnuts round the lawn the rushing stream was clogged with forgetmenots and marsh marigolds and although the bluebells were fading the wood was now lit up by the white flowers of the wild garlic it was definitely a day to be in love rupert turned up with cameron who was safe because tony had gone to rugborough to watch archie play cricket she and rupert had obviously just got out of bed their hair was still wet from the shower she sat on the lawn propped against him her hand on his thigh they looked lean glamorous and intensely separate great excitement was caused by the arrival of the rest of the venturer publicity material badges car stickers bookmarks peaked caps with adjustable straps at the back which had to be taken in to fit henry hampshires narrow stoats head but let out for dame enid and declan the pièce de résistance was the poster it was a blowup from the group photograph of taggie with gertrude on her knee both wearing venturer tshirts its fuckin gorgeous said freddie every garage mechanic will put it up in the service bay ill have some for the bar said bas and i for the close said the bishop both dame enid and professor graystock wanted several for the common room dirty old letch muttered rupert glaring at the professor ill keep mine under my pillow said seb in case tony drops in for coffee one evening only cameron had been scornful when rupert had showed the poster to her earlier its too fucking kitsch for words she snapped i thought you might like to have a look at coriniums rival offering said georgie unrolling a poster of sarah stratton cuddling a baby calf with a caption corinium cares underneath her tshirt had rather too many buttons undone corinium bares more likely said rupert dismissively venturer have definitely won the battle of the crumpet here let me carry that angel he went on leaping to his feet as taggie came out with a huge chocolate cake and a plate of cucumber sandwiches on a tray taggie couldnt meet his eyes nor did she say anything when she saw the poster it reminded her too poignantly of when shed still been happy when rupert had not yet rolled up with cameron after tea declan came to the serious bit for the next two months he told them while the iba are sifting through the applications before the public meetings begin in july our job is to get venturer across to the area we got off to an excellent start with such a dazzlingly flamboyant panel he grinned round at them publicity has been no problem now weve got to get out and meet the people who matter in the town halls the chambers of commerce the rotary clubs all round the area and show them were not just a bunch of dilettantes weve also got to cast our net wide to cover schools colleges churches young farmers job centres the police sports clubs political groups race relations officers etc etc we must let them know what we intend to do find out how we can help them and then sign them up as friends of venturer well collect a huge petition of names and organizations to send the iba but itll have far more effect if they can also be persuaded to write a private letter to lady gosling giving their support we must try to cover the entire area he went on i know youre all busy and its going to be a long hard slog and obviously none of the corinium moles or billy or harold can be seen to be doing anything ill help pleaded taggie please let me i can drive round the area delivering handouts and telling people how good you are how can she possibly explain to anyone why they should support venturer said cameron too loudly to rupert if she cant read the fucking application seeing taggie go crimson with mortification seb leapt to her defence put it on tape he said ill do it for you taggie if i cant go round the area canvassing its the least i can do seb was as good as his word over the next two days he not only put the most important points of the application on tape for her but also the answers she should give to any questions if theyre a leftie organization he explained say weve got professor graystock lord smith and your dad in the consortium if theyre tory plug freddie henry rupert and marti gluckstein if theyre sdp bandy dame enids name around if anyone starts grumbling about sex and violence he went on say weve got the bishop of cotchester and hes going to oversee all our programmes on the other hand if anyone says we havent got enough sex and violence say weve got rupert bas and wesley emerson in the consortium he coached her over and over again until her spiel was wordperfect taggie found him incredibly kind and patient i wish id been taught by people like you at school she said wistfully and so the hard grind started but as rupert was chronically busy and freddie was tied up with his electronics empire and declan was locked into his biography of yeats and both professors were frantically coaching their students for finals in the end most of the work fell to taggie with a car full of stickers badges and posters she drove round the vast area visiting everyone from trade unionists to youth leaders from mothers unions to arts councils taking in every imaginable pressure group begging them to sign her petition to write to the iba and best of all to come along and cheer venturer at the public meeting in july because of her beauty sweetness and passionate belief in her fathers and venturers cause she had surprising success sometimes she was joined by the bishop sometimes by dame enid which was great fun dame enid had a convertible and they drove through the glorious spring together with the roof down getting brown sucking lemon sherbets and calling an awful lot of people boring little farts after theyd safely got them signed up driving round with professor graystock was less fun he had a horrible habit of squeezing taggies bare legs when he made a point so she took to wearing trousers the third saturday in may however was a very bad day for taggie she was tired because shed been up very late doing a dinner party for valerie jones the night before as she was scheduled to tour the winchester area which she didnt know shed put directions to all the places she had to visit on tape but even so she got terribly lost and flustered on one of her calls shed got the sdp muddled up with the labour party and started plugging dame enid when she should have been pushing lord smith and professor graystock then shed called on a vile headmaster whod made her tremble because he reminded her of school how can venturer help your school personally she asked well get a pencil write it down he said bossily ill remember it stammered taggie write it down snapped the headmaster i cant taggie hung her head im dyslexic he was incredibly nice after that giving her a glass of sherry his eldest son whod been killed in northern ireland had been dyslexic and he got out a lot of photographs to show her it was half past nine and getting dark when taggie left and after ten before she managed to find her way to the gates of the local cricket club perhaps theyd all gone home but she could hear great whoops and catcalls coming from the pavilion and as she drew up outside moths were bashing against the lighted windows cricket taggie took a deep breath that meant she had to plug wesley emersons involvement and venturers entirely fresh approach to cricket coverage going through the door she quailed they were obviously having some allmale dinner she couldnt see the white tablecloth for glasses scores of hugeshouldered men with brickred faces and beer guts seemed to be grinning at her with unfocused lechery a tawny giant up at the top table fiddling with the microphone looked vaguely familiar im so sorry she stammered clutching her stickers posters and her petition ill come back some other time no come in sweetheart they all yelled a chunky dark youth rose to his feet and swayed unsteadily towards her if youre from the shalvation army im beyond shaving he said come back darling roared the rest as taggie backed out through the door a slightly older man who came up to taggies shoulders and who seemed less inebriated than the rest said he was the club secretary and asked if he could help i just wanted to tell you about venturer mumbled taggie and hoped you might sign our petition and put our stickers in your cars id much rather put you in my car said the chunky dark youth to roars of applause the club secretary then led her to the microphone and introduced her to the captain who had hard rather unpleasant blue eyes lady wants to tell us about television he said well go on then said the captain nastily the tawny giant smiled at taggie and sat down i just wanted to tell you about venturer television taggie began in her soft growling teddybear voice you probably know were ppitching for the corinium franchise we need your help in our campaign we want to know how we can help you give us a blow job lofty said a wag down the table to howls of laughter a bread roll sailed through the air just missing her taggie blushed even deeper but ploughed on strip strip strip strip intoned the captain banging on the table soon the entire room took up the cry shut up you meatheads yelled the tawny giant let her finish amazingly after that they did shut up and except for the occasional tarzan howl heard her out in silence i want you to know finally said taggie that venturer will be providing an entirely new approach to cricket coverage were very interested in cricket at all levels and er she froze for a second trying to remember and wesley emerson she brought out the name in triumph is a key member of our consortium and is specially interested in promoting cricket in schools so youll have some really good colts coming on in the future please support venturer thank you very much i suppose we can now get on with the speeches said the captain over the thunder of applause im so sorry taggie picked up the petition could you possibly sign this she asked the tawny giant whod been so kind to her of course he took the petition from her dyou want it signed to anyone no no just your name and the name of the cricket club thats a bit difficult lofty said the captain bitchily we dont play cricket you see but this is a cricket club said taggie aghast maybe it is darling but this is the winchley rugby club dinner and bill beaumont here he indicated the tawny giant is our guest of honour and is waiting to speak to us if youd be so kind as to bugger off grabbing the petition leaving the posters and the car stickers taggie fled sobbing into the night how could she have been so stupid she was absolutely no help to venturer at all her dyslexia always got worse when she was upset as a result she got desperately lost on the way home she couldnt read any of the unfamiliar names on the signposts and once it got really dark she was frightened to stop the car and ask strangers the way there were no stars or moonlight or street lamps to guide her along the country lanes she seemed to have been going round for hours and hours until at last she saw a sign she could recognize penscombe m gertrude was noisily delighted to see her but the trail of clothes in the hall and up the stairs told her that her parents had gone up somewhat precipitately to bed the débris of their dinner was still on the kitchen table one of the lids of the aga was up and aengus had knocked over a halffull bottle of whisky which was still dripping on to the flagstones oh god sighed taggie cant they ever do anything for themselves the cow parsley shed picked that morning was already shedding petals like scurf all over the welsh dresser nothing lasts she thought in despair across the valley ruperts house was almost blotted out by the trees there were no lights on he was probably tucked up in bed with cameron it was always when she was really tired that the longing became unbearable rupert in fact had spent the day at the cup final making the main speech at the official dinner afterwards despite horrific setbacks he was the first minister for sport whod tackled hooliganism head on and when he sat down they cheered him to the rooftops after the dinner was over however he beat a discreet retreat taking a bottle of brandy over to that other wembley stadium home of the horse of the year show where he persuaded an obliging groundsman with a couple of tenners to put on the lights sitting in the competitors stand drinking out of his bottle he proceeded hazily to relive his past glories as a show jumper and suddenly the huge arena seemed to be filled with coloured jumps and with the ghosts of all his great horses revenge rocky belgravia mayfair arcturus snakepit and even the cussed macaulay he could hear the sound of the bell the screams of the pony club the roar of applause even the voice of the commentator dudley diplock who always got the names wrong oh christ what was he to do putting his head in his hands he was overwhelmed with despair as he realized despite his political triumphs and the buzz of pitching for the franchise and stealing cameron from tony how hopelessly empty his life was now he hadnt got fat when hed given up show jumping or taken to drink except tonight or to boring other people with endless anecdotes about his sporting glories as so many other great athletes had but something had died inside him it was nearly midnight the government car was still waiting outside the groundsman wanted to lock up probably fallen asleep said sydney ruperts driver hes a devil for dropping off anywhere ill go and wake him but when sydney tapped him on the shoulder the face rupert raised was so stricken and haggard that sydney was prompted to ask if thered been a death in the family only myself muttered rupert chucking away the empty bottle and stumbling to his feet only myself taggie had just finished clearing up and feeding gertrude the corned beef hash which declan normally loved but had left halfeaten this evening when the doorbell rang gertrude ran out barking as loudly as she could with her mouth full taggie followed hastily kicking her mothers rather grubby bra and french knickers under the radiator for a second she thought she must be dreaming for there swaying in a dinner jacket clutching a red box was rupert hullo angel thought id catch up on the gossip is your father in yes but he and mummy have gone to bed im sorry i saw a light on thought he might be working late do you want a drink oh god suddenly she remembered aengus had knocked over the whisky ive had enough said rupert id love a cup of coffee his normally sleekedback blond hair had flopped over his forehead his black tie was crooked his blue eyes crossing taggie realized he was absolutely plastered you didnt drive down she said in horror no no syd dropped me off now whatever i do i mushnt lose this carefully he put his red box down on the kitchen table my red box my unread box i sometimes wonder if anyone would notice if i threw the whole lot in the thames where have you been said taggie putting the kettle on wondering if by some miracle he might have had a bustup with cameron to the cup final of course you were making a speech how did it go all right i suppose the speech that the department had written was so ghastly i tore it up and told a lot of blue stories instead i hope no one was there from corinium with a tape recorder and they liked it they seemed to they could afford to be kind its probably the last one ill make what dyou mean taggie put three spoonfuls of sugar into the blackest cup of coffee and put it down on the table in front of him thanks darling the pms announcing the election date as thursday th june at least i won a bet on it but youll win said taggie sitting down at the table beside him rupert shrugged im not sure we will the awful thing is i dont give a bugger im fed up with politics youll feel differently tomorrow said taggie at that moment gertrude strolled in looked beadily at rupert then to taggies amazement jumped on to his knee and gave his face a quick lick before settling down leaving white hairs all over his dinner jacket rupert stroked her and laughed there are some small victories left to me he said was cccameron with you taggie felt it would be better if they could talk about her openly no it was much too public every photographer would have picked us up anyway tonys in situ this weekend it must be awfully difficult for you both worse for her at least i dont have to sleep with tony i wish she wasnt so fucking insecure shes like a jack russell one spends ones time removing her from the target of her aggression usually oneself patrick said she had a terrible childhood said taggie he didnt give any details she added quickly just said shed really been through it what on earth am i doing defending her she wondered i dont believe all that junk about terrible childhoods said rupert ive had four stepmothers and five stepfathers you had declan and maud which is even worse taggie giggled were not screwed up said rupert that was debatable thought taggie rupert picked up the petition look at all these names his eyes ran down page after page christ youve been working hard it wasnt so good today said taggie then she told him about the rugger club rupert was absolutely furious the bastards he howled give me their names and ill get their ground ploughed up but what can you expect from a lot of rugger yobbos poor darling im so sorry it must have been awful he yawned without even putting his hand over his mouth showing a long pink tongue and teeth without a single stopping then he said why have you written l and r on the back of your hands blushing taggie shoved her hands under the table ill drive you home she said quickly as she started up the car the tape came on frantic with embarrassment she tried to tug it out of the machine but ruperts hand closed over hers like a vice leave it turn left at the a said taggies deep breathy voice then keep going for two miles then turn left just before the old mill pub then keep going till you come to a big barn turn right then left up a winding road winchley womens institute is at the top on the right pulling out the tape rupert looked up at the windscreen on which a large capital l and r were stuck on opposite sides you poor little duck he said softly the chestnut candles were shedding their white petals along his drive a couple of horses blinked in the gloom as taggie drew up in front of the house he said again you poor little duck taggie hung her head i cant mapread very well it takes me so long and signposts are difficult too because i dont know the words if i put it on tape it speeds everything up and weve got so much ground to cover before july rupert couldnt bear it what was it about taggie that so often brought a lump to his throat angel you cant go round on your own particularly not at night i dont always dame enids come with me and the bishop and professor graystock once or twice rupert shuddered thats worse than being alone enforced celibacy was not natural to rupert it was like asking a man who smoked sixty cigarettes a day only to smoke ten cigarettes one day a week denied cameron he was certainly not used to sleeping alone still very drunk he only just stopped himself taking taggie in his arms to comfort her and christ knows where that would have led to declan would take him apart and cameron would bolt straight back to tony getting out of the car however a brilliant idea struck him ill be travelling all round the area canvassing over the next month you can come with me and hand out venturer posters and stickers and paddle the venturer canoe at the same time we can even use the tory loudspeaker to plug venturer when no one from the partys listening is that allowed said taggie in awe politics is a dirty business said rupert blandly the socialists paid a lot of actors twentyfive pounds to dress up in shit order and pretend to be a dole queue for their election poster last time next morning caitlin rang up the priory wild with excitement gertrudes in the daily mail she looks so sweet whats she doing asked taggie wearing a venturer tshirt and an expression of absolute outrage shes sitting on your knee you look nice much better than that old tart sarah stratton oh goodness said taggie whats the piece about the headline says rival beauties weigh in for the battle of the box read caitlin theyve used the two posters of you and sarah will the blonde or the brunette pack the greater punch it starts then theres a lot of guff about sarah being paul strattons second wife and coriniums latest star presenter who pulls in three hundred fan letters a week then it goes on the dark horse or rather beauty in the race is agatha ohara yearold daughter of tv megastar declan ohara whos bidding to oust his exboss lord baddingham in the corinium franchise fight agatha runs her own business get you cooking for the great and famous but sadly she can no longer undertake dinner parties for her favourite client tony baddinghams wife monica in case state secrets slip out over the soufflé gosh said taggie in amazement where did they get all that from i hope lady b isnt cross how are you anyway all right fed up with revising can you send me some money and tell bloody mummy and daddy to write theyve been really busy with the franchise and things said taggie mummys never busy with anything said caitlin bitterly the long hard grind of getting venturers message across to the people who mattered continued throughout the long hot summer but things were much easier now for taggie several other papers reproduced the poster and as she toured the area people began to know all about venturer recognize her welcome her and even ask her to autograph the poster more important she spent much of may and june driving around with rupert on his campaign trail leaving him to canvass or to rally support for other southwest tory mps taggie nipped off to visit vicars youth clubs and chambers of commerce rather too often for tony baddingham or central offices liking the two campaigns merged rupert was not above urging people to support venturer on the tory loudspeaker or sticking venturer posters up on the van alongside those urging the public to vote conservative everywhere he and taggie went they handed out venturer publicity material and had great fun after dark driving round plastering the gateposts of corinium directors and even the corinium building itself with support venturer stickers to add to tonys apoplexy rupert conducted the entire campaign in a blue venturer tshirt and twice appeared similarly clad on cotswold roundup and even worse with huge support venturer posters on the tory party van behind him tony was quoted as saying the venturer tshirts had been chosen entirely by rupert to match his blue eyes and that no doubt the boy shading his forehead on the front symbolized all those gloucestershire husbands trying to see where rupert had hidden their wives rupert cracked back that everyone knew who the corinium ram was supposed to symbolize and so the mudslinging went on with the local press and radio stations uniformly backing corinium but the national and trade press having scrutinized the applications and the candidates universally agreeing that venturer had the more exciting programme plans dame enid wrote a battle song sung by maud called everything venture which to venturers relief didnt get into the charts on th june labour won the election by twenty seats with the sdp holding the balance of power paul stratton lost his seat rupert kept his he had in fact fought a brilliant campaign taggies presence seemed to soothe him so he was far less acerbic with bores and hecklers and as he was one of the only tories returned with a much increased majority central office had to stop grumbling about him using tory funds and equipment to promote venturer in an unprecedented move owen davies the new labour prime minister asked rupert whether he would like to stay on as minister for sport if the post was made nonpolitical rupert was deeply touched but refused he was fed up with swimming galas and pingpong matches and there was a big row brewing about players taking drugs at wimbledon which he was only too happy to hand on to his successor he was also immediately offered a job by the international olympics committee but refused that too for the moment knowing it would mean more buzzing round the world he wanted a breathing space to spend the rest of the summer at home concentrating on the yard seeing something of his children and putting in a lot of spade work with cameron who was getting increasingly uptight falling more and more in love with rupert she found it almost impossible to pander to tonys sexual needs and cope with the demanding job of programme controller at corinium while rupert was fighting the election hed been constantly hounded by the press baying for franchise gossip and trying to catch him out in some new affair so he and cameron had had to be doubly careful all this secrecys just like adultery darling said rupert on one of their few meetings very good training for when youre married that is the most cynical remark ive ever heard stormed cameron not at all the secret of a happy marriage is not getting found out how dyou know you didnt have a happy marriage thats because i was always getting found out as the election was over and tony was tied up all day in meetings in london she and rupert had arranged to meet at a hotel outside henley as they settled down to bloody marys and a splendid view of the thames a barge came chugging up stream two young girls in bikinis were sunbathing on deck cameron watched rupert run an expert eye over them now he had free time on his hands would she find it increasingly difficult to hold him all the same she was still not prepared to burn her boats with corinium until venturer had safely won the franchise and she had to confess all the secret meetings with rupert did give the affair a certain edge come on he said draining his bloody mary and picking up the keys of their hotel bedroom i want to indulge in some molemolesting but she who lives more lives than one more deaths than one must die next day in the corinium canteen daysee butler and deirdre kilpatrick took their cottage cheese and kiwifruit salads to a corner table and didnt notice cameron sitting next door at first there were the usual grumbles about bosses and crews but just as cameron had abandoned her shepherds pie halfeaten and started on her yoghurt deirdre said i dont usually read the scorpion but did you see that story that rupert campbellblacks having an affair with a cook cameron cook said daysee in amazement lord b wont like that not cameron cook a cook declan oharas daughter she does directors lunches and things shes seriously pretty well according to the scorpion shes been canvassing with rupert and now theyre absolutely inseparable looking down cameron saw she had squeezed her yoghurt so hard that it had spurted all over the table without attempting to clear up the mess she walked out of the canteen into cotchester high street and the nearest telephone box rupert was trying out one of his new very young horses over a row of fences in the field beyond the stables when the telephone suddenly rang in his pocket the horse nearly took off back to ireland even when hed pressed the answer button to silence the ringing it took all his strength to pull up the terrified animal all cameron could hear was a muffled thunder of hooves and expletives hullo rupert said finally have you seen the scorpion yes so what all about you and ms ohara that was yesterdays scorpion theyve linked me with mary whitehouse this morning cant you be fucking serious screamed cameron everyones talking about it good said rupert at least it keeps the heat off us then as cameron showed no signs of calming down he added darling theres nothing in it i promise you as taggie said in todays star ruperts old enough to be my father in fact hes a friend of my fathers doesnt mean a thing augustus john was old enough to be a lot of girls greatgrandfather that didnt stop him oh christ she screamed as her money ran out ill call you back in a minute please dont until youve cooled down said rupert i dont want both you and the horse having hysterics at the same time next time they met it took a great deal of sweettalking to win her round the next big event in the franchise battle was the public meeting held in cotchester town hall at the beginning of july chaired by members of the iba board it was supposed to give the general public the chance to air their grievances about existing programme content and quiz the rival applicants about their plans it also gave the iba the opportunity to observe the applicants in action and gauge the degree of local support in fact the audience consisted mostly of corinium venturer and midwest staff and their local supporters members of consortiums from other franchise areas who would soon go through the same ordeal picking up tips local councillors whose sole object was to persuade venturer or midwest that their borough was the perfect site for the new studios members of gay lib the womens movement and other pressure groups and a handful of the public only interested in gazing at declan rupert and wesley emerson muchneeded rain had been bucketing down all day but it stopped just before the meeting was due to start venturer arrived first as rupert had given them all a pep talk about being properly dressed declan had sulkily put on a suit and a tie and you can get out of jeans he had snapped in turn at taggie ive hardly seen your legs since you were born taggie having rifled through her wardrobe in despair had rushed into cheltenham and bought a beautiful violet dress with a scooped neckline a nippedin waist and flounced gypsy skirt newly washed her dark hair fluffed down to her shoulder blades as though shed beaten it with an egg whisk declan in somewhat unflattering amazement told her she looked absolutely gorgeous she was glad she did when she later found that sarah stratton cameron daysee and janey had all pulled out the stops to taggies delight she also found the audience packed with people whose support she had sought in her drives round the area local councillors race relations officers social workers ladies from the wi from as far afield as southampton oxford and stratford had turned up and now surged forward to shake her hand weve still got your lovely poster up weve written to the iba weve been following venturers programme with such interest they all said we thought wed come and cheer you on remember me said a gauntlooking man in a crumpled lightweight suit which had obviously just been unearthed from a trunk in the attic of course said taggie quite overwhelmed how wonderful of you to turn up it was the headmaster with the dyslexic son a diversion was caused when marti gluckstein whod never been to the country before tried to enter the hall wearing gumboots a waterproof deerstalker a riding mac and holding an umbrella over his head dont bring that thing in here its unlucky boomed dame edith come on marti ill buy you a stiff drink before we kick off said bas guiding marti back through the puddles over the road to the cotchester arms for a quick derobing sprinting after them rupert handed bas his hip flask can you fill this up with weak rum for wes his attention span will never last the course unlaced wesley having taken another five wickets that afternoon and having just been picked for the third test had been celebrating and was now busy signing autographs the next arrivals were three shiny redfaced stocky young men whod obviously been in the cotchester arms since opening time who strode up to taggie waving their tickets the shortest one who had hard blue eyes and crinkly hair thrust a melting box of chocolates into taggies hand hullo agatha he said bet you didnt expect us sorry we were a bit rowdy when you dropped in said the second thought wed come and give you a bit of support said the third it was the captain and two props from winchley rugger club tears filled taggies eyes as she hugged them all how sweet of you come and meet my father he adores rugger declan shook them all by the hand several times treat corinium like the welsh at twickenham he said and here they come a great theatrical hiss went up from the venturer camp as the corinium mafia trooped in they were led by tony very brown from ascot wearing a new darkpink and blue silk shirt a pink tie and a pink carnation in his buttonhole he managed to flash his teeth at everyone in the room except venturer he was followed by ginger johnson georgie baines whod obviously had a few to steady his nerves mike meadows head of sport charles fairburn seb burrows simon harris whod been allowed back in a consultancy capacity to impress the iba and whose straggly beard had turned quite white cyril peacock false teeth rattling sweating through his suit and cameron truculent in an elongated black tshirt which came five inches above her knees sarah stratton wearing a dress in virgin maryblue with a white puritan collar also to impress the iba brought up the rear with james vereker whose head was held high so more people could recognize him i fear the greeks when they come bearing presenters muttered declan whos chair james asked charles fairburn as the corinium contingent sat down in the front row dunno belongs to the town hall i should think said charles no said james impatiently whos chair ive just told you im asking you who is chairing the meeting oh comprehension dawned on charless round red face might be old mother goose which was everyones nickname for lady gosling but i wouldnt have thought shed have bothered to come this far cameron grabbed a seat at the end of the row by the window as far away from tony as possible all she could see was one of his beautifully polished black shoes rotating as if he were doing an ankleslimming exercise a sign that he was nervous the company in situ always got more flak at public meetings than those seeking to oust it tony frightened of ridicule knew he was in for a bumpy evening the entire corinium contingent studiously ignored venturer the committed from distaste the moles from embarrassment henry hampshire however whod been to a drinks party had no such reservations hello everyone he beamed as he came through the door hullo taggie darling youre looking beautiful hullo rupert then turning to the cringing corinium contingent boomed oh look theres charles georgie and cameron must go and say hello henree hissed rupert grabbing his arm and whispering in his ear youre not supposed to know theyre on our side what said henry loudly whats that how dyer mean not on our side course they are fortunately tony was talking to the archdeacon and didnt hear as rupert tried to explain henry looked as deflated as an english setter whos been told hes not going on a walk then cheered up when he saw daysee butler whos she she on our side no shes with corinium damn shame pretty girl like that and thats sarah stratton next to her isnt it shes a damn pretty girl too why isnt she on our side met her shooting at tonys and next moment henry had broken away from ruperts restraining hand and marched across the room to talk to sarah who introduced him to daysee just saying to rupert pretty girls like you should be on our side sarah giggled i dont think tonyd like that very much hows your springer spaniel how incredible you remembering that said henry now beaming down on the two girls like an english setter waving his plumy tail at two bitches what are you both doing afterwards bugger off henry snarled tony henree rupert dragged him off fortunately at that moment a diversion was provided by basil returning with marti quite soberly dressed now and janey lloydfoxe in a pink flyingsuit hullo rupert darling janey kissed him full on the mouth sorry im late rupert tugged up her zip to the bounds of decency saying for christs sake go and distract henry basil took rupert aside ive filled up the hip flask for wesley then dropping his voice he whispered those lovely lips just puckered up to meet yours were round my dick at eight oclock this morning what exploded rupert what did you say you heard said basil grinning how dare you thundered rupert shes married to my best friend course she is and very happily im just making sure she doesnt suffer from postnatal depression when billys away rupert might well have hit bas across the room if the iba three members of the board and various members of their staff hadnt trooped in and taken up their places on the platform we are honoured charles whispered to james old mother goose is in the chair the iba must regard the outcome as by no means certain then if shes come all this way to have a look i cant think why youre looking so cheerful said james fretfully venturers bound to offer me a job if they get the franchise i mean i am cotswold roundup but as theyve got the bishop to handle religious programmes i cant see them wanting you who are those deadbeats over there janey asked bas the midwest consortium said bas cant think theyll bother us much rupert having at last persuaded henry to stop chatting up daysee and sit down collapsed into a seat between taggie and declan how the hell am i going to keep this lot under control until december he said taggie giggled henrys certainly fallen for daysee let me not to the marriage of true mindlessness admit impediments said declan the audience were now occupying every seat in the body of the hall with corinium spread out along the front row and cameron at the far end by the window next to her at rightangles on a single row of chairs sat the midwest consortium who looked a pretty motheaten bunch facing them also on a single row of chairs forming a square with the platform sat venturer lady gosling decided cameron looked more like a hedgehog than a goose a mrs tiggywinkle with small twinkling intelligent eyes a long thin nose a pointed chin and rather wild grey hair held down on either side by tortoiseshell slides she wore no makeup and despite the warmth of the evening was smothered in several shawls over her olivegreen wool dress the cosy exterior however was deceptive and hid a rapier mind as head of an oxford college gwendolyn gosling had taught russian her fellow dons were not altogether joking when they nicknamed her khruschev there was shrewdness beneath the amiability and the twinkling eyes like the stars gave off little warmth for a hideous moment at the beginning of the meeting it looked as though no one was going to ask any questions then a man in spectacles got up and grumbled about the reception in gloucester coriniums chief engineer got up to answer him and the stupor produced by engineers at public meetings allowed everyone time to collect their thoughts more straightforward complaints then followed from local councillors who had not yet been interviewed by james on cotswold roundup that coverage in their area was pitiful mrs makepiece jamess daily then rose to her feet and disclaiming any connection with corinium said cotswold roundup was the best programme on telly and why couldnt it be on seven days a week this was greeted by bellows of rubbish and offside from taggies rugger players one of the corinium shop stewards whod just screwed a twothousandpound rise out of tony for all his members as well as a fat bribe for himself shouted from the back that he wouldnt trust declan oharas mob further than he could throw them his claim that industrial relations at corinium were second to none however were greeted by cries of sidown from all over the hall as corinium fork out immediately whatever the unions demand and most of the technicians earn more than the prime minister i should think industrial relations are second to none yelled bas to loud cheers from the venturer supporters the chairman of chipping sodburys wi then rose to her feet and said in a ringing voice that her institute was sick to the teeth of news about cotchester and nothing about chipping sodbury remembering miss corinium television rupert caught declans eye shes forgotten miss chipping sodburys tits he whispered across taggie both men started to shake with laughter until quelled by a cold look from lady gosling tony rose to reply i can assure you madam he said smoothly that by an extraordinary coincidence cotswold roundup is due to visit chipping sodbury later this week are we said james to sarah looking startled in fact tony went on warmly we have super plans for the entire cotswold area youve been here eight years why havent we seen any of them bellowed taggies headmaster more cheers all round were counterpointed by snores from mrs makepiece ive studied both venturers and coriniums applications at the public library went on taggies headmaster and venturers programme plans seem infinitely more imaginative what i would like to ask lord baddingham is how much have his grandiose new plans for a multimillionpound studio for slots for every possible minority group for cultural improvement and for spectacular entertainment been spawned by editorial inspiration or desire to hang on to his very lucrative franchise tony was about to rise and shout back over the deafening cheers but james was too quick for him james vereker cotswold roundup he announced getting to his feet and turning sideways so he could be recognized both by the platform and the floor whos a pretty boy then catcalled taggies rugger captain as anchorman of cotswold roundup said james i know i speak for each and everyone of us at corinium from tony baddingham downward when i say that coriniums ethos can be summed up in two words bloody terrible said taggies rugger captain to screams of laughter two little words james ploughed on corinium cares the only fing tony baddingham cares abart is making a fast buck shouted freddie to more deafening cheers mrs makepiece snored so loudly that she woke herself up lets get up a partition she said loudly cameron knew she ought to stand up and defend corinium but she didnt relish getting ripped apart by declan she was saved by the womeninbroadcasting lobby who all had moustaches and who complained that there werent enough women in any of the consortiums lady gosling nodded in agreement and made notes the meeting droned on wesley emerson had had a hard day in the field no one but rupert and bas realized that each time his noble head nodded onto his right buttonhole he was taking a long suck of rum from a straw to ruperts hip flask in his breast pocket outside in cotchester park the lime trees were in flower their sweet delicate scent stronger after the downpour drifted in through the open window cameron watched the house martins swooping after insects flashing their white bellies the tennis courts were packed with people playing vigorous wimbledoninspired tennis in a week or so theyd revert to their usual patball she glanced surreptitiously across at rupert who was sitting next to that drip taggie who whatever rupert said to the contrary had a thumping crush on him nothing except for the occasional yawn not even a glance in her direction betrayed the fact that rupert had left her bed at six oclock that morning cameron wondered sometimes if shed imagined the whole thing she was so deep in thought she had to be nudged in the ribs by seb to answer a question from a pale girl from gay lib as to whether the lesbian shepherdess whod appeared briefly in the last series of four men went to mow would appear in the next one as cameron sat down the chairman from chipping sodburys wi returned to the attack nothing that comes from corinium tv she said is truly regional even dorothy dove speaks with a london accent another rabblerouser again heavily bunged by tony then rose to his feet while were on the subject of accents he sneered in the first week of july four people were brutally butchered by the ira do we really want an irishman namely one declan ohara bearing in mind his leftwing attitudes and the subversive nature of many of his programmes to be the chief executive of an english television company out of order screamed the venturer contingent offside put it in straight roared the rugger players declan whod gone white was just about to answer careful whispered rupert id like the speaker to withdraw that remark said lady gosling frostily next question please the cleanup television campaign headed by the archdeacon then started slamming sex and violence followed by the bishop of cotchester who said how concerned he was about his flock and that he would be working with venturer to reduce not only sex and violence but the very widespread blasphemy on television he was just getting into his stride when henry hampshires ancient gardener staggered to his feet i like to go to bed very early he grumbled i do wish corinium wouldnt put all those sexy fillums on so late at night because i and the missus can never stay awake to watch them everyone roared with laughter including lady gosling who then clapped her hands and said it was with great regret that she had to bring this very stimulating meeting to a close as they were running out of time they would end she added with a sevenminute sales pitch from each of the three contenders tony rose first deliberately turning his back on venturer and talking half to the platform and half to the audience good evening he began suavely i am the chief executive of er he glanced down at his notes and everyone laughed corinium television we have noted he went on the very perceptive and instructive points raised tonight and although we dont agree with all of them anyone who would like a further answer to his or indeed her he smiled broadly question please write to me personally wanker muttered rupert under his breath he folded his arms belligerently and with the hand that was hidden fought a violent urge to caress the side of taggies left breast which swelled so seductively beneath her violet dress she looked so ravishing this evening and shed done so well to get all those strange but incredibly influential people to the meeting firmly clenching his hand away from taggie he looked across at cameron who was gazing moodily into space with a kind of deadpan terrorist truculence she reminded him of the girl grooms he used to pull in the old days he desperately wanted a fuck but he wouldnt get cameron tonight tony overexcited by the meeting would no doubt take advantage of that release rupert was finding the enforced celibacy more and more trying and bloody hell what was bas doing pulling janey it seemed as though he was the only person in the world behaving himself having finished a rousing spiel about coriniums long and honourable record tony was now paying tribute to the thriving creative community he had the privilege to lead we are aware ladies and gentlemen that there is life west of harrods our hearts are not in dallas nor is our hq in london our company is run by people from the region who have a special place in the cotswolds and indeed in west country life corinium is its own man here we will be biased we will fight for the west we are pledged to serve the whole community above all we care he sat down to moderate cheers then it was midwests turn a fat man with straggly white hair staggered to his feet and then took ages to find his notes thats obviously the geography master who never found his way to london whispered rupert to taggie i am deeply honoured began the fat man name name yelled the audience my name is cedric bonnington he mumbled i hope to be chairman of midwest television well dont be bashful speak up shouted tonys rabblerouser sadly cedric didnt in a low mumble he laboriously read out that he was very interested in all the fascinating points that had been made by the floor i cannot reveal who our backers are he droned on but very substantial funds will be available should the very talented group whose names i also cannot divulge at this stage win the franchise hell probably get it said georgie baines to seb burrows what about women yelled the womeninbroadcasting lobby cedric consulted his notes the companys programme controller whose name he also couldnt divulge he said would be a woman of the widest experience madame cyn yelled rupert mary whitehouse said tonys shop steward the audience waited for more exciting revelations and when none materialized egged on by the corinium consortium whod all got to their feet started to drift away it was almost dark outside the pubs beckoned no ones going to stay and listen to daddy said taggie in anguish and as declan got up to speak people were swarming out into the high street id like first to answer the speaker who questioned the right of an irishman to run an english television company he began softly as much right perhaps as that great irishman the duke of wellington to command a british army he spoke without notes as people poured back into the hall again the deep soft husky voice carried easily round the hall i am proud to be irish he went on and to echo the words of another great irish patriot irwin cobb i too had an ancestor who was out with the pikes in he was captured by the english and tried for treason they hanged him by the neck until he was dead but his soul goes marching on transmitting to his descendants of whom i am proud to be one the desire to fight against tyranny whenever i come across it i also love and honour british television it is the best in the world thats why i and so many of my countrymen eamonn andrews terry wogan robert kee frank delaney dave allen henry kelly patrick dromgoole gloria hunniford are over here learning from it and i hope contributing to it but we still go on fighting tyranny and oppression whenever we find it i found it in the few months i worked for corinium thats why i walked out and why with my english friends he turned and smiled briefly at the venturer consortium i have put in a bid to oust lord baddingham he then proceeded to carve up tony and tear coriniums boring sycophantic programmes to shreds only at the end did be briefly outline how venturer would be different how they would truly both represent the area and foster local talent i would like all great artists of the future to be able to say they had their first chance at venturer the audience stood up and cheered him for nearly three minutes stonyfaced tony strode out of the hall cameron tried to follow him but trapped by the crowd she watched rupert declan taggie and the rest of venturer plus their supporters jubilantly swanning off to the bar sinister for drinks on the house rupert never gave her a backward glance sick with desire she wondered how much longer she could go on playing a double game although the cotchester news reported the meeting a rousing success for corinium and published numerous rigged readers letters of support it was generally agreed that venturer had won that round after his humiliation at the public meeting tony stepped up his campaign to discredit venturer flipping through a list of their names the following morning he decided his newsroom had been singularly inept in uncovering any dirt the bishop of cotchester it seemed had neither fiddled with the collection nor with any of his more cherubic choir boys dame enid had never straddled anything more exciting than her cello professor graystock was recognized as an old goat but no more so than the average don on the other hand henry hampshire was plainly capable of being led astray by daysee butler perhaps she ought to be sent off to interview him nothing as yet on rupert except an alleged walkout with taggie ohara which tony didnt believe she was far too gormless all the same it might be a good idea to allow her to cook for monica again primed with a few latenight brandies she might become indiscreet about the moles who were joining venturer from other companies in addition monica had been so outraged because tonyd banished taggie from the house that shed refused to give any more dinner parties and tony did need to entertain some of those boring but influential local dignitaries who might otherwise drift towards venturer he added taggies name to the list but that didnt bring him any nearer rupert he made a note to track down beattie johnson whod been writing ruperts memoirs when rupert booted her out last year there must be some grievances to fan there freddie jones tony decided blackly was venturers greatest asset he was so solid so dependable so popular so hugely successful after such a lowly start which appealed to a crusading streak in the iba ha thought tony cherchez la femme he buzzed miss madden will you tell james vereker to come up james was not happy even through his layers of egotism he realized hed made a fool of himself at the public meeting he was still miffed because no one had asked him to join their consortium and opening a new edition of whos who in television that morning hed discovered two columns devoted to declan and not even a reference to himself james brushed his hair and put on a tie he hoped tony wasnt still miffed about the public meeting tony however was at his most amiable steering james towards the squashy green sofa when usually he made male staff perch on hardbacked chairs telling madden they didnt want to be disturbed offering james a large drink james normally only drank perrier at lunchtime both for his figure and to keep his wits about him for his programme but now he felt it fitting to accept a large bells just to show that he and tony were both males capable of holding their liquor ive got a very special mission for you james said tony half an hour later james returned to his office in a state of euphoria to find sarah exuding anais anais and expectancy are we lunching darling probably said james ive got to make a call when he rang valerie jones she was absolutely delaighted to hear from him oh dont mention that silly franchise if one cant talk to ones friends she said i was going to phone you and your er lovely wife she always forgot lizzies name to remind you that were opening green lawns to the public on saturday and we hoped youd both pop in it is looking really rather lovely at the moment what an extraordinary coincidence said james i was phoning to say of course weve got your opening in our diary and we were hoping we might come and film it for cotswold roundup were only covering the best gardens tony and monicas of course and the duchesss at badminton hullo hullo are you still there shes fainted said sarah of course i am shrieked valerie could i come for a recce this afternoon will freddie be there hes away good said james wolfishly give me a chance to get you on my own valeries tinkle of laughter showed she was not displeased what are you playing at asked sarah as james hung up tony wants a spy in the venturer camp hes chosen me because he thinks im the one guy who can charm secrets out of valerie the spy who came in from the cold frame giggled sarah are you going to stick poison umbrellas into valeries garden gnomes it was a muggy still afternoon frenchgrey sky on the horizon deepening to forgetmenot blue overhead the tall seeding grasses in the hayfields were turning gold against the deep summer greens of the trees at the bottom of the joness drive was a large sign saying garden open on th july to be televised on cotswold roundup come and meet james vereker in person proceeds to the red cross smirking james drove up a black tarmac drive as wide as the m long before he reached the house he was almost blinded by a blaze of colour every flowerbed was packed with serried clashing ranks of french marigolds yellow calceolaria royalblue cineraria flamingred geraniums billiardball pink zinnias and mauve asters as he drew up in front of the house a lorry was unloading plants having denuded every garden centre for miles around valerie was now hiring four hundred scarlet salvias and three hundred yellow begonias from rentagarden round the corner came a sweating youth pushing a wheelbarrow crammed with scarlet and mauve petunias next moment valerie came screaming after him brandishing a small fork what are you doing spicer putting them on the rubbish heap maam theyre meant to be planted in the wheelbarrow you idiot cant you recognize creative gardening when you see it take it straight back to the patio then she saw handsome james getting out of his paleblue porsche and her face softened james she said holding out both her hands its been too long youre looking lovely mousie said james taking her hands and holding them also a little too long and sos your garden its a miracle if it is said valerie our darling old gardener dropped dead last week wasnt it maddening and were having to make do with jobbing gardeners like that idiot no not that way she screamed as another jobbing gardener was carted across the lawn slap into a bed of mauve dahlias by an outofcontrol computerized mower when shed finished berating that gardener valerie swept james round to the patio and asked him if hed rather have iced coffee first or wander round james said hed rather have iced coffee and sat down very quickly on the hammock seat for fear of being concussed by halfadozen hanging baskets weighed down by every colour of petunia but although he coyly patted the seat beside him once valerie had poured the iced coffee she insisted on prowling the patio deadheading petunias and showing off her slim figure in the floral pink shirtwaister whats happened to your poor legs asked james noticing several marks on the back of her calves bites sighed valerie i seem fatally attractive to midges and to men mousie valerie smiled she wasnt going to tell james that henry hampshire had promised to take freddie and her flyfishing and that shed spent all day practising on the lawn and catching the backs of her legs with the hooks tony sent his special love so did monica lied james oh we miss them both sighed valerie i do wish freddied never got caught up in this stupid franchise its all so pointless dyou get roped into meetings asked james sipping his coffee and wincing because the orange marigolds and magenta petunias in a nearby tub reminded him rather too forcibly of ginger johnsons face no no said valerie but the socializing side of its quite fun henry took us to ascot we had cocktails with him on the way home i was shocked by the number of weeds in his seat but they have made rather lovely use of white buddleia in the walled garden with such interesting programme plans venturer must have roped in some pretty considerable production people said james idly i hope you like our border of massed glads over there said valerie bring your coffee and lets have a wander having admired every petal every gnome every plastic venus de milo james still hadnt learned anything more about venturer freddie used to pop into corinium a lot he said as they passed a dolphin regurgitating blue loo into a pond does he still see any of his old friends there i bet theyre knockedout by this lovely garden it is lovely isnt it said valerie smugly but i wish we could grow rhodos in gloucestershire are venturer recruiting their staff locally asked james who else have they signed up but valerie was off leaping across a stream to tug up some mares tail i know tonys keeping an eye out for moles at corinium fished james as valerie joined him again so are we said valerie moles are freddies biggest worry perhaps we should compare notes mousie said james as they were now hidden from the house by a row of yellow conifers he slid his hand around her waist it was nice and trim well freddies been putting down moleban everywhere said valerie but im still terrified im going to wake up tomorrow and find mole hills all over the lawn james gave up mousie was far too preoccupied with her plot to think about plotting at the moment he arranged that he and the crew would arrive at about threethirty and asked if she could keep any venturer tshirts and posters to a minimum tony feels youre so special and that a lovely garden is above personalities but we really cant use the footage on roundup if its full of plugs for venturer as james was filming gardens all saturday afternoon lizzie had planned to work on her book then feeling rather old and driedup she rubbed a lot of skinfood into her face only to realize shed forgotten her neck which is supposed to betray your age most so she rubbed the excess skinfood down into it then she remembered you were supposed never to rub skinfood downwards as it made your face droop would her life have been different she wondered if shed always remembered to rub skinfood upwards would james have stayed faithful to her unwisely knowing it would hurt her she snooped around in jamess drawers and found a ravishing photograph of sarah stratton under his boxer shorts feeling utterly miserable she thought how nice it would be to see freddie jones again abandoning any thought of work she decided to go along to valeries opening as she drove through green lawnss electric gates she noticed a large support venturer sticker on the huge sign announcing that james and corinium television would be present that afternoon lizzie felt so off james that she couldnt even be bothered to peel the sticker off in the car park she found rupert unashamedly sticking more venturer stickers on everyones windscreens darling he kissed her divided as we are by our rival consortiums we shouldnt consort but do lets go round together i need a good laugh mrs joness new rockery is like the polar bear pit at the zoo shes been training blow lamps on her roses all night and twentyfourhour fluorescent lighting in the greenhouse is forcing out the christmas roses lizzie laughed you cant bring that dog she said as rupert let beaver out of his car particularly if hes not on a lead mrs jones will have a coronary good said rupert locking the car look how well hes trained he went on as beaver lifted his leg on a cohort of salmonpink petunias do you think valerie drills her flowers every morning its just like a park said lizzie as they walked towards the house unfair to parks said rupert on the edge of the lawn a stall was selling clothes from valeries boutique with the markup going to the red cross models sweating in valeries autumn range wandered aimlessly round fanning themselves with price tags there was not a venturer plug in sight what a lot of people said rupert judging by the mob on the lawn your husbands holding court lets go the other way isnt that hell he pointed to a crescentshaped flower bed crammed with fuchsias and french marigolds that looked as if it had been dug out by a pastry cutter lady valerie of vulgarias gift for selfpublicity is only equalled by her appalling taste as they proceeded giggling down the crazy pavement they could hear valerie graciously dispensing advice on the other side of the yellow conifer hedge how dyou manage to grow such whopping glads asked a neighbour admiringly i feed them with growmore said valerie shes obviously been feeding her children the same thing muttered rupert as poor fat sharon blushing at the sight of rupert waddled past them hullo bishop they could now hear valerie screaming how good of you to look in im about to be interviewed on tv but youll find fredfred in the grounds itd be grounds for divorce if i was married to her the only person not allowed into valeries opening is fredfred the frigid bitch said rupert grabbing lizzies arm come on buck up lets look at the pond i dont want to get trapped with the bishop i thought the bishop was on your side said lizzie panting after him he is and a godawful bore too hes mad about taggie so he keeps dropping in at the priory unannounced and finding maud and declan having a bonk or hurling plates at one another which bearing in mind the bishops views on sex and violence doesnt go down very well i thought it was you having a walkout with taggie said lizzie slyly as they passed hybrid teas massed in clashing colours above totally weedless beds rupert raised his eyes to heaven would that i were shes so sweet why arent you then declan would do his nut and shes too young never deterred you in the past ah but its franchise year rupert bent down to press a venturer sticker on the bare belly of a plastic venus de milo and were all having to behave ourselves as im sure your husband knows why have you got that rash on your hands he asked more gently as lizzie whipped off the same sticker the doctor says its stressrelated said lizzie bitterly mistressrelated more likely suddenly she could bear it no longer james is having an affair with sarah stratton i shouldnt have told you that youll leak it to private eye and discredit corinium even further why dont you leave him hes such a cunt said rupert putting another sticker as a figleaf over a cherub and dragging lizzie on before she could remove it helen didnt leave you lizzie paused to examine the pond which was a mass of scarlet and yellow water lilies god isnt this hell she did in the end said rupert besides im not a cunt they had reached the end of the garden now cornfields the colour of french mustard and blueygreen woods stretched to the horizon on the right a red tractor chugged back and forth anxious to get the hay baled and away before tonights promised rain heaven to see some decent country said rupert do you think cuntricide means murdering ones mistress lizzie laughed you do cheer me up i wish someone would murder sarah leaving the pond they wandered back to the house and walking under a weeping willow went slap into freddie he looked very tired and only nodded at them politely until he realized who they were then he jumped up and down with pleasure giving lizzie a big hug ullo rupe ullo lizzie ow are you love you look grite better not let valerie see beaver rupe shes a bit uptight been deadeading petunias in her sleep all night fink shes abart to deadead me ive had this bleedin lot up to ere lets go inside and ave a drink vals doing her tv interview finks the sun shines out of james verekers arse oh sorry love he squeezed lizzies arm i quite forgot he was your usband james thinks the same said rupert spiking another sticker on a garden gnomes fishing rod im sure hes only here because he wants to worm secrets out of your wife freddie although watching the way freddie and lizzie were looking at each other rupert reflected that lizzie with all her warmth and sympathy would be far more skilled at getting venturers secrets out of freddie cameron had expected to spend friday night with tony but hed decided to fly to france a day early leaving her with an unexpected free evening unable to get in touch with rupert shed taken two mogadon slept alone and very well for the first time in months and woke feeling rested and happy as she wasnt due to meet rupert until the evening she decided to wander along and see how james was getting on filming gardens she didnt stay long at the falconry the garden was too wonderful and she didnt like such tangible proof of monicas skills she was surprised tony hadnt stayed at home to crow by comparison valeries garden was utterly dreadful but had certainly attracted large crowds particularly round the television crew fighting her way through until she was blocked by a large bed of purple and salmonpink gladioli cameron saw james up the other end interviewing valerie and quickly stifled a scream of laughter valerie was dressed for ascot in a yellow and white shirtwaister and a huge buttercupyellow hat trimmed with yellow roses but was totally unaware that someone had stuck a support venturer sticker on her bottom looking across the sea of mauve and salmonpink cameron caught her breath in joy because there beside freddie and lizzie vereker also trying very hard not to laugh was rupert as if drawn by her longing he looked up and gave a brief grin of surprise before instantly resuming his normal deadpan expression cotswold roundupgreen lawnstake four said the second assistant snapping the clapper board one only has to look at your flower beds valerie said james as the camera panned slowly in on the sea of mauve and salmonpink to appreciate what a truly caring gardener you are tell us your secret well james began valerie then her little laugh turned to a squawk of rage as the normally welltrained beaver suddenly seeing cameron whod spent a great deal of time sharing his masters bed recently crashed across the bed of gladioli snapping and flattening most of them and throwing himself on her in total ecstasy just for a few seconds to a crescendo of valeries squawks cameron and rupert were caught on camera absolutely collapsing with laughter before rupert sharply called beaver off as she drove home rather tight later in the evening with james lizzie said camerons the one you and tony should be watching im certain shes having an affair with rupert dont be ridiculous snapped james cameron only cares about corinium on sunday night on his way back from france where hed made great strides in acquiring a stake in french television tony dropped in at the office to see how the falconry garden looked on video the cameraman had left the tape on his desk loosening his tie pouring himself a large drink tony put the tape in the machine and lay back on his squashy sofa to watch he was enchanted with the results monica had really come up trumps this year how right hed been not to leave her for cameron when one considered the ghastly shambles paul stratton had made of his career after hed left winifred having played back the falconry footage twice more he decided to have a good laugh and ran the tape on to have a look at valeries garden having located it he played the tape back five times particularly freezing the frame on the last ten seconds then he walked out of the building not even bothering to lock the drinks cupboard or his office door and drove straight over to hamilton terrace cameron was not there letting himself in he searched systematically through the house in the bedroom wastepaper basket he found what he was looking for a pile of tiny tornup scraps of paper no one tore paper up that small unless they wanted to hide something and it was an added precaution as cameron wasnt expecting to see him until tomorrow night and by that time the daily would have emptied the basket it took him a long time to put the pieces together because his hands were trembling so much but finally he was able to read the words venturer meeting henrys house sunday cameron got home about midnight sated and reeling from rupert she hadnt even bothered to shower afterwards as she wanted to keep the sweat and smell of him on and inside her body as long as possible dropping her briefcase in the hall she wandered into the drawingroom the bulb that turned on by the door had blown so in the faint light from the street lamps she groped her way across the room to turn on the light by her desk the next minute she leapt in terror as a hand shot out grabbing her leg just above the knee burglars was her first panicstricken thought then as a light flashed on she saw tony crouched on the sofa like a venomous toad what are you doing skulking in the dark she stammered what are you doing said tony in a voice that utterly froze her blood going to a venturer meeting at henry hampshires house today camerons gasp of horror gave it all away iii had a tipoff i went along to spy i just hung around outside the gates trying to see who was going in who gave you the tipoff camerons mind raced i overheard people talking in the bar sinister in the next booth you bloody liar hissed tony and how long has rupert been stuffing you he isnt gibbered cameron wincing as his hand tightened on her leg hes a bastard the last person id shack up with tony tugged her towards him burying his nose briefly in her groin you reek of him you fucking whore and how come his dog knows you so well its all on tape sweetheart and the next moment hed hit her across the room she fell with a crash catching her head on the bookshelf then he was on her again picking her up by her shirt and smashing his left fist into her face this time she crashed back into a small table knocking over a vase of buddleia hes going to kill me she thought as he lunged at her again kicking her in the ribs until she groaned for mercy yet at the same time another part of her terrorcrazed mind was thinking that she had to get out of there before he got his hands on her briefcase which contained all her notes on the meeting and even worse the names of the corinium moles as he dragged her to her feet and hit her again she managed to grab a chair and swinging it round caught him on the side of the head narrowly missing his eye with one of the legs it gave her a breathing space grabbing the vase of buddleia that was now leaking onto the floor she hurled it at him and stumbled out of the room banging the door behind her gathering up her briefcase she just managed to put up the double catch on the front door locking him in as she slammed it by the time hed managed to clamber out of the drawingroom window shed started up the lotus and was on her way to ruperts putting her hand up to her head where shed hit the bookcase she could feel her hair sticky with blood looking in the driving mirror she saw more blood pouring out of her right eye and nearly blacked out she had got to make it to ruperts with the briefcase or tony would catch up and kill her somehow in a daze of pain and sickness constantly wiping the blood out of her eyes she managed to reach penscombe ruperts front door was unlocked the hall was dimly lit tripping over the dogs she screamed for him angel how nice have you forgotten something he said coming down the stairs wearing only a pair of jeans and reading horse and hound then she found and switched on the main hall light and he saw her properly her right eye had closed up now and her upper lip was cut and terribly swollen her face hair and shirt were drenched in blood my christ he said appalled what the fuck happened tony found out my poor little baby he raced down the stairs drawing her into his arms feeling the stickiness of her bloodsoaked hair and the frantic racing of her heart the bastard where is he lets get you a doctor then im going round to kill him im ok mumbled cameron he had provocation youd probably have done the same thing under the circs the next moment she passed out when she regained consciousness she was in ruperts double bed dressed in one of his shirts with most of the blood washed off a doctor benson who was rather smooth and glamorous had rolled up in his dinner jacket reeking of brandy and gold spot and after examining her assured her that her face wouldnt be marked having patched her up saying she might have to have stitches in her head in the morning he gave her a shot to sedate her i dont want my head shaved she muttered when rupert came back your hairs so short its practically shaved already said rupert sitting down on the bed and taking her hands im so desperately sorry angel i got you into it it took all camerons pleading to stop him going straight round to hamilton terrace or even to the falconry to beat tony to a pulp think of the adverse publicity itll only trivialize venturers bid nothing trivial about those bruises said rupert touching her swollen lip with his finger how did he rumble us saw the video of valeries opening and beavers crashlanding in the gladioli and somehow he found out i was at the venturer meeting yesterday very very gently rupert was stroking her cheek despite the pain in almost every part of her body she had never felt safer or closer to him hell knows no fury like a womanizer scorned he said lightly well he had to know some time youd better move in here cameron utterly despised women who cried in front of men it was taking an unfair advantage and outraged her feminist principles but once the tears started spilling out of her bruised eyes she found she couldnt stop them is it such a ghastly thought said rupert taking her in his arms no no its the nicest thought in the world i guess i dont want to railroad you youre not youve no idea how i hated letting you go back every time particularly to tony im sick of never seeing you dont worry about your brilliant career ill look after you and tomorrow as a symbol of your new dependence im going to chuck that beastly briefcase into the lake cameron managed a weak smile you had better take the papers out first or tonyll be dropping by using the truth drug on your duck she was drowsy with dope now so he laid her back on the pillow ill try not to get under your feet she muttered i ddo love you so so much i know you do rupert got to his feet now go to sleep please dont go she was suddenly frantic you will sleep here wont you course i will ill be back in a minute im just going to take the dogs out wandering mindlessly through the garden rupert found himself on the edge of the lake breathing in the soapy smell of the meadowsweet listening to the frogs croaking there were no stars and glancing across the valley he saw taggies turret was in darkness valerie jones was absolutely furious when nothing about her opening appeared on cotswold roundup but not nearly as angry as declan when rupert told him what had happened what the fock were you doing taking a dog you cant control to valeries opening i control my dogs a bloody sight better than you were not talking about me think of the adverse publicity there wont be any i refrained from beating tony to a pulp declan sighed and how the hell is tony going to explain the overnight loss of his mistress and programme controller to his staff someones going to leak the story pirated tapes of beavers flatfoot through the gladioli are no doubt circulating the network already and it wont be long before they reach the press and the iba it was terribly funny i wish youd seen valeries face its not funny thundered declan i suppose youre used to having your character blackened but it wont do venturer any good the iba dont like this kind of thing he couldnt understand how rupert could be so unrattled by such a catastrophe he supposed hed always lived in the eye of the storm i dont know who comes out worse declan went on you setting out coldly and deliberately to seduce cameron so we had a mole on our side or tony who beat her up a lot of people will feel tony was justified he was only acting in the heat of the moment oh come off it snapped rupert talk about making mountains out of moles the story we leak is that cameron and i were attracted to each other when we met when you interviewed me in february we resisted it because we were on opposing sides for as long as we could but now shes moved in with me and venturer has the best head of drama in the country christ were both free agents its tony whos the adulterer and the mistressbasher he wont want to make a big thing of it because of monica and the iba a story was duly leaked and appeared in the mail the next day that cameron cook had changed sides moved in with rupert and that tony was devastated to lose his star producer no reference was made to cameron being tonys mistress or of her being beaten up by him rumour however was rife and by wednesday corinium had leaked a counterstory accusing venturer of poaching and coldblooded enticement and putting the blame firmly on rupert a lonely single woman nearing thirty worried about missing the marital boat is in a particularly vulnerable position tony was quoted as saying rupert was furious all we have to do is give a photograph of camerons bruises to the press dont be so bloody stupid said declan crushingly youve no proof tony did it and not you it isnt as though youve exactly got a blameless reputation when it comes to beating up tony once he had cooled down was absolutely shattered by camerons defection hed had no idea how much both he and corinium had come to depend on her both as an inspiration and a sparring partner discovering through his spies that rupert would be in london opening a new sports stadium on thursday tony drove over to penscombe to see her surrounded by ruperts pack of dogs with mrs bodkin in the kitchen and mr bodkin strimming the long grass round the lake cameron felt safe to let him in dressed in an orange bikini she still looked as though shed just done fifteen rounds with barry mcguigan tony followed her out to the pool which sparkled brilliant turquoise in the sunshine and was no longer filled with leaves it killed him to see her in this beautiful opulent setting stretched out oiled on one of ruperts reclining chairs guarded by ruperts lurcher blue who lay by her feet panting but growling every time tony approached immediately tony begged her to come back telling her for the first time how much he loved her and when that had no effect offering to leave monica and marry her he didnt even lose his temper when she told him to bugger off your jobs open for you to come back whenever you want it and here are the keys to hamilton terrace he threw them on to the table the house may belong to corinium but its still yours when you need it come and get your clothes whenever you want to i shouldnt have beaten you up but i love you and i just saw red just like you did the last time i came home late after spending the day with patrick said cameron get out tony predictably couldnt remain nice for long you know its only a matter of time until rupert ditches you was his parting shot five days five weeks he may even keep you five months until venturer finally dont get the franchise then hell kick you out like all the rest and youll come running back to me cameron didnt believe tony would leave monica particularly during the franchise year but at least it now meant she could pick up her clothes her books and much more important her tapes and prizes from hamilton terrace she also felt privately that it was nice to have tony as a bolthole in case rupert started playing her up rupert in fact couldnt have been more angelic those first few days fussing over her seeing she didnt get too tired ensuring mrs bodkin made her delicious food which cameron privately thought contained far too much seasoning and fats making love to her with surprising gentleness and subtlety so he didnt crush her bruised ribs or her battered face the weather was beautiful too long hot days followed by short sweet nights cameron was happy to sleep and read and sunbathe and explore ruperts woods and fields with the dogs gradually as the black eye and the swelling on her lips disappeared she felt she was healing inside and out the only drawback was mr and mrs bodkin shadowy polite running ruperts life like clockwork but always there in the background cameron wanted rupert on her own she was not used to servants she wanted to wander round the house naked and make love in the kitchen if she felt like it she was also inclined to treat mr and mrs bodkin like corinium minions rapping out orders snapping at slowness and even more at ignorance even rupert famous for his caprice and short fuse with staff had to pull her up repeatedly taggie ohara increases her vocabulary by learning a new word every day you could start off with please and thank you any reference to taggie sent cameron through the roof so the second week after she moved in determined to prove to rupert that she could cook and run a house much better than taggie she persuaded rupert to give mr and mrs bodkin a few days off im better she insisted i want to look after you im going to cook you some decent food youre getting far too much cholesterol do i look as though its harming me said rupert who was eating white bread and dripping sprinkled with salt as he sat immersed in the scorpion no but its futile to abuse a magnificent constitution itll catch up with you and why dont you try to read the guardian occasionally instead of that trash because it uses much too long words and makes snide remarks about my party said rupert but objective criticisms valuable for chrissake not to me i only like people who think im perfect id better get mr and mrs bodkin back for the weekend the children are coming on saturday they make a hell of a lot of work oh dont said cameron suddenly excited lets look after them ourselves well have picnics and barbecues and all muck in itll be so much fun like many insecure people cameron was much easier to live with when she was down after shed been beaten up it was her intense vulnerability that had appealed to rupert wanting to protect her hed asked her to move in but as she got better her natural aggression and stridency started to reassert itself the day before the children were due cameron decided to make a big paella for dinner the rest could be heated up for them the following day discovering in the middle shed forgotten to get any saffron or squid she dispatched rupert to the village shop im sure they wont stock them grumbled rupert who wanted to read horse and hound the kitchen wireless was blaring out dame enids latest tone poem the new statesman and the times literary supplement lay on the kitchen table all giving rupert an unpleasant feeling of déjà vu it was too much like helen all over again well drive into stroud then snapped cameron shed forgotten what a rat race paella was to make but she was determined to cook better than taggie and get some parmesan as well she shouted after him the village shop had recently been converted into a tiny supermarket with shelves all round the walls and a partition also with shelves on both sides running parallel to the counter if the ubiquitous mrs makepiece who did for lizzie and valerie and one morning a week for maud now hadnt been holding forth so noisily and indignantly at the head of the queue rupert would never have slid into the shop unobserved picking up a red wire basket he chucked in some jaffa cakes because the children liked them and a tin of corned beef because he liked it he couldnt find any squid but he supposed a tin of pilchards in tomato sauce would do as well a squid pro quo as he moved round to the spice shelf mrs makepiece encouraged by a chorus of clicking tongues raised her voice declan and er ladyship have pushed off on some second honeymoon in the lake district leaving her all on her own rupert stiffened gazing unseeingly at rows of paprika dill and cayenne all alone in that uge ouse went on mrs makepiece and we all know its aunted well alf the lights fused so taggie went to the fuse box and read the instructions all wrong shes disconnected you know the poor lamb and she blew all the fuses and had to shiver all night in the dark with only gertrude thats her little dog for company despite the baking heat of the day rupert had gone absolutely cold taggie might have killed herself fiddling about with that fuse box she was crying her heart out this morning when i come in said mrs makepiece egged on by the row of shocked faces at first she wouldnt tell me what was the matter then i made us a nice cup of tea and it came out theyd all forgotten her birthday rupert was so enraged he dropped the basket and walked straight out of the shop with the pilchards which he had forgotten to chalk up the moment he got home he rang ursula where the fuck are maud and declan windermere give me their number i promised not to they dont want to be disturbed this is a patchup operation declans been devoting too much time to his biography they forgot taggies birthday oh my god and you should have bloody well reminded them give me the number declan and maud were out when he rang he left a message for declan to ring him saying it was about the franchise and very urgent then he rang taggie happy birthday darling cameron and i are going to take you out to dinner no i dont want any buts well pick you up about eight he was still sweating with horror at the thought of the poor little duck all alone in that big house in the dark with all those winding stairs and long passages bloody maud and declan he howled as he went into the kitchen what on earth have they done now dont turn it off its vivaldi protested cameron did you get the squid then as rupert handed her the pilchards these wont do dumbass and wheres the parmesan and the saffron they forgot taggies birthday said rupert bleakly well thats not such a big thing then seeing the rage on ruperts face havent you forgotten your kids birthdays no yes i suppose so but helen always remembers when he told cameron what had happened and that they were taking taggie out to dinner she hit the roof but it was our last night on our own this was to be a celebration i was cooking specially for us therell be plenty of time for that in the future the telephone rang it was declan fuelled by indignation and also because declan had been so censorious about him and cameron rupert let him have it you fucking hypocrite always banging on about tyranny and exploitation the worst case ive seen is going on under your roof what the fock are you talking about taggie she works like a slave for the bloody lot of you and all you can do is leave her alone in a huge house with the fuses blown and then forget her birthday oh my christ said declan appalled have we really you get on the telephone the moment i ring off and say how sorry you are we ought to come back no cameron and ill look after her tonight you come home first thing tomorrow and bring her a decent present not a crappy book of wordsworths poems she cant read god i feel terrible said declan now what was this urgent thing about the franchise that was it said rupert furiously if she hadnt worked her ass off trailing around the area rounding up names for your bloody franchise we wouldnt be ahead in the race now crashing down the telephone he poured himself a huge whisky he was absolutely shaking with rage well well well said cameron chucking the wooden spoon on to the drying rice and switching off the hot plate what gives with taggie ohara she doesnt deserve parents like that shes only a baby nineteen today to be exact well beyond the age of consent she knew it was madness to bitch but she couldnt help herself youve got a very soft spot or is it a hard spot for her havent you are you nurturing some secret passion what i want to know is where does that put me rupert looked her up and down there wasnt a trace of tenderness in his face now youre living here arent you at the moment lets get one thing straight he said softly if you want to go on living here stop being such a fucking bitch draining his whisky he picked up his car keys im going to get her a present you can ring up the white elephant in painswick and book a table for three at nine oclock henry hampshires springer spaniel had recently had six puppies theyd all gone to new homes except the runt whose paw broken when someone stepped on it was still in plaster the puppy had a freckled face a bright pink mouth crossed eyes that looked as though hed been on the booze all night and a stumpy tail which agitated his whole body hes a great character said henry you can have him for a hundred pounds with a broken paw dont be ridiculous plaster comes off next week then hell be as right as rain wont stop him going all day in the field fifty said rupert youve got to be joking the others went for two hundred and fifty each mother was best of breed at crufts father won every field trial in the country fifty said rupert hell always be slightly lame oh all right said henry i had lunch with daysee butler today well you shouldnt snapped rupert youre bound to give away trade secrets well you still havent laid on joanna lumley grumbled henry daysee said tonys flown to la to search for a new programme controller when rupert got back to penscombe cameron had washed her hair and changed into the clinging kingfisherblue dress shed worn to get her award in madrid it had slits to sunburnt midthigh on both sides she looked apprehensive very beautiful and came straight up and put her arms round ruperts neck i was jealous im sorry he breathed in fracas the dry bitter sexy scent she always wore it made his senses reel im sorry too he said i overreacted but i feel so sorry for her under the blue dress he could feel camerons nipples stiffening glancing at the kitchen clock he saw that it was a quarter to eight we havent got time itd muss you up you have said cameron dropping to her knees she unzipped his flies this was one skill she knew she was better at than taggie ohara a battered darkgreen gti was parked outside the priory as they drove up the front door was open the hall was filled with clothes books and suitcases perhaps she wont want to come out to dinner murmured cameron hopefully course she will said rupert it was debatable who got the worse shock cameron or rupert when they went into the kitchen and found taggie sobbing in the arms of a tall blackhaired incredibly beautiful young man the only difference was that cameron instantly recognized patrick whereas rupert did not patrick looked round still with his arms round taggie well he said icily taggie glanced up gave a gasp then tugging herself away from patrick blindly snatched at some kitchen roll frantically wiping her eyes and blowing her nose im sorry she mumbled hullo rupert hullo cameron how are you she was amazed to see rupert glaring at patrick with such hostility perhaps he resented him as camerons ex i dont think youve met my brother patrick have you she said quickly your brother instantly the hostility was gone i didnt twig it was your party on new years eve wasnt it how did your finals go perfectly all right said patrick shortly turning back to taggie rupert dumped two bottles of dom perignon on the table beside patricks white carrier bag of duty free happy birthday angel theyre just out of the fridge open them he added to patrick totally unaware of the look of utter loathing that patrick was shooting in his direction oh hell thought cameron poor patrick taggie must have told him about me moving in with rupert cutting short taggies stammering thanks for the champagne rupert seized her hand and led her out to the car come and see your proper present you ddont have to bother stammered taggie in the hall im having a lovely birthday mummy and daddy have just rung theyre bringing my present back tomorrow afternoon they couldnt pick it up until today and patrick brought me back the most gorgeous arran sweater hes just got back he had so much stuff to bring after three years she was rattling now on the verge of tears again sweetheart whats the matter im absolutely fine she said how could she possibly explain to him that the blown fuses the night in the dark and the forgotten birthday were mere irrelevancies that it was cameron finally moving in with him that had brought the world down round her ears she knew he couldnt ever be serious about someone as stupid and unsophisticated as she but as theyd gone round the country together theyd become friends and now shed never see him again without cameron you were all on your own last night in the dark he said who told you mrs makepiece told the whole village shop it was my fault i read the directions on the fuse box wrong she tried to smile i seemed to spend the whole night pushing poor gertrude round the house in front of me things seem to creak so much if youre in the dark rupert took her hands look next time something awful happens will you promise to ring me thats what im across the valley for it crucifies me to think of you all by yourself and frightened like that she wouldnt look at him all he could see was her reddened swollen eyelids reluctantly he let her go outside the puppy with its speckled paws on the car ledge was grinning out through the open window oh how adorable breathed taggie whats he done to his paw its nearly better hes your birthday present i was going to buy you a guard dog but i got sidetracked taggie was in ecstasy no one had ever given her anything so lovely gertrude will be very jealous to begin with warned rupert as the puppy rushed off on to the lawn quartering frantically pursuing various cat and dog smells youll have to make a lot of fuss of her he noticed taggie was still wearing jeans and an old torn redandwhitestriped shirt of declans arent you going to change weve booked a table for nine patrick can come too ive never met him properly taggie blushed its terribly kind of you but were fine on our own dont be silly im not having you cooking on your birthday patrick and i havent seen each other for ages youve got the rest of the summer hes going abroad tomorrow he er he yes said rupert pulling her down beside him on to the old bench on the side of the lawn taggie blushed even more deeply he adores cameron you see and hes absolutely dddevastated about her moving in with you ah said rupert taggie was frantically peeling paint off the bench as the puppy bounded back to them she gathered him up cuddling him for comfort patrick could accept her having an affair with tony because he thought she was doing it for her career bbut youre different why said rupert suddenly anxious to know the answer taggie buried her crimson face in the puppys ginger ears because one wouldnt need any incentive is that your word for the day no she shook her head frantically any incentive to move in with you inside cameron was gazing at patrick hes grown up she thought hes much tougher and more detached and less vulnerable how did you really get on in your finals got a first have they told you no but i know he got a packet of marlboros out of the dutyfree bag and lit himself a cigarette without offering her one as the match flared she could see the bitterness in his face i gather youve just become our nextdoor neighbour he said arent you going to wish me joy what joy hell only make you miserable christ youve got awful taste in men he added irritably tony was a disgusting thug this man he couldnt bring himself to say ruperts name is like a foxhound cant you understand you cant domesticate him hell always be hunting for something new its in his blood hell get bored with you in a few weeks and if he doesnt youll get bored with him hes the most ghastly philistine never read a book in his life hes streetwise that expression always seems to me a euphemism for someone with extremely shady morals which means hell dump you sooner or later and hell smash your career tony at least encouraged that youre just jealous not any more said patrick wearily i am ashes where once i was fire hes very funny youll like him when you get to know him im not going to give myself the chance im going abroad tomorrow cameron was put out she liked talking to patrick now they werent hamstrung by tonys jealousy shed hoped he might grow into a friend and that his admiration like tonys would act as a spur to rupert where are you going australia to work on a sheep farm im not hanging round for the rest of the year seeing you all scrapping over the franchise and watching your relationship with that bastard selfdestruct he isnt all bastard look how kind hes been to taggie cameron was fishing now hes totally fucked her up camerons throat went dry has he tried anything nothing according to tag just swans in in his bloody droit de seigneur lord bountiful fashion bombarding her with presents silver necklaces fabergé eggs fabergé eggs said cameron appalled oh taggie didnt know that it was he brought her that back from madrid i dont know whats on offer today a monet perhaps or a henry moore a puppy said cameron in a frozen voice this is it the next moment aengus shot into the kitchen tail fluffed out like a lavatory brush growling ferociously and took refuge under the kitchen dresser the puppy frolicked after him trying to join him under the dresser then let out a piercing shriek as aengus caught him with a punishing right hook on his pink nose instantly gertrude bustled in the personification of outrage the puppy bounced up to her then let out another shriek as gertrude bit him sharply on the ear oh christ said patrick not content with disrupting humans rupert has to disrupt animals as well for christs sake open one of those bottles said cameron i dont want a drink said patrick sulkily youll need it weve come to take you out to dinner well were not coming we dont want any of your fucking charity poor little ohara kids eating their hearts out lets throw them a few crumbs of comfort a black lock of hair had fallen over his forehead a muscle was going in the beautiful pale right cheek his eyes were as dark and forbidding as the depths of the huge cedar outside the window please dont hate me so much cameron was amazed to find herself pleading i really need a friend to talk to they both jumped as the telephone rang it was caitlin who was staying with a friend in newbury ringing to wish taggie many happy returns by the time they had finished talking rupert and cameron had left how did you get rid of them asked taggie i told them both to fuck off and that we didnt need their charity said patrick opening one of ruperts bottles at least we can now get drunk at their expense cameron and rupert had a disastrous dinner at the white elephant after that rupert was outraged at being thrown out by patrick arrogant little fucker just like his father i thought you adored his father not when hes playing god or neglecting his children you certainly arent neglecting one of them silver necklaces fabergé eggs handicapped puppies singularly appropriate in a franchise year oh shut up the row continued until they got to bed when rupert maddened cameron most of all by falling asleep when she was in midharangue she woke next morning feeling suicidal to find rupert gone wondering if he were already collecting his children she went downstairs found the paella gathering flies on the oven and chucked it out there was a chicken in the fridge she supposed shed better roast it for lunch dispiritedly she peeled some potatoes put them on to parboil then started to make a french dressing there wasnt any dill if she sent rupert off to the village shop hed come back with nutmeg outside the sun was shining through the mist like a dogs identity disk cameron longed to go out to the pool and swim off her hangover until last night with the bodkins away she had at last been able to enjoy a marvellously sybaritic few days with rupert swimming and sunbathing naked brazenly tantalizing him away from whatever he was doing she had even galloped bareback down the valley at twilight one night with no clothes on until rupert had caught up with her pulled her off the horse and pulled her in the meadowsweet cameron had halfhoped that taggie on a latenight walk with gertrude might have caught them at it and realized that at last rupert had found someone with a sex drive equal to his own but last nights row had ruined all that and now with the kids around thered be no more nude frollicking this weekend she jumped as the dogs barked and the front door banged cameron yelled rupert as he sauntered into the kitchen blithe as a skylark as though thered been no row at all cameron frantically stirred the french dressing were out of dill she said dildos hardly need one of those with me around im sorry i dont give you presents he went on kissing the back of her neck vainly i thought my presence was enough which hand will you have both said cameron sulkily telepathic said rupert uncurling his fingers glittering on each palm was a diamond earring a twoinchlong chandelier lit by little diamonds instead of crystals cameron was speechless incredulously she ripped out the gold hoops she normally wore and hooked on the diamonds running to the kitchen mirror rubbing away the steam with her sleeve to have a look the earrings hung halfway down her slender neck throwing rainbows of light on the lean tense jawline illuminating and softening the truculent hostile little face next minute ruperts reflection appeared beside hers like them in answer she turned kissing him with a fury and passion hed never known in her cupping her face with his hands he felt the tears sliding into his fingers very gently he unhooked the earrings shame to take them off so soon but i must have you before i pick up the children by the time theyd finished the potatoes were too soft to roast so cameron mashed them instead groggy with love she waited to love ruperts children at half past one trailing barking dogs tabitha erupted into the kitchen her cheeks were flushed her eyes bright with excitement she was clutching a huge box of chocolates mrs bodkin mrs bodkin she slithered to a halt in front of cameron wheres mrs b away for the weekend daddy never told us are you the temp well not too temporary i hope said cameron smiling you must be tabitha well im not marcus at nine tabitha was as blonde and as effortlessly elegant as rupert she stared at cameron with the wary blue eyes of a stray kitten she was followed by marcus who at eleven was very thin with very dark red hair huge surprised yellow eyes and pale delicate freckled features he looked like a fawn liable to bolt at any minute none of the photographs all over the house had captured their beauty nor the way their totally different looks complimented each other you must be marcus then said cameron i hope youre both hungry theres roast chicken for lunch not yet said tabitha grabbing an apple out of the fruit bowl im going down to the stables marcus smiled shyly and apologetically ive got a letter from my mother for mrs bodkin id better give it to you the chocolates were for her perhaps youd like his voice trailed off no no said cameron leave them for her helens writing was very vassar dear mrs b she had written i hope your arthritis is better and the kids wont make too much work marcuss medication is in his suitcase please see he takes it if he gets uptight i enclose a list of their clothes could you tick them off before they come home they lost so much last time and can you see tabitha learns her vocabulary and that both do half an hours piano practice and say their prayers at night i also enclose stats of their reports can you give them to mr cb yours sincerely helen gordon christ shes formal and a bornagain too thought cameron then she smiled at marcus is daddy on the way hes gone to the yard can i do anything tell him and tabitha lunchll be ready in ten minutes putting on the cabbage and removing the chicken from the baking dish cameron started to make the gravy and at the same time read the kids reports tabs was perfectly frightful except for sport marcuss was brilliant he returned to the kitchen looking apprehensive theyre trying out some new pony for tab daddy said would half past two be ok then quailing at camerons expression of fury he said quickly if you dont mind ill go and unpack how thought cameron furiously can i possibly keep up taggie ohara standards when i get fucked about like this then she remembered the diamond earrings and the fact that rupert hadnt seen the kids for a few weeks and decided not to make a fuss in fact they were back in forty minutes im starving said tab heading straight for the larder i thought you said lunch was ready she came out tearing open a packet of crisps with her teeth dont eat that itll spoil your lunch said cameron ignoring her tab sat down at the table with pony magazine rupert came in with a large vodka and tonic for cameron hullo darling cameron noticed how tabitha looked up eyes narrowed at the endearment sorry were late geoffrey gardener brought the pony over specially i wanted tab to try him any good were going to keep him over the weekend hes called biscuit said tabitha here are the kids reports and a letter from helen said cameron as rupert started to carve i only eat breast said tab when rupert handed her a leg well give it to marcus then said rupert who was reading the reports at the same time cameron opened her mouth and shut it again she noticed marcus was very nervous around his father and that while rupert hardly glanced at marcuss report he spent ages reading tabithas tabitha must learn not to be so competitive at netball what the fuck do they mean by that he said furiously you cant be too competitive at games i should be in the netball team next term boasted tab and im easily the youngest i dont want any she added to cameron snatching her plate away so a large dollop of mashed potato fell on the table camerons lips tightened as she scooped it up and put it on ruperts plate or any cabbage or salad you must have veggies im sure you do at home this is home tabithas blueeyed stare was as arrogant as ruperts isnt it daddy this is home she repeated to rupert who was still reading the headmistresss report of course it is angel he said kissing her marcuss report is excellent said cameron warmly ninetyfive per cent for latin thats almost indecent said rupert with an edge to his voice then he read on marcus has made very good progress in geography as he has only attended half the classes what were you doing during the other half going to strip clubs marcus flushed the pollen count was very high i was off sick quite a lot of days i wish i had asthma and could bunkoff school said tab feeding the rest of her chicken to a slavering beaver rupert having finished the reports was now immersed in the racing pages of the times theres a horse called venturer in the threethirty he said to cameron we must have a bet put a pound on each way for me said tab were doing a project on snakes next term you could start off by interviewing tony baddingham said rupert picking up the telephone now heres a chance to help tabitha and win her confidence thought cameron you could start off with adam and eve she said helping herself to salad the projects about snakes not sex said tab rudely eve got tempted by the snake stupid said marcus thats why they left the garden of eden its a jolly good idea he added kindly to cameron my projects about real snakes snapped tab getting up from the table and rummaging in her squashy bag she produced a photograph which she handed to rupert as he came off the telephone this is the pony malise bought me shes brilliant at crosscountry because she wont stop dyou mean youve already got a pony asked cameron shocked yes shes called dollop the trollop and she shakes hooves for a polo then why is daddy buying you another one tabitha looked at cameron as though she were crackers because i need at least two if im going on the junior circuit next summer i can cant i daddy your mothers not crazy about the idea unless your school work picks up said rupert who was still frowning at the photograph that ponys too short in front tabitha had learned to be manipulative to play off the rivalry between her father and stepfather malise and mummy dont want me to enter for the pony club mounted games at wembley even if im picked she announced slyly because ill miss a week of school dont be bloody silly said rupert angrily ill have a few sharp words with your mother whod like fruit salad said cameron as she cleared away the first course not me said tab is there any ice cream in the freezer cameron had spent a long time that morning peeling grapes if you dont like fruit salad im afraid youll have to go without she said sharply then ill have another packet of crisps said tab i can come over every weekend this summer daddy except the last week in august which is pony club camp good said rupert oh please no thought cameron she was sure it was only out of kindness that marcus had a second helping of fruit salad fortunately spirits were raised when venturer won by three lengths which meant that rupert and tabitha were richer by three hundred pounds and eight pounds respectively can we go into stroud and spend it tabitha climbed on to ruperts knee the kitten again but this time tactile and adoring christ no not on a saturday afternoon can we watch amityville i tonight no way said cameron it doesnt start until ten and itll give you nightmares for months when we dont have to get up next morning mummy always lets us watch latenight films lied tab balls said rupert if its that frightening youre not watching it can we go into stroud and get a james bond video then persisted tab and i need some pink hair spray for a punk party next week ill take you if you like conceded cameron the journey to stroud was the most successful part of the weekend the roof of the lotus was down and although marcus went white tab thoroughly approved of camerons driving this is a nice car and you go much faster than mummy can i have an ice cream may i you may if you promise to eat your supper on the way back however tabitha smiled sweetly at cameron you havent got a husband have you why dont you get one id like to said cameron thinking longingly of rupert but not my daddy hissed tabitha it is absolutely ludicrous said cameron to rupert as later they listened to tabitha sulkily crucifying beethovens minuet in g on the drawingroom baby grand this is a saturday during the vacation and shes got to learn her vocabulary helen is petrified the children will inherit my lack of brains marcus is clearly superbright said cameron hes such a sweet sensitive kid takes after his mother snapped rupert tab takes after me my reports were much worse than hers she doesnt strike me as being dumb said cameron just unmotivated she looks ok said rupert coldly and she rides like a dream what else matters supper was decidedly scratchy tab ostentatiously gave all her shepherds pie to beaver afterwards rupert packed both children off upstairs to watch james bond cameron was reading the guardian in the drawingroom and feeling absolutely shattered how the hell did mothers cope day in and day out when piercing screams rent the air the next minute marcus had run into the room waving the remote control he had difficulty breathing i dont think tab should watch this video its called for your eyes only but its not james bond you got it didnt you said rupert unhelpfully a second later tab came storming in and tried to grab the remote control when marcus held it above his head she went for him kicking his shins and giving him a karate chop in the stomach which doubled him up stop it shouted rupert pulling her off its a lovely film screamed tabitha its all about ladies licking each other id better come and have a look said rupert he returned grinning marcus was right its a blue film about lesbians he threw the video on the sofa beside cameron we must have a watch later she was wearing a sleeveless tshirt and he slid his hands inside caressing her armpits then feeling for her breasts it was ridiculous the way he could turn her to jello i dont fancy your bedroom without a lock on it she said the only safe place with this mob around is the john more shrieks issued from upstairs followed by a crash on the terrace outside going out through the french windows rupert found the remote control with all its entrails spilling out cameron stormed upstairs shed been looking forward to watching dido and aeneas on channel four later and now theyd be stuck with bbc why did you chuck that out of the window she yelled at tab i know it was you marcus wont let me watch amityville sobbed tab i hate him i hate him rupert put her to bed screaming cameron was relieved at only having to deal with marcuss asthma attack im sorry about tab he murmured as she finally tucked him in surely she doesnt behave like this at home of course she doesnt both malise and mum are quite strict so when she comes here she sort of runs wild and she and daddy love each other so much he added wistfully he loves you too said cameron giving him a kiss down the passage cameron found rupert talking to tab who was tucked up in bed with paddington bear gloomily transvestite in the family christening robes you really ought to be asleep tab she said marcus says mummy puts your lights out at nine marcus is a bloody sneak said tabitha yawning have you said your prayers ok tab rolled out of bed dear god she prayed loudly please bless daddy mummy marcus dollop and beaver and please give me biscuit if you think thats right god then her fingers opened a fraction she could see cameron still hovering on the landing hopeful of a mention and please god make mummy and daddy get married again so i can come and live at penscombe for always make me a good girl amen cameron walked back to ruperts bedroom quivering with rage rupert thought it was very funny isnt she awful she asked me earlier why i didnt sell my double bed as i didnt need it any more as marcus predicted tab had terrible nightmares and ended up in ruperts bed turned on by the blue movie rupert and cameron waited until she was asleep and then went downstairs and barricaded themselves into the diningroom ive never screwed anyone in here before said rupert should we put mats down in case we scorch the table in fact twelve feet of polished mahogany is not the ideal surface on which to make love straddling rupert her knees aching cameron took a long time she was just capitulating to pleasure when a bright red face as apoplectic as any mr barrett of wimpole street appeared through the hatch what thundered tabitha are you doing to my daddy im trying to keep him warm replied cameron through gritted teeth things went from bad to worse the next day rupert went off to see his constituency secretary tab vanished to the stables and despite cameron sending repeated messages didnt return for lunch grimly setting out to collect her cameron found tabitha watched by an idling trio of grooms jumping the new pony which ground to a halt each time it came up to a large wall this pony dont jump yelled tabitha think of something really nasty before takeoff and then give him a good whack advised one of the grooms tab rode towards the wall with great determination im going to think of cameron she howled bringing her whip down on biscuits quarters the grooms screamed with laughter and then cheered as biscuit cleared the wall by a foot tabitha leapt off the pony cuddling him and stuffing him with pony nuts good boy good boy lunch tabitha said cameron icily even tabitha looked faintly sheepish and ran on ahead back to the house there are a million children in england living with replacement parents in fact one in seven is a stepchild thought cameron furiously as she stalked back to the house they cant all be awful just fantasy youre doing research for a documentary on the incoming stepmother she told herself wheres daddy demanded tab as cameron went into the kitchen not coming back till later this afternoon i dont want any lunch till he gets back sit down ordered cameron i will if you sit down first said tab with a giggle not looking behind her cameron collapsed heavily on to a whoopee cushion which tab had slipped on to her chair and which let out a succession of noisy farts tab screamed with laughter even marcus grinned for cameron the noise was too embarrassingly reminiscent of her encounter with their father on the balcony of her madrid hotel you bloody children stop winding me up dont speak to us like that said tab coldly youre not our mother cameron walked out of the kitchen and went and swam twenty lengths in the pool to work off her rage going upstairs she discovered tabitha must have changed at least four times that day and used the carpet of ruperts bedroom as a dirty clothes basket tab she bellowed yes tab appeared from the television room eating a mars bar pick up your clothes ok mrs bodkin picks them up mrs bodkin is not here pick them up bloody shant cameron moved towards her dont you touch me hissed tab her little face a mask of spite because of child molesters like you im learning karate at school and clenching her fist in a blackpower salute she shot under camerons arm downstairs and back to the stables a blinding headache nudged camerons skull what was the name of that silent order charles fairburn disappeared to the day the franchise applications went in she took a valium and went down to the kitchen where she found marcus trying to clear up lunch he had put the roasting pan undrained in the sink so the grease floated thick and yellow on the top of the water im sorry about tab he mumbled you make up for it cameron said hugging him its not all her fault said marcus fairly shes used to daddys total attention when shes here and mrs bodkin fussing over her she looked after tab when she was a baby you see when tab says she wants lunch shes given it and if she doesnt like it when it arrives that doesnt matter much either shes just not used to a stranger saying do this dont do that cameron gazed at the sea of fat feeling reproved im sorry it isnt your fault said marcus busily sloshing water all over the surfaces as he wiped them down with a dripping dishcloth im not around kids that much how dyou relate to malise ok hes strict but hes fair hes very old his grandchildren are older than me would you like your parents to get married again marcus went green no absolutely not tab would oh tab gets on much better with daddy than i do said marcus bitterly and if she was here she could ride all the time as rupert probably wouldnt have eaten at lunchtime cameron decided to make him a nice dinner just the two of them the kids could go to bed early marcus chatted to her while she cooked and when shed finished offered to play the piano for her he was just playing a chopin impromptu quite magically when tab charged in with wham full blast on the wireless turn it off said cameron sharply why should i turn it off yelled marcus but he stopped playing and shut the piano immediately tab grinned and turned off the wireless ive never been so bored in my life she said moodily camerons suggestion that she could unload the dishwasher was met once again with the cold blue stare im starving whats for supper spaghetti hoops yuk whats that cooking in the oven boeuf provençal my favourite thing and there are kiwi fruits in the larder thats also my favourite thing as you havent eaten anything ive cooked for you yet said cameron coolly youre going to have spaghetti hoops cooked by mr heinz and then youre going to bed early i want to spend some time with your father alone rupert came home around half past seven and amazed cameron by backing her up go up to bed both of you camerons looked after you all day and she needs a break you can watch howards way tabs been insupportable all day cameron was appalled to find herself saying as soon as the children went out of the room later rupert went upstairs and cameron toured wearily round the house picking up kids clothes if she put a wash on tonight she could iron them first thing in the morning rupert found tab curled up in bed in a blue nightie looking through a photograph album of when helen and rupert were married wasnt i a sweet little baby look at me riding on badgers back rupert was not to be deflected why have you been so bloody to cameron he said sitting down on the bed i told you to be nice to her i hate her said tab calmly and all the grooms hate her and they say mr and mrs bodkin hate her because shes so bossy even beaver and blue hate her rubbish beaver and blue adore her shows how thick they are then i told you to be nice to her repeated rupert sternly its all gods fault said tab petulantly pulling the duvet up to her chin i prayed specially hard to him this morning to make me really nice to cameron and he did absolutely nothing about it rupert thought it so funny he had to go straight off and tell cameron he found her in the drawingroom rigid with anger what was this doing on my side of the bed she handed rupert a prayer book bound in ivory look inside she said shrilly to my own darling rupert read rupert slowly all my love helen all other things to their destruction draw only our love hath no decay he grinned at cameron well helen certainly goofed on that one didnt she tab must have put it there hissed cameron dont be fucking stupid she wouldnt understand words like decay and destruction bullshit screamed cameron shes the most destructive kid ive ever met and she certainly understands to my own darling rupert all my love helen whats wrong with that protested rupert most children do want their mothers and fathers to love each other didnt you shes insanely spoilt cameron could hear the obsessive rattle in her voice cant you see how she fawns all over you and freezes out everyone else your whole relationship with her is overly symbiotic i dont know what symbiotic means ruperts voice was suddenly brutally icy but its fuck all to do with you how i handle my children i suggest you read this prayer book yourself it might teach you a little christianity where are you going she said as he went towards the door to bed i dont want any dinner and you can bloody well sleep in the spare room a minute later she heard the front door open and the dogs barking terrified rupert had stormed out she ran into the hall to find mr and mrs bodkin blinking in the light clutching their suitcases and looking sheepish i hope you didnt mind us coming home a day early muttered mrs bodkin but we wanted to see the children and i thought you might need a bit of help with their meals and their washing mrs gordon likes everything back in good order cameron was never so pleased to see anyone sure its ok she said i shouldnt have made you have the weekend off weve all missed you theres some supper in the oven if youre hungry the next moment she was sent flying by tabitha tearing downstairs and throwing herself into mrs bodkins arms oh mrs b she said in a choked voice im so glad youre home its so horrid when youre not here the next day passed without incident until the afternoon cameron who knew she should have disarmed tab by being sweet or at least outwardly unmoved spent the day sulking thawing out then sulking again the children were due to go back to warwickshire after tea rupert had bought the pony biscuit for tab and would drive pony and two children back in the trailer mrs bodkin finished the ironing and packed the childrens cases while rupert and the children watched high society on television ecstatic about the new pony tabitha sprawled on ruperts knee defiantly covering him with kisses cameron determinedly doing the guardian crossword sat on the sofa as far away from rupert as possible they hadnt spoken since last night the sight of camerons long smooth brown thighs in the shortest of khaki shorts however was finally too much for rupert as the credits came up at the end he stretched out putting a hand on her leg dont touch her screamed tab its disgusting and bursting into tears she fled upstairs rupert followed her to find out what was the matter he came down shaking his head its the same old story she wants me and helen to get together again like bing crosby and grace kelly so she can live here all the time the following morning rupert got a letter from taggie dear roopurt she had written thank you for the luvly puppy he is sweet we called him clawdeeus becos patrick says it goes with gurtrude they love eech other now thank you for the shampain sorry we did not come out to dinner i hope you understand yours sincearly taggie ohara rupert wanted to weep is that from one of the children said cameron reading over his shoulder they dont teach them much spelling in class christ its from taggie shes completely illiterate how could maud and declan have produced something quite so dumb the weekend left cameron exhausted and with a numb sense of failure what sort of monster was she to detest an innocent little girl of nine desperate for someone to dump on she was tempted to ask seb or even charles fairburn out to lunch but decided it was too risky tony might easily have bugged their telephones she longed to talk to declan he was so wise and she craved his approval beyond anything but she didnt think this was the way to win it hed just assume shed been treating tab like a corinium employee in the end she rang up janey lloydfoxe who stuck at home with a new baby and frantically trying to finish a book was only too happy for any distraction they met for lunch in london janey rolled up looking stunning and fantastically brown its typing topless in the garden she explained my bum and legs are as white as blackboard chalk because theyre hidden under the table ive got to finish this bloody book because were desperately broke billys absolutely fed up with the bbc too i do hope venturer get the franchise dyou think we will hard to tell said cameron we ought to on form but there are so many wild cards in the pack and declan and rupert really arent getting on at the moment theyre both so tricky and selfwilled grumbled janey hello she beamed up at an italian waiter who was utterly mesmerized by her brown breasts which seemed to squirm in her lowcut pink dress like dayold puppies neither of us wants to work this afternoon so lets kick off with duo enormo vodkos et tônicos then we can get wildly drunk and indiscreet you are lucky not having to worry about schedules and costings any more janey added as the waiter floated back to the bar it must be bliss being supported by rupert hes not very pleased with me confessed cameron pleating the tablecloth then she told janey about the weekend darling said janey taking a hefty belt of vodka get one thing straight its not you i told helen yonks ago that she never need worry about rupert marrying again because no one would take on tab shes adorable until she suspects anyone might take rupert away from her then shes catherine de medici crossed with all the borgias mind you janey went on plunging a cauliflower floret deep into a bowl of mayonnaise tab hasnt had it easy helen tries to be fair but its obvious to anyone that marcus is the granny smith of her eye shes never got on with tab marcus is a really nice kid said cameron whys rupert so mean to him jealousy rupert and helen were going through one of their many bad patches when marcus was born helen lavished all her affection on marcus rupert started lavishing all his affection on show jumping and other women it doesnt help that marcus looks just like helen and rupert doesnt want any reminders of her around him any more but marcus just longs for ruperts approval i know said janey its really sad just as rupert used to long for helens approval but she always dismissed him as a handsome hunk and show jumping as a very secondclass occupation as the waiter wheeled up the hors doeuvres trolley janeys eyes fell lasciviously on mediterranean prawns stuffed aubergine and oeuf à la russe go on urged cameron its my treat what are you going to have asked janey as the waiter piled up her plate just cold salmon and a radicchio salad oh that sounds nice said janey ill have that next and lots of white wine what was helen like said cameron trying not to sound too interested as a second besotted waiter helped them to sancerre oh a sweet old thing really but very earnest and highminded not like us even grinning with her mouth full of tarragonflavoured mushrooms janey had all the charm in the world thought cameron the like us seemed to unite them in a conspiracy of naughtiness and fun did she love rupert ish said janey she always disapproved of him mind you he was disgraceful in those days but underneath all that stunning selfassurance and sex appeal and lack of introspection he does need the clapping he wouldnt be so competitive if he didnt hes so macho what he really needs is some very gentle calm submissive girl who thinks hes absolutely marvellous like taggie ohara thought cameron savagely goodness i shouldnt have eaten all that said janey later as she put her knife and fork together but i suppose i can make the excuse that i still havent got my figure back after the baby has tab truly fought with all ruperts girlfriends asked cameron well he turns them over so fast its hard to remember said janey then catching sight of camerons face she added quickly but im sure itll be different now hes met you they liked beattie johnson i think but she was such a slut she never imposed any régime on them and never minded if they were frightened of the dark and wanted to get into ruperts bed the more the merrier as far as beattie was concerned im amazed they got any sleep with her drunken snoring knowing both janey and beattie johnson had pages on national newspapers cameron suspected an element of professional jealousy what dyou figure i should do about tab she asked despairingly ruperts planning to have her over every weekend this summer he wont said janey soothingly hell get distracted but actually i think you ought to go back to work youre far too bright to hang about all summer brooding about tab and being ruperts concubine its so hard said cameron ive had plenty of offers but all from companies in other parts of the country and i dont want to leave rupert ive been offered loads of freelance work too but nothing that grabs me i guess youre right i must do something you probably miss the bustle at corinium and tony baddingham too ive always thought he was very attractive in a dark satanic way we were together for three years admitted cameron he had his moments but he was a devil that forked tongue must have made him very good at oral sex said janey wickedly cameron laughed having hardly touched her lunch she put her knife and fork together leaning over janey forked up camerons salmon and wrapping it in a paper napkin put it in her bag dyou mind if i take it home for my cat harold evans hes fourteen tomorrow and he loves salmon as much as he hates london while cameron was in london with janey rupert went over to the priory in an attempt to melt the dangerous froideur that seemed to have developed between him and declan declan however seemed enchanted to see him switching off brahms fourth and making a heavily ginlaced jug of pimms just the kind of focking english upperclass drink you would like he took rupert out into the garden is that the new puppys work said rupert noticing a shredded bedroom slipper on the lawn and the flattened flower beds im afraid so hes been rechristened high claudius as he rolled on onspeakable foxs crap yesterday and roshing in leapt all over professor graystock whod dropped in to drool over taggie at least he got rid of the professor double quick so he does have his advantages its all right he added hastily misreading the sudden bootfaced expression on ruperts face hes a dear little dog we all love him caitlins taken him and gertrude for a walk he poured the pimms into two pint mugs then put the jug in the shade under a nearby chestnut tree it was another glorious afternoon grasshoppers scraped like toy violins in the long grass a marbled white butterfly basked on a cushion of thyme through the silver trunks of the beech trees they could just see ruperts cornfields turning gold even the birds were silent worn out with feeding their young declan stretched out its days like this that make that terrible long winter seem worthwhile dyou know weve been here for nearly a year heres to many more said rupert noticing how tired declan was looking again hows the book going all right except that im constantly disturbed by my wife and daughter screaming at each other taggie screaming said rupert in surprise never taggie maud and caitlin mauds menopause appears to be coinciding with caitlins adolescence im thinking of calling in the international peacekeeping force i could have done with them this weekend said rupert swotting an ant my children were staying tab and cameron were like weasels at each others jugulars why cant women get on with each other men never fight declan laughed id never have cast cameron as mary poppins idly they discussed the franchise declan had recruited a very good girl from yorkshire television as head of childrens programmes then heavily prompted by rupert he confessed he was desperately pushed again for money have you spent all that thirtyfive thousand already said rupert disapprovingly you shouldnt keep sloping off to grope maud in the lakes i know but id been working flat out and shes so restless and ive just paid a massive tax bill and patricks fare to australia and caitlins school fees for last term and ive never seen anything like the electricity bill talk about electric shock treatment poor tags the only breadwinner shes over at monicas at the moment filling up her deep freeze cant she shove tony in as well said rupert fishing a piece of cucumber out of his mug i expect hell force the poor darling to taste everything first in case shes poisoning them declan wasnt listening his mini which was a model welded together by dog hair rust and mud which had only passed its mot for the last few years as a result of prayer and huge sums of money changing hands had finally given up the ghost he told rupert you can borrow one of my cars for the moment said rupert in actual fact what you need is a massive cash injection dyou want an advance from the venturer kitty well need all of that ive got to earn it ive spent the last week writing a script for a fiftyminute dramatized documentary on yeats who the irish poet the man im writing the book about said declan impatiently ah said rupert then regaining the ascendancy doesnt sound like a moneyspinner to me will be if its good enough ive sold the idea to channel four and the iba will be in raptures lady goslings halfirish lying on his back listening to the hum of insects and the idle cooing of the wood pigeons gazing up at taggies bedroom window rupert suddenly had a brainwave if freddie and i put up some more money you can afford to have cameron produce and direct it so we can keep it in the family indeed you will not said declan mutinously cameron and i dont get on rupert turned towards declan eyes squinting against the sun time you bloody learned she really thinks youre great she just has a communication problem and itll give her something to do shes like a sheep dog she needs work to stop her getting in your hair snapped declan rupert who hadnt had any lunch had now finished all the fruit in his pimms and was reduced to eating the mint im thinking of venturer not myself he said sanctimoniously as declan filled up both their mugs we just dont want her getting restless and running back to tony itd mean several weeks in ireland said declan well have to go on a recce fairly soon and once weve cast it and fixed up the people to interview i want to start shooting in early september then well need another week at the end of november to do the coole woods in autumn perfect said rupert ill be popping over to ireland all the time from now on for the autumn sales so cameron wont suffer too badly from withdrawal symptoms its a terrible gamble said declan broodingly she and i never got on at corinium why should we get on now because tony wont be there putting the boot in i promise you cameron really really admires your work declan blushed slightly well shes got to read the script before committing herself im not having her working on something she doesnt like one hundred per cent cameron rang declan later that evening trying to keep the excitement out of her voice ive just got back from london and read your script i just love it the characters are terrific and all the ideas for interviews are just great the text reads so beautifully its superb declan was utterly disarmed by such uncharacteristic enthusiasm for any writer waiting for the first reaction is a nailbiting experience ursula whod typed the script out had said shed loved it but then she was paid to id just adore to do it went on cameron if you really figure im the right person sure you are said declan ive just been talking to jeremy at channel four and told him you might be interested hes mad about the idea you look as though youre floating on eire said rupert as cameron put down the telephone you wont mind my being away so much yes said rupert taking her in his arms of course i will but youve got to have your freedom i did when i was show jumping it was the one thing that fuelled me cameron blushed do you swear it was declans idea i should direct it would i lie to you said rupert blandly he asked me to ask you he really admires your work he just has a communication problem oh wow sighed cameron i feel like the first woman on the moon deliriously happy to be working again cameron threw herself into producing declans programme much of her time was spent in london or over at the priory and she turned one of ruperts upstairs bedrooms into a study so she could work there as well rupert whod been neglecting the yard and his business interests and still had a full diary as an mp despite the summer recess was also kept very busy this suited them both they continued to argue a lot but sex at least was miraculous when they met even the childrens visits seemed less of a hassle mrs bodkin did all the work and when tabitha became unbearable which was most of the time instead of rowing with her cameron retreated upstairs to work on the franchise front the iba had now sifted through everyones lengthy applications with a toothcomb and fired off letters to all the consortiums containing supplementary questions about programme plans management structure studios and general finance we promised them a cross between camelot and utopia said declan and now weve got to justify it the long written answer to this letter was almost as crucial in winning the franchise as the original application once again therefore the venturer team had to get together to thrash out policy meetings at anyones house were now considered too risky as tony had stepped up his espionage since cameron had defected i was followed down cotchester high street by the most ravishing piece of rough trade this morning said charles fairburn petulantly but i couldnt work out if it was my lucky day or he was a member of the baddingham kgb rupert being such a practised adulterer was therefore deputed to find a meetingplace where they wouldnt be found out he chose a seedy room over a nightclub in a back street in cheltenham if this is where you bring your mistresses grumbled georgie baines when he arrived for the first meeting i can see why they get fed up night after night therefore through the end of july and a long hot august declan freddie bas rupert cameron lord smith harold white and the corinium moles when they could get away met up to hammer out the answers charles fairburn still turned up every time in a different disguise which made everyone giggle they needed to declan deadly serious now insisted everyone drank only perrier until the meeting was over they were nearly halfway through their long ordeal in the franchise fight and nervous tension was mounting at least they were spared the bishop who was spending a month in the holy land and professor graystock who was in greece researching a book but they missed dame enid whod gone on a walking tour in wales with a woman friend and after th august when he pushed off to scotland to shoot they missed the inanities of the lordlieutenant theyd all grown very fond of henry janey lloydfoxe hampered by two children and a book to finish seldom showed up billy was in australia making a film about rugger for the bbc for wesley emerson august was a wicket month he took for against the australians in the leeds test venturer basked in his reflected glory the letter with the answers to the supplementary questions was dispatched to the iba at the beginning of september by which time the franchise wives were getting very fed up the long summer holidays were slowly grinding to a halt the smell of moulding leaves and bonfires the sight of huge red suns and dewy cobwebs hanging on the fences reminded them with a pang that summer had already had its run sarah stratton for example not only had paul hanging round at home out of work and grumpily demoralized but also his ghastly daughters who never stopped implying that daddy would be prime minister now if he had stayed with mummy and that by going out to work sarah was neglecting him sarah and jamess afternoon programme was off the air for the summer paul and the girls watched the local news and knew that sarah finished at seven or even sixthirty on crossroads days the studio was only twenty minutes from home all were waiting bootfaced to start supper if she werent home by eight valerie jones was increasingly irritated that freddie seemed to be spending so much time on the stupid franchise completely off gardening since james had failed to immortalize her opening valerie had dragged wayne and sharon off to a villa in portugal for a month shed all but persuaded taggie to join them and to do the cooking until that fiendish rupert talked her out of it so instead they got a local slut called conceptiona who got so terribly on fredfreds nerves he hated foreign food anyway that he buzzed off back to gloucestershire saying he had too much on as hed been wandering round the villa with nothing on at all in order to get a suntan no doubt ruperts fiendish influence again this seemed very illogical monica baddingham also had as cameron would have said a somewhat stressful summer there had been no discussion between her and tony about camerons defection beyond the fact that corinium had lost a megastar and an essential weapon in the franchise battle privately monica realized tony was utterly devastated being humane and kindly she felt very sorry for him in the same way as she did for her poor distressed gentlefolk her battered wives her stray dogs and everyone else who was the recipient of her inexhaustible charity it was tragic that tony couldnt level with her comforting him they might have grown closer but at least she listened patiently to his diatribes against declan and rupert and stoically accepted that he would want to sleep with her more than once a week until he found a new mistress much more worrying was that archie her favourite child now seventeen and not due to take his alevels until next year was still enjoying a most unsuitable fling with the ghastly tracey makepiece whom hed met at the ohara new years eve party both monica and tony were terrified archie would make her pregnant and be forced into an early marriage or because the makepieces didnt believe in abortion or adoption the baby baddingham would be taken into the bosom of the makepiece family and be a drain on archies quite insufficient pocket money for the rest of his life why the hell cant you find a girl of your own class roared tony forbidding archie to see her any more archie had obviously taken no notice one morning in early august putting on archies barbour by mistake monica found a letter in traceys loopy handwriting i will love you dearest until all the seas run dry archie had promptly been shunted off to tuscany for three weeks most despondent of all the wives however was maud no one had fallen in love with her for ages and declan having been totally obsessed with the franchise and then his yeats programme was now totally obsessed with both not wanting to leave maud when she was so depressed apprehensive about going to ireland with cameron declan tried to persuade maud to make a return to acting and play yeatss great love maud gonne in the programme so she could come with them maud terrified of failure turned him down flatly and then detested herself for doing so it was as though she was deliberately pushing him into an affair with cameron finally caitlin had been home most of the summer full of teenage moodiness criticizing everything maud did particularly her clothes which caitlin claimed were so out of date they should be called a first world wardrobe maud was not amused shed always prided herself on being able to go to a party in a pair of declans pyjamas with a jewelled comb in her hair and look marvellous one morning towards the end of august maud read a piece in the daily mail about princess michael entering a new golden age of maturity and confidence shes the same age as me thought maud broodily and im ten years younger than joan collins and look how great she looks why am i riddled with selfdoubt and about as confident as a mongrel at crufts having borrowed a hundred pounds and her new violet dress off taggie she decided to ignore declans bank balance as well and go into cotchester and buy some new clothes as she got ready caitlin wandered into her bedroom even in the space of the holidays she seemed to have shot up several inches and was as tall as maud now her brace was off her teeth shed grown her hair and peroxided it canary yellow chronic sulkiness was the only thing that stopped her being incredibly pretty changing her parting slightly maud noticed three grey hairs and tugged them out in horror youd quadruple the men after you if you had short hair or used sunin or a bit of gel said caitlin and thats taggies dress youre wearing when i was your age countered maud i had hundreds of boys after me i cant think why you dont im choosey thats why why dont you have your face lifted maud gazed at her reflection perhaps she ought to but unable to face a filling at the dentist shed never cope with the pain anyway shed rather have her spirits lifted her body looked ok still but crêped when it was squeezed which didnt seem very often these days im over the hill she thought with a shiver as she started to put on her makeup declan will go off to ireland and with cameron cook eyeliner goes on much better if you pull your eyelids out said caitlin and youre not going to wear those ghastly slingbacks better than your revolting clodhoppers said maud furiously its like sharing a house with a carthorse and what are you going to do with yourself all day im going to spend the morning dyeing my hair said caitlin cotchester was full of tourists drifting aimlessly down the high street photographing the cathedral and the ancient houses and the statue of charles i by contrast monica baddingham striding purposefully through the crowds was like a powerboat chugging through a flotilla of yachts on a windless day she detested shopping such a timeconsuming activity but she needed batteries for her walkman and there was a new recording of don giovanni on order which maddeningly hadnt arrived and she had to pick up some scores of the merry widow every year the west cotchester hunt put on a play which was performed to large noisy audiences in november this year they had decided to be slightly more ambitious and join forces with cotchester operatic society to put on the merry widow monica had already been appropriately cast as valencienne a virtuous wife charles fairburn had been inappropriately cast as her randy admirer camille bas baddingham was still dickering over whether to play the male lead count danilo but as yet the director barton sinclair excovent garden no less was still searching for someone to play hanna the merry widow he was holding auditions in cotchester town hall that very day but was deeply pessimistic that anyone would be beautiful or stylish enough or have a sufficiently good voice luck however was on barton sinclairs side outside the bar sinister monica bumped into maud how jolly nice said monica in her raucous voice as she kissed maud ive been hoping id run into you for ages i wanted to say how wonderful taggies been completely saved my life cooking for all the hordes this summer you must be so proud of her maud said yes she supposed she was but shes getting too thin went on monica she used to be so round soft and smiling i hope shes not taking on too much you on the other hand look splendid hows declan oh obsessed with the wretched franchise said maud fretfully isnt it a ghastly bore sighed monica tony cant think of anything else but i dont see why just because our husbands are on different sides we cant be friends it was very hot in cotchester high street the cool garlicscented gloom of the bar sinister beckoned nor do i said maud why dont we go in and have lunch what a good idea said monica in excitement ploughmans lunch and half a pint of cider mauds aims were slightly more ambitious and they were soon sitting down with muscadet and crespolini oh look theres james vereker and sarah stratton said monica whats declan doing at the moment hes off to ireland with cameron cook said maud oh monicas forkful of crespolini stopped on the way to her mouth but i thought she was living with rupert yes she is but shes making a film with declan in ireland her tongue loosened by a third glass maud told monica about declans trying to persuade her to play maud gonne and how her nerve had failed i couldnt face cameron screaming at me when i didnt come up to scratch she confessed her sarcasm could strip furniture and ive always found it difficult to act in front of declan monica at this point became very thoughtful but you would like to go back oh yes but at the moment ive got about as much selfconfidence as a leveret at a coursing meeting monica fished in her shopping bag and brought out one of the scores of the merry widow on the cover was a painting of a beautiful woman with hair swept up under a big pink hat and a waist in its swirling cyclamenpink dress as slender as her neck she was raising a glass of champagne in one long purplegloved hand four handsome men with black twirling moustaches were raising their glasses to her in admiring salute it was mauds perfect fantasy what did gel and sunin matter to that woman why dont you start with something less ambitious than maud gonne said monica were desperate for someone to play the merry widow i couldnt faltered maud its a very demanding part nonsense said monica briskly youd waltz it what are my two favourite women doing lunching at my restaurant without telling me said a voice it was bas absolutely black from a fortnights polo in america bas said monica delightedly i know im not supposed to talk to you either after the dreadful way youve betrayed tony but sit down and help me persuade maud to audition for hanna bas needed little persuading up to now hed bypassed maud in his amorous travels partly because he had longrange aims for taggie and partly because hed realized how dotty maud had been about rupert at christmas certainly in the soft lighting of the bar sinister she looked stunning today and that violet dress was very becoming it emphasized her white skin and just missed clashing with the gorgeous red hair and all those undone buttons showed off a cheddar gorge of cleavage another bottle of muscadet was ordered bas is toying with the idea of playing your leading man said monica hopefully itll lead to other things said basil rubbing one of his long muscular poloplaying thighs against mauds as he refilled her glass later not even allowing her a cup of black coffee to sober her up basil and monica frogmarched maud down the high street to the town hall where the director barton sinclair had reached screaming point having heard ten amateur hopefuls murdering the score up on stage now the eleventh a very madeup blonde whod never see fifty again was crucifying the vilja song the pianist was desperately trying to keep in time with her a huge bluebottle buzzing against a window pane was having more success shed be too fat even if you looked through the wrong end of your binoculars whispered bas to maud at least you can do better than that i cant muttered maud in terror thats top g shes missing as she tried to bolt bass arm closed round her waist yes you can he murmured just think of the fun we can have rehearsing together night after night and it wont be all singing i can tell you thank you very much said barton sinclair in his chorusboy drawl i sang the part in said the blonde teetering down the steps in her fourinch heels it brought the house down pity you werent buried under the rubble muttered barton well be in touch ill be making a decision at the end of the week he told her then waiting until she was safely out of the door he turned to monica thats the lot thank god talk about scraping the barrel organ im going home said maud could you hear just one more said monica barton sinclair looked at his watch and sighed do i have to i was hoping to get the three fortyfive back to paddington itll be worth getting the next train i promise you said monica this is maud ohara she used to act and sing professionally barton sinclair straightened his flowered tie and smoothed his straggly mousebrown hair you certainly look the part he said i havent practised bleated maud the crespolini and the sancerre churning like a tumbledryer inside her try the same song said barton handing her the score take it slowly mike he added to the pianist you come in on the last quaver of the fourth bar the pianist told maud kindly below her maud could see their faces monicas eager flushed and unpainted basils sleek and mahogany and barton sinclairs london night owl and deathly pale they seemed infinitely more terrifying than a first night audience at covent garden i cant she whispered wringing her sweating hands go on darling said bas were all on your side off went the pianist maud fluffed the opening im sorry could we start again of course said barton off went the pianist again and maud opened her mouth there once lived a vilja a fair mountain sprite she danced on a hill in the still of the night her voice was sweet true and hesitant but suddenly as she launched into the main theme it seemed to soar out glorious and joyful stilling the bluebottle and taking the dust off the rafters and the four other people in the room felt the hair rising on the backs of their necks a star is reborn whispered monica wiping her eyes i am going to have a nice autumn reflected basil over forty theyre always so grateful vilja oh vilja be tender and true sang maud triple pianissimo love me and ill die for you for a second there was silence then her audience burst out clapping and cheering come into covent garden maud sang basil youve got the part said barton sinclair the only problem is how much youre going to show up the others thank you barton said monica and basil in unison after that they all went back to the bar sinister for several more bottles of muscadet and barton sinclair only just made the six fortyfive tony and declan were very apprehensive when they heard the news of such close fraternization between the rival franchise sides on reflection however tony decided hed definitely got the better bargain while maud was a rattle who drank far too much monica drank very little and was incredibly discreet keep your trap shut and your ears open tony told her you may learn some interesting things im not pumping anyone said monica firmly its simply not on only if anyone lets anything drop itll be knickers if bas has anything to do with it said tony declan however who was going to have to spend the second half of september and much of october in ireland with cameron was principally relieved that maud was so much happier the sound of her carolling away upstairs practising her songs reminded him of the carefree days in dublin when they were first married perhaps if the merry widow were a success shed have enough confidence to take up acting professionally again caitlin who had now dyed her custardyellow hair so black it almost looked blue found her mothers euphoria even more irritating than her previous picky depression and decided to push off to london for a few days to stay with some schoolfriends she was going back the week after next and might as well have some fun before the prison doors clanged round her again she found taggie in the kitchen fainting over a final reminder from the electricity board i cant think why its so high mummys vibrators batteryoperated so it cant be that said caitlin hullo darling she added hugging claudius hes in disgrace sighed taggie hes just eaten one of mummys new slingbacks good thing they were gross said caitlin every claud has a silver lining can you lend me fifty pounds to go to london i havent got it protested taggie ive just lent daddy a hundred pounds for a new pair of cords for ireland at least ill be gone for nearly a week so you wont have to feed me cajoled caitlin so thats worth fifty and we havent done your trunk yet wailed taggie youve grown out of everything you need new aertex shirts and both your games skirts are split oh sew them up said caitlin airily we cant possibly afford new ones if were so poor after a riotous five days in london caitlin rolled up at paddington station with just enough money for her halffare home her blueblack hair was coaxed upward at the front into a corkscrew quiff she was wearing peacock feather earrings a black and white sleeveless tshirt a black lycra mini which just covered her bottom laddered black tights huge black clumpy shoes all of which belonged to various friends of hers a great deal of black eye makeup and messages in biro all over her arms it was hardly surprising therefore that the man at the ticket desk refused to believe she was under sixteen a most unseemly screaming match ensued which first amused then irritated the growing queue of passengers behind caitlin who began to worry they might miss their trains home my father is a very very famous man screamed caitlin as a last resort and hell get you dont threaten me young lady said the booking clerk its people like you who turn liberals like me into racists screamed caitlin even louder youre just discriminating against me because im white ill report you to the race relations board at that moment archie baddingham on his way home from his three weeks banishment in tuscany reached the top of the neighbouring firstclass queue hearing the din and recognizing caitlins shrill irish accent from new years eve he bought her a ticket remember me he said tapping her on the shoulder no yes said caitlin youre archie arent you can you lend me my fare this stupid asshole wont believe im under sixteen ive got you a ticket said archie i cant accept a ticket from you stormed caitlin irrationally your fathers been absolutely shitty to my father my fathers shitty to everyone said archie calmly taking her arm come on wed better move it they only just caught the train on time but managed to find two single seats opposite each other ive never travelled first class said caitlin stretching out on the orange seat and squirming her neck luxuriously against the headrest archie looked wonderful she thought like her hed shot up and lost weight he was wearing black s rolled up above black socks and black brogues with a black poloneck tucked into a western belt with a silver buckle black crosses in his ears and a brown suede jacket his blond hair washed with soap to remove any shine was long at the front and cut short at the back and sides his still slightly rounded face looked thinner because of a suntan almost as dark as his eyes why are you so disgustingly brown asked caitlin ive just spent three weeks in tuscany my parents booted me out there to get over a girl traceyonthemakepiece archie grinned making him look even more attractive how dyou know that you were superglued to her at patricks twentyfirst so i was actually im over her but dad and mum thought i wasnt so i thought i might as well take advantage of a free holiday have you been away we never go anywhere my parents are always broke no its quite ok nothing to do with your father theyre just hopeless with money there was a pause caitlin gazed out of the window wondering what to say next what would you like to drink asked archie they got any malibu i doubt it well vodka and tonic then can i come with you the intercity belting towards bristol swayed like a drunk as they walked towards the buffet car have you had any lunch asked archie admiring her narrow waist and slim legs which were more ladder than tights no said caitlin ill buy you some grub then said archie been to a funeral said the gay barman running a lascivious eye over archies black clothes passengers are reminded that it is an offence to serve intoxicating liquor to persons under the age of eighteen read caitlin loudly as archie paid for everything keep your vice down hissed archie the journey back to their seat with each of them carrying white plastic trays of vodkas and tonics glasses bacon sandwiches mars bars and packets of crisps was much more hazardous they had no hands to steady themselves against the lurching train terribly sorry mumbled caitlin going scarlet as for the third time she cannoned off a commuter back into archie whos complaining said archie thank you so much said caitlin as they sped past slow winding rivers rolling fields and clumps of yellowing trees this bacon sandwich is the best thing ive ever tasted im surprised you can say that with taggie cooking for you said archie every time my father compliments my mother on the food it turns out taggies made it how is she bit low shes hopelessly hooked on rupert campbellblack wont do her any good said archie pouring out a second vodka and tonic for caitlin he strikes women down like lightning bolts anyway hes bonking my fathers ex cameron cook said caitlin dismissively shes a crosspatch isnt she i cant see what men see in her my brother was crazy about her and now shes gone off to make a film in ireland with daddy i hope they dont end up in bed people usually do on location dont they id loathe her as a stepmother dad was mad about her i was shitscared hed leave mum and marry her said archie breaking a mars bar and giving half to caitlin i dread my parents getting a divorce in case they marry again and leave all their money to their new children caitlin giggled mine havent any to leave i hear your mothers joined the cast of the merry widow mum told me on the telephone that shes streets ahead of everyone else at least its got her off my back said caitlin she drives me crackers where are you going who with why were you so long on the telephone who was that on the telephone was it a good party did you meet anyone nice christ not that shes interested my mother overreacts said archie she thinks the world will end if she finds a halfeaten tin of baked beans under the sofa and shes so embarrassing christ we were at a party earlier these holidays and she suddenly asked me in a loud voice if i needed a kirby grip he raked his blond locks back from his bronzed forehead it looks great said caitlin particularly now the suns bleached it a lot of passengers got out at didcot so they practically had the carriage to themselves as the cooling towers of didcot power station belched out unearthly white steam against a darkening charcoal grey sky the gay barman came by with a black plastic bag gathering up rubbish i want to keep my tonic tin said caitlin grabbing it back as she put it in her bag archie examined the heartshaped face the pointed chin echoed by the widows peak the small beautifully shaped green eyes the snub nose the coralpink mouth sweet now it was no longer set in a sulky petulant line the blueblack mane parted on the left which she kept lifting with her fingers and tossing over to the right glancing up she caught him staring at her and smiled thats it said archie wonderingly your brace has gone so have your zits said caitlin archie went pink i fancied you the moment i saw you what about tracey she was just a net said archie they were nearing cotchester now dense woods clinging to steep hills on each side of the line giving way to lighted houses archie removed his earrings putting them in his pocket because he said his father would only make a fuss then blushing again he forced a tenner into the pocket of caitlins clinging lycra skirt whats this for asked caitlin in amazement i owe you money for a taxi said archie percy my fathers chauffeur is meeting me and if we give you a lift hes bound to sneak to dad its just like the montagues and the capulets sighed caitlin i hope we dont end up like romeo and juliet ill ring you tomorrow said archie and hopefully we can fix an evening when all our parents are away opening his bank statement next morning archie nearly fainted to make matters worse it was his mothers birthday on friday and hed promised to buy her the latest recording of the flying dutchman normally hed have tapped his father who was a far easier touch than monica but tony was still in edinburgh for the international television festival besides if tony discovered he was financing a date with caitlin archie would be crated straight back to tuscany hed been stupid to show off and buy them both firstclass tickets and all that booze if only hed been back at school he could have raised the cash smuggling in some booze and fags or even porn mags and selling them to other boys on the black market nor was caitlin the kind of girl who could be fobbed off with hamburgers and a video she needed something special grimly aware that he hadnt touched any of the ridiculous amount of holiday work hed been set archie gazed gloomily at the same page of aristophanes for twenty minutes then threw the book across the room if he hurried he might reach the bar sinister before lunch and catch his uncle basil before he rushed off to polo or some amorous jaunt he found bas humming the vilja song from the merry widow and taking fifty pounds out of his own till can i have a quiet word said archie you can have several noisy ones if you like said bas i thought your father had forbidden you to talk to me where is rambo anyway in edinburgh said archie and please dont pump me he admired his uncle who always had the loudest tweed jackets and the prettiest girls of anyone he knew have a drink said bas taking down a bottle of chambery and two glasses yes please if i work really hard in the kitchens for three days will you let me sign the bill for dinner for two on saturday night are you bringing tracey makepiece no good there are limits i really was on tonys side for once on that score yes you can then on saturday night taggies violet dress paid its second visit to the bar sinister in ten days this time with caitlin inside it but with the waist jacked into nothing by a black corset belt and the skirt turned up from midcalf to midthigh by taggie it was almost unrecognizable archie having scrubbed mussels for three days in the kitchen and suffered agonies of doubt like mr toad that his hands would ever be unwrinkled again felt he had really earned his date basil was out that evening but all the waiters were in on the secret and gave archie and caitlin a table in an alcove where no one else would see them determined to get his wages worth archie ordered a bottle of dom perignon and they started off with a wine race seeing who could drink a halfpint of champagne fastest to get things warmed up but after that they found that they were so excited by each others company they werent very hungry this is the most delicious thing ive ever eaten said caitlin as she toyed with foie gras on radicchio i cant think why i cant eat more of it archie slowly undressed a giant prawn and dipped it in dill sauce try this gosh its yummy i wish school food was like this nellie newstead found a used bandaid in her shepherds pie last term arent you dreading going back not if you promise to write to me caitlin looked up god shes sweet when she smiles thought archie every day if you like said caitlin ive looked up the distance between rugborough and upland house said archie its only about forty miles a mate of mines passed his test so well drive over and take you out one sunday and itll be halfterm soon archie was wearing a dinner jacket over black baggy trousers and a grey and white shirt over a sisters of mercy tshirt he looks incredibly cool thought caitlin lovingly as if in a dream she watched his sunburnt hand closing over her white one his palm felt so warm and dry that suddenly she longed for him to touch her all over archie ordered another bottle of champagne you really shouldnt protested caitlin its frightfully expensive in restaurants and i already owe you for my ticket and my taxi you can pay me in kind said archie gently stroking the inside of her wrist a pound a kiss no i wont be able to afford it a penny a kiss da mi basia milk sighed caitlin whats that catullus give me a thousand kisses are you frightfully clever of course thats why i chose you they screamed with laughter suddenly the stupidest things seemed funny archie thought he should try and be poetic too your eyes are the same colour as beech leaves in spring he said gazing into them youre like a little wood nymph a dryad said caitlin taking a swig of her champagne nothing very dry about me what are we going to do after this said archie getting out a packet of sobranie did you say your parents are both away daddys in edinburgh probably killing your father but mummy might be back from her rehearsal although she seems to be getting later and later theres no one at home said archie ill get them to get us a taxi it was only when she got up to walk out of the restaurant that caitlin realized how drunk she was its like intercity all over again she told archie only by grabbing her arm did he prevent her cannoning off every table he kissed her all the way back to the falconry caitlin whod spent three days practising kissing the palm of her hand found archies mouth a great deal more exciting and when they were ensconced on monicas huge flowered chintz sofa having both carefully removed each others earrings archie discovered that caitlins small incredibly springy white breasts were far more thrilling than tracey makepieces it was just a question of preferring nectarines to melons and her waist was so tiny once hed removed the black corset belt that he was terrified he might snap her in two but nothing could exceed her enthusiasm i do hope im not too pissed to remember every minute of this tomorrow she said have you ever been to bed with anyone before archie mumbled into the gelstiffened straw of her hair never have you yes lots about two and threequarters a man of experience sighed caitlin in ecstasy undoing a few more buttons archie who was down to his sisters of mercy tshirt now kissed his way down her shoulder until he was sucking her right nipple he was also wrestling with his conscience as to whether he ought to take her to bed he wanted to like mad but he was pissed enough to botch it and she was certainly so pissed she might easily regret it in the morning he had a condom in the breast pocket of his dinner jacket which was hanging over the chair but if he got up to get it it might destroy the mood but again it was unlikely theyd have an empty house to themselves for months as her little hands slid inside his tshirt he found his hand as if magnetized creeping up her legs im climbing your ladders to paradise he whispered the next minute he jumped out of his skin as a great white light shone in at the window holy shit said archie ooh squeaked caitlin in excitement its a close encounter bloody sight too close said archie its my father flying in from edinburgh it was too late to make a bolt for it with lightning presence of mind archie turned on a side light plugged a tape in the video pressed twelve on the remote control and did up caitlins buttons ill ring for a taxi as soon as i can and take you home well just have to try and bluff it out the next minute james verekers new pilot on keeping fit for the elderly burst on to the screen tony fortunately had been hosting a very successful dinner for the iba and after several belts of brandy on the way home was in a mellow mood it soon became even mellower when he found his favourite son in the drawingroom with an enchantingly pretty little brunette she looked vaguely familiar but tony was too vain to put on his spectacles and by no stretch of the imagination could she be called tracey makepiece this is caitie said archie heartily i was just going to ring for a taxi to take her home where does she live said tony chalford lied archie ill take her said tony expansively no distance at all lets all have a drink caities tired said archie desperately she doesnt look it said tony admiring caitlins flushed cheeks and glittering green eyes theres a bottle of moët in the fridge shoving caitlins corset belt under a pinkandwhitestriped cushion archie reluctantly left the room why are you watching this tape asked tony as a lot of geriatrics with purple faces started doing pressups i love coriniums programmes said caitlin dreamily i adore master dog weve got two dogs ones very thick ones brilliant im sure shed win youd better give me a ring in the office next week said tony were always looking for bright dogs im going back to school where dyou go upland house better and better thought tony in delight the girl was a lady dyou know my niece tonia martin frightful slag said caitlin she nearly got sacked last term for having boys in her room shes got a terrible reputation at stowe too tony was enchanted his sisters daughter was always being held up as a paragon of virtue and dyou by any chance know caro mckay teaches biology i think of course she teaches me caitlin beamed ghastly old dyke she and miss reading live in a twobedroom house with a spare room she screamed with laughter tony joined in once caitlin got an audience there was no stopping her archie was torn between hysterical laughter and total panic as she regaled tony with one scurrilous story after another about the daughters of his friends and colleagues after the bottle was finished tony insisted on driving her home the only way tracey would have got out of the house reflected archie would have been in a hearse bitterly ashamed of himself he funked going with them he couldnt face the return journey it was a lovely night a buttercoloured moon was gliding in and out of threatening blueblack clouds gilding their edges mist was rising there was a smell of dying bonfires and wet leaves what a heavenly car said caitlin playing with the electric windows how long have you known archie asked tony about nine months i dont mean to suck up but i do think youve brought him up well hes so considerate tony purred he is a nice boy wish hed work a bit harder have you taken your olevels yet last term get a few eleven said caitlin simply you seem more pleased than my mother she added bitterly a minute later archies father she decided was really really nice extraordinary how her father and tag got everything wrong he was soon saying she might like to come to the hunt ball if she could get off school and even suggested skiing in the christmas holidays oh id love to said caitlin as they neared penscombe she noticed the car telephone oh how lovely you are lucky can i use it of course said tony the length of caitlins slender white thighs on the black leather seat reminded him almost unbearably of cameron hed been hoping hed bump into her at edinburgh but she hadnt shown up without thinking caitlin rang the priory it was two oclock in the morning and no one answered for ages hullo murmured a sleepy voice taggie darling said caitlin did i wake you tony nearly ran into a wild rose bush suddenly the temperature in the car dropped below zero what did you say your surname was said tony as caitlin put back the receiver ohara said caitlin in a small voice declans daughter yes what the fuck are you playing at did your father put you up to this oh please dont tell him gasped caitlin hed be furious not any more furious than i bloody am roared tony the little snake ill murder archie when i get home oh please dont caitlin whod had a great deal too much to drink burst into tears for christs sake exploded tony i like you so much sobbed caitlin and i thought you liked me i do said tony in exasperation handing her his blue spotted handkerchief reeking of the inevitable paco rabanne i just cant stand your father the fathers have eaten sour grapes sniffed caitlin dolefully and the childrens teeth are set on edge and youre not going to tell declan that youre going out with archie christ no said caitlin i dont want to get butchered in my prime tony did a lot of thinking as he drove home when he turned on the light in archies room he found him huddled under the duvet with his pyjamas buttoned up to the neck desperately pretending to be asleep not for the first time however tony astounded his son you can go on seeing that girl as long as you try and find out as much as you can about venturer thats immoral said archie shocked dont be bloody wet said tony brutally dyou want corinium to lose the franchise no or for me to forfeit four hundred thousand minimum a year no said archie if he was rich he reflected he wouldnt have to scrub mussels for three days every time he wanted to take caitlin out to dinner one day she would live in the falconry with him his father was right he decided blood was thicker than water if declan didnt get the franchise he archie would look after caitlin taggie had a very wearing september getting a besotted and reelingly untogether caitlin packed up and back to upland house was bad enough but dispatching declan to ireland was even worse as the departure date drew nearer he grew increasingly reluctant to leave maud or his precious franchise which was just coming up to the boil maud was plainly revelling in the merry widow declan was glad but was her euphoria slightly over the top and was it really necessary for her to have a bath wash her hair and pinch yet more of taggies clothes before every rehearsal and when she carolled the words all the worlds in love with love and i love you over and over again from the southern turret who were they really aimed at as the yellow woods turned gold and the swallows seemed to postpone their departure and even the huge red suns sunk more slowly into ruperts woods in order to hear mauds exquisite notes floating down the valley declan prayed she wasnt leading her leading man on too much maud herself was much happier after caitlin had gone back to school no one was quicker on the draw than a teenager in love which ruled out any illicit incoming telephone calls for maud but now it seemed cameron cook was always in the house monopolizing the telephone and declan and not being deferential enough to maud the arrogant bitch anyone would think they were going off on a six months polar expedition rather than three silly weeks on location maud also bitterly resented cameron treating taggie like a slave only this morning on the eve of departure perry odonovan whod been cast as yeats wanted cameron to call him back and taggie had taken the number down wrong dont keep apologizing screamed cameron running out of breath after five minutes of invective just get it right in future the only person allowed to exploit and scream at taggie reflected maud should be maud herself the eve of departure in fact was full of spats and now at dusk declan was in the library firing off lastminute instructions to freddie who was just back from portugal again and rupert who was just off to virginia for a few days between them they would probably run things far more smoothly than declan the appalling professor graystock had also dropped in returned from his working holiday in greece to get ready for the new university year and was as usual swilling declans whisky dame enid had just come down from upstairs after going through mauds merry widow score with her and making some extremely helpful suggestions shell be totally irresistible dame enid told declan as she accepted a large pink gin wish i were playing her leading man cameron sat in the corner going through her lists for tomorrow with half an ear on the meeting shed checked that everyone actors wardrobe makeup and crew knew where to meet her and declan at birmingham airport shed doublechecked that the airconditioned coach would be waiting to take them to sligo by early evening and that the hotel overlooking the bay would be expecting them for dinner glancing across the room at rupert who was gazing moodily out of the window at claudius chewing a library book she knew that he was bored there was nothing he loathed more than other peoples waffle hed been affectionate enough recently but slightly detached perhaps he always distanced himself before a separation she hated the thought of him going to virginia on his own she couldnt imagine american women leaving anything as beautiful or as explosively macho alone shed lived with him for sixtyeight days and she glanced at her watch eighteen hours and she still wanted him continually now you all know that im on the end of the telephone declan was saying by the time i get back we should have the date for our iba interview then we can start having dryruns ive booked hardy bisset to coach us hes exiba so hes witnessed the interviewing process from the other side theres also a permanent exhibition on the history of television at the iba he went on parties of schoolchildren and tourists visit it every day i think you should all try and have a look at it before the interview so you at least know something about the business youre intending to run go in in ones or twos or itll look too obvious we must get wesley marti bas and particularly henry along there or theyll make complete pratts of themselves at the interview i think thats all he ran his hands through his hair and leaned back in his chair surveying the chaos on his desk in despair rupert turned away from the window when dyou reckon yeatsll be finally in the can he said for chrissake dumbass screamed cameron ive told you a hundred times its pronounced yates declan raised a disapproving eyebrow dame enid was much more up front you havent learned to pronounce the word hostile yet young lady she snapped but you certainly manage to be it most of the time thank you enid the age of chivalry is not entirely dead said rupert lightly but his face had lost all expression oh god thought cameron i shouldnt have said that the answer to your question said declan to rupert is sometime in december well have to edit and do all the vos when we get back i hope youve got in the story about yeats cutting his precious fur coat in half because he didnt want to disturb a cat who was sitting on it said dame enid must have been a good bloke to do that or the time that he signed a lot of cheques yours sincerely w b yeats said professor graystock determined not to be upstaged or even the story he began rupert had had enough fucking intellectuals he walked out of the library out of the front door and down the garden migrating arrows of birds were flapping down the valley there had been a storm at lunchtime roses were pulping and disintegrating tobacco plants prostrated themselves like palms before his feet beyond the garden in one of his fields the grass had been flattened by the deluge as though a herd of elephants had been having a gang bang half a dozen young steers grazing there had recently been joined by a guernsey cow and a little chocolatebrown calf which a grateful neighbouring farmer had sent rupert as an early birthday present now he could see the steers pushing the baby calf away and drinking her mothers milk with her longlegged gawkiness her big eyes and long fringed eyelashes the calf reminded him of taggie he looked at the mothers pink udder with its four teats perhaps cameron would pronounce them tates fucking intellectual hed get the mother and calf moved to a field of their own tomorrow instead of returning to the library he went round to the kitchen and found taggie listening to pop music and trying to iron a great pile of declans shirts and read a recipe at the same time dashing away with a smoothing iron she stole my heart away said rupert taggie gave a start i dont see how anyone could steal anybodys heart away when theyre ironing she mumbled one gets so red in the face and youre about to singe that shirt said rupert hastily taggie upended the iron youre just the person i wanted to see sarah stratton wants me to do a dinner party for her the week after next and shes given me this recipe all in french and i cant make head nor tail of it rupert whod had plenty of experience of sarahs writing took the piece of paper and reeled off the recipe oh marvellous could you read it out to me said taggie grabbing a pencil rupert was about to take the pencil saying itd be much quicker if he scribbled it down himself then he remembered something hed read recently about encouraging dyslexies very slowly making sure he didnt get too far ahead resisting the urge to touch taggies white neck revealed in all its vulnerability as her black ponytail fell sideways he read it out you are brilliant sighed taggie as she finished no one else could translate it daddy doesnt read french nor mummy nor even cameron suddenly rupert felt ten feet tall again what a bugger he had to fly to virginia tomorrow but he desperately needed a new stallion and he hoped to get in a few days hunting he was about to make a firm date for dinner the moment he got back when the repulsive professor graystock wandered in ah taggie the professors formless mouth widened showing crooked yellow teeth im frightfully hungry only had time for a bowl of soup at lunchtime could i have something to eat nothing fancy simple repast bread and cheese will be quite sufficient disgusting old goat thought rupert with a shudder typical leftie with his second house and no school fees to pay bumming off anyone he regarded as capitalist taggie tried to smile the professor gave her the creeps too he still never missed an opportunity to squeeze her or gaze at her breasts or make risqué remarks camerons looking for you rupert said the professor pointedly she wants to go home rupert took no notice and went on stroking aengus who was stretched out by the aga mouth watering the professor watched taggie put out a loaf of wholemeal bread some brie and cheddar and half a pound of butter any celery he asked im partial to celery with father in ireland and mother rehearsing all the time youre going to be rather lonely taggie perhaps youll come over one evening to the campus and cook supper for a lonely old man shes working every night snapped rupert someones got to keep this doss house in whisky no need to overreact dear boy said the professor cutting a doorstep of bread and spreading it thickly with butter ive got an intellectual poser for you both what would you have done he leered at taggie if youd discovered as i did last term your most brilliant firstyear student guaranteed to get a first in bed in college with a naked girl would you have sent him down if shed been pretty said rupert coldly id have confiscated her cameron felt twitchy as she packed she was still kicking herself for showing rupert up in front of the others but she got so uptight before she went on location it was a million times worse than before a period at the bottom of her bags shed packed a book on coping with stepmotherhood when she came back from ireland she was determined to get it together with marcus and tab wandering into ruperts dressingroom she found him also packing he was catching concorde in the morning i love you she said putting her arms round him you will fly out to ireland when you get back from the states wont you of course said rupert as he hastily flipped a book called overcoming dyslexia under a pile of shirts for a man so confident in business matters freddie jones was surprisingly timid in matters of the heart for months he had longed to ring up lizzie vereker but only screwed up the courage the day declan and cameron left for ireland how about lunch today he said wading straight in wheres valerie asked lizzie in portugal because she had the curse two large spots dirty hair hairy legs unpainted toe nails needed a hundred years to go on a crash diet and had been caught on the hop lizzie said no she was frantically busy then felt absolutely miserable what about next week she asked hopefully valeriell be home said freddie despondently well ring me anyway said lizzie all week lizzie was very absentminded she spilt red wine over a review copy which she hadnt reviewed and which james intended to give to his mother for a birthday present on thursday morning she kept filling up cups of coffee with cold water and even swallowed a conditioning pill herself which shed intended to give to the dog perhaps shed go barking mad she knew she ought to be working on her new book but all she could think about was freddie distracted and miserable she walked in the pouring rain down to the lake a moorhen was summoning her chicks into the rushes with a strange fluted call the beeches trailed their red leaves in the raindroppitted water suddenly lizzie heard shouting from the french windows it was jilly her treasure of a nanny who seemed even more of a treasure when she said mr jones was on the telephone ullo said freddie fort you might like to go for a picnic but its pouring said lizzie joyfully we could ave it indoors at green lawns wheres valerie at the nearly new sale for the distressed gentlefolk anticipating adultery was rather like going to the doctor mused lizzie as she painted her nails washed her hair bathed and shaved and cleaned her ears then she rubbed body lotion into every centimetre of her body one really had to get oneself up the only problem was that she had forgotten that the corinium television gardener one of jamess perks came that morning he must have been amazed to see so many gallons of soapy water gushing into the bathroom drain and to see lizzie emerging so startlingly painted and scented at midday to announce that she was off to the nearly new sale and then going on to do some shopping so would he weed the main herbaceous border which she had already thanked him profusely for weeding last week shed even rung james to tell him she was going to the sale and to ask if he needed anything in cotchester lizzie had had no intention of going to bed with freddie that day she wouldnt have if she hadnt bought a lovely blue tweed skirt for a pound at the clothes stall and passed valerie noisily manning the produce stall on the way out look cried lizzie waving the skirt look at my lovely bargain youll never get into that said valerie crushingly that used to be sarah strattons valerie was looking very sloane lizzie decided in a paleblue cashmere jersey darkblue stockings and gucci shoes with her hair drawn off her forehead in a velvet bow do you know what that absolute swine tony baddingham is threatening to do valerie went on lowering her voice build twenty homes on a field next to our grounds itll ruin our view i mean we are designated an area of outstanding natural beauty he wont get planning permission said lizzie probably will with all those bribes he offers tell james to absolutely refuse to interview any of the planning committee on cotswold roundup so embarrassing when monica and i are such close friends valeries beady eyes fell on lizzies purse now what are you going to buy im sure james likes beetroot slices in vinegar ill give you a penny off ill buy that coffee cake it looks delicious how long are you stuck here for asked lizzie until four oclock said valerie crossly someone has to hold the fort its the fort what counts murmured lizzie i fort you was never coming said freddie as he opened the door in the kitchen was a bottle of dom perignon on ice and a huge plate of smoked salmon freddie had picked ruperts brains about seducing techniques the ideal picnic sighed lizzie i brought us some coffee cake for pudding they stayed in the kitchen in case they messed up the cushions poised on their points on valeries settees briefly they discussed the franchise dyou think youll get it i know we will said freddie now lets talk about us i want to see a great deal of you mrs vereker but it wont be easy wiv tony baddingham an valerie an james breaving down our necks james wont be said lizzie where is he at the moment inside sarah stratton i should think they both roared with laughter and for the first time lizzie found she didnt mind she liked everything about freddie she decided the way his eyes turned down at the corners and his beer gut and the damp patches under his arms because he was so nervous and the way he smoked with his cigar between finger and thumb to eke it out and coiled into the palm of his hand as though he was still hiding it from the foreman who was probably now called valerie as a writer she told herself firmly as freddie led her upstairs one has to experience life all the same she didnt think she would have gone to bed with freddie on that first day and certainly not in valeries bedroom if she hadnt found four of her favourite books in the spare room bookshelf which shed lent to valerie when shed had flu and which valeried sworn shed given back to lizzie when they got upstairs freddie initially seemed far more interested in showing off his gadgets the eighthorsepower jacuzzi and the bath which turned on by remote control and regulated the water from the bed which was huge and oval with its great dashboard of buttons at the head shall we sleep in it whispered lizzie or hijack it and fly it to paradise you do say the loveliest rings said freddie drawing her close his paunch slotted in below her splendid breasts so it was very easy for them to kiss what music would you like asked freddie brahmss second piano concerto said lizzie next moment incredibly it flooded through the room i must have a pee first said lizzie wading through the shagpile to the bathroom ill get undressed said freddie lizzie washed herself with valeries flannel but not too much in case she rubbed away all the lubrication she wanted freddie to know how excited she was for a second she examined the lips of her labia just peering out of her bush like a wrinkled old tortoise then shoved them inside how could men possibly find women beautiful down there would her opening be prettier than valeries she wondered coming out she opened the wrong door and nearly went into the linen cupboard goodness it was tidy as though it had been laid out with a set square adultery certainly taught you about other peoples houses she expected freddie to be completely undressed by the time she got back but he had so much jewellery to remove that she beat him to it ive dreamed and dreamed of this moment said freddie as he stretched out beside her ever since we first met at that unt ball eighteen monfs ago i fort what a lovely lady im so fat sighed lizzie youre not said freddie its much more fun climbing everest than the foothills lizzie put her hand on his cock and its so nice to see software becoming hardware and im going to declare this an area of outstanding natural beauty said freddie reaching for his glass of champagne on the bedside table he emptied it into her bush and proceeded to lick it all off after mousies fragility he reflected as he climbed on top of her it was like having a wonderfully sturdy cob between your thighs i hope youre using a condom perignon mumbled lizzie halflaughing and halfcrying with pleasure as he entered her brahmss second piano concerto was her favourite piece of music but from then on she forgot its existence until the last ecstatic bars of the final allegretto youre absolutely perfick whispered freddie youre the big fing in my life now i love you said lizzie and i love you said freddie afterwards they had another bottle and ate all the coffee cake and longed to make love again but decided it was too risky to establish an alibi lizzie then went shopping in cotchester so drunk and happy she could hardly get the clothes back on the hangers coming out of the chemist having bought a huge guilt present of aramis for james which she thought she might give to freddie she heard a car tooting not being vain she didnt even turn round when it went on tooting and only did so when tony baddingham lowered his electric window and yelled out to her keeping her mouth tight shut so he wouldnt catch the champagne fumes wondering if he could see the words adulterer and traitor branded on her forehead she edged towards him youre looking great said tony smoothly really great must have been a good holiday what have you been buying scent for james said lizzie how very nice said tony and it isnt even his birthday youre a good wife lizzie look forward to seeing you on saturday week saturday said lizzie bewildered sarah strattons dinner party said tony well have a good talk then back at lake house lizzie rushed upstairs washed off all her makeup and scent removed the nail polish from her toes and got into her old clothes in case james came home early fortunately he was very late so she was able to watch almost the entire production of midsummer nights dream by herself it was magical despite titanias bulge and must have won corinium a lot of brownie points in the franchise battle throughout the performance lizzie kept thinking of freddie and how cuddly and sweet and kind hed been and how she wanted him to make love to her over and over again funny goings on at venturer said james in a pleased voice pouring himself an uncharacteristic drink the moment he got in evidently camerons pushed off to ireland with declan and ive just seen bas coming out of the bar sinister with maud funny goings on everywhere thought lizzie dreamily what with james and sarah and her and freddie and rupert probably still hankering after taggie it was as though theyd all been affected by pucks mischievous witchery like the mortals and titania in midsummer nights dream james fell asleep the moment his head touched the pillow i am the mistress of a very nice man wrote lizzie ecstatically in her diary before she turned out the light the first saturday in october taggie overslept working late she hadnt got to bed until four she was just making a cup of coffee when wandering aengus mewing horribly padded in with a live fieldmouse in his mouth beast yelled taggie hurling a dishcloth at him she missed but aengus was so startled he dropped the fieldmouse which took refuge under the dresser having shut the enraged and growling cat in the larder taggie managed to rescue the mouse with a dustpan and brush and put it in a cardboard box dressed in only the briefest nightie and gumboots she carried the box across the lawn to set it free at the edge of the fields very gently she tipped it out but the poor little thing didnt move perhaps it had died of shock next moment she nearly died too coming towards her out of the blue mist across the dewdrenched field on a big sweating darkbrown horse rode rupert as he raised his hat taggie put her finger to her lips and showed him the mouse which was still motionless aengus caught it she whispered dyou think itll survive rupert privately thought a quick shove with his boot would put the mouse out of its misery but knowing this would upset taggie said it might just be frozen with fear and why didnt they leave it for a bit gazing at taggies nightgown and gumboots he asked her if she was going out taggie went crimson and said shed been doing a late dinner party there was a long pause casting desperately round for something to say taggie mumbled that it was a nice day very ive been cubbing said rupert oh poor little things said taggie in horror did you kill any no lied rupert i brought you these he went on producing some huge mushrooms out of his ridingcoat pocket oh arent they beautiful distracted taggie examined their pleated pink undersides how really kind thank you so much anyone would have thought hed given her another fabergé egg thought rupert stammering furiously she asked him if hed like some breakfast i hoped youd say that ill drop off my horse and come back taggie raced upstairs and was appalled to see that her nightie had a huge tear her eyes were full of sleep and her mascara was all smudged frantically she washed put on an old pair of black sawnoff cords and a darkbrown tshirt which seemed to be the only things maud hadnt pinched and started cooking breakfast she steeled herself to the possibility that rupert would get caught up in some drama at the yard or at home and forget to return or that maud smelling frying bacon would come down and join them but he was back in a quarter of an hour with a bottle of champagne for bucks fizz and maud stayed upstairs perfecting a song called jogging in a onehorse gig she really is working at it said rupert edging the bottle open with his thumbs its wonderful shes so much happier said taggie thinking how black and luscious the white mushrooms had gone and tipping most of them onto ruperts plate i hope tony baddingham and your father dont bump into each other on the first night said rupert as the cork flew through the window into the long grass outside or either your mother or monica really will be a merry widow he picked up the guardian which had a grim frontpage story about the rocketing aids figures thank god hed had that test it was such a lovely day they had breakfast outside on the peeling white bench despite the warmth the cedars wellingtonias and yews flanking the house were already full of orange leaves from the nearby horse chestnuts and the ground was littered with conkers lavender roses and evening primroses still bloomed on bravely waiting for the first frost ive never felt such hot sun in october said rupert taking off his jersey with a few more leaves off the trees ill be able to see your house again how was america asked taggie dividing her bacon rind between a slavering gertrude and claudius good said rupert deciding not to mention four magnificent days hunting in virginia ive found a marvellous stallion and a brood mare for freddie which reminds me i saw freddies red jaguar parked outside mrs verekers house while cotswold roundup was on the air last night if hes going to err and stray he ought to find a more discreet car taggie giggled lizzies so nice isnt she she said breaking a sausage in half for the dogs she certainly deserves some fun james treats her like an old wheelchair he can fall back into in old age this breakfast is quite marvellous why are you giving all yours to the dogs i dont usually eat breakfast mumbled taggie taking a slug of bucks fizz rupert ran his eyes over her youre losing weight ill have to start adding molasses and carrots to your oats jogging in a onehorse gig any time of night or day sang maud from upstairs careless of the weather very close together lovers fall in love that way rupert raised his eyebrows and filled up taggies glass please god she prayed make this moment go on for ever and ever the next moment gertrude had joined them on the bench seat on taggies side not giving herself enough room so taggie had to move closer to rupert well done gertrude said rupert grinning you really are on my side taggies heart seemed to be beating completely out of time to mauds singing frantically she stroked gertrude heard from your father asked rupert no stammered taggie have you heard from cameron not recently there was another long pause a conker plummeted on to the shaggy lawn laughing and watching her rupert waited you mustnt worry about daddy and cameron being on their own together for so long taggie finally blurted out i know daddys wildly attractive but he is utterly obsessed with mummy rupert was about to deny that he was remotely worried about cameron instead he removed a long dark hair from her shoulder and put it in his shirt pocket i dreamed about you last night you did said taggie in amazement was it nice lovely and extremely disturbing he trailed the back of his fingers down her arm taggie quivered and stopped stroking gertrude its the last night of the horse of the year show tonight went on rupert tabithas in the final of the mounted games its a good evening why dont you come with me we could have dinner afterwards taggie nearly wept sarah strattons giving a dinner party ive got to work pity said rupert lightly gertrude stuck her nose under taggies trembling hand jerking it upwards urging taggie to stroke her again gertrude and me thought rupert the baddinghams and the verekers are going so theyll all talk about the franchise ill probably be made to stay in the kitchen babbled taggie well keep your ears open and put a pint of arsenic in tonys whisky they certainly wont get bucks fizz like this tonight pauls so mean he makes it with babycham damn damn damn thought taggie as she followed him to the door im off to the tory party conference next week said rupert getting into his car ill ring you when i get back that was a lovely breakfast thank you by the way he added ultracasually as he drove off i hope you noticed i didnt burn my stubble this year in a complete daze taggie finished off the bucks fizz rupert had dreamt about her and hed asked her out and he hadnt burnt his stubble the whole thing was desperately confusing she ran upstairs and looked out of her window it was true instead of charred patches all over the valley his cornfields were still yellowed by stubble or reddybrown after being ploughed up she couldnt possibly be the reason but it was so nice of him to say so there were so many things she ought to do picking apples planting the indoor bulbs getting in the geraniums there were large bowls of picked mulberries and blackberries reproachfully gathering fluff in the fridge waiting to be turned into jam and she must make some tomato chutney not to mention painting the bench and mowing the lawn suddenly she heard an enraged mewing from the larder shed forgotten aengus she couldnt even get cross that hed eaten half the turbot mousse shed made for the first course this evening at least when she went out to search for the fieldmouse it had run away by the time shed reached the strattons house shed sobered up paul was still out playing golf sarah was in a panic because she wanted everything to be perfect for tony her boss and even more so for james giving a dinner party is far worse than going on television she moaned look i know it sounds horrendously valerie jones but do you mind pretending ive done the cooking tonight especially the main course which is a particular favourite of a friend of mine added sarah going pink if anyone rings pretend youre our daily mrs maggs then leaving taggie with a milelong list of instructions she swanned off to bath to buy a new dress at least everything was tidy the table laid and the house clean taggie got out the french recipe that rupert had translated for her an hour and a half later she was getting on well the beef daube was sizzling in the oven the pudding was in the fridge and just needed whipped cream and sugared violets and shed done the vegetables earlier all she had to do was to make another fish mousse perhaps shed just better doublecheck the beef oh my god she said aghast as she licked the spoon she tried again from the other side of the dish and then the centre where it was even worse she must have been so distracted by her encounter with rupert that shed added a tablespoonful of salt instead of sugar she tested the sugar in the glass bowl and went green it was definitely salt the beef was quite inedible absolutely impregnated with salt and shed used up all the other ingredients it was after five and shed never get to cotchester in time she gave a whimper of horror shed wrecked sarahs party and she knew sarah could be extremely difficult if things didnt go right the telephone rang oh god she sobbed ive got to remember to be the daily trembling she picked up the receiver hullo crackled a voice from a car telephone mrs stratton be shopping thank you very much who be you mumbled taggie rupert laughed that is the worst gloucestershire accent ive ever heard hows it going taggie burst into tears it was jamess favourite recipe and shes supposed to have made it for him she sobbed cheer up or youll cry more salt into the beef said rupert calmly get on with the fish mousse ill be over in half an hour he arrived twentyfive minutes later he screeched the astonmartin to a halt in a cloud of dust and nearly tipped beaver and blue who were sitting on the back seat through the windscreen then he sauntered into the kitchen with a huge casserole dish containing boeuf bourguignon for twelve from luigis the local fivestar restaurant in cheltenham oh youre lovely said taggie flinging her arms round his neck hands off weve no time for dalliance said rupert briskly as he emptied the bourguignon into one of sarahs big bowls and chucked taggies salty remnants into luigis casserole dish dont tell paul and sarah what happened he added just pretend this is how the recipe turned out theyll all be too pissed to notice anyway id better beat it or shell be back from shopping and start accusing me of bugging the room still stammering her thanks taggie followed him out to the car an owl was hooting a semicircle of orange moon was rising out of the sycamores the moon was a mandarin segment as valerie jones would say said rupert i cant ever begin to thank you bleated taggie rupert pulled her towards him dropping a kiss on her cheekbone oh yes you can angel just wait till i get back from blackpool the patron saint of cooking guided taggie that evening the food was positively ambrosial and sarah took all the credit particularly for luigis boeuf bourguignon which was so tender you could cut it with a spoon dyou remember that daube we had at the white elephant at painswick whispered sarah to james as they went in to dinner well i wrote to them for the recipe and ive made it for you tonight putting on his hornrimmed spectacles to have a closer look across the table tony baddingham decided he hadnt been wrong about lizzie vereker whether it was the marbella sun or a stone off or just some new inner contentment she looked sensational the talk during dinner was mostly of the rocketing aids figures they also drank to master dog which was edging up on eastenders in the ratings but they waited until taggie was safely out of the room to discuss the franchise there are some quite fascinating developments tony said tantalizingly but im not prepared to leak them until november when itll be nearer the iba meetings and people are properly back from their holidays and reading newspapers again and then my god venturer will wish theyd never tried to take us on he paused as taggie came in with the salad not that she would have taken anything in that night in the kitchen she was frantically trying to watch the horse of the year show hoping to catch a glimpse of rupert at least she saw tabitha in the mounted games utterly adorable and so like rupert as she jumped up and down waiting for the baton then grabbing it and scorching up the arena the finals were just coming up when sarah summoned taggie to clear away the pudding by this time tony was banging on about aids again by the year unless we get our act together in this country well have sixteen million cases the message from america is loud and clear affairs are passé he gazed down the table monogamy and fidelity in marriage are in fashion again its vital that everyone is made aware of the dangers of aids its up to us at corinium to set the ball rolling james felt that sarah had been so very very caring to go to all that trouble with the daube that in the hall after dinner he was foolish enough to behave in a thoroughly unmonogamous fashion and be caught by tony not only kissing her but putting his hand inside her new silk dress on monday morning tony summoned james to his office ive been thinking a lot about our conversation about aids on saturday night he began briskly ive decided its time for you to have your own series which well almost certainly sell to the network thats very good of you tony said james i want to make a series examining all aspects of marriage went on tony financial dual careers how much housework should the caring husband do rattled off james excitedly sex rows decorating the house thats right said tony we could perhaps even introduce children and the pressures they put on a marriage but basically the whole series will be aimed at couples who are getting behind marriage again who want to avoid aids by staying with the same person for the rest of their lives well call it how to stay married with the aids panic itll be a real franchisegrabber said james excitedly exactly said tony urbanely and i want you and a very charming lady not far from your heart to front it i dont even have to guess tony said james warmly but dyou realty feel shes experienced enough more important said tony who was enjoying himself shes a natural shes not too obviously glamorous but shes got just the right kind of lovely warm bubbly personality thatll make couples talk and trigger off a really good audience reaction james bowed his head i know sarah will appreciate the very great honour youre bestowing on her tony both to combat aids and to help corinium retain the franchise im not talking about sarah you berk said tony icily i mean your wife lizzie and if you value your job the less you see of mrs stratton over the next three months the better taggie spent the next week dreaming of rupert she knew he loved and lived with cameron who would be back in a week or so but she couldnt help herself on thursday she watched him on television at the party conference making a brilliant speech saying that the tories must get off their fat backsides and start thinking positively about unemployment and the way it directly affected hooliganism and rioting in the inner cities taggie detecting declans influence felt very proud on friday night a slight distraction was provided by caitlin coming home for a long weekend with her black hair dyed white at the front still utterly besotted with archie he went into the town and brought eighty cans of beer back in a taxi and smuggled them in and sold them to the other boys on the black market in order to buy me this gorgeous jersey i havent taken it off since he sent it me so please can you wash it tonight and my black jeans so i can wear them tomorrow archies taking me out to lunch whats mummy doing for the rest of the day rehearsing i think said taggie exactly on cue maud wandered in looking radiant hullo darling hows school ghastly anyone with layered hair is being sent home so im going to get mine layered on monday ive bought some apples said maud waving a large paper bag at taggie theyre so cheap in the market and they cost nothing in the orchard thudding on to the grass every two minutes taggie wanted to scream she wanted to murder her mother sometimes thats a nice jersey said maud looking at caitlin where did you get it it was a present said caitlin noncommittally you will wash it carefully wont you tag hows the merry widow she asked her mother oh exhausting but fun said maud pouring herself a large whisky i er thought i might go to the cinema with some of the cast tomorrow night she added casually taggies cooking will you be all right on your own caitlin brilliant beamed caitlin stay out as long as you like ive got masses of work have dinner and make a night of it ive got to read antony and cleopatra and write an essay on streetcar named desire i think its extraordinary that they shut us up in singlesex schools and then give us these amazingly erotic set books by the time taggie had cleared up supper and washed and ironed caitlins jersey and jeans and put them in the hot cupboard it was two oclock in the morning admittedly her progress had been slowed up by constantly looking out of the window to watch for ruperts helicopter landing on the lawn or his car coming up the drive but there was nothing perhaps hed gone to ireland to see cameron after all it seemed shed hardly fallen asleep when she was roused by an hysterical caitlin that bugger mummy used all the water so i cant wash my hair or have a bath and even worse shes gone off in my new jersey and jeans and now i cant wear it for archie and hell never believe i havent lost it like desdemonas handkerchief i hate hate hate her bloody old cow and shes bound to split my jeans ill run you into cotchester and buy you something else said taggie i got paid in cash yesterday its no good screamed caitlin i wanted archie to see me in his jersey ill kill her ill absolutely kill her nothing taggie could say would calm her down ill ring up rupert and see if you can have a bath there said taggie in the end throat dry heart thumping hands drenched in sweat and trembling taggie misdialled the number three times in her nervousness when rupert didnt answer immediately she nearly put the telephone down hullo he sounded irritable and very sleepy its taggie my darling his voice softened im desperately sorry she began then stammering worse than ever she explained what had happened but didnt mention archies name could i possibly rush caitlin over to wash her hair and have a bath of course said rupert as long as we can all have it together rupert hadnt shaved when they arrived he was wandering around in bare feet having obviously just put on the white shirt and the black dinnerjacket trousers hed been wearing last night he looked bugeyed i wont stop mumbled taggie desperate not to impose on him ill pick caitlin up in an hour ok rupert pulled her into the house dont be boring as im such a notorious reprobate you ought to stay and chaperone caitlin caitlin promptly started raging on about maud bloody old cow nicking all the water and my seducing kit what does she want with it i bet shes up to someone the old tart its high time my father came home caitlin remonstrated taggie going pink rupert hasnt got all day i thought you wanted to be ready by twelve go and have a bath grinning rupert took caitlin upstairs and showed her where everything was taggie glanced at some photographs of tabitha at wembley which were lying on the kitchen table arent these gorgeous she said as rupert came back i saw a bit of it on television at sarah strattons but i missed the final did her team win no but they came third and she did well horse and hound described her as a chip off the old campbellblack which was nice marvellous said taggie am i in your way she asked as rupert paused on his way to the fridge no i just like standing behind you i know youll spring to her defence but your mother is an absolute disgrace swanning off with all caitlins clothes at her age mauds trouble is that she wants to have her cake and eat it and make trifle out of it as well taggie giggled but she said i know but its such a relief that shes happy and working again she might even start doing it professionally and shes so beautiful taggie sighed its hardly surprising all the casts in love with her rupert privately deduced that maud must be in love with one of the cast to have lost enough weight to get into caitlins jeans but merely said ive got a hangover lets have a drink i mustnt said taggie or ill make another cockup of cooking tonight dont say youre working again said rupert appalled taggie nodded dolefully jesus said rupert id better make a date with you for next october im so sorry stammered taggie hanging her head its nnot that i wouldnt love to ive got an idea said rupert my children are coming over this afternoon why dont you come out with us for the day tomorrow and help me entertain them ill make a picnic said taggie suddenly excited no you wont for once youre not going to cook a thing with both maud and caitlin plundering her wardrobe taggie was at her wits end as to what to wear feeling desperately guilty with the electricity board the television hire firm the village shop and god knows who else baying to be paid she blued or rather greyed friday lunchtimes cash wages on a palegrey cashmere poloneck which brought out the silvergrey in her eyes and clung to her in all the right places there was no more money so shed have to wear her old black cords next morning maud whizzed off very early to yet another rehearsal caitlin who nobly said shed dogs it and read antony and cleopatra hustled taggie out of the house you look delectable randy rupe wont be able to keep his hands off you dont hurry back im quite ok on my own she smirked wickedly or almost on my own the hon arch will be dropping by plus tard or marble arch as i call him now hes lost his suntan tabitha amid the swirling pack of dogs answered the door looking belligerent she was wearing a pink sweater embroidered with blue flowers and a blue puffball skirt hullo said taggie in delight i recognize you you were on television last saturday you were wonderful and what a beautiful clever pony he was much the fastest whats his name biscuit said tabitha coldly can i see him hes at my other house oh what a shame ive brought him some carrots taggie rummaged round in a carrier bag and ive made you some fudge thank you said tab looking slightly mollified can i have a bit now i dont see why not i like your puffball skirt i wanted to get one but my knees are far too knobbly mummy says hers are too said tab perhaps theyre not suitable for grownups stroking the dogs taggie sat down on one of the stone seats inside the porch whats your name again said tabitha taggie its really agatha isnt that awful tabithas so much nicer my parents call me tag sometimes which sounds just like tab doesnt it i expect when marcus shouts tab well both go charging into the kitchen to see what he wants and bump into each other in the doorway tabitha stared at her consideringly and suddenly she smiled and youre nine and a quarter said taggie yes sighed tab pushing her blonde hair out of her eyes cant you see my wrinkles taggie giggled still its awfully young to be in the mounted games were you the youngest yes said tab if you come back to warwickshire with us tonight you can see biscuit weve got a foal here would you like to come and see it yes please said taggie the front door opened it was marcus hullo he said daddy wants to know where youve got to shes talking to me stupid said tab shes brought you some fudge tag bellowed rupert from the kitchen where are you here said tab and tag in unison then they both looked at each other and burst out laughing taking taggies hand tabitha dragged her into the kitchen can she come back to warwickshire with us this evening and see biscuit said tabitha rupert who was drinking black coffee and reading the racing pages of the sunday times looked surprised of course she can i thought youd kidnapped her shes brought us fudge and carrots for biscuit and a big bottle of cough mixture said tabitha unpacking the carrier bag its sloe gin said taggie blushing i made it yesterday you mustnt drink it for three months thank you angel said rupert kissing her on the cheek i hope i dont have to wait that long for you he murmured in an undertone come on taggie said tabitha impatiently i thought you wanted to see the foal this fudge is smashing they had lunch in cheltenham in an upmarket hamburger bar the children who insisted on sitting on either side of taggie had huge milkshakes rupert who complained he had alcohol shakes ordered a carafe of red that jersey suits you he said approvingly to taggie how dyou manage to keep it out of mauds clutches taggie blushed i slept with it under my pillow were doing a messiah at the end of term announced tabitha sucking air noisily from the bottom of her milkshake there are going to be two trumpets and a drum and real fathers in the chorus im in the altos theyre much naughtier because theyre mostly boys silly twits dyou like singing asked taggie no mrs brown takes us shes just got married she takes us for history too she was reading a book called improving your home in class this week she was reading a book about drains in our class said marcus and thats what i pay your school fees for grumbled rupert i wish theyd organize a sponsored walk to save the parents having ordered he looked across at taggie who was talking to marcus about conkers we used to roast them slowly in the oven to harden them up we soak them in vinegar said marcus my sister caitlin used to put them in the hot cupboard and they always fell down behind the boiler and went mouldy weve got masses at the priory if you want any more but i expect youve got hundreds already christ shes sweet thought rupert noticing the way the grey cashmere moulded the full breasts mary had a little lamb and surprised the midwife said tabitha to her father really said rupert absentmindedly mary had a little lamb and surprised the midwife its a joke ha ha said rupert filling up taggies glass why dyou always say ha ha and not mean it can i have a packet of frazzles no said rupert heres your lunch can i have punk hair like cameron said tabitha picking bits of mushroom out of her salad and putting them round the edge of her plate no why not because i dont like short hair youve got very nice hair said marcus to taggie blushing scarlet as he bit into his hamburger yes agreed rupert she has tabitha gazed dreamily into space mrs bodkin must have slept with mr bodkin an awful lot of times what on earth makes you think that asked rupert in amazement she told me shed had four miscarriages said tab taggie didnt dare look at rupert she thought she had never been happier in her life suddenly the most ordinary things a hamburger smothered in tomato ketchup the mural of the village street round the wall with its milk cart and postman were illuminated because she was with rupert and these adorable children everything all right meester campbellblack asked the manager perfect said rupert could we have another carafe of red i would like to congratulate you went on the manager looking round rapturously at marcus tab and taggie i never knew you haff three such beautiful children after lunch they went for a walk in ruperts woods it was ridiculously mild insects moved leisurely in the rays slanting through the thinning beech trees like specks of dust caught in the light from a projector birds sang drowsily orange leaves drifted down on to already orange paths the squirrels stupefied by the sun were fooling around on the ground instead of gathering nuts what are you singing at school asked taggie green grow the rushesoh said tab ill sing you threeoh sang marcus what is your threeoh sang back tab three for the rivals two two the lilywhite boys clothed all in greeno replied marcus his pure treble echoing through the soaring cathedral of beech trunks then both children took up the chant one is one and all alone and ever more shall be so lovely sighed taggie three for the rivals sounds like corinium venturer and midwest said rupert he used up a couple of reels of film then exhausted after a strenuous week at blackpool fell asleep under a chestnut tree while taggie played games with the children dyou know she said drawing them away down the ride so they wouldnt wake rupert that every time you catch a falling leaf you get a happy day lets see if we can catch thirty so we can give daddy a really happy november when he wakes up easy peasy said tabitha leaping forward as a yellow sycamore leaf pirouetted through the air towards her then caught by a puff of wind dummied round her and fluttered to the ground its harder than it looks panted marcus reaching out as a twig of ash leaves floated tantalizingly out of his grasp would those have counted as seven not really said taggie bugger screamed tab as she just missed a beech leaf hush said taggie we mustnt wake daddy silently they raced round the wood trying to suppress their screams of joy whenever they managed to catch a leaf after a particularly piercing yell when tab tripped over a bramble cable but managed to hang on to a wand of chestnut leaves rupert woke up but he pretended to be asleep watching taggie gambolling longlegged over the beech leaves ponytail flying looking as the manager had thought not a day over fourteen he was suddenly kneed in the groin with longing here you are daddy said tabitha her hands full of leaves a whole happy month for you rupert who privately thought that the only thing that could make him happy at the moment was a whole month in bed with taggie said thank you very much can we go and see the new woody allen asked tabitha rupert looked at his watch its nearly four oclock youll be very late back the last thing he wanted to do was to go to the cinema we can go on our way home pleaded tabitha weve done our homework said marcus rupert turned to taggie who said shed adore to see it anything to prolong the day with rupert im going to sit next to taggie said tabitha seizing her hand im going to sit next to her too said marcus taking her other hand if she sits on my knee you can both sit next to her said rupert severely jolted he felt it was increasingly necessary to make a joke about the whole thing the woody allen was extremely funny but taggie hardly took any of it in she was so aware of rupert slumped in the seat beyond tabitha gazing totally unmoved at the screen how awful for rupert being left by helen and losing these heavenly children living alone by himself in that big house one is one and all alone and ever more shall be so sang tabitha as they drove home taggie felt ruperts loss far more acutely when she met helen who was simply the most beautiful woman shed ever seen with huge serious yellow eyes and long red hair drawn back in two combs from her freckled face and incredibly slim ankles and wrists she had the same colouring as maud reflected taggie but while maud cavorted untrainably through life like a red setter bestowing her favours indiscriminately helen would be far more fastidious and sparing with her affections helen was like a red deer if you tamed and won the confidence of anything so delicate and nervous youd feel incredibly proud but before she had much time to observe helen or her husband malise who seemed very old taggie was dragged off to the stables by tabitha to meet biscuit and dollop then she had to see marcuss room and then tabithas room both extraordinarily tidy in fact the whole house was incredibly tidy for a sunday evening by which time it was well past the childrens bedtime back in the drawingroom taggie found helen tapping her beautifully shod foot and looking at the clock and rupert standing in front of an unlit fire holding an empty glass and looking absolutely glazed what would you like to drink malise asked taggie taggie glanced at rupert who almost imperceptibly moved his head in the direction of the door nothing thank you very much she said we must go said rupert ive got to get this child home so the day was to end just like that taggie suddenly felt suicidal malise seeming to sense her depression said helen and i are tremendous fans of your fathers i do hope he gets the franchise coriniums programmes are absolutely ghastly oh the dream was excellent the other night protested helen marcus said cameron cook had something to do with that rupert you must bring her over sometime id love to discuss the production with her it was a most original interpretation they set it in victorian england and had some fascinating parallels between queen victoria and john brown and titania and bottom rupert stifled a huge yawn i think taggie and rupert want to go darling said malise gently putting his arm round helens shoulders he has the most charming smile thought taggie i can see why she finds him attractive but not compared with rupert and he is terribly old the children came to see them off promise promise we can see you next time we come over said tabitha clinging to her like a monkey thank you so much for the fudge said marcus rupert is awful said helen having packed the children upstairs to have baths that girl must still be at school shes a bit older than that but not much said malise straightening the sunday papers dyou know she gives me the same ghastly sense of forboding i had when i first met you i hope you havent fallen in love with her too said helen somewhat too archly no one just knows hes going to break her heart said malise grimly and feels powerless to do anything about it he may have mellowed said helen shes the first girl hes ever brought here and the kids obviously adore her malise shook his head hes like a hound you cant domesticate him huntingll always be in his blood rupert was very quiet on the drive back to penscombe taggie feeling utterly miserable because the day was almost over and the astonmartin seemed to be gobbling up the miles assumed he was merely depressed because his ravishing wife and children didnt live with him any more rupert however for the first time in his life was battling seriously with his conscience taggie was declans teenage daughter he was committed to cameron who was already paranoid about taggie and there were deadly serious things like franchises to be won then in the light from a streetlamp in cheltenham he caught sight of taggie everything seemed to turn upwards her nose her long sooty eyelashes her adorably short upper lip and those beautifully soft breasts which hed dreamed of the other night his conscience lost would you like some dinner oh yes please said taggie joyfully if youre sure youre not too tired and i look smart enough never never get smart said rupert i loathe doneup women theyre such adorable children said taggie and so beautiful not surprising really with such a beautiful mother in the darkness of the car now they were out of the town it seemed easier to talk is it absolutely agony every time you see her again agony said rupert soulfully then shooting a sideways glance at taggie he explained because she bores the fucking tits off me taggie gave a gasp of shocked laughter i cant think how the hell i stayed married to her for seven years while you were upstairs she gave me the entire plot of the italian film theyd seen that afternoon and if malise hadnt shut her up wed have had a fiveact analysis of midsummer nights dream how he puts up with it he seems very nice said taggie but hes almost like a grandfather to the children thirty years older than helen said rupert but hes made her very happy and what happened to you after she walked out asked taggie oh well i had one or two fish of my own i was frying at the time admitted rupert but the fat began to spit too much so i backed off then i had a long stint with an engaging tramp called beattie johnson and then a few games of tennis with sarah stratton oh god moaned taggie rupert laughed im halftempted to stop the car and see how much youre blushing were you terribly shocked when you saw us yes no yes mumbled taggie more for gertrude really shes led such a sheltered life it must have been awful all those fire engines turning up we were bloody lucky said rupert cameron tells me that the corinium newsroom give the cotchester fire brigade so much booze at christmas that invariably the firemen tip them off and keep their hoses running until the television crew arrive sarah and i in the buff would have been a sensation on cotswold roundup taggie giggled she didnt like to tell him how much in the last few months the memory of his oiled mahoganytanned wonderfully constructed body had haunted her dreams the white elephant at painswick was packed and taking last orders but still managed to find a corner for rupert taggie fled to the loo all she had in her bag was a defunct mascara wand a comb some scent and a picture of claudius if only she could clean her teeth she made do with soaking the roller towel rubbing some soap on it rubbing her teeth then rinsing her mouth out with water then she detangled her hair and put it back in its ponytail when she got back to the table rupert realizing she would be totally floored by the french menu had ordered a bottle of pouilly fumé and smoked salmon and scrambled eggs for both of them and youre going to eat the lot at first they discussed the children i wish they got on better with cameron sighed rupert but being totally unused to children she makes neither extra beds nor allowances it was good that they could talk about cameron naturally now thought taggie suddenly longing to touch the fan of fine lines at the corner of ruperts eyes perhaps she could become his longterm confidante and even when he was eighty hed come roaring over to the priory and tell her hed met some marvellous new fiftyyearold at least itd be better than not seeing him does it still upset you going to the horse of the year show when youre not winning all the cups any more she asked tentatively yes he said thats why i wanted you to come along last week he took her hand to hold my hand i dont think i realized at the time how desperately i minded giving up just stopping overnight after the world championship burying myself in politics refusing to recognize i was suffering from withdrawal symptoms far worse than any junkie theres so little time to think while youre show jumping even on those interminable drives there was always billy to yak to or some horse to natter about always something to look forward to a prize to be won someone elses time to be beaten a horse to be sorted out a girl to be laid i suppose i never gave myself time to grow up and when helen buggered off i blocked that out too still holding her hand he looked into her loving infinitely understanding and sympathetic eyes christ hed never admitted things like this to anyone not even billy then she asked the same question does it still hurt seeing helen rupert shrugged i got bored with hating her i guess the only thing that really irks me is that malise succeeded where i failed i cant honestly say ive ever made any woman happy or not for very long you make me very happy said taggie gruffly for a second they gazed at each other and he watched the colour mounting in her cheeks id like to try he said softly ill just pay the bill and well go as he drove her slowly back to penscombe chris de burgh was singing lady in red on the car radio it was such a beautiful night the moon was hiding behind a vast ebony cloud shaped like a yew tree tipping its edges with silver the rest of the pearly grey sky was threaded with stars a few windows were still lit up in the village like cardboard cutouts just before he reached the right turn up the long chestnut avenue to penscombe court rupert slowed the car down almost to a standstill and raised a finger to taggies cheek are you quite sure angel he could feel her cheekbone rubbing frantically against his finger as she nodded totally adrift with love she had no thought of refusing fucking hell howled rupert as they drew up outside the house parked outside beside taggies car was a lotus in the moonlight it could have been any dark colour cameron thought taggie in horror but the girl who came out of the front door had thick lustrous hair as golden yellow as the sycamore leaves swirling across the gravel it was sarah stratton sobbing she threw herself into ruperts arms i must talk to you i must go said taggie no dont said rupert sharply then realizing what he was saying added well it is a bit late well check through the rest of those names tomorrow and well tackle the southern part of the region later in the week oh the fucking franchise screamed sarah leaving time only to squeeze taggies hand and say hed ring her tomorrow rupert took sarah into the drawingroom where she collapsed sobbing on the sofa the temperature suddenly seemed to have dropped several degrees the house felt horribly cold and empty without taggie and the children it was a few minutes before he could get any sense out of sarah evidently james vereker had given her the bullet tony ordered him to he said everyone was gossiping about me and james and it doesnt do coriniums reputation any good in a franchise year jesus and when you think of the way he was carrying on with cameron was is the operative word said rupert pouring sarah a glass of brandy theres no prude like a reformed rake i know james loves me sobbed sarah hysterically but that shit tony offered him the carrot of his own thirteenpart series on staying married and ordered him to front it with lizzie tonys convinced the iba will adore the idea what with all this panic about aids rupert whistled thats quite shrewd so james and the podgy frump have to present a loveydovey united front until the franchise is in the bag and james is going to go along with it ambition should be made of sterner stuffing said rupert idly and hows lizzie taking it oh lapping it up i should think said sarah viciously must be the first time anyones slept with her in yonks hum thought rupert well youll just have to be a bit more discreet until after th december he said thats what i said but james is refusing even to have a drink with me if i talk to him in the passage at corinium he scuttles off like a daddy longlegs he wont even gossip during the break in roundup i know hes vain and ambitious but i love him i cant live without him her voice rose to a shriek slumped on the sofa in a ruckedup amber miniskirt and a saffron yellow jersey with her tousled tawny hair and her tearstreaked face sarah should have been the epitome of desirability but comparing her hard petulant demanding little face to taggies so sweet so infinitely kind and gentle rupert wondered how the hell hed ever fancied her i cant live without him sarah repeated shrilly ill never get over it i hate to point it out said rupert but you said exactly the same thing to me after christmas and youve got over me pretty thoroughly and no doubt when paul thought he ought to do his duty and stay with winifred you said the same thing to him you cant compare the two said sarah furiously ive just spent a whole weekend with paul she added with a shudder pauls palled has he said rupert topping up her glass i cant stand living with him a moment longer he wont stop pawing me wailed sarah and hes so old i mean hes nineteen years older than me it was all right when i started working for him i was twenty and he was thirtynine and he seemed so wonderfully forceful and dynamic and experienced but now im twentynine and hes fortyeight and his bodys going and he looks all grey and rumpled when he wakes in the morning and he wears cornplasters and snows scurf on his suits and hes always clearing his throat and picking his nose behind the ft and peering at me over his spectacles sarahs voice rose to a screech again as she catalogued his crimes i cant stand it mindlessly rupert patted her heaving shoulder as he bleakly worked out that the age gap between him and taggie was exactly the same or would be when he was thirtyeight next month gradually sarah stopped crying the one thing that puts men off is scenes said rupert youll just have to grin and not bare it until th december everyones going to be behaving in a pretty tense way for the next two months i honestly cant see james and lizzies rapprochement lasting very long and at least if you concentrate on your career at corinium youll be able to support yourself you wont be able to afford two hunters a lotus and jasper conran dresses if tony kicks you out which he will do if you dont leave verekaring alone sarah sat up and rubbed the mascara from under her eyes i suppose id better seduce tony but hes got one cloven hoof in the grave too you and cameron are so lucky being near in age then her eyes narrowed and while were on that subject what were you doing rolling up with the galloping gormless just now ruperts mind raced hed got to kill that rumour stone dead if sarah told tony hed been out with taggie tonyd make sure it went straight back in a wildly exaggerated form to cameron i had the children for the weekend he said carefully camerons away so taggie was helping me amuse them shes nearer their age well thats a relief said sarah i thought for one ghastly moment you were after her as well i mean shes simply not up to it very sweet and all but not very bright a bit loco james thinks the last thing she needs is a lascivious old ram like you youd crucify her anyway youre far too old itd be just like paul and me in a few years time it was like a dentist hitting a raw nerve with a highspeed drill rupert never dreamed remarks could hurt him quite so much mercifully he was saved by the telephone then the dentist seemed to hit another nerve christ ive missed you said camerons seductive rasp sorry i havent called but weve been up to here perry odonovans such an asshole and he cant stand esther mcdermott shes an asshole too and theyve both had such rows with declan hes walked off the set twice so its all going as planned said rupert as cameron rattled on about the cockups and frustrations of filming all he could hear was prison doors clanging shut on him so weve managed to finish a day early she said finally god what a bore said rupert who hadnt been listening sweetest this is a terrible line i said ill be coming home a day early declan and i are flying in tomorrow great said rupert feeling sick ill come and meet you no ive got the car at the airport ill see you late afternoon and darling her voice dropped huskily ive been celibate for three weeks weve got a lot of catching up to do so cancel any appointments for the rest of the day i love you me too said rupert automatically good said sarah as rupert put down the receiver and went and poured himself a large whisky an absolute bastard like you needs an utter bitch like her to keep you in order after shed left rupert couldnt face going to bed he took the dogs into the garden as they weaved about snuffling and barking after badgers and masochistically lifting their legs on rose bushes he looked across the valley the moon had set black clouds covered the sky a chill wind was shepherding beech leaves irritably across the lawn the priory was in darkness except for one light in taggies bedroom rupert almost wept he longed to ring her now to explain why he wouldnt be ringing her tomorrow or any day after that but he didnt dare in case he weakened sarah was right he was too old too shopsoiled too reprobate hed only bring her unhappiness besides cameron was coming home tomorrow and he couldnt jeopardize the franchise by risking her running back to tony it was his fault hed gone into the whole thing with his flies open not only had the prison door clanged shut but he could hear a huge key turning for ever in the lock one is one and all alone and ever more shall be so he thought despairingly across at the priory by some lucky chance a starryeyed but slightly sheepish maud swanned in at five to twelve just in time to take a telephone call from declan saying he was coming home tomorrow cameron would drop him off and bar fogs or airport strikes he would be with her by twilight all next day taggie waited for rupert to ring and by some vicious twist of fate as she cleaned the house and cautiously dusted and hoovered round the chaos of precious papers in her fathers study and put clean sheets on her parents bed the telephone rang incessantly but it was only archie ringing once again to say goodbye to caitlin or members of the cast ringing for maud or every member of venturer ringing to ask whether declan was back each time taggie pounced on the telephone and each time like a stray dog dumped bewildered on the motorway hoping each passing car might be her master returning when it wasnt rupert she slunk back in utter despair and as the day ebbed so did her hopes once cameron was home he wouldnt ring the weather had changed too and as the grey skies closed in on the october afternoon the black tracery of ivy fretted against the casement windows and sharp bitter winds swept the leaves from the lime walk and drove them in withered heaps along the dry gravel paths however many jerseys she put on however much she raced about the house taggie was still cold while upstairs maud oiled and scented herself for declans return no doubt leaving a horrible mess both in the bathroom and bedroom which taggie had just cleaned in the kitchen having put some green tomato chutney to cook on the aga taggie was trying to find a place on caitlins incredibly skimpy pants to sew a name tape caitlin having scattered breadcrumbs all over the dresser dumped papers and magazines on the table left the orange juice carton out and her scrambledegg pan unwashed in the sink was now peeling an orange give me to drink mandragora that i might sleep out this great gap of time my archie is away she moaned one day youll be sewing the name caitlin baddingham and a coronet on my pants dont you think ill make a good lady baddingham she dropped a deep curtsey im going to bunk out of school next weekend so i can see him i wouldnt said taggie breaking off a thread with her teeth youll get expelled and its bound to get in the papers oh for gods sake she snapped as caitlin dropped her orange peel on the table cant you ever throw anything in the bin dont nag said caitlin when i grow up im going to live in a really messy house what happens when you meet a fantastic man at a party and want to bring him back for a cup of coffee afterwards id go to his house said caitlin how can i live without archie till next weekend how can i live without rupert for ever thought taggie getting up to give the tomato chutney a stir she jumped as gertrude and claudius rushed in and leapt on to the windowseat bristling furiously they were followed by maud in a big fluffy pink towel what on earth are you cooking she demanded in outraged tones tomato chutney said taggie through gritted teeth what a disgusting smell to welcome home your poor father and there are cows in the garden doing great splattering cowpats all over the lawn and the paths which is even worse they must be ruperts ring him up and tell him to take them away you ring him screamed taggie i cant do everything temper temper said maud exchanging surprised glances with caitlin well i certainly havent got time to ring someones got to be ready to welcome him scrubbing off other mens fingerprints said caitlin scornfully as maud flounced off upstairs she put a hand on taggies shoulder you ok nnot really is it rupert did you have a lovely day taggie nodded but sarah stratton was waiting for him when we got back so i came home he said hed ring but her voice trailed off she stared at the great congealing brown mass of onions brown sugar and tomatoes her mother was right it was a repulsive smell ill ring him about the cows said caitlin thatll remind him but when she got through rupert was on the other line and the secretary said shed send the farm manager over at once to remove the cows ruperts probably terribly busy said caitlin consolingly then as the telephone rang there thatll be him now you answer it gasped taggie please god make it be rupert she whispered over and over again into the vat of chutney hullo upland house bakery which tart would you like to fill said caitlin oh archie darling i wont survive either she was interrupted by frantic barking gertrude and claudius shot off the windowseat taking the cushions with them and rushed into the hall as a car crunched on the gravel my fathers just got back hed lynch me if he knew i was talking to you said caitlin hastily ill write tonight love you madly ciao fighting back the tears taggie went out to welcome declan he looked wonderful incredibly suntanned from filming outside and much less tired he was about to hug her when she was sent flying by maud a tornado of arpège and desire wearing taggies new grey cashmere jersey throwing herself on declan she buried her face in his chest so that he shouldnt see the guilt flickering in her eyes darling youre so brown and handsome she murmured ive missed you every single minute caitlin lounging in the doorway whistled then she quoted sardonically when my love swears that she is made of truth i do believe her though i know she lies declan was too delighted to find maud in such good spirits to take in what caitlin was saying camerons outside he said come and say hullo while i unload the car taggies heart sank as cameron came through the door like declan she looked wonderful her face seemed even softer her hair less severe she was wearing a cream silk shirt tucked into brown suede jodhpurs above tight shiny brown boots either it had been a highly successful shoot or she was obviously over the moon about seeing rupert again ignoring taggie and caitlin she went straight up to maud and hugged her ireland was terrific but we sure missed you if youd been playing maud gonne wed get an emmy esther mcdermott was just awful but declan was such an inspiration his sarcasm can bruise but wow it makes you grow really said maud not altogether enthusiastically taggie unable to take any more went out to the car where she had no difficulty in picking out her fathers battered ropedtogether leather case from camerons louis vuitton on the second journey she picked up a couple of carrier bags no said cameron sharply appearing in the doorway those are gifts for rupert and the kids i must show you what i got tabitha maud she produced a little leather pony with a girl rider and bridles and saddles that came off isnt it neat lovely said maud without interest cameron had bought a beautifully illustrated book of irish legends for marcus and a pair of gold cuff links for rupert which she insisted on showing to taggie ill get his crest put on later she said taggie stared at her dumbly very nice im sure said caitlin tartly then looking at camerons jodhpurs are you going for a ride i sure am said cameron with a sudden lascivious smile after three weeks away i need one and not on the back of a horse im off declan she yelled into the house ill call you as soon as i know when we can see the rushes bitch screamed caitlin at the departing lotus taggie shook her head cameron was the one who rupert belonged to taking a bottle of dutyfree whisky declan and maud went up to bed taggie also went up to her room and with trembling hands tried to hold caitlins binoculars still as she looked across the valley to penscombe court enough leaves had come off the trees now for her to see lights on downstairs in the kitchen and the drawingroom then like a firefly lighting up the almost leafless chestnut avenue she saw camerons lotus storming up ruperts drive in an unbearably short time another light went on which taggie knew from tabithas guided tour of the house yesterday was ruperts bedroom no one bothered to draw the curtains taggie collapsed on the bed what was that expression her father was always quoting the heart transfixed upon the huddled spears she knew what it meant now two minutes later there was a bang on her door go away she groaned caitlin walked in with the dogs who leapt on to the bed frantically trying to lick away taggies tears you got over ralphie youll get over rupert said caitlin anyway you may not have to hes got to keep that bitch sweet until after the franchise bugger the franchise sobbed taggie what would you do if you saw archie and some woman in bed id light a cigarette have a drink and go and stuff my face said caitlin look i hate intruding on your grief but the tomato chutney smells even more disgusting burning and as those carnal beasts wont emerge from their bedroom before morning im afraid youll have to take me back to uplift house theres a pauper just behind me and hes treading on my tail groaned declan the following morning as reeling from hangover and too much sex he went through the pile of final reminders and endless requests from charity organizations for his time his money or one of his very personal things why dont you send them all a lock of your hair suggested ursula id be bald in a week its only because youre a household name that people mistakenly assume youre rolling said ursula soothingly ill be a poorhousehold name at this rate declan winced as he bent down to retrieve an unopened letter that had fallen under the table among the débris of biros and pencils chewed up by claudius this looks more interesting the letter was from the iba telling venturer that their interview would be at ten oclock on th november at the iba headquarters at brompton road declan immediately swung into action and called a venturer meeting the following week the room over the nightclub in cheltenham was considered too risky so a suite was booked in an obscure bloomsbury hotel for securitys sake a large board in the lobby announced in white plastic letters that the ohara black jones drainage co sales conference was being held in the virginia woolf suite on the fourth floor the whole of venturer turned up except dame enid who had a concert in new york janey lloydfoxe whose baby had gastric flu and bas who had ostensibly been caught up in some crisis at the bar sinister cameron took special trouble with her appearance wearing a new very waisted red silk suit with padded shoulders a very plunging neckline and an extremely short skirt this was because she was meeting ruperts best friend billy lloydfoxe for the first time hed been away making a film on rugger for the bbc for the past three months and cameron was determined to make a good impression she neednt have worried billy came up to her straight away with that famous smile which had been described as able to beam into millions of homes without the aid of satellite hullo gosh ive been longing to meet you he said kissing her im mad about four men went to mow janeys taped all the episodes for me its exactly how rupe and i used to carry on before we were married it was just starting in australia when i left and being marvellously received he was extremely attractive cameron decided his lightbrown hair had gone greyer and hed thickened out since his showjumping days but he had such a young face and his turneddown eyes were so merry you didnt notice the broken nose or the doubling chin he also had a sweetness and an air of life being hilarious but at the same time a little bit too much for him that had endeared him as much to the bbc viewers as to everyone in the sporting world janey was mad to mess him around thought cameron she wondered if that was why bas wasnt here today rupert and he seemed to know each other so well they slipped into familiarity like a pair of old bedroom slippers arguing about horses finishing each others sentences howling with laughter at each others jokes it was nice to see rupert happy again thought cameron his fuse had been very short since she got back she suspected although he denied it that he hated being in opposition a shadow minister of his former self when you come back to penscombe were bloody well going to start a racing stable rupert was saying in an undertone i thought we were going to run a television station said billy we are but with the revenue coming in well have access to a hundred and twentyfive million a year just think what we can do with that good god said billy in amazement christy may be able to go to harrow after all i must have a drink at that moment declan tapped a large mahogany table in the centre of the room and asked everyone to sit down on the row of chairs lined up on the opposite side wheres the bar asked rupert no ones having anything to drink until weve finished declan said firmly wesleys face fell billy turned pale what is this a concentration camp concentration declan smiled thinly is what were after tonight if youre all swilling booze and getting up to get each other drinks you wont take in what im saying theres perrier if anyone wants it now i know why its called a dry run said billy sulkily come and sit by me he said to cameron patting a chair at least i can cheer myself up gazing at your legs cameron looked like a cross between joan collins and donald duck billy decided frightfully glamorous but somewhat highpowered im frightfully hungry can we at least ring for some sandwiches said professor graystock deliberately pressing against camerons breasts and having a good look as he leant over to pinch one of billys cigarettes later said declan billy harold white seb burrows georgie baines and sally maples the childrens editor declan had recruited from yorkshire television then jumped out of their skins when an unknown man in spectacles with a crew cut and a purposeful expression walked in its all right said declan soothingly this is hardy bissett he used to work for the iba and knows exactly what sort of questions theyll ask us at the interview hes going to drill us over the next few weeks whos that turgid old crone in the portrait over the mantelpiece billy whispered to cameron virginia woolf whispered cameron id do anything to keep her from my door said billy what did she do for a living belly dancing a fine writer said professor graystock reprovingly declan found hardy a chair beside him on the other side of the table then he said the iba meeting as you all know now is fixed for th november the good thing is that coriniums meeting is the afternoon before so there wont be any problem for those of you who have to go to both meetings everyone jumped again as a fat man waddled into the room wearing a stocking over his head waving a blue plastic toy gun saying this is a shootout then he peeled the stocking off with a broad grin and said boo it was charles fairburn oh for focks sake charles exploded declan this is serious i was just explaining that ours and coriniums meetings are on different days so you wont bump into tony and ginger johnson coming out of the iba as you go in but please think up excuses to be out of the office on the th well in advance we want as many of you there as possible are you sure no one will see us asked sally maples nervously weve all been threatened with the sack again this week so have we said billy declan shook his head all you have to do is to drive into the underground garage at the back of the iba you neednt go near the front at all and youll be whisked up to the eighth floor by now he went on the iba will have digested our applications and answers to the supplementary questions and noted our performance at the public meeting they will obviously have some idea as to whom they want to award the franchise but have no doubt the interview on the th is key just as important as a viva to an undergraduate taking finals i wouldnt know about that murmured billy im now going to hand you over to hardy said declan sitting down wholl take you through the dry run hardy bissett despite his bristly crew cut had an air of officialdom which unnerved them all getting to his feet he tapped the table with a biro this is exactly the kind of table youll sit along during the interview except the iba table is ovalshaped facing you will be the twelve members of the authority with lady gosling in the centre none of them know anything much about television they are worthy public figures academics business people one of them mrs scottmenzies for example is the exchairman of the wi another used to run the post office another is an exlabour minister of education yet another whom i think youve come across declan is the reverend fergus penney a disgusting old goat who was once a prebendary of the church of england it is essential for you to memorize all their names all important people in their own field once they tend to be vain and enjoy recognition behind them during the meeting will sit half a dozen officials who work for the authority who know all about television they do not speak during the interview but they brief before and advise afterwards and will be watching you all like hawks billy mopped his brow it sounds most alarming he sighed god that mans disgusting thought rupert as professor graystock pinched yet another of billys cigarettes as if reading ruperts thoughts hardy bissett said one of the crucial things at the interview is to appear to like and admire each other and prove you are not merely a starstudded bunch after a quick buck but actually capable of forming a workable and amicable team as you will be sitting in an almost straight line and will not be able to catch each others eyes it is also crucial to work out in advance who will field what questions freddie perhaps should answer any technical questions the bishop should deal with religion dame enid with music charles the arts and so on it is also vital that everyone has their say one excellent consortium lost the breakfast franchise a few years ago because their chairman a newspaper editor answered all the questions quite brilliantly thereby convincing the iba that they would be too much of a oneman band all right he clapped his hands together enough waffle to begin with ill fire questions directly at individuals later on in rehearsals well get to the stage when i can fire a question in the air and the appropriate person will leap to answer it now remember the interview will last at least an hour i wont if i dont get a drink grumbled billy shut up snapped hardy bissett he turned to henry hampshire im interested to know why as lordlieutenant you decided to join the venturer consortium for a second henry mouthed helplessly like a goldfish because rupert told me id make a fortune he said and that hed introduce me to joanna lumley everyone screamed with laughter except the bishop declan and hardy bissett which rupert hasnt done yet what said henry delighted at the reaction this is meant to be a dry run said hardy icily he turned to wesley how dyou intend to retain the cultural traditions of the ethnic minorities in your area mr emerson wesley looked blank dont know man declan promised me a fortune too but he didnt say anything about joanna lumley billy wiped his eyes this is wonderful he whispered to cameron like a terrier hardy bissett caught billy off guard as venturers head of sport he asked sharply how dyou intend to revolutionize coriniums sporting coverage erhum said billy helplessly making programmes is a bit like sex i do it all the time but im afraid i never talk about it programmes are living things particularly sport he went on apologetically they seem to materialize as you go along very lucid said hardy so sarcastically that billy went crimson he then turned to professor graystock i wonder professor if you might be able to provide us with a more serious answer to the question i asked wesley the professor cleared his throat at venturer we would naturally give the ethnic minorities the chance to develop their own programmes in their own way he said in his fulsome drone this will keep alive the cultures and traditions which would otherwise be neglected as the minorities become fully integrated into the population excellent professor said hardy thats more like it although you could have gone on to specify some of the programmes and had a crack at coriniums abysmal record at the same time he turned to freddie have you got a definite policy towards industrial relations freddie looked somewhat apprehensively at rupert i and my managing director declan and my financial director rupert are all firmly committed believers in industrial democracy are we said rupert in amazement shut up hissed cameron will you and billy stop taking the piss sulkily rupert got out the evening standard and surreptitiously started reading his scorpio horoscope which was all about career opportunities and staying cool in the face of provocation then because he read taggies horoscope as automatically as his own these days his eyes moved up three places to cancer as there is a new moon this week wrote patric walker you are probably wondering where the next blow will fall and feel everyone is against you oh the poor little duck thought rupert suddenly overwhelmed with longing and protectiveness shed been so adorable the other day he never dreamed hed miss her so much rupert snapped cameron hardy wants to know if weve got an employment policy yes said rupert coolly well employ very good people well pay them extremely well to work and if they dont well tell them to fuck off the bishop and professor graystock exchanged pained glances declans bitten fingernails drummed on the table slightly too simplistic said hardy bissett acidly i hope someone else has something a little bit more illuminating to say on the subject at the end of half an hour hardy called a halt that was absolutely appalling he said bluntly declan youre fielding too many questions cant say i blame you with these morons and getting totally carried away by your own blarney so are you bishop the bishop turned purple youre both far too longwinded the rest are much too short you should be answering the questions in a sentence and then immediately using the subject to dive into another area where you want to make a point the object is to put across venturers message and make your pitch whatever questions youre asked christ said billy to rupert as the professor nicked yet another of his cigarettes its like one of those terrible nightmares of being back at school who is this fink on my right who talks like a british telecom technical manual professor graystock said rupert declan brought him in hes a disgrace well have another halfhour session said hardy bissett then well have a drink he turned to freddie mr jones how did the idea for venturer originate freddie scratched his curls well it was like this rupert an me ad both ad an upanddowner wiv tony baddingham over different fings declan was having a rough time of it tonys a fug make no bones abart it got a board made up of professional accountants who use profits for anyfing other than making programmes wont take risks thats why their share of the ratings is dropping anyway declan ad a barney wiv him and walked out rupe and i both fink declans terrific hes a real man of stature could become the lord reef of itv so we decided to pitch for the franchise we all live in the area he went on rupes lived there all is life declan cameron and i are comparative newcomers more like cafflic converts so we love it wiv a passion and we just feel its being shabbily represented by corinium well done said rupert but once again the professor and the bishop exchanged pained glances after that harold white and cameron were both excellent on programme plans georgie was brilliant on advertising and seb marvellously bitchy about the newsroom and cotswold roundup but at the end hardy bissett was just as scathing look at you he said mockingly cringing on the back of your seats trying to make yourself invisible to an examiner who might ask you the awkward question youve got to sit forward be eager and positive bursting with enthusiasm gimme a drink then murmured billy but it was better than last time went on hardy youve got just over a month to get your act together and if we keep going over the same ground night after night billy and rupert exchanged looks of horror freddie glanced at his watch youre bound to improve its obvious our moles wont be able to make every evening but im glad to say most of them not all hardy glared pointedly at billy acquitted themselves well and are obviously less in need of coaching than the rest of you i congratulate you declan on your poaching skills just dont get rumbled any of you between now and december when theyd all got drinks declan gave them a brief progress report you neednt be too disheartened by our abysmal showing today elsewhere things are looking good the most dramatic bit of news is that midwest have pulled out they cant raise the cash evidently so their geography master will probably never get to london now he grinned this means its a twohorse race just us and corinium everyone was wildly excited by this information except rupert two two the rivals now he thought bitterly why did everything remind him of taggie ive also heard off the record that the iba have had at least three thousand letters from local organizations pledging their support for venturer declan went on tony was also supposed to appear on a programme on radio cotchester this week with me and the west of england man from the iba but hes backed off because he claims a programme interspersed with pop records is not the right vehicle for serious discussion ie hes got cold feet the storys been leaked to tomorrows papers finally ladbrokes make us five to four on today so were on our way so am i said freddie going towards the door rupert followed him where are you going to a meetin said freddie looking shifty with mrs vereker said rupert for christs sake be careful sarah stratton rolled up at my house in hysterics the other day saying james had been told to back off and concentrate on lizzie as theyre going to make this marriage series together i know said freddie makes fings very difficult thats why lizzie and mes meeting up here its a bloody good story said rupert corinium presenter ordered to give up his presenter mistress and concentrate on his wife in order to win franchise the scorpion would adore it no said freddie appalled itd hurt lizzie and hurt her kids to have their fathers name plastered all over the papers frederick dear said rupert patiently its a good story i said itll discredit corinium and make a complete mockery of the marriage programme if everyone knows its a sham dyou want to win this franchise or not freddie shook his head stubbornly not if it urts lizzie anyway youre barking up the wrong tree mate fact that tonys told james to drop his mistress and concentrate on making his marriage work will only score brownie points with the iba besides if the papers start sniffin round james they might easily cotton on to lizzie and me rupert sighed if declan and i can behave ourselves i cant think why you cant as soon as freddie had gone the bishop and the professor who was clutching a huge whisky in one hand and a vast plate of smoked salmon sandwiches in the other closed in on rupert could we have a word said the bishop were a bit concerned about freddie jones said the professor with his mouth full charming chap of course said the bishop smoothly definitely one of natures gentlemen but a little bit of a rough diamond rough diamonds are a consortiums best friend said rupert lightly but there was a deterrent steeliness about his eyes ha ha said the bishop heartily however as i was saying crispin graystock knows several members of the iba who well be meeting on the th i myself am not unfamiliar with quite a few of them either mrs menziesscott is an old friend and of course ive exchanged views with the prebendary we just feel that freddie jones is not quite the right vehicle to put venturers message across what dyou mean vehicle snapped rupert freddies not a van well someone who talks about lord reef and cafflic converts and refers to tony baddingham as a fug delicately the professor mimicked freddies accent and extols the joys of miking vast sums of money will hardly go down very well with the iba to be frank said the bishop poor freddie can hardly string a sentence together freddie is a star said rupert furiously hes far the most genuine person venturers got he runs one of the most successful companies in the country and hes got the common touch a very common touch said the professor stuffing two more sandwiches into his face and gargling them down with a huge slug of whisky all were suggesting said the bishop soothingly is that freddie jones may be very much at home on the shop floor with businessmen even with the press but not with the clergymen academics ladies of the womens institute and senior statesmen hes going to encounter on the th we feel very strongly that he should stick to technical specifications take more of a back seat and perhaps take a few elocution lessons added the professor i know an exactor who lives in willisden said the bishop taking ruperts stunned silence as assent whos worked absolute miracles with somewhat er provincial young curates who have difficulty taking services and giving sermons ive never heard such a bloody awful idea in my life exploded rupert dyou want to castrate freddie to take away all his spontaneity and bounce and coming from two jumpedup exgrammar school boys who talk about willisden and substarntial involevement makes it all the more laughable do you want freddie to talk like a fucking toastmaster i beg your pardon thundered the bishop turning puce and for someone who calls himself a christian and another a practising socialist youre both a bloody disgrace added rupert i hope youll withdraw that remark spluttered the professor showering rupert with whiskysoaked crumbs sausage rolls anyone said cameron coming over and shoving a plate between them what on earths the matter the bishop and the professor have just pointed out that freddie is a social embarrassment to venturer and should take some elocution lessons said rupert furiously and stalked out of the room it took all camerons and later declans tact to calm the bishop and the professor down both threatened to resign demanded ruperts resignation or at least most humble apologies and were only placated by a large and very expensive dinner at the gay hussar it was twothirty in the morning before declan got home to penscombe but he found taggie still up laying out apples in an upstairs spare room with all the bills flooding in it might be all they had to live on soon how did it go she asked awful but hardy bissett says its always ghastly to begin with hell knock them into shape billy lloydfoxe turned up is he nice said taggie enchanting said declan exactly the right kind of person to calm everyone down with the last fence in sight theyre all getting incredibly twitchy then he told taggie about ruperts row with the bishop and the professor rupert was right poor freddie said taggie indignantly he was not said declan winding up other members of the consortium at this stage is insane keeping the bishop sweet is absolutely crucial rupert was flip and obstructive the whole way through the meeting i dont know whats got into him or how poor cameron puts up with him it was poor cameron now reflected taggie grimly she was fantastic at the meeting declan went on with unexpected warmth the more i see of her the better i think she is in fact all the moles distinguished themselves even sally maples once she got over her nerves and charles keeps everyones spirits up and billy as i said just has an enchanting personality which is bound to endear us to the iba i hate to sound overconfident he reached over and touched the skirting board but if we dont do anything bloddy silly between now and december our chances of getting the franchise must be focking good in the first week in november tony baddingham called a press conference he looked on top of the world the scarlet poppy in his buttonhole adding just the right note of concerned sobriety to offset the hedonistic effect of a splendid los angeles suntan he had been in la he told the waiting army of reporters and cameramen to sign up a brilliant new woman programme controller who would start in the new year assuming you win the franchise asked itn theres no doubt about that said tony smugly is she better than cameron cook i have no doubt about that either said tony even more smugly he went on to say that corinium had set aside sixteen million pounds next year for new programmes and pledged to have an even fresher and more responsible approach to covering the region the old fox is up to something muttered the mail on sunday he didnt get us here just for this crap what about advertising asked the observer revenue may be down tony replied smoothly but so is the advertising revenue of all the itv companies it had been a bad summer for advertising he explained because the weather had been so good but this had boosted coriniums leisure interests so shareholders could expect excellent midterm results in december why werent you prepared to face declan ohara on radio cotchester asked the scorpion because corinium prefer to rest on their laurels and not indulge in vulgar abuse and tony lowered his voice so the journalists had to crane forward to catch what he was saying declan ohara might not have been quite so happy to face me had he been aware that i know everything hes been up to here it comes said itn as tony very slowly got out a cigar and made a great play of cutting off the end before lighting it declan ohara he went on slowly has been poaching my staff this summer he enticed cameron cook away but as early as may he had signed up my sales director georgie baines my religious editor charles fairburn and my finest news reporter sebastian burrows id like also to warn the bbc london weekend and yorkshire television that billy lloydfoxe harold white and sally maples tony enunciated the names particularly carefully so all the journalists could get them down are also signed up and poised to move to venturer in the most unlikely event of them winning the franchise there was a stunned silence how the hell did you find all this out asked the mail on sunday almost sent flying by the unseemly dash for the telephones i wouldnt be chief executive of corinium if i didnt know everything that was going on in my own company said tony grimly and i intend to keep it that way for many years to come unlike venturer he added dismissively whose security is even worse than mis for twentyfour hours tony left the three corinium moles to sweat and the whole corinium building in a turmoil of rumour and speculation james vereker for one was absolutely furious on initially hearing the news how dare declan ignore him and sign up charles who was nothing but a fat drunken fag or seb who was infinitely junior to james in the newsroom or georgie of whose longer eyelashes james was inordinately jealous then jamess fury turned to pleasure as he realized that all three moles would be for the high jump he even gave several interviews to the nationals saying he was utterly disgusted by their disloyal uncaring behaviour and that he felt huge sympathy for tony baddingham in his hour of desertion james was therefore not the only member of coriniums staff hanging round the newsroom waiting for fireworks the following morning after word whistled round the building that tony had sent for georgie baines seb was demented with worry thinking of the loan hed wheedled out of his bank manager for a new ferrari charles could only take another gulp of claret and think greyly of his fivefigure overdraft and the mortgage hed just taken out on a tumbledown cottage near penscombe half an hour later georgie baines staggered into the newsroom making agonized faces and clutching his bottom as though hed just been given twelve of the best then very slowly he drew the latest corinium company report out of the seat of his trousers then roared and roared with laughter tony gave me an absolute bollocking he told his amazed audience said if i have any more dealings with venturer hell sue me for breach of contract but its made him realize how much im worth to corinium so hes doubled my salary and made me deputy managing director so you better all behave yourselves my darlings oh how sweet said daysee butler bursting into tears youre not joining venturer then asked seb not for the moment said georgie then rubbing his hands and now that im deputy md im going to start getting heavy off with his head he yelled pointing at a very discomforted james vereker and dont you go giving any more interviews to the press about me and disloyalty you little twerp muttering about being seriously misquoted james bolted out of the newsroom whereupon everyone cheered and started opening bottles to celebrate seb was summoned ten minutes later and received more or less the same treatment tonys sending me to the new york office for six months to get me out of the way he said then if i behave myself i can come back i suppose its better than the sack much much said charles fairburn draining his bottle of red feeling vastly relieved that he wasnt going to be out on his ear charles too obeyed a summons from above mea culpa he said in mock seriousness winking at miss madden as he sauntered into tonys office five minutes later he was back in the newsroom trembling like a great white blancmange everyone stopped their revelling whatevers the matter said georgie whod been tangoing in and out of the desks with daysee butler ive been sacked whispered charles on the spot and hes not giving me any redundancy money because i was warned three times over at the bbc at london weekend and yorkshire television billy lloydfoxe harold white and sally maples all ashen and trembling and mindful of their overdrafts and their dependants denied any involvement with venturer and were all suspended from programmemaking pending further investigation and warned that the most tenuous contact with venturer would mean the sack the story was front page in every paper for several days declan and rupert as the bestknown members of venturer were blamed for enticement which no one minded about very much and lousy security which however reflected very badly on their management skills worst of all venturer was now left without a sales director a programme controller a childrens editor a sports editor and a head of news until seb enraged by the cavalier sacking of charles fairburn told tony to stuff his new york job and resigned as well this was all very highminded of seb but now meant that venturers fast diminishing kitty was faced with paying both his and charless salaries seb would have no difficulty finding another job but at fiftyone and a notorious piss artist charles was far more of a problem venturer meanwhile had been thrown into complete pandemonium on the afternoon of tonys putsch rupert freddie and declan met up at the priory there must be a countermole or how could tony have found out all these things said declan freddie however was scrabbling under declans desk then he took declans telephone apart bugged he said bleakly ill get my men in at once to sweep the room and check all the phones its possible the ole place is bugged theyd better do your phones as well rupe declan was appalled christ knows how much tony has found out then if he smashes venturer he finks hell get cameron back said freddie i said we was dealing with a villain hes out to bury us but how the hell did his men get in here to bug the telephone said rupert the dogs would frighten anyone away and theres always someone in the house as taggie was out doing a dinner party in cheltenham declan sent for maud has anyone called to check the telephones lately he asked yes said maud someone from british telecom came last friday such a delightful young man he said his mothers favourite opera was the merry widow he heard me rehearsing and made me sing the vilja song over and over again what was he doing here asked declan wearily his department had been notified that wed been overcharged so he was checking all the telephones to see if they were using up too many units said maud beaming he said they might be able to give us a rebate i quite forgot to tell you declan put his head in his hands how long was he here he groaned about three hours said maud rupert and freddie exchanged glances of horror if it hadnt been so terrible it would have been funny that was your bugger said rupert dyou mean to say all that time he was bugging our house said maud indignantly and i gave him three cups of tea with sugar and a penguin im sorry sighed declan after shed gone im not making excuses for her but i dont think its quite as simple as that tony knew about all the moles but ive never rung billy on this telephone ruperts always been the one to get in touch with him and because i was ultraconscious of security ive always made a point of directly contacting all the moles from a call box outside penscombe so the calls couldnt be traced back anyway if the telephone was only bugged last friday i rang everyone about the dry run before that ive got a horrible feeling someone tipped tony off all right said freddie sitting down heavily on a lot of tapes lets go through the list of possibilities taggie was working at sarah strattons a fortnight ago and the baddinghams and the verekers were both there dont be bloody silly snapped rupert who was pacing up and down the room of course its not taggie shes entirely responsible for all those letters being sent to the iba and what the fucking hells she got to gain by leaking secrets to tony freddie raised his eyebrows no need to overreact she could have just let somefink slip to sarah over the dishes and how dyou know the verekers and the baddinghams were at the strattons the other night said rupert still furious i suppose lizzie told you lizzies much more likely to have told tony lizzies nothing to do with us said declan irritably do keep to the point rupert lizzies something to do with freddie persisted rupert you could easily have talked in your sleep freddie turned dark red theres nuffink going on there hum said rupert declan looked disapproving is there he said icily freddie shuffled his feet im very fond of lizzie i havent told her anyfing declan then admitted that maud had told him caitlin had been out once with archie baddingham but they were just a couple of kids and he was quite certain caitlin knew nothing of importance anyway she was back at school now caitlin knows everything said rupert she doesnt miss a trick and she might easily have seen sally maples or harold theyve never been to the house said declan i suppose one of the moles could have turned countermole more than their lifes wurf said freddie shaking his head if they shopped us they automatically shop themselves georgie is the only one it might have been and he was far too upset when tony broke the news yesterday i expect tonys got the thumbscrew on him now getting the rest of venturers secrets out of him what about maud said rupert shes always hanging around with monica when did my wife ever take the slightest interest in the franchise she doesnt know a thing said declan bitterly valeries got a soft spot for james vereker suggested rupert freddie sighed valeries like maud simply not interested much as id like to suspect the bishop and professor graystock said rupert theyre far too motivated by greed and selfinterest to shop us and the same goes for marti not if tony made it worth their while said declan i wouldnt rule them out well basils in the clear went on rupert and i honestly think wesley and henry are too thick or in wesleys case too spaced out to remember anyones names anyway but i suppose theyre possibilities everyones a possibility said declan bleakly and finally theres cameron shes my choice ive had my doubts about her all along balls said rupert irritably shes far too obsessed with us winning the franchise and since she came back from ireland with making movies with you and frankly said freddie shes far too smitten by our rupe when declan said nothing rupert protested camerons got a lot of faults but shes basically honest thats why she so loathed carrying on with tony and corinium while she was sleeping with me ive always suspected she was treacherous said declan how do we know she hasnt been spying for tony from the very beginning dont lets get le carréed away said rupert well just have to keep an eye on her well have to keep an eye on everyone said declan grimly in an atmosphere of sniping and growing suspicion venturer carried on preparations for the iba interview there were secret communications with georgie billy harold and sally arranging that they would join venturer if and when the franchise was won it no longer seemed a certainty but there was no way they could be present at the iba meeting on th november night after night without them therefore hardy bissett fired endless questions at the rest of the consortium until they were word perfect and answered almost without thinking then he accused them of being too glib one evening charles fairburn desperately trying to hide his anxiety about being fired turned up dressed as lady gosling in a grey wig halfmoon spectacles and hundreds of shawls and proceeded to lay everyone in the aisles by answering questions in a high soprano until hardy sharply slapped him down but the questions rolled on how dyou hope to promote interest in scientific matters in your schedule what is your attitude to training schemes how will you ensure equal opportunity for women in your company by screwing every one of them answered rupert dont be bloody flip yelled hardy you can be funny but never flip and with a female chairman never never be funny about women rupert was bored and fed up why the fuck couldnt they tell the truth that they just wanted to make good programmes and a lot of money and dispense with all this flannel he was relieved when cameron and declan set off to ireland for a final weeks shooting he needed some space and time to think he spent most of the week they were away in london on political work and keeping the rattled venturer backers happy outside his office the last of the plane leaves were drifting down reminding him unbearably of taggie he still had the thirty leaves she and the children had given him they hadnt brought him much bloody happiness he steeled himself not to ring her up or drop round he was truly terrified how much he wanted to when rupert didnt take advantage of camerons week away to ring her taggie wanted only to retreat into her turret room in utter despair but alas monica had asked her to do the food for the first night party for the merry widow next saturday and when she wasnt cooking and freezing in both senses of the word now the cold weather had set in the priory was absolutely arctic taggie was calming down or boosting the morale of an increasingly demanding and nervous maud corinium were showing highlights of the first night and maud was counting on declan getting back from ireland in time she couldnt face such an ordeal alone in addition the press were on the prowl for a story both venturer and corinium consortiums were turning out in force and dinner jackets for the first night the newly sacked charles fairburn was playing monicas lover declans exquisite wife was making her stage comeback and her leading man was the handsome bas who was on opposing sides to his loathed brother tony with declan due back from ireland with rupert campbellblacks livein lover who was also tonys ex it was clear that there were endless possibilities for fireworks cotchester wrote nigel dempster slyly are celebrating guy fawkes day ten days late this year the merry widow dress rehearsal on friday afternoon was disastrous the presence of the television crew on a dry run threw the entire cast tempers flared lights dimmed too early lines were fluffed or forgotten the television director decided to put two cameras in the dress circle and in the two boxes on either side of the stage so they wouldnt have to take out any stall seats the technicians stood around yawning one sound man even fell asleep and snored loudly throughout the second act james vereker cotchesters dusty answer to humphrey burton according to charles fairburn would be presenting the programme just as well we bombed early said barton sinclair the merry widows director but he seemed far from happy over in county galway cameron and declan were at the end of their last days filming declan in a darkblue fishermans jersey and jeans his thick black hair lifting in the gentle west wind was speaking to camera hallow this spot he began softly here once stood the proud white georgian house which belonged to lady gregory here for the last thirty years of his life yeats spent every summer and most of his winters thats a long time to put up with not the easiest of house guests declan smiled briefly even bearing in mind the number of servants large houses employed in those days here in this tranquil ordered household yeatss genius was able to blossom on and on like a rose right into the winter of his days i doubt said yeats if id have done much with my life but for lady gregorys firmness and care cut shouted cameron that was excellent well now do closeups of the copper beech on which he carved his initials and then straight down to the lake for the last shot wed better hurry the sunll set in threequarters of an hour twenty minutes later declan was standing on the shore of the lake with a huge bloodred sun sinking gradually behind the coloured trees and casting a warm glow on his face while yeats stayed at coole park said declan bending down and picking up a pebble and sending it spinning across the still water he wrote his poetry in a room looking towards this lake a time lovingly remembered in his poem the wild swans at coole he began to quote softly the trees are in their autumn beauty the woodland paths are dry under the october twilight the water mirrors a still sky oh that husky heartbreakingly sexy voice thought cameron feeling the hairs lifting yet again on the back of her neck she could go to the stake for declan at times like this theyd been so lucky with the weather too enough leaves still hung from the trees to pretend it was october but one hard frost would have stripped them in a day the crew going out to get plastered at an endofshoot party tried to persuade declan and cameron to join them but because they were both tired and faced a late night at the merry widow tomorrow they opted for a quiet dinner at the hotel afterwards they sat alone in the bar apple logs cracked merrily in the grate giving off a sweet cider smell occasionally the flames flared lighting up declans face as he sat immersed in the galway post his whisky hardly touched cameron was happy to watch him memorizing every tiny black bristle of stubble every deeply trenched line on the battered craggy western hero face without seeing the rushes she knew they had made a great programme schemes were afoot for other programmes but this first would always be the most exciting exploring and luxuriating in each others talent she had learnt so much from him already despite the fact that all the crew were at times victims of his almost feudal caprice he certainly inspired devotion he allowed no insubordination only that morning hed roared at the sound man for giving the hungover pa a bloody mary for breakfast he was irascible with an extremely short fuse and got so wrapped up in the work that he frequently upset people but he was so mortified afterwards and so ready to apologize that they always forgave him not least because he had more charm than anyone cameron had ever met tomorrow she thought putting another log on the fire shed return to rupert and reality or was it unreality with both of them following their separate careers in that huge house with nothing in common except the franchise only coming together literally for sex in that huge pink and yellow silkcurtained fourposter she wanted to marry rupert more than anything in the world to tame and hold such a beautiful man and have access to all that wealth and privilege rupert was her fix but she was frightened how increasingly she was drawn to declan together they could make an amazing team he would understand her far better than rupert and she would look after him and sort out his money problems far more efficiently than that parasitic feckless hopeless maud and what would happen to her and rupert if they lost the franchise declan looked up and smiled im neglecting you hows your drink the barman had wandered off to talk to mrs rafferty about some cows or it might be cars cameron had difficulty with the irish pronunciation and had left the whisky bottle and a jug of water on the table for them cameron was even learning to like whisky without ice shed be saying dustbin and petrol soon as declan filled her glass she said this time in a month well know if weve won i was just wondering if there was life after franchise for me and rupert the dark brooding eyes bored into her id like to think there was ive grown very fond of you both honest stammered cameron honest under all that bitching and stridency youre as soft as thistledown the only problem is that you may be too good at your job for rupert he needs a wife to come home to not one to come home with a little stately home maker said cameron bitterly partly he must be the dominant tom youd compete with him and im not sure he could handle you becoming a big star then suddenly out of the blue never having mentioned it before he asked why were you so focking awful to patrick cameron gasped i guess i liked him too much i was scared he was so attractive so élitist so certain yet so magnificently unprepared for the knocks that life was bound one day to give him and tony was pathological about any competition all i cared about then was getting to the top so i could have the space and freedom i needed there was no way a penniless student could be part of my future goals i didnt figure he had sufficient weight patrick has more weight than anyone said declan and hes more together i wish youd read that play and i knew how violently you disapproved of me and patrick said cameron slyly indeed i did declan grinned but i know you better now hed suit you better than rupert and he wouldnt mess you about but its you i want thought cameron resisting a terrible urge to reach out and touch declans hand and then drag him up the black polished winding stairs to her hard narrow bed wondering if she was crazy to jeopardize what had certainly been their most intimate conversation yet she said maud messes you about enough maud said declan topping up his glass is a dramaholic thats why she devours novels soap operas and newspapers like a junkie occasionally her heroineaddiction spreads to real life and she has to live out one of these romantic plots it never lasts very long has she got something going at the moment declan looked out of the window at the moon peering through the bars of an elder tree like a prisoner then he drained half his whisky in one gulp yes he said harshly bas doesnt it crucify you declan shrugged adultery isnt the only kind of infidelity im unfaithful to her each time i get locked into work i cant help myself any more than she can and if you marry someone like maud you accept the conditions that beautiful people are the blood royal of humanity and not governed by the same rules as ordinary mortals shes not that beautiful protested cameron glancing at her own extremely satisfactory reflection in the mirror above the fireplace she is to me said declan simply cameron wanted to shake him how can you be sure one of these men wont come along one day and walk off with her altogether she doesnt go after other men for sex said declan arrogantly she knows shell never better what she has with me she does it for excitement flattery and the relief from the loneliness anyone who lives with a writer has to endure cameron got up to examine a horse brass pulling her big black leather belt forward with her thumbs so he could appreciate the slenderness of her waist have you ever cheated on her she muttered into the flames no have you ever wanted to she whispered to his reflection in the mirror yes said declan simply all this week cameron stayed motionless by the fire until the heat from the flames became too strong then it wasnt just me its going on location said declan flatly when you create something you both know is special it seems natural to have some kind of consummation one devoutly to be wished said cameron fiercely and ludicrously prevalent in television said declan it happens on shoots all the time not like this pleaded cameron turning she went up to him idly he reached out and fingered the huge lowslung silver buckle of her belt itd complicate things he said roughly at a time we dont need complications maud would disintegrate i cant afford to fall out with rupert i cant afford anything at the moment dont joke its too important hissed cameron moving her legs between his pressing her groin forward against the palm of his hand she felt declan tremble wed be so good together lets go upstairs now she urged they both jumped as the barman returned not much wind tonight he said blithely but what there is is blowing terrible hard you look frozen said declan sit down and have a drink fuck fuck fuck or rather no fuck cameron screamed inwardly as the barman collected a glass and sat down between them youll be being a bit of a writer declan he said did ye know theres another of your kind living not ten minutes from here angloirish names macbride declan froze like a dog hearing a rabbit in the undergrowth dermot macbride he lives here came in the other night said hed just finished a play but he didnt think anyoned be interested thought theyd all forgotten him him said declan incredulously do you forget ibsen or miller have you got his address ive his number said the barman he wanted some manure for his garden names familiar said cameron the angriest of all the angry young men said declan and easily the most unpleasant and the most talented he made a bomb from his first play then the second was so venomous and obscene no one would touch it he took umbrage and vowed never to write another word christ its like a new novel from salinger give me the number he said to the barman im going to ring him but its half past eleven protested cameron declan was back ecstatic ten minutes later hed gone to dublin i rang him there im going to see him at eleven tomorrow morning cutting it a bit fine said cameron the flights at one maud she added bitterly would totally disintegrate if you missed it ill see him alone said declan hes not keen on women ill keep a taxi waiting and meet you at the airport he put his hand on her head briefly stroking her hair wed better go to bed weve got an early start in the morning as saturday wore on maud was increasingly in need of declan to fill in time she went to the hairdressers and even had a manicure but her hand shook so much the manicurist had trouble getting the polish on she also bought good luck cards for the rest of the cast and some champagne in case by some miracle anyone came backstage to see her afterwards arriving at the theatre she gave a gasp of terror at the huge lights on metal stands trained on the main entrance ready to film the arriving celebrities and huge cables running from these and from the cameras inside the theatre to a variety of ob vans she felt even sicker at the sight of a makeup caravan a mobile dressingroom for james and a doubledecker catering bus for the technicians even though the town hall was less than yards from the corinium television building union rules required all these facilities going into her dressingroom maud gasped again but this time with delight because shed never seen so many flowers from the family and rupert and cameron and the verekers and the joneses and the baddinghams and so many of her friends in london there were also scores of good luck cards and a telex from darling patrick in brisbane but so much good will made her feel even more nervous what happened if she let them all down she looked at her watch five oclock she needed twenty minutes alone with the script to absorb the notes barton had given her yesterday then her makeup would take an hour by which time declan would be here and he could do up her dress and her jewellery and they could have a quiet hour together but as she tried to concentrate on the script she was interrupted by the arrival of more and more flowers and by monica popping in to see if she were all right and by bas whod brought her a fluffy stuffed black cat which miaowed good luck when you pressed it maud was enchanted and weve got time to rehearse love unspoken just once more she said lets rehearse it lying down said bas whod just come back from hunting and was feeling randy not before a performance said maud shocked i couldnt possibly concentrate well im not risking you going down on me with chattering teeth said bas so id better buzz off back to the bar sinister and pay the wages were doing a roaring pretheatre trade as taggie carried great saucepans of chicken marengo in through the stage door she could see people gathering in the foyer hoping for returns the advance publicity and the possibility of the audience appearing on television had made it a total sellout as she fell over cables and bits of scenery she could hear behind every dressingroom door the cast warming up like the record department at harrods she felt simply terrified for her mother once shed unloaded the stuff there wasnt much to do the puddings were cold the salads only needed dressing and she had just to put the chicken the mashed potato and the garlic bread in the oven to heat up if the ovens were turned on low during the interval everything would be ready in case anyone was frightfully hungry by the final curtain thank goodness monica had provided plenty of people to help serve and wash up as she came in with the last chocolate meringue cake the telephone was ringing by the stage door maud ohara shouted the doorman my mother said taggie shall i take it and see if its urgent it was maud said the alltoofamiliar seductive rasp no its taggie your fucking fathers missed the plane oh my god are you sure course i bloody am i was on it snapped cameron the next one doesnt land until nine fortyfive ive arranged for a car to pick him up and bring him straight to the theatre but mmummyll die shes been going through our leaking roof with nerves all week tranq her till we get there said cameron ive got to change and then rupert and ill be over with a sinking heart taggie knocked on mauds door declan said a low excited voice maud wearing only a sliding emeraldgreen towel now sat at the brilliantly lit mirror different eyeshadows littering the shelf in front of her as though a paintbox had been upended she had just spent forty minutes on her eyes huge goldgreen hypnotic impossibly seductive like two separate works of art they seemed almost too dominant for the heartshaped delicately flushed face you look beautiful said taggie nervously and what wonderful flowers wheres daddy demanded maud he should have been here five minutes ago is he parking the car taggie took a deep breath and was almost asphyxiated by the heady smell of fuchsias and jasmine im sorry he missed the plane she said then as maud opened her mouth to scream but hell be here for the end of the last act and the party he didnt mean to going into hysterical sobs maud put her hands up to her eyes and deliberately smeared the makeup all over her face neck and shoulders taggie winced it was like seeing the mona lisa slashed with a razor i dont believe it sobbed maud he cant do this to me the one night i need him he did it on purpose because he was jealous he doesnt like me having the limelight her voice rose to a screech i cant go on i cant hearing the din monica rushed in wearing only her petticoat with one eye made up demanding what was the matter you must go on she said in a shocked voice dont be so jolly wet and selfish theyre all coming to see you he did it on purpose screamed maud rocking backwards and forwards if it had been an act of god like an engine fault or fog i could have forgiven him or even a crash oh dont say that said taggie turning pale and you can shut up yelled maud you and your father are just the same never think of anything but your bloody work thats jolly unfair said monica there was something almost obscene about mauds daubed screaming face and neck and her bare shoulders and breasts as the towel slipped downwards monica yanked it up round her tucking it in as barton burst in but neither monicas rallying exhortations nor bartons hairtearing nor charless jokes could shift maud finally they all lost their tempers and shouted at her like some operatic trio admonishing a wrongdoer and cameron whod heard a great deal too much in praise of maud recently was only too happy to make it a quartet when she arrived for chrissake maud she screeched you cant let the cast and the audience down dont be so fucking unprofessional im not going on maud screamed back and why did declan miss that plane he went to see began cameron then realizing she couldnt mention dermot macbride in front of monica who might tell tony to see someone very important about the franchise it was like a spark from the fire landing in a box of matches maud went berserk all he thinks about is his fucking franchise she screamed her face a shuddering grotesque coloured pulp of rage and misery and turning on her flowers she started to tear them apart pulling off the heads and then the petals and throwing them on the floor shouldnt we slap her face said cameron longingly stop it maud said monica angrily thats wanton and destructive i dont care screamed maud ripping apart poor taggies yellow roses in despair taggie went out into the passage and ran slap into rupert who was no doubt about to add his own particularly vicious brand of invective behind him members of the cast and the corinium television crew were peering curiously out of doors and round corners where is she said rupert grimly oh please theyre all shouting at her they dont realize how frightened she is rupert paused weighing up the options then like a wand fleetingly restoring her happiness he touched taggies cheek with his finger go and get a large brandy angel ill sort her out shut up the lot of you he yelled as he went into the dressingroom well have to play the understudy said barton despairingly even though shes fifteen stone and about to draw her pension the floor was entirely carpeted with petals now she wont go on said cameron contemptuously im not surprised with you lot yelling at her said rupert get out everyone and he slammed the door on them rupert sat down on the bed and pulling maud into his arms gently stroking the silken shoulders letting her cry until gradually the sobbing and shuddering ceased there said rupert encouragingly theres a brave girl he wanted me to go to ireland with them and play maud gonne said maud in a choked voice i know rupert went on stroking her i wanted to do it so badly but i funked it i didnt want to fail again particularly in front of cameron im sure shes having an affair with declan i kept imagining them meeting secretly after a days shooting and discussing how terrible id been youre a dick said rupert gently declan fell in love with me the first time he saw me acting i wanted him to fall in love with me all over again tonight declan adores you hes never looked at anyone else then why isnt he here mauds voice grew shrill again for a second rupert thought hed lost her he went to see dermot macbride the dermot macbride rupert nodded hes written a new play declan felt if venturer could tell the iba wed bought an option it would really give us the edge maud quivered with rage i loathe the franchise she said tonelessly declans only obsessed with it because he sees it as the one way hell get you out of your financial mess you dont want to sell the priory do you maud shook her head violently could it come to that it almost has said rupert there was a knock on the door i dont want to see anyone said maud hysterically rupert wrapped the towel round her again but it was only taggie with an enormous brandy for maud and an equally huge whisky for rupert thanks sweetheart he took them from her now beat it maud took such a huge gulp that she choked rupert didnt tell her he suspected declan had deliberately missed the plane because his nerve had failed and he couldnt bear seeing maud humiliated nor did he say that the press were howling like jackals outside and that if she didnt go on the publicity with both her and declan letting everyone down would be devastating for venturer im disappointed he said idly i heard you practising at the priory so often i wanted to hear it for real and see the others make absolute tits of themselves by comparison look youve had a shock why not get back into your jersey and jeans and finish that brandy there was a long long pause better not said maud shakily putting down her glass or ill start forgetting my words id do better with a drop of oil to get me through all those skylarking bits rupert said nothing but reaching for the huge blue tin of cleansing cream he took off the lid gouged out a white blob and very slowly began to smear it over mauds face blurring away the ravages how did you know to use that ive watched enough actresses take their makeup off in my time most of mines come off on you said maud suddenly contrite as she noticed his hopelessly streaked evening shirt treat it as war paint said rupert later ill be doing battle with tony docile as a child maud let him remove all the smeared makeup you wont leave me ill stay with you the entire evening but i have to admit making up your face is beyond even my skills outside barton looked at his watch for the hundredth time it was ten past seven the press were howling for a decision the understudy was already changed if only he could make an announcement that the performance was starting late at least it would keep the audience happy if she werent going on said cameron rupert would have come and told us he was always good at boxing difficult horses said bas who had changed into his stage clothes and was now raring to go in and comfort maud as her door opened everyone surged forward coming out rupert put a finger to his lips then made a thumbs up sign has anyone got any eyedrops mine are by appointment to the queen mother said monica diving into her dressingroom to get them they jolly well make your eyes sparkle out in the foyer tony was now welcoming the mayor and mayoress and the reverend fergus penney from the iba who was visiting cotchester for the performance i have to warn you there may be holdups purred tony happily declan ohara who usually misses the boat has missed the plane this time and failed to turn up on the night of his poor wifes famous comeback shes gone to pieces and is refusing to go on so the understudy is waiting in the wings im afraid one really cant rely on venturer he added to fergus penney but at least we can all pass the time pleasantly enough having a glass of champagne steering them through a door marked private he found his latest acquisition wearing a new black and gold dress to complement her newly streaked hair and getting stuck into the bollinger can i introduce lizzie vereker said tony warmly i told you she and james are fronting our new series to discourage the spread of aids how to stay married didnt i fergus he added to the prebendary who was now licking his thin lips at the sight of lizzies curves norman and i could give you a few tips on that said the mayoress were celebrating our fortyfifth next week you must come on lizzies programme then said tony raising his glass cotchesters most distinguished married couple i cant bear it thought lizzie allowing her glass to be filled up in this dress she felt as though shed been giftwrapped at harrods she longed to get out into the foyer and see if freddie had arrived because of jamess new uxoriousness and a general tightening up of security she and freddie had only managed to talk on the telephone this week outside in the auditorium sarah stratton was spinning out the signing of autographs anything not to be trapped in the middle of the second row with paul and thus not able to accost james as he came past james absolutely livid at being mistaken for the manager by some enraged theatregoer whose seats had been doublebooked was now trying to explain the extremely complicated plot of the merry widow to the viewers the bishop mingling with his flock and pressing the flesh misconstrued freddies abstractedness as animosity and wondered darkly whether rupert had passed on his remarks about freddie being a rough diamond as the fiveminute bell went tony glanced at his watch seven thirtyfive bugger they were hardly going to be late at all at least they could rely on the understudy to be perfectly awful i think wed better find our seats he said charles wearing pantaloons so tight he felt he was standing inches above the ground peered through a chink in the thick prussianblue velvet curtains as he and monica and the chorus all in evening dress waited in the wings to go on its absolutely packed he reported in a hollow voice people are standing at the back and in the side aisles the première of the messiah in dublin was such a sellout that the men were told to leave off their swords pity that people werent frisked at the door today i bet your husbands carrying a long knife monica dear no its no use looking reproving hes given me the bullet i can say what i like and turning he stuck a rather green tongue out through the curtains as tony came in taggie helped maud pile up her hair with two diamanté combs and zipped her into her slinky black ball dress then leaving rupert and bas to do up her jewellery she slipped into her seat there were only two empty seats between her and cameron but they should have been inhabited by rupert and declan so the gap seemed wider than the atlantic judging by camerons set profile it was obvious that she was seething because rupert wasnt beside her particularly as a smirking tony had just rolled up with the mayor and was sitting directly behind them cameron was seething even more that after not seeing her for three months tony should catch her when shed only had a few minutes to change and hadnt showered or washed her hair she was wearing the smoking jacket which taggied tipped dessert over last year and which didnt evoke very happy memories either it definitely needed clean hair and very dramatic makeup to carry it off she felt horribly butch dame enid who was conducting the orchestra in a dinner jacket had been giving her some very hot looks but at least she didnt look as awful as taggie who must have lost a stone and was wearing a dreadful brown dress that was just the wrong length and made her look completely flatchested there was a gap on taggies left too where the hell was caitlin wondered taggie shed arrived by taxi half an hour ago and despite promising to behave had promptly disappeared all round taggie could hear the roar and sizzle of anticipation as the lights went out and the orchestra started the cameramen whod been forced into dinner jackets by tony took up their positions behind their cameras the soundmen made a final check of the microphones as caitlin apologizing profusely clambered along an irritated row of people and collapsed panting by taggies side do up the buttons of your shirt said taggie furiously in the row behind from the other side having kicked the mayoress in the varicose veins and trodden on the prebendarys bunions the hon archie the bow of his black tie under his left ear collapsed panting beside a bootfaced tony next moment tonys bootfaced expression turned to one of apoplexy how dare you wear a madeup tie he hissed as the prussianblue velvet curtains creaked back on the pontevedrian embassy in paris the ambassador was giving a ball and the guest of honour about to arrive was the merry widow after a rousing opening number by the chorus it was monicas and charless turn monica playing the ambassadors beautiful exactress wife couldnt act for toffee but by tackling the part with the same breezy competence with which she ran charity committees or bathed labradors she gave the rest of the cast a muchneeded confidence and charles looked so sweet in his tight pantaloons swearing eternal and extremely camp devotion that it was rather like a skittish billy bunter getting off with the head girl my marriage is sacred to me warbled monica to the smirks of the audience who all knew she was married to tony if marriage is sacred to you sang back charles lasciviously stroking her bare arm theres not very much i can do to even more smirks from the audience who nearly all knew charles was gay and they liked it even better when his moustache fell off and he nearly split his pantaloons bending over to pick it up what a lot of gold fillings monicas got whispered caitlin to taggie and waving that baton dame enid looks as though shes playing stickie with gertrude whens mother courage coming on any minute said taggie who was praying maud clinging to both bass and ruperts hands stood shivering like a whippet in the wings although her black velvet dress was turnofthecentury in fashion basil for some reason was dressed as a regency buck the longest legs in gloucestershire were set off by gleaming black boots and pantaloons the cut of his slateblue coat would have had beau brummel in raptures and his sleek black hair had been coaxed forward into byronic curls he looked the perfect georgette heyer hero you look gorgeous he whispered to maud so do you said maud whose teeth were chattering loud enough to provide the castanets in the orchestra youll be all right said rupert patting her shoulder and suddenly she was there was no more need of ruperts presence she was really keen to get on stage she must gather the audience into the play and say every line exactly right she was only nervous because she was a young provincial widow a little shy but heartbreakingly beautiful about to be launched on parisian society there was a terrific roll of drums a tantivy of horns and she glided into the glittering ballroom standing deliberately under the huge chandelier so all her jewels sparked and the audience could take in the beauty of her body in the tight black dress and her pallor which only set off her red lips and her brilliant red hair gentlemen no more sang maud pianissimo ive never seen the spring going to a ball before sang a swooning french aristocrat played by the bank manager of lloyds cotchester you throw us into ecstasies lovely lady and for once the words were believable now maud was singing again the exquisite voice hitting f sharp as clear as a bell shit murmured caitlin shes fucking good oh thank god breathed taggie its going to be all right i cant bear it thought cameron shed dismissed maud as a sluttish middleaged parasite with unfashionably long hair who dressed like a tramp and here she was bringing the entire audience to their feet at the end of her first number bass entrance stepped up the excitement even more he had a glorious slightly husky voice and added just the right touch of rakish latin glamour shit said caitlin again lucky mummy hes dead attractive the sexual tension between him and maud was incredible particularly when offset by monica and charles who stepping up the camping got more and more like dignity and impudence having dispatched all the competition bas was left alone on the stage with maud at the end of the first act music so sweet he crooned softly dancing round and round her tempting her into his arms speaks to the heart and the feet and finally triumphantly he swept her into a waltz elegant incredibly romantic they revolved under the chandelier until the curtain came down to a deafening roar of applause and a fusillade of bravoes after the first act even though there was the vilja song and several big numbers to come maud felt nothing but relief it didnt matter that declan hadnt turned up she even sent rupert back to his seat she felt totally insulated shed been so petrified and concentrated so hard on getting that first act perfect that now she felt on automatic pilot all trace of tears had gone and although charles almost stole the show when he bent down to retrieve his moustache yet again and his trousers split to reveal pink boxer shorts covered in paleblue teddy bears it was mauds night when the final curtain came down she was cheered to the rooftops taking curtain call after curtain call as the whole audience even tony were on their feet yelling and clapping like promenaders rupert turned to taggie we did it he said triumphantly no she said you did it dont cry said basil as he and maud took their final bows you were better than anyone could have dreamed said barton sinclair pale beside the madeup actors as he kissed mauds hand and to roars of applause handed her a huge bouquet of flowers that appeared through the curtains i saw the merry widow in paris said valerie jones petulantly to professor graystock it was quite a different opera but then it was performed by professionals i wouldnt call die lustige witwe opera said the professor showing off that he knew the german title but i did think maud ohara was marvellously in voice id like to meet maud ohara said the prebendary she seems an interesting person you shall in a minute said tony cosily maud rushed back to her dressingroom to change out of her gold lastact dress into a blue silk suit shed bought for the occasion after that it was bedlam people pouring in and out hugging kissing and congratulating her the champagne went in a flash the press bombarded her with questions but she was not to be drawn on the subject of declan my husbands in ireland on business she said firmly hell be here later at the party everyone kept coming up and saying how marvellous shed been but she still felt curiously detached as though nothing could dent her now i wonder if youd like to have lunch one day said the prebendary his voice thickening now im in the autumn of my life i enjoy the company of lovely women he was furious when the bishop came up and joined them with a plate piled high with taggies food evening fergus you look very fit good to see venturer pulling their weight this evening maud my dear you were absolutely splendid such good tunes too nice to see my flock enjoying it so much can i get you some refreshment id love another drink said maud well go and get her one said the prebendary irritably heres a waiter coming said the bishop not budging i must tell you about my recent trip to the holy land fergus the prebendary didnt want to hear about the holy land one bit particularly when maud excused herself she was just going over to thank rupert once again when she felt a warm hand on her back it was tony even the ranks of tuscany could scarce forbear to cheer he said softly couldnt you hear me yelling like a schoolboy was it really all right stupendous there wasnt a man in the audience who wasnt madly in love with you im sorry your husband didnt make the grade but then making the grade has never been one of his specialities has it unfortunately he takes the franchise as seriously as you said maud bitterly ah said tony with an evil smile but the difference is hes not going to win maud my dear said monica bringing forward a distinguishedlooking man in a leather jacket with greying hair i didnt tell you before but this is pascoe rawlings mauds jaw dropped pascoe rawlings was simply the most powerful theatrical agent in london were you in the audience said maud and in total raptures said pascoe drawing her out of the shadowy corner and under the naked light bulb hanging in the wings and examining her face carefully yes closeup youre even better look jonathan millers casting a dolls house can you have lunch with me very early next week the party was in fact a great success james spent the evening holding lizzie in front of him like a riot shield to ward off the advances of sarah stratton and only let her go because he wanted to be introduced to pascoe rawlings the next moment freddie had whipped lizzie behind one of the huge cardboard pillars which had stood in the pontevedrian ballroom this is a pillar of unrespectability said lizzie i love you said freddie desperately and i love you james is going to london tomorrow night what time will the children be asleep by nine said lizzie even if i have to drug them ill be there at ninefirty said freddie in her mothers dressingroom on a floor of wilting petals caitlin lay in archies arms and had no need of words taggie spent the evening removing plates keeping out of ruperts way and sticking up for her father it was not just tony who thought hed behaved appallingly so unsupportive snapped cameron he ought to have his knuckles rapped said monica but in a way that storm of grief seemed to enhance her performance i always said you can never trust the irish said valerie jones dyou think declans coming back tonight whispered bas in mauds ear at midnight because if he isnt everyone stopped talking as tony tapped his glass with a spoon on behalf of corinium television he said suavely id like to thank our mayor and mayoress and of course you prebendary for being here this evening i want to congratulate barton and all the cast of the merry widow for a truly splendid performance but most of all i think we should praise maud ohara who under the most difficult circumstances he smiled at maud was without doubt the star of the evening exactly on cue declan walked in he was deathly pale and still wearing yesterdays jeans and darkblue jersey but such was his presence that as usual he made everyone else seem like pygmies charles fairburn who was pissed gave a very theatrical hiss hullo declan dear im surprised you havent popped up through a trap door in a great puff of sulphur and brimstone good morning declan drawled tony ostentatiously looking at his watch youre late four and a half hours late to be exact what kept you i do hope youre not as late as this when you go to the iba on friday week or theres even less chance of venturer winning the franchise declan ignored him and walked up to maud im desperately sorry darling he said i hear you were sensational i knew you would be indignation overcame monicas normal good manners you knew nothing of the sort you beastly man you ought to be hung drawn and quartered she was absolutely super but no thanks to you you wait till you see the video there was a good reason said declan not taking his eyes off maud but as i dont like some of the company youre keeping this evening ill tell you later lets go but shes the guest of honour said monica furiously just for a second everyone expected maud to slap declans face instead she reached up and hugged him poor darling she said you must be tired thank you all marvellously theatrically the big star now she turned slowly round smiling at everyone in the room for a lovely lovely party then taking declans arm she dutifully followed him off the stage caitlin whod just emerged from mauds dressingroom with archie shook her head ill never understand that couple she said on the way out maud and declan passed rupert and cameron rupert saved me said maud ignoring cameron whom she had not forgiven for her abuse earlier i know said declan taggie told me on the way in briefly he took rupert aside look im sorry i focked everything up but dermot macbride insisted i sat down and read the whole play i didnt realize his mother was from gloucestershire and the plays all about his childhood just outside stroud hes giving it to us with an option on the next play im going to fix a price with his agent tomorrow its a focking good play it better be said rupert icily you nearly paid for it with a far higher price than money six days later the gatherum which was the neigbouring hunt to the west cotchester held their hunt ball in henry hampshires beautiful mouldering elizabethan house this was the last time the two consortiums would meet before their encounters with the iba next week and once again the whole place seemed to divide like the dreyfus case at one table sat freddie and valerie henry hampshire very much on his best behaviour as host and in the presence of his wife hermione declan and maud and rupert and cameron bas was turning up later with some exmistress whose husband was conveniently in america two tables away sat the baddinghams ginger johnson and his wife georgie baines with his long eyelashes cast down and his wife paul and sarah stratton and james and lizzie vereker although some of the women in both parties exchanged occasional banter and smiles the men of one side studiously ignored those of the other side maud appeared to be the only member of the venturer party in tearing spirits the two subsequent performances of the merry widow on tuesday and wednesday had been just as successful she had had hundreds of letters and telephone calls of congratulation and yesterday she had lunched with pascoe rawlings who was arranging for her to audition as soon as possible for a dolls house tonight she looked stunning with her redgold hair piled up and an oldgold taffeta dress which looked suspiciously new turning her green eyes a tigerish yellow no doubt when bas arrived after the success of the merry widow the band could be prevailed upon to play a quick waltz and bas would sweep her on to the floor cameron whod been editing the yeats rushes all week and working hard with declan on additional programme plans to present to the iba next friday looked thin and drawn she was worried declan seemed suddenly distant there was none of the intimacy theyd achieved in ireland tonight obviously hating being so near tony he was pale and edgy as the only member of the party in a dinner jacket rather than a red coat his black lowering presence seemed to accentuate venturers gloom and tension cameron was even more worried about rupert who had gone increasingly into his shell since shed come back from ireland he also looked desperately tired the new socialist majority was so tiny that the tories were determined to contest it to the full on every vote which meant endless late night sittings the interminable iba rehearsals even though both henry and wesley were word perfect now were also taking their toll even freddie didnt seem his usual bouncy self only valerie was appallingly unchanged what are you doing fredfred she screeched as freddie started crawling around under the priceless jacobean table lookin for bugs youre more laikely to find woodworm said valerie disapprovingly i cant think why henry and hermione dont junk all this nasty dark stuff and invest in some decent repro and have you seen the state of the place valerie had already had a prowl round some of the bedrooms the long gallery and the grand staircase with its heraldic leopards all the plasters peeling theres so much damp and you should have seen the moths flutter out when i touched the drapes in hermiones bedroom didnt you realize this is a moth sanctuary said rupert gravely you know henry is venturers conservation expert valerie looked at rupert sharply she was never sure if he wasnt mobbing her up actually i wanted to pick your brains she said lowering her voice about fredfreds birthday there was an article in the times yesterday saying the latest thing in the hunting field is to have a brass flask of sherry attached to your saddle sounds hell said rupert with a yawn the only thing i want attached to my saddle is my bum at that moment tony paused in front of the venturer table surveying them with amusement i see the devil has cast his net he said loudly if the holes in his net were as big as your mouth wed all escape drawled rupert everyone at the surrounding tables howled with laughter and tony retreated discomforted and ladbrokes has us at on today rupert yelled after him valerie turned to cameron youre looking a bit washed out i dont think blacks really your colour too deadening why dont you pop into the boutique and buy something naice for all the christmas functions coming up whats the difference between a shop and a boutique asked henry whod got bored of welcoming people they sell exactly the same stuff but a boutique is about five times as expensive said rupert valerie looked very boutiquefaced as rupert turned his back on both of them people were sitting down at their tables now and the waitresses were beginning to carry plates of smoked trout down the aisles looking round rupert noticed the place was absolutely crawling with beautiful onlytooavailable women it was just the sort of evening he once would have revelled in getting drunk and off with half of them behaving atrociously not a cordonedoff fourposter untested what the hell was the matter with him he didnt even want to sleep with cameron any more wheres taggie asked valerie picking up her fork no leave your bread roll fredfred dogsitting said maud holding up her glass for more muscadet i dont know whats got into her at the moment shes so lethargic i tried to persuade her to come this evening but she wouldnt she hadnt got a partner when i was her age i had hordes of boys chasing after me when all this franchise business is sorted out we must all put our heads together and find her a decent guy said cameron dont be fucking silly snapped rupert you cant find people for other people taggies perfectly capable of finding someone herself he put his fork down his trout hardly touched and refusing wine asked the waiter to bring him a bottle of whisky across at the corinium table sarah stratton plonked herself down beside james you shouldnt be here he hissed giving her the sort of look delphinium growers reserve for slugs the high sheriffs wife is supposed to be sitting there i shifted the place cards hissed back sarah you dont want to sit next to that old bag but youve totally ruined monicas placement said james in outrage and that means tonys got to sit next to the high sheriffs wife which he wont like one bit serve him right for trying to split us up i love you keep your voice down james looked furtively round ill talk even louder if you dont let me stay surely you must have a programme in your marriage series on coping with temptation well you can bloody well research it tonight home at the priory taggie having dispatched her parents to the ball was wondering forlornly what to do for the rest of the evening the only decent film on television was italian and she wouldnt be able to read the subtitles fast enough to get the gist of it it was a vicious night the wind was howling round the windows trying to get in out of the cold the snow was falling steadily already lining the windowledge and bowing down the evergreens at least there was a nice fire in the little sittingroom gertrude aengus and claudius were all stretched out in front of the blaze the logs came from their wood or rather it was ruperts wood now everything seemed to come back to him how will i ever get through my life without him she thought hopelessly when i cant even face a muchlongedfor free evening she jumped at a sudden pounding on the door the bell was still blocked up with loo paper to discourage creditors outside was hazel one of the makeup girls from the bbc whod once worked on declans programme and become a great family friend flakes of snow like brilliants in her hair gave her an added glamour shed been doing a job in bristol and was on her way home everyones out except me apologized taggie but come in and have a drink what a lovely house really gothic said hazel in awe as they went into the sittingroom not too large she squawked as taggie poured her a vodka and tonic ive got to drive back to london you must stay the night urged taggie you cant drive in this weather and daddyll be ddevastated to have missed you i cant believe caitlins taking olevels she was such a wee little thing said hazel twenty minutes later and patrick got a first and hes as tall as your dad i do hope your dad gets the franchise were all rooting for him at the beeb tony baddinghams such a shit the telephone rang it was bas taggie babe youre coming to the ball i cant squeaked taggie ive got someone here well get rid of them annabel my date has been out all day with the belvoir and the snows too bad for her to drive down and anyway shes bushed so ive got no one to go with and i cant think of anyone more delicious than you i havent got anything to wear fret not ill be over in an hour with some frocks ive been asked to the hunt ball said taggie in awe wonderful said hazel excitedly ill dogsit go and wash your hair and have a bath ill make you up youll come up beautifully bas naughty as his word arrived an hour later with a back seat loaded up with ball dresses where did you get them asked taggie incredulously coriniums wardrobe department said bas their security is atrocious what a gorgeous man murmured hazel enviously and ive had some heartthrobs through my fingers in my time this dress is made by balmain spelt out taggie slowly what happens if i put my foot through it try the crimson one said bas its much the best colour for you and at least it wont show up the red wine thats bound to get poured over you its awfully lowcut said taggie dubiously all the better said hazel checking the carmen rollers hurry up and decide i want to do your hair back at the ball dinner was over and dancing had begun it was a measure of monicas niceness that no one else but she knew that valerie had auditioned and been turned down for both maud and monicas parts in the merry widow still smarting from the rejection she would have been so much better than maud valerie was now determined to demonstrate her dancing skills and had dragged a reluctant freddie on to the floor she was soon bawling him out cant you concentrate for one minute fredfred i said fishtail not telemarque through a swirling herbaceous border of red coats and brilliantly coloured dresses freddie could see lizzie in fuchsia pink being humped round the floor by james whod at last managed to shake off sarah as they passed tony sitting at the corinium table james deliberately pressed his cheek and his body against lizzies i cant stand it thought lizzie wretchedly shed imagined it would be better seeing freddie tonight than not seeing him at all but it made everything much much worse watching across the room freddie wanted to punch james on his perfectly straight nose and then whisk lizzie upstairs on to a mothinfested fourposter and tear off her fuchsia dress and kiss her all over fredfred screeched valerie in his ear are you tipsy this is a foxtrot declan danced with maud who was well away over his shoulder she glanced at her gold watch bas was very late at the venturer table it was plain to cameron watching rupert pour another large whisky that he was deliberately setting out to get drunk people kept pausing to say hullo but seeing the set expression on his face and the sinister glitter in his eyes they didnt stay long cameron acutely conscious of tony two tables away talking in lowered tones to ginger johnson and watching her every move tried to talk to rupert a slow anger rose in her when he only answered in monosyllables why make it so obvious that youve absolutely no interest in me she wanted to scream was he deliberately goading her to go back to tony the next dance is definitely mine said henry to cameron oh good heres bas at last said maud pinning up a tendril of hair at the back good lord said henry in wonder his glass of wine poised halfway to his lips what a stunning girl annabel kembletaylors hardly a girl said rupert who had his back to the floor half leicestershires been up her she is pretty most dramatical said freddie putting on his spectacles blimey its taggie rupert swung round and caught his breath there undulating across the floor rouged lipsticked her eyes vast and blacklined with kohl black hair a mass of snakey ringlets her shoulders far creamier and lusher than mauds rising out of a ruched crimson dress with a bustle was indeed taggie everyone was turning round to gawp at her basil whod been slowly stalking her for fourteen months looked beside himself with pride you look like a christmas cracker he whispered in her ear as he fingered the ruched dress and my god i cant wait to pull you taggie giggled she was slightly overwhelmed by how different hazel had made her look and the sensation she seemed to be creating her only aim was to please rupert she wanted to show him that she had at last grown up but as he stared at her his face totally unsmiling her courage failed and she gave the dress a desperate tug upwards then just as she and bas reached the venturer table the band started again lady in red said basil in delight how appropriate and taking taggies bag from her and dropping it in front of rupert in a curiously insolent gesture he swept her onto the floor i cant dance pleaded taggie halflaughing i truly truly cant you can with me said bas putting his hand round her waist this is a nice slow one to start with this song could have been written for you you are so so beautiful never seen you looking so lovely as you do tonight he sang never seen you shine so bright i find all this lipstick a bit strange said taggie dont worry ill kiss it all off later taggie blushed he was at least five inches taller than her and so supple and strong and with such a latin sense of rhythm that taggie was soon following him perfectly in time you dance beautifully he said laying his cheek against her hair i can do it said taggie excitedly i can really dance the lady in red is dancing with me sang bas gazing deep into her eyes theres nobody here just you and me what a good thing annabel had such an exhausting day with the belvoir lady in red lady in red sang taggie dreamily and tunelessly not knowing any of the other words it is a most gorgeous song and youre the most gorgeous girl said basil frenchkissing her shoulder very fast man across country bas said henry approvingly very fast man on the dance floor said freddie dont they go well togevver maud was looking extremely wintry cameron was watching rupert his face was like marble but the tendons on the back of his hand which was clenched round his glass were like underground cables he never took his eyes off taggie as she and bas moved round the floor then suddenly as the music stopped and bas bent his ottersleek head and kissed taggie on her crimson mouth his hand tightened on the glass so convulsively that it shattered amazingly he didnt cut himself but there was glass everywhere my auntie was so superstitious said valerie as a waitress rushed in with a dustpan and brush that if she broke something precious shed rush down to the bottom of the garden and smash two jam jars to break the run of bad luck as ruperts hearts just been broken as well said cameron viciously we only need smash one more thing shut up snarled rupert pouring a slug of whisky into a nearby wine glass declan shot him a warning look nor were matters improved by bas arriving at the table with taggie havent i done well he said smugly annabel dropped out so the understudy took her place i knew youd be pleased maud darling he added blithely as he bent down to peck mauds gritted cheek you were just complaining yesterday taggie never had any fun you look absolutely perfick said freddie where did that gown come from asked valerie accusingly corinium wardrobe department said basil lobbing freddies roll at georgie baines at the next table suits her doesnt it she looks great said declan proudly but make sure it isnt bugged all the bug would pick up is the hammering of her heart because shes with me said bas squeezing taggies hand taggie glanced shyly across at rupert who was now looking at her with complete indifference suddenly she felt utterly deflated even with every stop pulled out there was no way she could win him but there was little time to fret next minute a thoroughly overexcited henry had whisked her off to dance they were just circling decorously when the band broke into rock around the clock ha ha ha said henry suddenly galvanized like an overadrenalized tarantula i know this tune theres life in the old dog yet and he flung taggie across the floor with great energy every time he twirled her round he nearly pulled her out of her cracker dress hell discover a paper hat and a motto in a minute she thought as she frantically tugged it up again as soon as the band stopped a young blood swooped and asked her to dance and then another and another each one took her telephone number and said theyd ring her great excitement because it was regarded as highly symbolic was caused at the corinium table when tony won a portable television on the tombola he wont be needing that much longer growled declan who was getting increasingly worried about rupert freddie had also vanished ostensibly to fetch valerie some lemon squash but hed been away for threequarters of an hour and james vereker could be seen hunting everywhere for lizzie as he tried to escape from sarah bas claimed another dance with taggie and persuaded the band to play lady in red again as he and taggie danced past them all the band stood up in salute to her beauty rupert was threequarters of the way down his bottle of whisky when he was tapped sharply on the shoulder by one of his more forceful lady constituents i know this isnt the time but could we have a word about the swindon gloucester motorway she had a face the colour and texture of corned beef and it was now very close to ruperts bugger the motorway he said the corned beef seemed to engorge and darken like the interior of black pudding getting to his feet leaving her mouthing apoplectically rupert reached the dance floor just as taggie and bas were coming off grabbing taggies hand he dragged her back onto the floor alone in the centre they gazed at each other slowly rupert examined the huge blackened almost feverish eyes the trembling ruby mouth the quivering white breasts hardly covered by the crimson ruching adoring the way she looked normally in old clothes with hardly any makeup he detested this new grownup glamorous taggie whats the matter she stammered stepping back as though scorched by the disapproval in his eyes i hoped youd lllike it you look like a complete tart he said viciously and as youre with bas youre obviously going to behave like one taggie gave a gasp of horror as turning on his heel rupert walked straight back to the table what was that about taunted cameron i thought you liked little girls with bust measurements bigger than their iqs i like them better than fucking american smart asses snarled rupert spitting with fury passing heraldic shields suits of armour and antlers of several kinds of deer cameron fled to the ladies rupert was a bastard an utter asshole but as she looked at her reflection in the ancient dusty mirror which should have flattered her she couldnt blame him for neglecting her she looked awful and the black dress shed thought so sophisticated and understated had understated her so much she was practically invisible why the hell hadnt she worn her black suede dress savagely she daubed her cheekbones with blusher and emptied the remains of a bottle of jolie madame what a singularly inappropriate name over her wrists and neck coming out into the long gallery she saw tony emerging from behind a suit of armour and went sharply into reverse he was too quick for her grabbing her wrists he drew her into an alcove behind a huge urn filled with blue hyacinths she tried to wriggle away but he was too strong for her oh why did that sweet heady smell make her almost faint with longing ive missed you he said as he regained his breath ive never stopped missing you i need you corinium needs you come back to us dont be fucking infantile hissed cameron after the dirty trick youve pulled on us im going to bury venturer he said evilly and youll go under too youve just no idea what ive got up my sleeve cameron tried not to appear fazed youll never get away with it the iba knows youre as bent as hell by the time ive finished with venturer ill look like a shining white angel drawing her towards him he slowly fingered her rib cage then pressed the ball of his hand up against her breast at the same time running the other hand equally slowly over her bottom it was an act of assessment not of lust dear dear he sighed you used to have such a beautiful body now you could do a commercial for famine relief dont be disgusting im just sad youve lost your looks the hand still rotated on her bottom she shuddered unable to stop the squirming helpless revolted longing tony always did this to her ive been working for chrissake you always thrived on work youre having rupert trouble i watched you tonight and last friday suddenly cameron realized what the scent of the blue hyacinths reminded her of the much fainter smell of bluebells in ruperts wood the first weekend she spent at penscombe hes got the hots for taggie ohara hasnt he gloated tony everyones talking about it in the distance the band was belting out mac the knife it was as though tony was turning it in her heart bullshit she said with a sob and fled away from him hearing his laughter following her all down the long gallery cameron was so distraught she didnt see declan standing in the shadows of a high tallboy worried about her scrap with rupert hed come looking for her wanting to comfort and steady her he was about to call out the next moment he froze as he saw a man emerging from behind the urn the glint of his huge signet ring as he smoothed his hair and the almost orgasmic expression on his face as he passed made him instantly recognizable declan went straight back to the venturer table but found only maud and freddie you was so dramatical in the merry widow freddie was saying was i really said maud looking very happy whats hup said freddie in alarm as he saw declans face sitting down declan came straight to the point ive just seen cameron talking to tony just saying ullo no it was a long and very intimate conversation she was in tears when she left him he looked delighted with himself shit said freddie its ruperts fault hes been diabolical to cameron all evening whats much much worse is that she and i have been working on the dermot macbride deal and the royal shakespeare negotiations all week if she leaks those to him were stymied i still dont fink shes like that said freddie they was probably just reminiscing were off said a voice it was bas with his arm round a somewhat tearstained taggie youve only just arrived said maud hysterically i know but weve got somewhere else to go on to said bas suddenly there was a shriek of excitement as henry rode a horse into the ballroom and round the floor followed by hounds he had snow on his shoulders and his black hat and all the hounds had snow on their faces and their frantically wagging sterns everyone came rushing in to cheer them there were terrific view holloas as a hound trotted calmly up to the corinium table and lifted its leg on the back of tonys chair wish that dog was a member of the iba said freddie by the time the hounds had gone cameron and rupert were back at the table rupert declan noticed had snow on his hair too and was shivering uncontrollably maud too seemed suddenly terribly upset particularly when valerie pointed out how keen bas seemed on taggie much better for him to find someone nearer his age she said smugly where are they anyway gone said declan where asked rupert looking up sharply i dont know get your coat said rupert to cameron he was waiting in the hall glaring at a buffalo whose eyes were as glassy as his own making no effort to conceal his impatience its not easy extracting ones coat from underneath a heaving husband and someone elses wife snapped cameron outside the snow was already four inches deep as the long dresses of departing guests trailed over the white lawn flurrying flakes seemed to blur the great house and a party of whooping young bloods all no doubt with taggies telephone number in their breast pockets engaged in a snowball fight cameron felt she had gone back four hundred years ill drive youre drunk she said to rupert as they reached the car careful she told herself as the astonmartin slid all over the road like thumper on the ice hes reached that pitch of drunkenness that will erupt into violence at any minute having been beaten up by tony she was terrified of it happening again but as they drew up outside the front of penscombe court rupert waited until she got out of the car then slid across into the driving seat and set off in a tremendous flurry of snow sobbing uncontrollably cameron let herself into the house and shouting at the dogs to get out of her way went straight to ruperts office and started searching in the bottom drawer of his desk under the lining paper she found what she was looking for that impossibly illspelt and illpunctuated letter taggie had written rupert thanking him for claudius and two photographs of her running in the wood she stiffened when she saw the second ruperts kids were there as well as taggie they were holding her hands and laughing the leaves were flamered on the beech trees so it must have been autumn and tab was wearing her puffball skirt so it must have been this year shit and they all looked so happy it must have been while she was away in ireland that was why rupert had been so reluctant to have the kids over since and insisted on taking them out on his own in case they babbled on about taggie that was almost the worst thing that she had utterly failed with the children where taggie had succeeded also under the lining paper which she couldnt interpret was a pile of faded leaves rupert knew he was far too drunk to drive but he didnt care anyway he had always jumped horses when he was pissed with that much more dash and brilliance unable to stop himself he drove straight into cotchester and parked outside the bar sinister the roofs of the honeycoloured houses were completely hidden with snow now flakes were landing like huge polar bears on his bonnet almost obscuring his vision but not so much that he couldnt see the lights in the flat above bas was plainly at home christ why had he been such a shit to taggie shed looked so fucking gorgeous and hed detested it because he wanted to keep her as his little teenager at the back of his mind hed expected her to be always there rationally he knew he must never make a play for her that one day shed find some nice dull kind boy of her own age to take care of her but he hadnt thought the whole thing through or realized hed be driven into a maddened frenzy of jealousy because shed been stolen from under his nose by the second worst rake in the county who was probably expertly initiating her into the pleasures of the flesh at this moment he slumped on the steering wheel groaning he wanted to break down the door to kill bas to drag taggie back to the priory like a father out of a victorian melodrama in his misery he didnt even feel the cold gradually the snow obscured the entire windscreen and he had to turn on the engine to start up the wipers when suddenly the balcony doors opened and bas and taggie came out she was wearing bass red coat winding down the window rupert could hear her cries of joy at the beauty of the snow next moment bas had gathered up the snow along the balcony rail to make a snowball and handed it to her but she only managed to chuck it a few yards down the ghostly whitening street tell you never played cricket at school said bas fondly then drawing her close by the lapels of his coat he slowly kissed her they were so preoccupied they didnt even notice rupert totally sobered up he drove back to penscombe the rest of the weekend was like the phoney war rupert and cameron were perfectly polite to each other she worked on the franchise he was off to rome on sunday for a meeting with the international olympics committee but would be home on wednesday night the only time she saw him with his guard down was when she caught a glimpse of him watching a lassie film in the study he was clutching beaver and the tears were running down his cheeks after lunch next day having scraped the frozen snow off the bird table and fed the birds for the fourth time declan had great difficulty getting out of his drive to visit freddie the gritters had been at work on the main roads but the side lanes were murder for once the beauty of the black and white landscape held no charms for him he passed several cars totally submerged which must have been abandoned last night and a farmer frantically trying to dig out some sheep before dusk the sky was a dull mustard yellow promising more snow what would happen if none of the venturer consortium could get up to london for the iba meeting freddies drive had already been lavishly gritted i sent the council a grittings telegram he said with a huge laugh in fact i bunged them a few tenners so they made a detour past the ouse he poured declan a large brandy and took him into his study the house was blissfully warm after the priory outside valeries garden had never looked more beautiful totally hidden by snow the gaudy colours wiped out the vast rockery transformed into a miniandes the garden gnomes and the plastic cherubs fluffed out into creatures of fable even the serried ranks of hybrid teas had become a white army hoisting up fistfuls of snow if valerie moved to the arctic reflected declan she might become an arbiter of garden taste a vita sackvillenorth freddie was in terrific spirits brandishing the telegraph with a piece on the forthcoming franchise struggle it says four incumbent companies are vulnerable and names corinium as one of them it also says venturer coriniums rival must be reckoned a considerable creative and management force then it goes on to say corinium are strongly challenged and as a result their shares are selling at a substantial discount to assets i dont understand what that means said declan dont matter its good believe me were on our way boy what are we going to do about cameron and tony freddie chewed on his cigar i cant believe shes turned i dont want to but we still havent discovered who leaked the names of the other moles to tony how was she in ireland asked freddie wonderful said declan wistfully well then my guess is that shes dotty about rupert and when he started giving er the runaround last night tony seized his chance and accosted her on the way back from the ladies declan thought it was more complex to bolster her chronic insecurity cameron had to have a man in her life and after that last night in galway when shed made such a definite play for him he didnt think she was ruperts exclusive property any more he was also furious how much seeing her with tony had upset him weve fought this fight absolutely straight up to now said freddie except for rupert seducing cameron in the first place but so much is at stake now freddie went on that wed better put a private detective on tony and get rupert to slip a tiny bug into camerons andbag the snow was falling again flakes tumbling down dark against the muddy yellow sky then getting lost to view as they reached ground level better not involve rupert at this stage said declan if he realizes shes been hobnobbing with tony he might get really rough and send her scuttling back to tony for good anyway shes got a dozen bags ruperts bound to bug the wrong one and hes off to rome for three days tomorrow ok said freddie stubbing out his cigar and getting to his feet well start wiv a private detective on tony i know an ace one leave it wiv me declan sensed that freddie was anxious to get rid of him wheres valerie he asked visiting her sister in cheam do you want to come over for supper freddie shook his head its not really a night to go out thanks ive got an ell of a lot of work to do i keep forgetting im the chief executive of a public company committing adultery freddie reflected ruefully after declan had gone made one tell an orrible lot of lies james vereker was spending the night in london at another corinium dry run lizzies nanny was away for the weekend he must remember to ring valerie before he left so she didnt ring and find him not at home as he arrived at lizzies he felt glad that the steadily falling snow would cover any wheel tracks by morning lizzie was looking out for him so no doorbells should wake the children she welcomed him in a primroseyellow silk dressinggown rosy warm and florisscented from the bath the lights were low in the bedroom but a fire burned merrily in the grate reflected tongues of flame lasciviously licked the ceiling making a mental note to throw away the evidence first thing in the morning lizzie said there was a bottle of moëtt to be opened instead freddie opened her silk dressinggown and felt his heart stop lizzie was wearing just black high heels and a black corset which pushed up her breasts moulded her waist and stopped just above her damp blonde bush except for four black suspenders holding up black fishnet stockings you are the loveliest fing ive ever seen murmured freddie come live wiv me and be my love leave it on he added as lizzie started unhooking kneeling down he removed her high heels and kissing her instep slowly kissed his way up until he could bury his face in the soft marshmallow of her thighs lizzie bent down to take off his jersey and shirt feeling his stomach muscles tauten as she unbuckled his trouser belt there was a huge mirror on the ceiling james adored to watch his own reflection when he made love beside his lithe and taut bronzed beauty lizzie had always felt like a beryl cook lady with freddie she felt slim and beautiful and wanted to watch the whole thing i never rated swucksontnurf before said freddie happily the snow had grown two inches on the window ledge freddie had grown several inches and diminished again the logs had died in the grate before lizzie leaned up on her elbow smoothing the redgold curls on his chest i love you she said softly so as not to wake him freddie opened an eye i meant it when i said come live wiv me and be my love he said the following tuesday morning james vereker had a rare and intimate breakfast with his fiveyearold daughter eleanor usually james fled the din of little children in the morning and either had his muesli prunes and herbal tea in bed or breakfasted at the corinium canteen after a workout in the gym this week he and lizzie were recording their second programme in the series on the way children enrich and restrict a marriage james had already written his script which began as a caring parent i and was now in between reading the guardian doing a little research into fatherhood sebastian ellies brother whod already got soaked making a snowman and nearly drowned testing the ice on the lake was upstairs having his clothes changed by jilly the dependable boot of a nanny lizzie was working ellie was eating a boiled egg dreamily dipping buttered toast soldiers into the yolk i hope youll watch roundup tonight james said to her were visiting the zoo and filming a new polar bear cub which is called james after me i saw freddie bare the other night said ellie dreamily i dont think i know freddie bear said james do the bbc make it or is it one of ours i saw freddie bare repeated ellie i heard you said james patiently is it a new cartoon no freddie bare he was on the bed with mummy they were struggling james put down his spoon i beg your pardon i wanted a drink of water so i went into mummys room freddie and mummy were in bed freddie was bare but mummy was wearing long socks with her bottom hanging out james went very red in the face are you trying to tell me that mummy was in bed with someone er someone who wasnt daddy yes beamed ellie freddie with the big tummy hes nice he brings us smarties youre not to make up wicked fibs said james furiously jilly he yelled for the dependable boot its time the children went to school lizzie had the effrontery to giggle when james confronted her its not funny thundered james no it isnt oh dear i hope the poor darling isnt totally put off sex for life is that all you can say what about me nothing would put you off sex for life said lizzie stop being frivolous i cannot believe youd cheat on me with that dreadful overweight common little man freddie is a very nice man said lizzie hes totally dishonourable and so are you what about all your affairs theyre finished said james sanctimoniously and being in the media one is inevitably the target of certain attentions anyway its different for men dont blame freddie then freddie said james working himself up into a fury is a member of the rival consortium i feel utterly betrayed its like fraternizing in the war well im not having my head shaved screamed lizzie and whats this about wearing long socks and your bottom hanging out lizzie giggled again it must have been my fishnet stockings and my corset you dress up like a prostitute whatever for to excite him said lizzie simply you never bothered to do that for me said james indignantly lizzie watched james catch sight of himself in the mirror smoothing his hair he composed his features into an expression suitable for a wronged husband hes just the wrong husband she thought i suppose you realize said james nastily freddies only been running after you to worm corinium secrets out of you i shall have to tell tony of course we have to report anything suspicious hell be delighted to have something on mr squeaky clean at last i shant blame you ill say being somewhat unsophisticated and unused to male attention you fell for it ive heard enough said lizzie furiously freddie is the most honourable man ive ever met after you junked sarah because tony ordered you to clean up your marital act she went screaming round to rupert and told him everything james winced rupert was all set to give the story straight to the news of the world it would have been a goody corinium stud ordered to give up mistress by boss in order to present image of idyllic marriage to viewers and iba there were plenty of corinium people including sarah whod have enjoyed shopping you to the press and the whole thing would have been a lovely black blot on coriniums escutcheon but freddie wouldnt let rupert do it unlike tony he feels that sort of thing is below the belt he didnt want mine or the childrens names dragged in said it wasnt fair having them branded as the offspring of an adulterer and a pratt she added as an afterthought you uncaring bitch spluttered james and what is more continued lizzie coldly if you breathe a word about me and freddie to anyone im leaving you and then your silly marriage programmes going to look even sillier the moment james left the house lizzie burst into tears she was still crying when j illy the dependable boot got back from the school run in the end lizzie told her the whole story id no idea poor darling ellie came into our bedroom that night shed have screamed if shed been frightened said jilly comfortingly she was perfectly happy on the way to school on monday only interested in whether the lake would be frozen enough to slide on she picked up a table which james had knocked over as he rushed from the room if it comes to a split id like to stay with you youre the best boss ive ever had and i love the kids i dont mind taking a cut in salary if things get hard there there theres no need to start crying again freddie was just going into a board meeting when lizzie rang him ill come and get you no no said lizzie weve got to lie low i dont want to give tony any ammunition at this stage venturer doesnt need it and think of valerie sharon and wayne well just have to play safe and not see each other till after th december thats over a fortnight said freddie aghast well we must try anyway freddie was utterly distracted at the meeting when an outside director congratulated him on the new billionpound deal with the japs he looked blank when another informed him that the exchairman general walters had died of a heart attack freddie said triffic news keep up the good work outside in the beautifully kept company gardens the sun like a huge red christmas bauble was setting down the side of a large yew tree freddie shivered at the thought that the sun might be setting on his relationship with lizzie then one of his secretaries summoned him from the meeting there was a call she said on his very very very private line whose number was only known to lizzie and now the private detective it was the latter ringing hed seen tony and cameron go into the royal garden hotel early that afternoon theyd spent ninety minutes in the residents lounge hed walked through twice and thered been no one else there freddies heart sank he told the detective to keep on tailing tony and immediately rang declan who was utterly shattered they both decided however that if cameron had spilled any more beans it was too late to muzzle tony now if as was just possible she hadnt she was still too important a trump card with the iba to be frightened off they decided to wait until rupert returned from rome tomorrow before tackling her next morning after a restless night declan woke up to more snow and not wishing to risk either car walked down to the village shop to get the papers yesterday at the priory theyd had a power cut and frozen pipes today the washing machine and the tumble dryer were kaput and it was warmer out than in threefoot icicles hung from the faulty gutters the evergreens lining the drive were bent double by the snow every blade of grass edging the road was rimed with frost and burned with a white heat of its own the traffic was crawling so slowly that declan didnt bother to put the dogs on leads gertrude a bit lame from the hard ground still rushed into every cottage front garden and barked at the snowmen claudius encountering his first snow this year was wild with excitement plunging into drifts leaping to catch the snowballs declan hurled for him as declan passed the white church he sent up a prayer that venturer might win on such a beautiful day one couldnt fail to be optimistic but as he walked into the village shop mr banks who was a great newspaper reader waved the times lord baddinghams been blowing his own trumpet again declan felt his throat go dry his stomach churned page five went on mr banks handing the paper to declan baddingham set for victory said the headline there was a very nice picture taken from above and at a slight angle to reduce the heavy jowl tony was smiling and showing excellent teeth the interview had been written by a wellknown financial journalist as he was so confident of retaining the franchise tony had told him he was only too happy to reveal coriniums plans for next year they were very happy to welcome three new directors on to the board all production people including ailie bristoe whod just spent three years in hollywood and who would be director of programmes they were also very excited about their new networked thirteenpart series on marriage which tony predicted would turn james and lizzie vereker into big stars it was safe enough stuff declan sat down on the snowcovered windowledge outside the shop obscuring the postcard advertisements for lost gerbils daily women and secondhand carrycots in the window corinium he read on had also made arrangements with the royal shakespeare to televise special productions of whatever shakespeare plays children in the area would be taking for oand alevels each year then they would offer the videos for sale theyd also be filming johnny friedlanders hamlet which had been postponed until the summer shit thought declan in horror those were both camerons ideas but most exciting of all he read on was that corinium had signed up a new play by stroudborn playwright dermot macbride with an option on the second there followed a lot of guff about macbrides towering genius and how happy tony was to welcome this lost son of gloucestershire back into the fold we paid a lot for macbride tony had admitted but as the financial journalist pointed out the publicity value alone would be worth thousands of pounds to corinium please dont obscure my advertisement said a shrill voice ill never get a cleaner that way looking up declan discovered an old lady with a red nose glaring at him looking down he saw gertrude and claudius sitting at his feet shivering miserably slipping and sliding falling over twice moaning with rage declan ran home to the priory look at fucking that he brandished the times under mauds nose tonys bought dermot macbrides play cameron must have leaked it to him i always thought she was untrustworthy said maud who was plucking her eyebrows declans hands were so cold it took him a long time to dial the number of dermot macbrides agent we had a deal what the fuck are you playing at the contract hadnt been signed said the agent defensively my duty is to get the best deal for my authors tony offered three times as much as you you could have come back to me id have matched his offer he said if i talked to you the deal was off thats the last deal ill ever do with you roared declan never mind im retiring at christmas through the window declan watched the priory robin furiously driving a rival robin away from the bird table how did tony know about our deal dunno he phoned about five yesterday i spoke to macbride we exchanged contracts this morning itll buy a few gold watches for me the moment declan put down the telephone freddie rang have you seen the cotchester news theres a bloody great picture of you an me an rupert an basil an enry all in our red coats out huntin wiv big grins on our faces wiv a caption do you want these butchers to run your television station thats libellous howled declan have you seen the times yes said freddie grimly unfortunately thats not im not waiting for rupert to get back said declan im going round to have it out with cameron right now but when he got to penscombe mrs bodkin told him cameron had gone out and wasnt expected back until evening guilt thought declan in a fury cameron got home around eight that evening she knew she shouldnt have played truant but having brooded agonizingly about rupert since the hunt ball she felt she had to get out of the house the heavy frost had made the white valley look so beautiful that morning why should i give up all this without a fight she had thought rupert was an alpha male he was exceptionally handsome funny very rich clever in a totally different way to herself and now that shed given him six months intensive training on pleasing a woman rather than automatically pleasing himself spectacular in bed a great believer in positive action she drove into cheltenham to the branch headquarters of mind the step a support group for stepparents and stepchildren which had just opened cameron figured the subject would not only make a good programme but might help her love ruperts children and understand her own tortured relationship with her mother and mike she had a long talk with the organizer who then gave her several names and addresses driving round gloucestershire cameron was amazed how many people welcomed her in at their wits end hemmed in by snow and coping with stepchildren at home for several days they were only too happy to talk to someone listening to the shrill invective to halfhearted attempts at love to occasional genuine affection to grown women blaming their own stepmothers for lack of love which prevented them in turn loving their own husbands and children cameron forgot her own miseries she decided it would make a marvellous programme and was already preselecting the people to interview like declan on his way to the village shop that morning she returned to penscombe with a feeling of optimism she found messages from mrs bodkin that rupert had rung twice freddie three times and declan four going into the kitchen she poured herself a large vodka and tonic and decided to scribble down some ideas for the step programme while it was still in her head searching for a biro on the kitchen shelf she found the yellow sachet that had been included with the flowers that tony had sent her after he beat her up which you were supposed to add to the water to make the flowers last longer stabbed with sudden misery she wished she could sprinkle the sachet on rupert to prolong their relationship with a lurch of apprehension she heard the dogs barking in the hall not rupert the welcome wasnt clamorous enough but it was obviously someone they knew she went into the hall declan her face lit up sorry i didnt call back ive had a great idea for a programme on treachery asked declan bleakly youre an expert on that subject what are you talking about do you want a drink no thanks he followed her into the drawingroom you seen the times havent seen any papers ive been playing hookey declan picked up the times from the table it took him ages to find the right page here he thrust it at her what a crazy photo of tony she said settling down on the sofa for a good read theyve made him look almost benign oh my god she whispered a minute later the laughter vanishing from her face i dont believe it how the fuck did he find out you tell me something chilling in his tone made her look up in alarm he had moved close and seemed to tower above her his legs in the grey trousers rising like two trunks of beech trees the massive shoulders blocking out the light and in his deathly pale face the implacable everwatchful eyes of the inquisitor cameron shivered what dyou mean i saw you plotting with tony on friday night he was waiting for me when i came out of the john for chrissake so freddie and i had him followed camerons eyes flickered youre not going to tell me you and tony were talking just about cucumber sandwiches for an hour and a half in the royal garden yesterday afternoon said declan cameron suddenly looked the picture of guilt sure i saw him we had tea i needed advice on on she flushed scarlet a personal matter you gave him all our programme plans just as last month you told him the names of all the moles no doubt hes got lots of other info about venturer up his pinstriped sleeve for the meeting tomorrow cameron looked furious and terrified now the hawk cornered by her captor about to strike i didnt tell him anything you bloody liar thundered declan how long have you been spying for him ever since the beginning since rupert got his legover in madrid how could i possibly spy for tony she screamed he beat me up for chrissake this she waved the times piece at declan sabotages everything weve worked for someone else leaked it why did you bother to go to london on the worst day of the winter snarled declan blue the lurcher whod been hovering nervously jumped up on the sofa beside cameron and glaring at declan started to whine querulously at him the other dogs licked their lips beaver slunk out of the room blue believes me pleaded cameron why the fuck should i come to ireland and work so hard on the programme plans if i was spying for tony hes given my old job to ailie bristoe thats a front bullshit said cameron furiously is this some kind of a nightmare are you back at corinium am i your guest tonight wheres the fucking thumbscrews and the rack or do you use electrodes and kneecapping like the fucking ira grabbing her arm declan yanked her to her feet no one else knew about dermot macbride how much else have you told him ignoring the low growl from blue he started to shake her like a rat you arrogant pigheaded irish asshole yelled cameron why dont you believe me maddened because shed let him down violent because he felt guilty about wanting her so much declan slapped her very hard across the face the next minute blue leapt at him burying his teeth in declans arm leave screamed cameron leave blue grabbing the dogs collar she tugged him off then almost carrying him back onto the sofa beside her collapsed sobbing into his shaggy coat pulling himself together declan lit two cigarettes but as he handed one to cameron blue gave another ominous growl its ok boy gasped cameron she wiped her eyes frantically on her sleeve then took the lighted cigarette inhaling deeply she felt she was drawing the fires of hell into her lungs blue struggled up on his front paws and licked her face my only friend she said tonelessly youd better have a tetanus jab she added to declan massaging his arm declan retreated to a respectable distance in front of the empty fireplace ok what was the personal problem and why tony i know hes a shit but sometimes i figure hes the only person in the world who truly cares for me after beating you up cameron fingered her reddened cheek and shrugged seems to be catching im sorry cameron took a deep breath i saw tony because rupert doesnt love me any more and i cant handle it just because he was bloodyminded at the ball said declan scornfully were all uptight at the moment camerons lip was trembling again rupert doesnt give a shit about the franchise all he cares about is taggie taggie said declan flabbergasted my taggie are you out of your mind he saw her when we were in ireland in his bottom desk drawer under the lining paper hes hidden pictures of her with his kids cameron gave a sob and hes also kept some totally illiterate thankyou letter she sent him declan was utterly appalled rupert and taggie he growled so furiously that blue started rumbling back at him like rival storms across a valley im not having that profligate bastard laying a finger on taggie but its ok for him to finger me hissed cameron im only a mole earlier that afternoon rupert had flown in from rome and gone straight to his office in whitehall ignoring a long list of telephone messages he signed his letters gathered up the rest of the post made sure he was paired for the finance debate that evening and set out for gloucestershire slumped in the corner of a firstclass carriage with his hand round a large bells he looked at the snowy landscape turned electric blue in the twilight even in london it wasnt thawing it had been a wasted visit to rome hed made no contribution to the international olympics conference he hadnt been able to sleep or eat or think straight he was so haunted by the image of taggie and basil on the bar sinister balcony or of taggies gasping with pleasure in basils expert embrace he tried to concentrate on the standard but beyond the fact that corinium shares had unaccountably rocketed and patric walker forecast a stormy day for him tomorrow and warned cancers which was taggies sign to ignore all outside influences he couldnt take anything in sitting opposite an enchanting blonde was eyeing him with discreet but definite interest glancing at her slim knees above very shiny black boots rupert reflected that by now in the old days he would have bought her a large vodka and tonic and been investigating the prospect of a quick bang at the station hotel cotchester if not at penscombe what the hell was happening to him his secretary in london had given him a carrier bag of christmas cards to sign for constituents and party workers wearily he scribbled rupert campbellblack in a few but not love not for anyone in the world except that feckless taggie unknown to him taggie was slumped shivering and equally miserable in a secondclass carriage down the train shed been doing an early christmas lunch for some overseas sales reps in swindon which had seemed to go on for ever she always found train journeys unnerving having to read all the strange station names and the platform directions and the train times today by mistake shed got on a train going back to london and had to get off and wait in quite inadequate clothing on didcot station for half an hour as declan had taken the new mini maud had borrowed taggies car to buy a new dress for her audition for a dolls house tomorrow shed promised to meet taggie at cotchester if taggie rang and told her what train she was coming on but when taggie had tried to ring her at didcot there was no answer rupert thought he was dreaming when he saw taggie ahead of him on the platform at cotchester the snakey curls had dropped she was back to her old ponytail as she walked up the steps of the bridge he noticed a man behind admiring her long blackstockinged legs fucking letch rupert wanted to kill him as she turned to hand in her ticket under the overhead light bulb he noticed the black shadows under her eyes too much sex he thought savagely no one was there to meet her there were no taxis the telephone box didnt work peering out through the square glass panes taggies legs nearly gave way beneath her as she saw rupert getting into his car rushing out into the street she waved at him there was a moment of blind hope as she thought he waved back as he stormed past spraying snow all over her but he was only adjusting his driving mirror the only answer was to walk into cotchester and find another telephone box or perhaps ask bas to run her home why the hell hadnt she worn boots she wasnt thinking straight at the moment the icicles glittered from the station roof as she went past ahead she could see the white spire of cotchester cathedral glinting in the moonlight with all the coloured windows lit up by a service inside the next minute a car skidded to a halt beside her what the hell are you doing trying to find a telephone box to ring mummy she muttered through furiously chattering teeth her lips were a livid green her nose blueybrown in the orange street light get in said rupert viciously he punched out the number he knew so well he let the telephone ring for two minutes there was no answer mummys on the toot as usual he said ill run you home oh please dont bother its not exactly out of my way he said sarcastically the frozen snow twinkled like rhinestones in the moonlight once theyd got out of cotchester on to the country lanes there was only room for singleline traffic between the huge polar drifts they didnt speak for a few miles then glancing sideways rupert saw the tears pouring down her face what the fucks the matter now i thought we were friends then why did you go to bed with bas i didnt i meant to because i was so miserable about you i thought if i got some really good experience you might fancy me a bit but when it came to the crunch i couldnt do it i love you too much rupert stopped the car pulling it into a gateway im desperately sorry sobbed taggie groping in her bag for a paper handkerchief i know it must be boring having every woman you meet in love with you i didnt want to be one of them ive tried so hard to get over you work doesnt help at all its just that youve been so kind looking after us sorting mummy out the other night and getting all that food when i made an upcock at sarah strattons dinner party and giving me all those lovely things and buying the wood for far more than its worth who told you that said rupert appalled ursula did she saw daddys bank statement it was the only good thing in it im sorry for being such a drip rupert raised clenched fists to his temples in a superhuman effort not to reach out for her taggie mistook the gesture for sheer horror at being propositioned by yet another girl im sorry for christs sake stop apologizing rupert started speaking very slowly and deliberately as if he was addressing some loopy foreigner look it wouldnt work im terribly fond of you tag but im far too old remember that hamburger bar manager who thought you were my daughter ive never been faithful to anyone for more than a few weeks and im not going to ruin your life by having a brief fling with you my lifes ruined already sobbed taggie whod soaked one paper handkerchief and was desperately searching in her pockets for another youll get over me said rupert handing her his like that fivebar gate in front of us said taggie helplessly what made it worse was that the car got stuck and they had to push it out and taggie slipped over and rupert picked her up then almost shoved her away as though she was white hot so desperate was his longing to take her in his arms the priory was in darkness when they got back tell your father ill ring him later said rupert cannoning off a low wall in his haste to get away across the valley he could see lights on in his house he couldnt face cameron at the moment if only he could dump on billy but it was wednesday and billy would be at the television centre presenting the sports programme mindlessly he drove back to cotchester and parked outside basils flat one look at ruperts set white face was enough bas poured him a large whisky taggie said there wasnt a legover situation there wasnt said bas not through lack of trying on my part she is utterly adorable but she utterly adores someone else you lucky sod rupert drained his whisky im not going to do anything about her why ever not said bas incredulously its on a plate im too old shopsoiled evil oh dont be so fucking selfindulgent all these histrionics and tantrums are just the last frantic struggles of the lassooed bronco youve never been in love before its really very nice if you stop fighting it everyones got to hang up their condom sometime taggied be worth it i dont want to talk about it ok said bas filling up their glasses am i interrupting you not excessively i was just looking at the books the bars had a staggering year thanks to all those malcontents from corinium drowning their sorrows and plotting my big brothers downfall wont be so good next year with you and freddie and declan running things theyll all be working so hard they wont have time for a lunch hour dyou really think well get it course we will said rupert thinking he really didnt give a fuck any more bas shook his head tony gave a bloody good interview to the times this morning came across as mr caring he threw the paper in ruperts direction rupert ignored it did she really say she loved me yes she did which i find extraordinary knowing you as i do rupert shook his head in bewilderment its never never hit me like this before either im still not going to do anything about it up in london that night the fourteen directors and senior staff of corinium television had an extremely successful final dry run before their meeting at the iba the next afternoon tony in a new darkblue pinstripe suit paid for by corinium was in coruscating form they can have one drink he told ginger johnson beforehand and then not one drop until weve been round the course and im going to grill them no one at the meeting tomorrow he said was to speak until hed introduced them there was now as a result of recent hiring and firing a most satisfactory preponderance of exproduction people on the board who would do most of the talking the moneymen like ginger and georgie baines who brought in the vast advertising revenue would keep a low profile in fact it would be better if the word profit were not mentioned at all all the men had had hair cuts no doubt muttered sarah stratton to james vereker there will be a nail inspection in the morning afterwards they all dined wisely but not too well at the carlton tower where they were staying overnight no shellfish was allowed nor liqueurs after dinner everyone was very impressed with ailie bristoe the new programme controller whod flown over from hollywood for the occasion and seemed as beautiful as she was bright james vereker in particular thought she looked very caring im surprised tony hasnt put the women in separate hotels grumbled sarah as they were all sent up to bed early be sure to order a scorpion for tomorrow was tonys parting shot youll all find it very interesting reading back in gloucestershire declan finally stormed out of the priory around ten oclock having failed to get a confession out of cameron utterly devastated that he and freddie could possibly think she was the mole cameron was slumped on the sofa still cuddling blue when the telephone rang it was some girl saying rupert wouldnt be back until the morning but he sent his love there was a terrific din in the background and the girl sounded as though she was ringing from a bar bastard thought cameron but she was too proud to ask where he was as she put the telephone down it rang again can i speak to rupert campbellblack hes not here is that cameron cook this is she the voice thickened and became oily as though it was asking for extended credit this is the messenger here wondered what you feel about ruperts memoirs in the scorpion i dont know what youre talking about ruperts really done it this time bloody bad timing on the day before your iba meeting cameron had had a long day and was not connecting well but gradually it sank in that beattie johnson had finally got her revenge on rupert by telling all to the scorpion not only according to the messenger reporter had she produced every kind of salacious detail about her two years with rupert and the unbelievably kinky things theyd got up to but even worse revealed intimate details of his sex life with other women including helen oh my god whispered cameron does he mention me not yet sweetheart said the reporter whod already seen and admired camerons photograph but you may be in saturdays instalment theyre trailing the spread thats going out on friday the morning you go to the iba its all about ruperts affair with amanda hamilton wife of the shadow foreign secretary very pretty lady evidently she liked being spanked cameron groaned and theres a particularly damaging bit tomorrow said the reporter who was beginning to enjoy himself ill read it beattie writes i always felt rupert was unnaturally close to fellow show jumper billy lloydfoxe rupert admitted that when they were in kenya he helen and billy and his journalist wife janey who left billy for nine months soon after they were married had a naughty foursome did helen who started an affair with jake lovell shortly after this incident discover the true nature of ruperts sexual preference that night i dont want to hear any more screamed cameron slamming down the receiver it rang again it was the sun go away she screamed immediately shed put down the receiver she dialled out fuck off all of you snarled a voice declan its cameron have you heard about ruperts memoirs yes said declan and i dont know where the fuck to get hold of him nor do i sobbed cameron the juggernauts rumbling along cotchester high street woke rupert next morning to the worst hangover in recorded history moaning he pulled the blankets over his head there was a knock on the door bugger off i feel terrible youre not going to feel any better when you read this said bas handing him a fernet branca and the scorpion which rupert read in silence the dirty bitch he said softly she said shed get me in the end it was as though some terrible monster from his past had put a hand up from a manhole and dragged him down into the mire and slime below he went straight to the lavatory and threw up lend me a toothbrush and then a telephone he said to bas he was put straight through to freddie look ive only just seen the scorpion im ringing up to resign dont be daft said freddie ive got to there are two more days to go and its bound to get worse unless i pull out theres no way youll get the franchise dont be rash mate we wont be much good at running a tv station if we cant ride out somefink like this got to stick togevver come over ere and well sort out the best plan of action but youre not resigning up to me really said rupert i must see cameron and then ill be over arriving at penscombe he found cars parked all the way up his drive and the gravel in front of the house completely hidden by journalists photographers and television crews corinium had even had the temerity to send a mobile canteen stonyfaced greyer than the trampled snow rupert got out of his car fuck off the lot of you he snarled as they all surged forward ive got to talk to my lawyer what about the franchise asked the mail on sunday come on rupe said the star give us a quote weve waited all fucking night ive got nothing to say ill put my dogs on you if you dont beat it fighting his way into the house he slammed the door behind him well well well said cameron from halfway up the stairs she wore no makeup and her hair was sleeked back from her face which was deathly white im sorry began rupert fuck off screamed cameron as a photographer appeared at a side window racing downstairs she drew the curtains come upstairs said rupert they went into his bedroom the set for so much of the action in the first instalment of the memoirs almost as though the great fourposter would contaminate her cameron gave it a wide berth and went over to the fireplace how could you she whispered have you told people those sort of things about me never never said rupert suddenly dizzy he slumped on the flowered chintzcovered chair in front of helens old dressing table beattie was a special case the thing that turned her on was stories of my screwing other women she must have had a tape recorder running under the bed the whole time then you did say those things theyre disgusting insupportable she shuddered you realize your careers finished youll be kicked out of the party i hope youve already resigned from venturer and i suppose saturdays instalment will be all about your touching designs on taggie ohara how the great rake was reformed and approached his waiting bride with a tenderness which was all the more careful the more considerate because he knew the depths of her apprehension kerrist her voice rose to a screech rupert looked at her incredulously expecting the exocet from the front he was suddenly being torpedoed from underneath youre in love with her arent you said cameron rupert looked across the valley at his white fields hed always seen them as arms protecting taggie now they seemed like a great predatory polar bear crushing the priory to death he turned back to cameron ok he said flatly i do love her if im honest ive loved her ever since new years eve probably long before that im desperately sorry i know ive dealt you a marked card im much too fond of you to kid you along any longer just for the sake of the franchise that you and i are going to end up together cameron opened her mouth to yell at him but rupert raised his hand for a seconds more silence i didnt know a thing about these memoirs coming out not that youd want me anyway after reading them but i want you to know that i was intending to level with you today about taggie for a second cameron seemed to sway with frenzy like a viper about to strike then she screamed you wont get her declan knows about it too and theres no way hell let you ever get your filthy depraved hands on his darling daughter i know there isnt said rupert this he picked up the scorpion and wearily dropped it in the wastepaper basket has finally done for us serve you fucking right yelled cameron im getting out of here and i never want to see you again she rushed downstairs out of the front door then kicked and punched her way through the waiting journalists sending several of them leaping for safety as the lotus stormed down the drive nice quiet girl said the mail on sunday picking himself out of the snow arriving at green lawns rupert found freddie and declan desperately trying to salvage the iba meeting as a result of ruperts memoirs two of the major financial backers had pulled out and professor graystock had resigned as rupert went into freddies study the bishop rang up im afraid in the light of rupert campbellblacks quite appalling revelations i shall have to withdraw my support for the venturer bid you cant said freddie aghast the meetings tomorrow morning your not being there will really tip the scales i fort the church of england were supposed to forgive sinners i have to set a good example to my flock said the bishop and rang off lilylivered bastard said freddie furiously were well shot of im hed have impressed the iba said declan bleakly who couldnt look rupert in the eye was it because of taggie or the memoirs then i must resign said rupert its the only honourable thing to do no you wont said freddie it dont add up beattie johnson was a slut but she ad a good eart i dont fink shed ave written those rings wivout considerable financial inducement seb burrows has got nuffink to do at the moment im going to put him on to the story and see what he can dig up and cant we slap an injunction on the scorpioni rupert shook his head wearily i wish we could but im afraid its all true although its appallingly slanted the only wrong thing is that billy and i arent gay seveneighths of it was never never meant for publication but she was such a fucking good listener and you know i can never resist making people laugh we were together for two years for christs sake hows cameron taken it asked declan harshly she was in a terrible state last night thinks you and she are kaput rupert slumped on the sofa putting his head in his hands we are ive just told her declan lost his temper it was like an earthquake and a volcano erupting at the same time cant you ever keep your fucking trap shut first you tell everything to beattie johnson then you have to give cameron the boot dont you realize thisll screw up any final chance we have of getting the franchise no bishop no professor no financial backing no cameron shell bolt straight back to tony and tell him everything she hasnt told him already what dyou mean rupert looked up the bloodshot eyes suddenly alert havent you read the times yet bas muttered something about it last night but i forgot to read it cameron leaked all our plans to tony on tuesday dont be ridiculous we put a private detective on to tony they spent an hour and a half together in the royal garden so said rupert they were having a bunkup camerons straight i swear it so do i said freddie well its purely academic now since rupert has seen fit to kick her out im sorry declan its not bloody good enough unshaven puttycoloured his shirt on its second day his suit crumpled rupert looked so desolate and so ill slumped on the sofa that freddie went over and put a hand on his shoulder could appen to anyone youll come out of it venturer wont ive done for the lot of you at that moment valerie marched in ive read every word of your disgusting memoirs she screeched i dont want you in the house you might give wayne or even fredfred some horrid disease shut up snapped freddie hes ad enough punishment now just bugger off and bring us some black coffee feeling he was such an irritant to declan rupert left soon after that holing up in bass flat he spent the rest of a nightmare day on the telephone trying to resign from the party from his constituency and from the international olympics committee to his frustration no one would accept the leader of the opposition for example was amazingly sanguine wait until the franchises have been awarded she said that tramp beattie johnson took me to the cleaners just before i became leader slanted the whole interview jolly nearly cost me the job the amanda hamilton business is unfortunate i grant you but rollos only shadow foreign secretary at the moment and you havent done anything illegal theres been absolutely no security leak and it isnt as though you were married when you were in office just hang on a bit amanda hamilton on the other hand was absolutely gibbering with anger when rupert rang her rollo was intending to sue she said malise gordon by contrast was icy cold with rage that helens name had been dragged into it im not excusing whats happened said rupert but i was very raw when helen left me beattie lived with me for two years naturally i confided in her about my marriage it never entered my head shed shop me none of the stuff thats been printed was intended for the memoirs will you tell helen how desperately sorry i am i did tell beattie hundreds of good things about her which she conveniently forgot to put in im sure thatll be a great comfort to helen said malise acidly look im going abroad immediately after the iba meeting tomorrow said rupert i wont be back for christmas i must see the children before i go i dont think thats at all a good idea said malise crushingly and i know helen wont either tabs far too young to understand and i doubt if marcus will ever speak to you again after the things you said about his mother the press are howling round the place your presence would only exacerbate things just bugger off and leave us all alone i must explain just for a second ruperts voice faltered that whatevers happened i still love them for christs sake malise you can always write said malise and hung up rupert sat slumped for a long time then he borrowed two hundred pounds in cash from basils till a piece of writing paper and an envelope darling taggie he wrote im sorry i was bloody the last two times we met of course were still friends one day youll find some nice boy whos worthy of you and hell be the luckiest sod in the world in the meantime could you spend the enclosed on christmas presents for marcus and tab youll know instinctively what theyd like thank you for everything god bless you rupert shoving the cash and the letter in an envelope he gave it to bas to deliver to the priory towards nightfall over at green lawns freddie and declan were just trying to prevent another backer pulling out when the private detective rang on another line he had something too important to tell them over the telephone hed be straight round he turned out to declans surprise not to be some seedy unfrocked cop in a dirty mac but a delightfully understated mousehaired young wykehamist with an innocent pink and white face nor did he beat about anyones bush tony baddingham spent yesterday afternoon in a stowinthewold motel with a woman ive got pictures of them arriving separately and then leaving together and exchanging kisses in the car park he threw the pictures down on the table fascinated freddie and declan got up to have a look in the first photograph the woman had her black coat collar turned up and was wearing a black beret dark glasses and her hair tied back in the second coming out of the motel her coat was unbuttoned she was laughing holding the dark glasses and the beret in one hand with her glorious red hair trailing down her back in the third she was kissing tony in front of taggies car is this some kind of a joke hissed declan im afraid not said the private detective im awfully sorry mr ohara after theyd gone i talked to the receptionist after id bunged her she admitted theyd been there several times before she showed me the register theyd signed in as mr and mrs jones the girl remembered mrs ohara because she was so beautiful declan started to shake it was like seeing the first stroke of the woodcutters axe going into a great oak tree thought freddie but it was bas not tony muttered declan bas must have been a front said freddie look how upset she was the other night when taggie turned up with bas said declan frantically trying to convince himself thats because shes jealous of taggie said freddie wisely it was only later she got really upset which was when you told us youd just seen cameron with tony and she did know all about dermot macbride and the shakespeare plays i dont believe it muttered declan she wouldnt i must find her he stumbled towards the door for christs sake drive slowly warned freddie as declan walked into the priory maud came out of the drawingroom with a glass of champagne in her hand she was wearing a black poloneck jersey a black coat black stockings black flat shoes and a black beret on the back of her head she was very pale she wore no lipstick but her skin had a glowing luminosity and her eyes were huge and dreamy declan thought she had never looked more beautiful and suddenly knew she was as guilty as hell darling i got it she said ecstatically what the part nora in a dolls house we start rehearsing immediately after christmas and theyre paying me four hundred a week so our money worries are all over how little she knows about anything thought declan how can a child have done such terrible things wheres taggie he asked cooking supper i think you dont seem very pleased for me darling as if in a dream he led her into the drawingroom shutting the door and then opening it again to let in claudius and gertrude gertrude had a bonio sticking out of the side of her mouth like a pipe she could sit there for hours saliva hanging in festoons declan leant against the door for support watching maud put a log on the fire despite all mauds grandiose plans for the priory there were still no curtains at the windows which were as black as her clothes how long have you been having an affair with tony he asked almost conversationally mauds face went as blank as a digital clock in a power cut i dont know what youre talking about dont prevaricate ive got evidence declan threw the photographs down on the sofa slowly maud examined them rather good that one she took a leisurely sip of her champagne i might use it as a publicity photograph how longs it been going on since september so you told him everything maud shrugged i really dont remember we found so much to talk about this cant be happening to me thought declan i dont feel anything its as though were discussing two characters in a play but why tony bas i can understand but not for the first time he betrayed any emotion not that filthy venomous toad maud looked at him for a moment her hand gently stroking claudiuss ears because he was kind because he listened to me because he was interested in me as a person not just as a hole between two legs her sudden uncharacteristic coarseness shocked declan almost more than her betrayal tony he said in amazement kind suddenly maud flipped youre so obsessed with your fucking franchise she yelled you dont know anyone else exists except when you want to fuck them you couldnt even forget it for one moment to get back for my first night when i really needed you christ i needed you and then swanning in and ordering me away from my own firstnight party i was only fooling around with tony until then it was only after that that it got serious he arranged for me to meet pascoe rawlings he saw that a car delivered me to pascoes office last week and brought me back he fixed for me to be driven to the audition today and even though hed got his iba meeting this afternoon he still rang me this evening to see how id got on youd even forgotten i was going she laughed it was a horrible sound without any merriment the great interviewer so praised for his judgement of character and his consideration to the staff who doesnt know a thing about his own wife cant you understand that hes using you said declan slowly the only thing that turns tony on is acquisition youve just lost us the franchise and you were going to stand by and let me blame cameron serve her right arrogant little bitch cried maud hysterically outside in the hall taggie could hear her mothers screams getting louder and louder oh god her father didnt need upsetting any more when he had the iba meeting in the morning next moment the drawingroom door burst open im leaving you screamed maud come back roared declan never and dont send ursula looking for me at the lost property office because i wont be there she shot past taggie and out of the front door banging it so hard the whole hall rattled taggie ran to open it outside it was snowing again she watched maud drive off in her car hell for leather down the drive what on earths the matter she said turning to declan who was standing as if blasted white by lightning she was the mole taggie gave a gasp she couldnt be she cant have meant to she did said declan in a voice of utter despair because i neglected her its all my fault i blamed cameron last night and rupert today and just now i blamed her but through my focking obsession and hubris ive brought us all down for rupert next morning the press was crucifixion ranging from highly moralistic pieces about the chronic tory failure to keep their noses clean to doublepage spreads with pictures charting the rise and fall of the tory party golden boy the tabloids had dug up several of ruperts more bitter exes who having done a great deal more than kiss were now only too happy to tell the seamiest tabloid of all had a huge frontpage headline campbellblackguard above an enchanting picture of tabitha in the playground of exclusive bluebells school fees a term ran the copy a little child sobs alone in a voice hardly above a whisper tabitha campbellblack told the scorpion i dont mind my friends not playing with me any more but i dont want daddy to die of aids this is the final fucking limit howled billy lloydfoxe hurling the scorpion across the room im coming with you to the iba the beeb will sack you if they find out said janey who was painting her nails because it was less hassle than cleaning them and as i turned down a hundred grand yesterday to tell all about our life with rupert and this suit cost nearly as much i dont think you can afford to i dont care said billy mutinously ruperts my best friend and anyway since beattie implied i was gay yesterday i shall certainly be snapped up by radio at freddies house the remnants of the venturer consortium gathered before the meeting with no bishop no professor no cameron and none of the moles their numbers were utterly depleted and their bid in tatters the second day of ruperts memoirs was even worse with intimations of underage school girls freddie had spent half the night trying to persuade a demented declan that theyd got to shop tony not just for seducing maud and bugging their houses but because seb was working on excellent evidence that tony had bribed beattie johnson to sing to the rooftops just at a time when it would be most damaging to venturer but like wellington at waterloo refusing to turn the guns on the enemy commandant declan refused to let anyone condemn tony he didnt want mauds name dragged into it he was clearly still suffering from shock he looked terrible a black ram is tupping my white ewe he kept saying over and over again and it was all my fault rupert who arrived with bas didnt look much better but at least hed got a grip on himself the meeting had to be got through there were people not to be let down there would be the rest of his life to mourn for taggie and probably his children as well helen had rung this morning saying she was applying for a court order to deny him access even henry hampshire arrived walking wounded wearing a dark suit with uncharacteristically flared trousers and with his leg in plaster horse put its foot down a rabbit hole was all he would say about it morning he went up to rupert who was huddled on the sofa trying to keep down a cup of coffee enjoying your memoirs great stuff he lowered his voice i had a crack at mandy hamilton myself twenty years ago god she was pretty might have made more progress if id known she liked having her bottom smacked rupert managed a pale smile at least it kept you out of the papers then also lowering his voice he added look i dont think theres any chance now of us getting the franchise tonys now odds on and weve gone way out better have a bet then said henry limping towards the telephone anyway ive had more fun in the last six months than i can ever remember well have to bid for another area next time dame enid arrived next resplendent in a pinstriped trouser suit with an even wider white stripe than tonys a bright blue tie and an al capone hat stick em up its a shoot out said marti gluckstein who came with her he was dressed in a lurid green norfolk jacket and knickerbockers and sucking on a pipe did you get that at valeries boutique said bas then hastily shut up in case freddie overheard thought i ought to appear as the country squire said marti wheres the bishop pulled out im afraid said freddie handing him and dame enid cups of coffee good riddance pompous old fart said dame enid helping herself to sugar cant you pull a rabbi out of a hat to replace him she added to marti marti smirked for you my dear anything crispin graystocks pulled out too said freddie well thank god weve got rid of the two worst wafflers said dame enid philosophically graystocks got complete verbal diarrhoea which reminds me said henry hobbling off at great speed towards the lavatory had the most ghastly trots all night sure im going to botch my answers the moment he arrived lord smith went straight up to rupert really feel for you lad he said but everyone regards the scorpion as fiction that beastly johnson did me over once took down what i said but twisted it like barley sugar ive got a message from alf smithers chairman of the fa he added by way of illumination when rupert didnt react i know said rupert flatly he was my cross hes not cross now told me to wish you luck today said you were the best sports minister theyve ever ad they all wish youd come back whats up with declan wife trouble said rupert happens at franchise time said lord smith when we bid for the midlands eight years ago the wives got so fed up they was all at it even mine only two more to come said freddie trying to cheer up his own and everyones spirits and ere they are he went on as seb and charles came through the door were going to have a fuller house than you thought said charles ive just seen billy janey harold white and sally maples getting out of a taxi freddie had tears in his eyes as he welcomed them you shouldnt have come its totally out of order he said i know what youre risking but i wont say im not bloody pleased to see you declan seemed hardly to notice but ruperts jaw quilted with muscles when he saw billy youre fucking insane he said roughly i like lorst causes as henry would say said billy cheerfully anyway i brought you luck at the la olympics and you brought me luck too if i hadnt done the commentary for the bbc theyd never have given me a job which youre about to lose as the hands of the clock inched past ninethirty they decided that there was no point waiting any longer cameron wasnt coming pity sighed hardy bissett going round straightening ties now dont forget no sniping solidarity is all sit up straight burst with enthusiasm youre bursting a little too much janey darling he did up two buttons of her shirt although on reflection if youre sitting anywhere near the prebendary undo them again and press your elbows together it was still bitterly cold when they set out for the iba in their cars the snow in the park was the colour of dirty seagulls in high street ken the shop windows with their jolly snowmen spangled christmas trees and mufflered brighteyed tots hurling snowballs were at variance with the sullen sky outside and the shoppers shuffling bluelipped and badtempered along the slushy pavements janeys scent was making rupert feel sick in a greengrocers shop he noticed they were already selling mistletoe the one thing he wouldnt need this christmas oh look theres father christmas said janey pressing a button to lower the window as the car swung round the scotch house into brompton road please santa she called out to him as he marched alongside the car will you put a franchise in my stocking ho ho ho said father christmas hoisting his sack onto his back and batting his long black eyelashes at janey for a pretty little girl like you i just might my christ said janey with a scream of laughter as he turned right in front of the car and strode purposefully across the road through the revolving doors of the iba its georgie baines i wish id thought of that said charles petulantly i wanted to come as gwendolyn gosling again but i thought id better play it straight to avoid the press and preserve the utmost security the convoy of cars turned right down lancelot place entering the iba from the back by the underground car park from here their passengers were whisked up to the eighth floor and although the moles nervously looked for reporters in every dark corner they were all safely led along the corridor and installed in an empty office i feel like a courtier waiting for an audience with louis xiv please dont banish me to my estate in the loire sire said charles as he peered out of the window on to another iba block of offices where every secretary seemed to be clutching paper cups of coffee and reading ruperts memoirs god im nervous said henry mouthing the answers to possible questions dyou think i should say brilliant wild life photographer or cameraman cameraman said billy photographer is press and we dont like them very much at the moment i wish i could take in a calculator said marti in a hollow voice dyou think theyll shine lights in our faces asked janey they didnt yesterday but then corinium has a better track record said a voice it was georgie baines whod shed his father christmas disguise and was now wearing a dark suit and fluffing up his dark curls everyone crowded round him in delight of course you went in yesterday afternoon with corinium said freddie wearing a different tie said georgie how long were you in there asked seb exactly an hour said georgie what was it like falling off a log not one difficult question tonys star is definitely in the ascendant thats why im here ive always believed rats should desert a rising shit how did you manage to get away asked janey removing a last bit of white beard from georgies chin tony thinks im at saatchis a female iba official was going spare trying to organize everyones entrance into the board room in a preordained order so the authority would know who they were i expected eleven people she said in bewilderment there seem a great many more i know who you are she said to janey and you she said to rupert keeping her distance and you she turned to declan looking perplexed as though she hardly recognized him are you the bishop of cotchester she asked marti as she consulted her notes everyone giggled and i wasnt expecting you mr white or you billy or you miss maples and certainly not you again mr baines well were all here said harold white we belong to venturer have you all got your two photographs everyone duly produced them had to go into woolworths to get it taken announced henry never been there before rather a lark the female official scratched her head in despair and wheres cameron cook not coming nor the bishop nor professor graystock theyve dropped out said freddie helpfully nor wesley emerson hes still wiv us but hes playing in a test match abroad no im not said a voice deeper than the caribbean sea it was wesley in a support venturer tshirt and an england blazer he was greeted with screams of delight dame enid thumped him on the back till he pleaded for mercy how did you manage to get away pulled a muscle man said wesley grinning from ear to ear but i havent slept all night so i hope theres no tricky questions about ethnic minorities rupert took him aside you really are fantastic he said wesley grinned i read all that shit about you man same thing happened to me thought we ought to show a united front i really think ive got you all sorted out said the iba lady ill just check that lady goslings ready after that there was a dreadful quarter of an hour wait its just like standing outside the headmasters study said seb are we going to have to run round the pitch fifty times or get six of the best amanda hamiltond like that said charles then seeing the bleak expression on ruperts face oh come on rupert ones got to laugh rupert whod been thinking of taggie didnt really think one did have to must go to the lavatory said henry will you all come in please said the iba lady good luck everyone said freddie remember the old bat who isnt lady gosling is mrs menziesscott exchairman of the wi hissed georgie the twelve members of the authority flanked by six senior staff from the iba were already seated along one side of the beautifully polished oval table as venturer filed in and took up their places opposite them in the centre sat lady gosling in a thick brown tweed suit and a bottlegreen cardigan despite the warmth of the room a thermal vest could be seen peeping above her brown check shirt mrs scottmenzies of the wi whod been foolish enough to wear a rust angora jersey had already turned puce in the heat other members of the panel included such worthies as the exlabour minister for education who gave lord smith the ghost of a wink a welsh judge davey a catholic bishop the prebendary who had an expression of extreme distaste on his face several dons two exchairmen from public companies and lady barnsley late of the white fish authority who was alleged to have an orgasm every time she saw a celebrity handbag rammed protectively against her groin she was now gazing at rupert with a mixture of terror and excitement three other authority members whod been avidly reading the memoirs hastily shoved them away as venturer came in i wish id brought my autograph book whispered judge davey who was generally regarded as the group wag freddie sat in the middle facing lady gosling flanked by rupert and declan on ruperts right as obvious and disfiguring as a lost front tooth was a space where cameron should have been janey was up the end of the table with only henry beyond her so he could stick out his plaster leg the prebendary sat opposite them gazing at janey with pursed lips surreptitiously she undid a couple of the buttons of her grey silk shirt it was like dining at lady margaret hall she thought as she looked at the worthy unpainted faces of the women opposite she wished shed softpedalled her eye makeup henry was gazing out of the window at knightsbridge barracks used to work there he announced in a loud whisper youd never believe there was a squash court on top lady gosling who had not winked at her friend dame enid greeted them with the utmost coolness im sorry you were kept waiting so long it was because of the very considerable changes in the numbers attending i see all the socalled moles one could feel her fastidiously putting quotes round such a slang word have decided to show up despite the threat of dismissal and we certainly werent expecting you she added to wesley we gathered you were playing in a test match wesley gave her the benefit of his heavenly bananasplit smile i was mrs menziesscott gosling hissed janey im sorry mrs gosling i got injured and coming to this meeting seemed more important after all well be running a television company for a long long time hum said lady gosling somewhat hubristic of you and where are the bishop and professor graystock freddie cleared his throat er theyve withdrawn because of a conflict of interests one can understand that said lady gosling heavily and cameron cook freddie opened his mouth im here said a voice behind him im so sorry lady gosling my cab ran into another car in the old brompton road it was cameron in her scarlet silk suit bringing a wonderful warmth and colour into the room she was very pale beneath her blusher and wearing tinted glasses but totally selfpossessed sliding into the seat beside rupert she very deliberately put a hand over his then smiling down the row said once again im so sorry everyone you little beauty said freddie under his breath camerons arrival seemed to pull venturer magically together the first questions were about finance and technical specifications and initially fielded by freddie then like a tigerish scrumhalf he passed the ball out to his wings rupert bas lord smith marti and georgie barnes whod arrived with a pile of revenue forecasts freddie in fact was the life and soul of the application a born showman puffing on his cigar giving occasional infectious roars of laughter he exuded honesty energy and huge enthusiasm for the task the prebendary who was still looking beady didnt throw wesley on ethnic minorities but seeing him yawning asked him why he personally wished to oust corinium as the franchise holder i live in the area man drawled wesley im absolutely fed up like everyone else in this consortium with having to watch such godawful programmes even lady gosling suppressed a smile and nodded to lady barnsley who rather nervously asked if the applicants programme plans were based on its view of the characteristics and needs of the franchise area it was a sod there was a long pause almost entirely said cameron we all know and love and live in the area so we want to put something back and give it a regional identity we want to make friends with the viewers to make them feel part of one great venturer family but our approach would be the same if we were pitching for any area in the british isles great television comes from telling people the truth from entertaining them so well they dont realize theyre being educated we want to make documentaries and dramas that tackle the problems we all face coping with unemployment loneliness adolescence being in love even she smiled testing the age group of the panel with the traumas of having ones grandchildren to stay over christmas the panel smiled warmly back cameron can hardly say this for herself chipped in charles but id just like to add that with her and declan we have the most exciting team to hit the screen since ivory and merchant theyve both been in ireland making a film on yeats for channel four i saw the uncut version last week it is utter magic and will bring yeatss poetry and the beauty of the irish countryside to millions of new viewers it would be nice to think they could do the same for the cotswold area lady gosling nodded sagely noticing however that declan was gazing blankly into space and taking no part in the proceedings everyone drank a great deal of highland spring water dame enid and charles were superb on the arts billy charmed all the panel on sport janey had some wonderful ideas for womens interests seb made them laugh on news coverage saying that the corinium head of news was so idle he consulted his opposite number at the bbc every morning so they could both cover the same local events and there would be absolutely no danger of either of them being bawled out for scooping the other henry started off brilliantly when judge davey asked him about his involvement in the consortium he was just waxing lyrical on capturing the wild life of the area on film and appearing to scratch his plaster for the third time when janey suddenly realized he was pulling up the flare of his trousers and reading the whole thing off his plaster and got the most frightful giggles terrified that the prebendary who was sitting next to henry would take his eyes off her bosom for one second and see what henry was up to janey nudged henry sharply in the ribs ouch shrews voles badgers ended henry lamely dropping his trouserleg and thus losing his impromptu autocue i love badgers said lady barnsley looking very excited weve got some in our wood have you really said henry so have we and so has declan actually i passed two big chaps having a fight in my drive the other night they were so preoccupied i managed to get really close up did you really said lady barnsley lady gosling however had had enough about badgers she looked straight at declan who was still slumped in his chair totally unrecognizable from the dazzlingly charismatic selfconfident demagogue whod laid into tony baddingham at the public meeting who is going to run the company she asked him im chairman said freddie when declan didnt answer i intend to devote at least one day a week to venturer if not more enrys nonexecutive deputy chairman rupertll handle finance and admin with harold declan and cameron will oversee programmes georgie will be in charge of sales charles janey sally billy and seb will all be heads of various departments marti bas lord smiff dame enid an wesley will be nonexecutive directors but theyll all act on a consultancy basis and add to the smooth running of the company but who is really going to run the company persisted lady gosling no contribution was clearly forthcoming from declan so rupert looked at lady gosling squarely i am he said i would have thought said lady gosling icily that your very limited business experience doesnt include the creation of new companies its a tough skill to acquire when i was twentyone snapped rupert i started my own showjumping business which has now developed into a yard which turns over ten million a year im also an mp and on top of all this i ran an extremely successful sports ministry for four years i shall also have the constant and incredibly able advice of all my directors particularly harold whos been in charge of lwts programmes for the last few years the entire board would support rupert as chief executive said bas all of venturer murmured their assent except wesley who was sleeping peacefully he did come on an overnight flight explained janey giving him a nudge howzat said wesley waking up lady gosling looked with infinite disapproval from wesley to declan to rupert to billy then up the table to janey dont you feel there are too many celebrities too many prima donnas in your consortium can you honestly convince us that venturer will be able to stick effectively together as a team yes said rupert evenly once more looking her straight in the eye it hasnt been an easy week with my socalled memoirs coming out but except for the bishop and the professor were all here arent we lady gosling dropped her eyes first glancing at the clock on the wall cameron could see theyd been in there an hour and a half was that a good sign or did the iba merely want to prove venturers inferiority beyond doubt knowing nothing about mauds affair with tony she had also realized there was something seriously wrong with declan he hadnt contributed to the discussion at all by now he ought to be revving up for his final peroration tearing corinium limb from limousine but he was saying nothing she looked down the row at janey and billy radiating panache and glamour and high spirits when she knew how desperately broke they were at charles who had no future if venturer went down at georgie sally and harold whod certainly jeopardized their careers at henry dreaming of bosoms and badgers at wesley whod flown thousands of miles to support them and probably jeopardized his test career as well at rupert who despite the devastating blows that had been dealt him that week had performed so incredibly bravely and back to declan who had taught her humanity they were her friends the people she most wanted to work with lady gosling looked at her watch and poured herself a glass of highland spring well weve listened to you all and studied your bulky application has anyone anything else to say there was a long agonizing pause i have said cameron getting to her feet as slim and brave in her red suit as the young portia ladies and gentlemen last week at one of the northern television stations a young head of news hanged himself she glanced along the row of shocked reproving faces sure weve all been fed the official story that he had domestic and financial problems the truth was he couldnt handle all the pressures in the runup to the franchise awards he was being so bullied to get so many different lobbies local worthies friends of his managing director on to his programme to impress you the iba so that his lousy bosses could keep their franchise and go on making a fortune this is a tragedy and a disgrace went on cameron fiercely and an appalling indictment on the whole iba and itv system we in production should not feel weve got to put on worthy uplifting boring programmes every eight years in order to impress you and retain the franchise we should make good programmes all the time she turned pointing to the framed document on the wall giving the iba its own coat of arms and motto your motto is servire populo but youre not serving the people if youre encouraging the companies to make programmes that please you which you feel the people ought to watch rather than what they want to watch i worked for tony baddingham for four years she went on bitterly and produced some very good uplifting programmes that werent boring said lady gosling dryly cameron grinned touché then instantly she became serious again but that was because tony baddingham was inordinately fond of me and gave me carte blanche to ride roughshod over all the staff and also gave me an unlimited budget while cutting the budgets of all other programmes to nothing morale at corinium was and is absolutely rock bottom declan ohara she looked at declan pleading with him to glance up or react in some way is one of the alltime greats of television but when he was at corinium he was very nearly broken by tony who forced him to interview people of total insignificance big businessmen local dignitaries people whose influence he believed he needed to win the franchise fortunately declan escaped and formed venturer ive spent the last two months working with him and learnt that you dont need to terrorize people or reduce them to hanging themselves to make good programmes once youve got the authority if youll forgive the pun you get far more out of people by kindness and interest in their welfare the welsh judge put on his spectacles for a better look at cameron really she was a most astonishingly attractive girl she could read for the bar if ever she got fed up with television itv audience figures are plummeting went on cameron accusingly because so many of the programmes are so awful and because most of the companies are run by accountants who arent prepared to take risks any more why spend ten million on a serial which may fail when for peanuts you can buy a quiz from another company venturers going to change all that were going to revitalize itv and not only make really good programmes right across the board but also change the scheduling of the whole network so its based on an exact analysis of what the public wants at the moment it is simply a ragbag of whatever happens to be lying around or fits in with the resources of the contributing company we know what difficulties lie ahead we know we cant produce profitable results if we have to make continually uplifting programmes well need your help understanding and guidance all along the way but i promise you unlike corinium we are not april when we woo and december when we wed im sorry ive gone on too long she collapsed back into her chair embarrassed it was some comfort that rupert put his hand over hers with real pride normally your chairman would sum up at this stage but i think weve all heard quite enough about venturers policy from miss cook said lady gosling thank you all for coming after all the effort it was a very curt dismissal feeling utterly despondent venturer filed out of the room even worse as they were smuggled out of the underground car park they went slap into the press who were out in force clamouring to get a quote from rupert about the memoirs fortunately they concentrated on getting pictures of him and didnt notice the rest of the moles cringing inside the convoy of cars for want of anything better to do they all went back to freddies for a wake on the way there janey billy and freddie told cameron about declan and maud but the iba ought to be told stormed cameron someones got to wise them up what an absolute bastard tony is you made a pretty good job of it just now said freddie and declan wont hear of it as soon as he got to freddies rupert took cameron aside thank you for turning up sweetheart you were absolutely marvellous cameron shrugged if you can get a gold with a dislocated shoulder i can talk too much with a broken heart christ i admire you id so much rather youd loved me said cameron sadly for a second rupert lowered her dark glasses and winced to see how red and swollen from crying her eyes were im so sorry angel you know you can stay on at penscombe as long as you like i wont be there for the next few weeks where are you going asked cameron suddenly frantic america this afternoon the only hope is to get the hell out of england until the dust settles so you wont be back for christmas rupert shook his head wearily what christmas or for the iba verdict on the th the results a foregone conclusion couldnt you feel the tidal waves of disapproval and distaste emanating from those tweed bosoms throughout the interview we havent a hope probably not said cameron glancing at declan who was now slumped in a chair shivering uncontrollably with an untouched glass of whisky in his hand but declans going to need a lot of support in the next few days not from me said rupert bitterly the best thing for all the oharas would be to have me out of their hair he looked at his watch id better be off can i ask you just one favour said cameron could i possibly keep blue the doorbell rang and they both jumped thinking it might be taggie freddies secretary answered it and the next moment a man marched into the room for a second cameron thought she was hallucinating for it seemed as if the old declan the forceful confident aggressive cleareyed suntanned declan whom she remembered so clearly that first day he arrived at corinium had just walked through the door then she realized it was patrick thickened out weathered and bronzed from five months working on a sheep farm hed obviously come straight from the airport and being patrick even in a family crisis had bothered to buy duty free whisky and cigarettes hed need them both over the next few days near to tears declan rose to his feet ignoring everyone else in the room patrick went over and put his arms round him its all right pa he said gently i rang home first taggie told me about mum it was a terrible thing for her to do but she had reasons itll be all right its you she loves shell come back he was like the father comforting the child she sabotaged the franchise groaned declan and it was all my fault rubbish said patrick the responsibility for that lies elsewhere he let go of declan and turned towards rupert his face hardening you deliberately set out to seduce cameron because you wanted her on venturers side didnt you well thats for fucking her up the next moment hed smashed his fist into ruperts right jaw and as rupert reeled sideways caught totally by surprise patrick hit him again on the right eye with his other fist and thats for fucking up taggie he added as rupert crashed to the ground in the press over the weekend there was endless speculation as to which of the wronged husbands named in ruperts bonkstatement as the memoirs were now known had given rupert the black eye the next two weeks were terrible for venturer deeply guilty that his utter failure to pull himself together at the meeting had finally cost them the franchise declan went home to penscombe taggie and patrick made sure he was never alone as he seemed to sink deeper and deeper into depression constantly vacillating between loathing maud for betraying him and longing to have her back there was no word from her she seemed to have totally vanished patrick displaying patience and understanding way beyond his years spent hours talking to his father taggie said mum was absolutely gibbering with terror before the merry widow it was such a colossal distance from obscurity back to the limelight a little amateur production perhaps to you but to her it wasnt just an extra step to cross the frogsmore but a vast leap over a fivehundredfootdeep ravine she needed you so desperately to witness her triumph or catch her if she fell i know groaned declan because i always had to fight so hard to keep her i never realized how much she needed me and you know she lives any part she plays in her head shes now become poor bullied nora in a dolls house marching out with a slammed door on an insensitive tyrannical husband she wanted to hit back to slam the door on your figures and finally you mustnt underestimate the influence of tony baddingham i know the effect he had on cameron he is pure iago he only had to point out how brilliant beautiful and sexually voracious cameron was how you were spending more and more time with her how could the two of you not be having an affair you know what an imagination mum has this was even more immediate than p d james imagine too the appalling things he must have said about you and finally the escape from poverty he offered her new dresses new jewels furs no more brown envelopes or creditors at the gate even warmth patrick shivered after the australian summer the priory central heating left a great deal to be desired and he was around all the time and you were away or preoccupied with the franchise or yeats and mum was probably turned on because the whole thing was so utterly verboten all he had to do was to switch on his electric carving knife dip it in washingup machine powder and turn it in the wound declan winced i can understand all that but deliberately to hand over all our secrets she may not have done said patrick taggie was out a lot cooking tony probably came to the house the plans were on your desk your writing isnt that indecipherable dyou think i should go round to the falconry and kill him patrick gave a wintry smile i wouldnt you know how lady gosling abhors violence taggie who was kept enormously busy cooking for parties and filling up peoples deep freezes for christmas made heroic attempts to be cheerful but she worried patrick far more than declan never one to grumble she refused to discuss rupert but patrick knew she was bleeding to death inside outside the weather was frantically warmer the snow thawed in patches leaving fantastic shapes a sea horse there a camel here all down the valley the streams that tumbled into the frogsmore were still frozen into dirty grey glaciers wandering numbly through the fields with the dogs taggie only noticed the flattened tufts of thick tawny grass sticking up through the snow like the heads of a thousand ruperts slain in battle too long a sacrifice quoted patrick bitterly thinking too of his own situation can make a stone of the heart cameron mercifully was still very busy editing yeats declan had lost all interest in the project and setting up the programme on stepmothers which channel four had commissioned she popped over on several occasions to cheer declan up but managed to avoid times when patrick was at home patrick didnt know if shed gone back to tony or whether tony was looking after his mother he and taggie decided it would be better to do nothing until after the franchise results were announced sunday th december was dday the form was that from nine oclock onwards in an atmosphere of high drama and secrecy the existing managing directors of all the commercial television companies would roll up at the iba in their limos at quarter of an hour intervals driving past the battalions of reporters photographers and camera crews they would be ushered once again into the building from the underground car park and be whizzed up in the lift to yet another empty office here not unlike the suitors in the merchant of venice they would be handed a sealed envelope from lady gosling and then be left alone to open it and learn if they had held onto their franchise or whether as in some instances they had to merge with their rivals allowed a few minutes to digest this information they would then be summoned to lady goslings office for a brief word of congratulation or commiseration afterwards they would leave the building by the back door or by the front having sworn not to reveal a word of the results to the press after all the existing contractors had been seen the contenders who hoped to depose them would come in one by one after lunch and endure the same procedure at fourthirty lady gosling would call a press conference to announce the results which would simultaneously be rushed to the stock exchange and the home secretary who would inform the prime minister tony baddingham was so certain he had retained the corinium franchise that hed taken a suite overnight at the hyde park hotel expectation had been boosted by frontpage forecasts in most of the sunday papers of a definite corinium victory the krug was therefore flowing at a reception for the press and for all tonys corinium supporters as he left for his twelve oclock appointment with the iba tony was relieved the contenders werent being seen until the afternoon he would need police protection if he met declan in the lift he preferred to gloat over venturers utter humiliation at a distance it was a bitterly cold grey day with an icy wind which razorcut the face far more effectively than any east end villain rather than walk the two hundred yards from the hyde park hotel to the iba tony made percy drive round the park and approach brompton road from south kensington innumerable cameramen and journalists were mingling on the pavement with the christmas shoppers as his rolls drew up never one to resist publicity tony decided to go in through the front door and let percy take the rolls round to the car park there was a frenzy of activity and popping of flashbulbs as he got out tony had always kept a high profile most of the press recognized him posing for thirty seconds in his garrick tie and new suit he told the grey forest of microphones that he didnt believe in jumping the gun but he was confident quietly confident that hed still be in business that afternoon before scurrying through the revolving doors of the iba arrogant focker snarled declan who was watching itn at freddies house dont talk about guns in my presence you bastard dont watch it said patrick switching off the television itll only upset you you ought to change soon and have a shave whats the point of looking pretty for a firing squad the door bell rang declan started why did he pray each time it might be maud ill answer it said freddie freddies heart was heavy he knew there was no hope of venturer getting the franchise but hed tried to keep everyones spirits up for the last two weeks and tried even harder to be a good husband to valerie in return valerie hadnt even bothered to come up to london today she so detested failure but as freddie peered through the spyhole he felt his heart expand in joy and gratitude for there her face as red and purple with cold as a mandrills bottom stood lizzie never was a door opened so fast as he drew her into the house out of the sight of any lurking press she fell into his arms you shouldnt be here he mumbled incoherently i know i shouldnt said lizzie but james is being so smug and i couldnt sit around drinking tonys champagne i thought it would poison me at tonys house in rutland gate totally oblivious of the franchise affair with only thought for one another caitlin ohara and archie baddingham met up on the first day of the school holidays are you sure its safe asked caitlin as they went into monicas bedroom and your father wont descend down the chimney like father christmas no theyll be whooping it up all day at the hyde park said archie and poor mum will spend her time fending off kisses from ghastly drunken hangerson like james vereker im sorry your father hasnt got it its a shame said caitlin he worked jolly hard so did tag ill support you said archie putting a bottle of sancerre and two glasses on his mothers bedside table look are you sure you want to go through with this and wouldnt rather wait until after were married caitlin who despite her habitual air of unconcern was trembling like an earthquake shook her head most people sleep together first these days just to find out whether theyre sexually compatible anyway i reached the age of consent last week its awfully tidy in here she looked round in amazement you ought to see my parents bedroom dyou think we ought to put a red towel underneath us itd be so awful if i bled all over your mothers sheets what time is it whispered archie one fortyfive said caitlin looking at the flickering red figures of the digital clock why i want to remember what time the most important thing in my life took place said archie as he unbuttoned her black cardigan he looks terrible thought taggie as she brushed declans darkblue suit and straightened his tie the new harvie and hudson greenandbluestriped shirt cameron had bought him last week in honour of the occasion was already too big in the last fortnight the thick black hair had become almost entirely silver and despair and grief had dug even deeper trenches on his forehead and on either side of his mouth the clock struck two cars here declan called freddie from the hall good luck said taggie hugging him itll be over in half an hour one by one the members of venturer shook declans hand and wished him well billy gave him the faded fourleaf clover hed worn in his boot when hed won the showjumping silver in colombia henry hampshire gave him a piece of white heather foisted on him by a gypsy outside harrods that morning rupert had sent a telex from la professor graystock and the bishop of cotchester were no doubt at this moment enjoying their second helpings of roast beef in gloucestershire everyone waved to declan as he set off majestic though in ruin said patrick ruefully not yet boomed dame enid dont be so defeatist boy the media went berserk as declans car drew up it had been a long cold somewhat boring day not admitted inside the iba for reasons of security they had spent their time belting the hundred yards between the front of the building and the back desperate to get a story managing directors of television companies are enormously powerful but not always very wellknown men one camera crew had had the embarrassment of asking their own chief executive what television company he worked for another crew wasted a lot of film on their own press officer but everyone knew declan many of the crews had worked with him and loved him and wished he could have won the christmas shoppers battered by the cold and each other knew him too and cheered and mobbed him it took him several minutes to fight his way across brompton road and as he went in through the revolving doors a fat woman gave him a piece of holly for good luck coming the other way was johnny abrahams his old boss at the bbc whod put in a bid to oust granada how did you do asked declan they told us to go home said johnny despondently declan was taken up in the grey steel lift to the eighth floor and ushered into a large office which said members viewing room on the door inside a lot of maroon chairs were lined up in front of a large screen the grey telephone in the corner was dead a smell of turkey drifted down the passage the aftermath of lady goslings festive lunch out of the window he could see knightsbridge and the northeast corner of harrods strawberry roan against a sullen grey sky with its coloured flags fretted by the icy wind he looked down at the piece of holly which still had two red berries it was nice that all those people had been pleased to see him perhaps one day when hed got this mockery of a franchise behind him he might work again he wondered what maud was doing probably celebrating at the hyde park hotel with tony by now directly below him was lancelot place it was ironic that he was the arthur whod promised the iba camelot and tony was the lancelot whod stolen his guinevere oh christ he groaned how could he possibly ever do anything in life without her mr ohara declan started violently looking round stupidly a kindfaced woman in spectacles had walked through the door with a tray full of envelopes and handed a white one and a larger brown one to him your envelopes best of luck thank you muttered declan he waited politely until shed gone then shoved them in his coat pocket like bills he never believed in opening unpleasant things out of the window he saw a group of horses and riders jingling back to the stables at hyde park back to oats and a warm straw bed christ how peaceful in life to be a horse and how beautiful they were hed have to put the priory on the market immediately but he might get a day or twos hunting before he left mr ohara im sorry i was just leaving would you come upstairs and have a word with lady gosling not much point really nice of her to bother though she asked me to collect you said the bespectacled woman firmly lady gosling sat in her office behind a huge desk the director general and his deputy sat on the sofa the room was full of smoke theyd obviously all had a good lunch good afternoon mr ohara lady gosling rose slightly holding out her thin freckled hand declan held out his realized he was still holding the bit of holly and blushed rather premature to celebrate said lady gosling dryly i should sit down if i were you declan mumbled he would prefer to stand well she began sternly there were certainly some patchy moments in your bid freddie jones obviously has an exceptional grasp of finance and cameron cook was first class what a very bright courageous girl and of course some of your programme plans are extremely interesting whats she going on about thought declan wearily it was like a condemned man being told that hes got a really sympathetic hangman some of the publicity on the other hand has been perfectly frightful went on lady gosling fiercely and your security left a lot to be desired however we were impressed by this she handed declan some sheets of paper at the top of the first were three typewritten lines it was a little time before declans tired eyes could make out what they said we the undersigned wish to state we would like to support declan oharas bid for the corinium franchise he makes the kind of television we believe in and in the brief time he was at corinium we were all impressed by his utter integrity and kindness to staff at all levels if his consortium were awarded the franchise we would all like to work for him slowly slowly declans eyes travelled down the list of names georgie baines cyril peacock daysee butler deirdre kilpatrick mike meadows then on to pas tea girls secretaries production buyers designers security men receptionists best boys gaffers producers sparks riggers researchers makeup girls engineers floor managers directors commissionaires canteen ladies sound men vision mixers he turned the page the list went on in three columns down to the bottom of the next page and then down to the bottom of the next and swam before his eyes declan turned towards the window the horses had all gone in he pressed his hands to his eyes his great shoulders shaking thats a most impressive document said lady gosling gently i should frame it and look at it if ever you feel low declan turned to her frantically rubbing his eyes im sorry to let them down he said in a choked voice it was good of you to show it to me on the contrary said lady gosling you havent let them down at all why dont you open those envelopes still clutching his piece of holly declans hands were trembling so much he tore the white envelope and had to piece the letter together dear mr ohara he read incredulously we have great pleasure in telling you that the venturer consortium has been awarded the corinium franchise declan read the letter three times in silence then he opened the brown envelope which contained contractual details i wouldnt bother to try and absorb those at the moment chipped in the director general also in a slightly unsteady voice but its all good news well done in silence declan shook hands with them then presented the piece of holly to lady gosling and walked out of the room totally forgetting freddies driver waiting in the underground car park he took a lift to the ground floor outside the building the press surged forward how dyer do declan then seeing he was fighting back the tears they divided and let him through as he walked unsteadily off in the general direction of holland park gathered round the radio because there was no television news till six oclock the venturer consortium pounced on every bit of news a great cheer went up when the reporter said that tony baddingham had been seen driving away from the building looking stonyfaced perhaps we havent come to another wake after all said freddie in amazement lets have a drink anyway maybe the iba want us to merge in some way with corinium suggested cameron count me out then said charles id rather stay on the dole they all jumped as the wireless crackled the latest news on the franchise front said the commentator is that declan ohara has just come out of the iba building in tears so im afraid things look bleak for venturer hes just walked through the crowds and was last seen heading towards south kensington tube station like a man in deep shock cameron looked at patrick thats that then that bugger baddinghams beaten us after all said dame enid furiously im bloody well going to tell gwendolyn gosling how he enticed maud away and bribed beattie johnson i dont give a damn what declan says we must be able to appeal i dont fink we can said freddie wearily the decisions final nothings final said dame enid briskly taggie went white you dont think daddy will do something silly of course not snapped cameron because she had thought the same thing and was frightened too lizzie took freddies hand im so sorry darling freddie shook his head near to tears too unable to speak next minute freddies chauffeur rang from the car i eard the bad news on the radio mr j ive picked up mr ohara at south ken is he ok said freddie well hes not making much sense but ill bring him back to holland park ten minutes later declan walked into the drawingroom for a second he looked like a thundercloud so they all knew finally there was absolutely no hope then for the first time in weeks he gave his wicked schoolboy grin its all right my darlings we got it there was a stunned silence followed by an explosion of cheering everyone was hugging each other janey burst into tears so did charles dame enid and billy were wiping their eyes fuckin ell yelled freddie jumping up and down good lord said henry taggie suddenly found herself hugging cameron we got it they both screamed simultaneously are you quite quite sure said bas incredulously can we see the proof grinning broadly declan got the torn white letter out of his pocket everyone crowded round to have a look bloody hell its true said janey giving a whoop of joy and hugging billy we can move back to penscombe im going to be the next trevor macdonald shouted wesley i might even keep my cottage after all said marti what decided them finally to give it to us cameron asked declan over the tarzan howls and the deafening fusillade of champagne corks mostly you said declan putting an arm round her shoulders they thought you were marvellous and they adored freddie but it was everyone he went on raising his hand for silence it was all of you turning up at the iba that finally swung it a case of everyone ventured everything won in the end none but the brave deserved the franchise he wiped his eyes im so proud and happy for us all so am i said henry whod been laboriously doing sums on the back of an envelope i had one thousand pounds on us at christ said bas you can almost buy joanna lumley for that everyone screamed with laughter and started hugging everyone else all over again over at rutland gate caitlin lay in archies arms are you sure that was all right he asked her for the hundredth time as he stroked her flat white belly of course it was i thought guys were supposed to go off girls the moment theyd had them but i love you more than ever youre so beautiful did it hurt very much caitlin giggled one has to suffer to be beautiful and weve got the whole holidays ahead of us have you got masses of work to do yes said archie so have i we can do it together are you hungry i am ill see if theres anything in the larder archie got up naked still slightly plump but to caitlin entirely beautiful he peered through the curtains at threethirty it was getting dark holy shit said archie my mothers just getting out of a taxi frantically caitlin kicked the bottle under the bed put the two glasses in the bedside cupboard dragged on her jeans her black cardigan and her boots and shoved her shirt bra pants and socks into her carrier bag archie turned off the bedroom lights going into the drawingroom a minute later monica found archie and caitlin sitting on either side of an empty fireplace caitlin was reading country life upsidedown hullo mummy said archie heartily getting up and kissing her i thought youd be at dads celebration pissup i was about to join you its been cancelled said monica numbly weve lost the franchise what exploded archie we couldnt have all the papers said it was in the bag they were wrong for security the iba leave mi standing my god im sorry caitlin couldnt take it in dyou mean daddys got it she said slowly i dont know monica looked at caitlin dazedly i suppose so still in her fur coat and headscarf she sat down very suddenly on the sofa stared at her rough gardening hands with their huge diamonds and burst into tears archie whod only seen his mother cry once years ago when one of her labradors had to be put down was utterly helpless it was like watching the titanic sink i just feel so sorry for him sobbed monica i know hes done dreadful dreadful things left no stone unturned to try and win the franchise but he wanted to beat rupert and declan so very badly rushing across the room caitlin put her arms round monica im so sorry im delighted for daddy of course but its like the boat race someones got to win but it doesnt stop it being horribly desperately publicly humiliating for the crew who dont there please dont cry get her some brandy she ordered archie will you be terribly poor no gulped monica i dont think so tonys got all his other companies its just that he minded so much and its such a shock he was so certain struggling to her feet desperately wiping her eyes saying she must find a handkerchief she stumbled off to her bedroom thinking of the unmade bed archie and caitlin looked at each other in horror i must be going senile gulped monica when she returned wiping her eyes and blowing her nose i could have sworn i made my bed this morning youve been under a terrific strain said caitlin sympathetically my father topped up a whisky and soda with milk the other day but i never leave it unmade whispered monica i cant afford to go to pieces tonys going to need so much support she made a face like a little girl drinking medicine as she took a gulp of the brandy ill go and make it for you said caitlin thatll make you feel better then archie and i are going to get you some lunch in the middle of venturers amazed and joyful celebrations the telephone rang dame enid picked it up not bothering to put her hand over the receiver she yelled its the boring old fart for you declan congratulations declan said the bishop of cotchester heartily delighted youve finally got the franchise with the festive season nearly upon us ive been pondering much on the nature of forgiveness i think on balance my flock will understand if i overlook rupert campbellblacks lamentable behaviour i would like to reconsider my position visàvis venturer a beatific smile spread over declans face flock off he said and hung up cameron sat on the sofa cuddling blue a penny for your thoughts said patrick sitting down beside her although now youve won the franchise i suppose theyre much more expensive than that cameron grinned i was thinking how odd it is to feel so wildly happy when ones heart is breaking its relief said patrick filling up her glass to discover youre going to survive after all he glanced across at taggie who with a fixed smile on her face was gathering up glasses like a zombie im not sure my sister is whats she got to complain about said cameron bitterly rupert loves her she hasnt got a clue he does said patrick and hes not going to do anything about it hes probably out on the tiles at some hollywood orgy at this moment busy forgetting her freddie and pa have been trying to get through to him all evening but theres no answer cameron looked at her watch it must be breakfast time in la she said over in california rupert was slowly going out of his mind with misery leaving england had made everything far far worse he couldnt eat or sleep he must be dying if he didnt even want to drink all he could do was long for taggie hed never dreamed anything could hurt so much rupert said suzy erikson his beautiful hostess as they breakfasted by the pool having just come in after an allnight party ive been talking to you for twenty minutes and you havent heard a single word i know im sorry ive also trailed all the most glamorous women in hollywood in front of you for the past fortnight and youve paid no attention to any of them i know im sorry about that too still brooding about your irish teenager said suzy plunging a spoon into her melon go home and screw her its the only way youll get her out of your system rupert looked at his cooling cup of coffee i cant i mustnt fuck her up he repeated dully apart from billy shes the only genuinely good person ive ever met that seems rather a good omen said suzy billys the only person youve ever been faithful to and the only one you havent fucked up either as rupert got up to prowl up and down the terrace suzy thought how much weight hed lost and how really ill he looked having some years ago been desperately in love with him shed always longed to see him brought to his knees but now so abject was his despair she could only feel sorry for him i want to look after her he was saying shes the only person whos ever made me want to find a dragon and slay it for her sake although he added with a halfsmile she wouldnt appreciate it she doesnt like cruelty to animals at all good thing she didnt know you in the old days said suzy have you got a picture rupert walked back to his chair and extracted a creased snapshot from the inside pocket of his boating jacket which was hanging over the back of the chair it was one hed taken in the woods taggie was pinkfaced from catching leaves with the children not a great beauty is she said suzy with a certain satisfaction rupert snatched back the photograph she is he said icily shes the most beautiful girl ive ever seen hum said suzy well if you think that you have got her badly an extremely tense silence was broken by the telephone someone called declan ohara for you said suzy he seems kinda drunk rupert steeled himself for abuse weve got it weve focking got it yelled declan you what not just us you as well weve focking got the franchise judging from the shrieks and whoops there was the most terrific party going on in the background rupert wished after the initial passionate relief he could feel more excited and respond appropriately to declans almost incoherent ecstasy then he talked to freddie who was calmer but equally euphoric and briefly to cameron who sounded pretty overexcited as well then declan snatched back the telephone isnt it focking marvellous youd better come back soon and we can find out if we know how to run a television company whats that oh taggie says to wish you a happy christmas switching off the telephone rupert walked to the edge of the shimmering paleblue pool and looked up at the snowy peaks of the santa monica mountains that rose like one of taggies puddings he wondered if the snow had thawed at penscombe im going home he said to propose to your pinkfaced amazon rupert shook his head violently no no i just think if i was in the same country as her it might hurt less the journey home was hell all the air hostesses fluttered round him plying him with champagne and delicious things to eat which he left untouched by some ghastly irony the film was the woody allen which hed seen with the children and taggie he took in as little of it as he had the first time he tried to sleep but it was as though he was destined to watch eternal television with taggies face on all four channels he dropped off for a few minutes as the plane flew over ireland but dreamed of her and woke in utter desolation to find she wasnt there heathrow at seventhirty on a raw december morning was still dark good morning mr campbellblack said the passport man who didnt even get a nod as he waited for his luggage rupert watched the carousel going round it was the last circle of hell he reflected for people who never got the person they wanted in life his heart was so heavy hed have to pay excess baggage on it as he went through the green door at customs he thought of all the times in the old days when hed sauntered through carrying dope or illegal currency in the bottom of his boots now he had nothing forbidden to declare but his hopeless love for taggie once through the barrier he looked wearily round for his driver but no one came forward christ that was all he needed he set off towards the telephones passing a fleet of people brandishing cards with names on suddenly a particularly large placard caught his eye on it was painted in huge letters roopurt cambelblak only one person could spell that badly he must be going mad then below the placard he saw a pair of very long very slim legs in familiar faded jeans the legs were shaking frantically so was the placard rupert finding too that his legs would hardly hold him up walked towards it very gently he pushed it down seeing first the mane of black hair then two silvergrey eyes then the deathly white face and the desperately trembling mouth hed dreamed of kissing for months now oh tag he said despairingly i cant help it she sobbed ill do anything ill drive you around ill look after your children ill cook clean your house muck out your horses weed your garden i just want to be near you i cant bear it any longer the next moment the placard crashed to the ground and rupert had taken her face in his hands feeling the contrast between the softness of her cheeks and the frantic tension of her jaw and just to prove to himself she was real he wonderingly kissed her lips and her wet salty eyes and then her forehead im such a selfish bastard he muttered into her hair im used to selfish people sobbed taggie id be lost without them and what about the memoirs there was so much uncertainty and despair in his voice that taggie drew slightly away from him then she laughed despite her tears i couldnt read them thats one advantage of being dyslexic rupert started to laugh too and then taking her in his arms gave her a kiss that everyone gathered round said afterwards should for length and passion have gone straight into the guinness book of records i love you he gasped as he came up for air ive never loved anyone like i love you then aware that she was still trembling added its all right darling and suddenly he knew that it was and hed never let her go again mr minister said a voice i mean mr shadow minister glancing round rupert saw they were surrounded by press holding taggie close he whispered wheres the car outside just through the door well make a dash for it on the motorway he managed to shake off the reporters took an exit into some royal berkshire countryside and pulled up with a jerk in a layby then removing both their seat belts he turned to face her taking her hands i want you to know it was he who was stammering now that i only joined the fucking consortium because of you in fact i only came back from gstaad for your rotten brothers twentyfirst because i wanted to have a crack at you i only let myself be interviewed by your father because i thought hed think me a wimp if i didnt and i might be able to ingratiate myself with him i only bought his bloody wood for that ludicrously inflated price because i love you the only reason i didnt move in months ago was because in the one unselfish gesture of my life and christ it was the most difficult i thought it was unfair to foist my sodding bloodyminded nature on you no one could have had a more appalling past taggie put up a hand to his lips to halt him i dont care about your past she said shakily all i want to be is your future it was not long before the car had misted up completely and rupert stopped kissing her and wrote i adore you will you marry me on the windscreen and underneath taggie wrote yes pleese back on the motorway it was light now and taggie could see how grey and thin rupert looked and how blackly shadowed he was under the eyes i just cant wait to feed you up she wailed looking ahead she saw the pallid full moon which like a sympathetic friend had peered in at different windows of her turret bedroom throughout the night as she paced the floor boards wondering whether or not she should go and meet rupert now clearly dying to go to bed the moon kept on bobbing round clumps of trees or above the frozen white downs as if just managing to keep awake to see how the story ended silently thankfully taggie made a joyful thumbsup sign as the moon finally disappeared from view how did you screw up the courage to come and meet me asked rupert putting his hand on her thigh as they turned off the motorway i went to see the children and gave them your presents yesterday afternoon i was so desperate it was the nearest i could get to you they were so sweet and malise and helen were really nice they asked me to stay to supper and after the children went to bed i talked to malise he said he and helen had overreacted about the memoirs and he was sorry and how happy helen had made him and he was thirty years older than her and he told me to go for it really said rupert in amazement good for malise where are we going asked taggie snuggling up to him to ask your fathers permission if he wont give it well have to elope but i dont want it hanging over us youll have to see mummy as well shes back said rupert in outrage when for christs sake the day before yesterday the evening we got the franchise that figures said rupert dismissively realized shed backed the wrong horse no said taggie she saw daddy crying on television when he came out of the iba you know how emotional he is and she thought it was from unhappiness because hed lost it and felt so sorry for him that she rushed back and turned up at freddies house in the middle of the celebrations just after daddyd rung you in fact it was so odd im not boring you she added quickly you never never bore me said rupert touching her cheek well dyou know what mummy said when she first saw him such a strange remark that i remembered it she said my oberon what visions have i seen me thought i was enamoured of an ass patrick says it comes from midsummers night dream anyway they were both crying and fell into each others arms and disappeared into freddie and valeries bedroom pa and ma for the course said rupert shaking his head taggie giggled it was a bit embarrassing hordes of press and television people turned up to interview daddy and photograph him about getting the franchise and hed locked himself in with mummy so freddie and cameron had to field all the questions and then even worse valerie arrived shed beetled up from london the moment shed heard venturer had won to get in on the act and she found everyone plastered and freddie kissing lizzie vereker on the sofa so she stormed off to bed and she couldnt get in because mummy and daddy were in there already christ well never behave like that will we said rupert putting his hand over hers still im glad theyre back together again all the same rupert was surprisingly nervous about confronting his future fatherinlaw he neednt have bothered when he went into the library declan was poring over all sorts of leaflets for electronic equipment spread out on the table rupert great to see you good of you to come back so quickly come and look at this stuff were going to bid for satellite next rupert took a deep breath i actually came back to ask for your daughters hand in marriage declan have you declan peered over his spectacles at taggie i thought you might well she certainly looks happier than shes done for the past nineteen years so id better say yes weve got a hell of a lot to do here can you start work before christmas no i bloody cant im going to be on my honeymoon over christmas so soon cant you wait till the spring and go to paris maud and i went to paris id better call her and well have a drink good thing you didnt turn up yesterday we were all so hungover you might not have had such a genial reception maud he yelled up the stairs maud wandered down looking pretty wretched after her prolonged disappearance but with plenty of her old insouciance and embraced them both shes obviously so glad to be home she wouldnt have minded you marrying the cat rupert said to taggie afterwards a bottle of champagne had been opened when patrick marched in looking like a thundercloud oh christ here comes frank bruno said rupert ducking behind taggie ive just heard the news on radio one said patrick coldly i suppose none of you has had the decency to tell cameron oh dear said declan ill ring her its my responsibility ill do it said rupert ill do it said patrick heavily he took the telephone into the drawingroom next door and dialled the number of camerons house in hamilton terrace she took a long time to answer ive just heard she said in a flat voice it must hurt im very sorry you neednt be snapped cameron why should i care if your sisters finally got him when its all over between him and me still hurts said patrick reasonably not much fun seeing someone get a clear round on a horse you were bucked off by ill be over later whatever for camerons voice was shrill with hostility im going out you stay where you are cameron collapsed on her bed she had nowhere to go anyway she supposed her house belonged to venturer now outside the shoppers were trailing argumentatively home in the rain weighed down by christmas presents then like a frozen pipe that suddenly bursts with a thaw cameron for the first time since rupert left for america gave way to tears around fivethirty when there seemed nothing left to weep out of her system she tried to pull herself together took blue for a quick desolate walk across the water meadows and had a bath at halfpastsix and seven she was interrupted by carol singers at a quarterpastseven she was disturbed by two men with a van who said they had some stuff to deliver what stuff snapped cameron six tea chests full of books records and some clothes dont be fucking stupid youve got the wrong house take it away she screamed at that moment patrick walked purposefully through the door carrying two squash rackets and a portable typewriter under one arm and a large ginger cat under the other i dont like cats nor does blue snarled cameron you will said patrick soothingly just give me five minutes he added to the van driver as he pushed cameron into the sittingroom and shut the door behind him what the bloody hell are you playing at and whats all that shit theyre delivering im moving in said patrick putting the ginger cat down immediately blue bounced up to the cat dropping gracefully down on his front paws head on one side the cat hissed tail like a christmas tree and took a fierce swipe at blues nose blue gave a yelp and retreated between camerons legs theyll get used to each other said patrick just like we will we bloody wont yes we will i love you you cant any

on the door can we unload the stuff now sir said the driver patrick looked at cameron questioningly oh well i guess you bloody well can as the men stumped out to the van patrick smiled down at her i just want to check out on your availability for the next thousand years ive never seen such a change in taggie said caitlin to archie next morning she keeps giggling all the time and grinning from ear to ear and shes suddenly got terribly protective ruperts been asleep for twentyfour hours in the spare room and the most amazingly important people have rung up and she hasnt let any of them talk to him thats nice said archie kissing her they say love hits you with even more of a thunderbolt when youre old rupert woke to blue skies and birds singing outside a fire in the grate and total panic inside he had no idea where he or taggie was then suddenly he became aware of something warm and furry and realized gertrude was lying in the small of his back slowly the events of yesterday reasserted themselves and he felt so happy he nearly went back to sleep again next minute the door opened very cautiously im awake said rupert you did sleep well said taggie in delight as she put down the breakfast tray piled with orange juice coffee croissants and homemade apple jelly because i felt safe for the first time in my life come here rupert patted the bed and when he kissed her she smelt equally of toothpaste and her mothers scent afterwards he stroked her face incredulously i still cant believe im going to spend the rest of my life with you nor i you sighed taggie i was going to bring you bacon and eggs said taggie spooning a pip out of the orange juice but i thought if you hadnt been eating it might be too rich for you then she giggled a girl from the daily mail rang up just now what did she want asked rupert thinking how wonderfully it suited her to be so happy she said how did you first meet your fiance and what was he doing i couldnt say you were playing nude tennis with sarah stratton so i said basil brought you round for a drink and the leader of the opposition rang twice evidently the governments fallen and theres going to be an election she wants you to ring her urgently i said you were asleep ruperts eyes gleamed ive got a feeling youre going to be far far more use to me than i ever dreamed wed better get married at once im allergic to the word fiancée even you cant glorify it i certainly cant spell it said taggie later downstairs they discussed marriage plans i suppose itll have to be cotchester registry office said maud who was thinking about her wardrobe i got married in a registry office the first time round said rupert as its the real thing this time he raised taggies hand to his lips and kissed it we thought we might get married in church im sure we can find some trendy parson in london who wont mind my being divorced ive got a better idea said declan reaching for his telephone book tabithas going to be a bridesmaid said taggie to caitlin would you like to be one too only if i can wear jeans said caitlin declan having for once dialled the right number was put straight through to the bishop of cotchester he immediately apologized for being so shirty on the telephone the other day and wondered whether the bishop would reconsider coming on to the venturer board after all after some huffing and puffing about having to take a stand over rupert campbellblacks disgusting memoirs the bishop said he would be delighted and wrote down the date of the first board meeting theres just one other thing said declan my daughter taggie is getting married and her one wish is to be married by you in cotchester cathedral taggie turned crimson it isnt true she squeaked looking at rupert who had started to laugh the bishop once again told declan that hed be delighted hed become extremely fond of taggie in the past year just the simplest service said declan only family and very close friends and of course all our venturer supporters splendid splendid said the bishop and who is the very very lucky young man well im just coming to that said declan the end
