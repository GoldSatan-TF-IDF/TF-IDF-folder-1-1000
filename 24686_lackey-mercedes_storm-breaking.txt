one karal lay as quietly as he could keeping his breathing even to avoid jarring his head he kept his eyes closed against the light hoping that the snow pack across his brow would eventually ease his throbbing headache it was hard to think through the pain that stabbed from both temples and seemed to meet just above his nose he was only vaguely aware of the rest of his body muffled as it was in blankets with hot stones packed all around to keep him from getting cold the shinain who tended him seemed particularly concerned that he not take a chill from the clammy stone floor or the snow packs on his head if this had been valdemar or even karse there would have been other recourses to ease the fiery lances stabbing through his templesbut unfortunately it wasnt this halfmelted ruin of an ancient tower held no such amenities as healers or herbal pharmacopoeias and he was going to have to make do with whatever their shinain allies could come up with at least for the present that meant willow tea and snow packs and hope for the best i can always hope for the best it could be worse how much worse thoughthat was something he was not prepared to contemplate at the moment it was a headache of monumental proportions which was only to be expected considering that he had personally been the nexuspoint for all of the energies of a weapon so powerful and unpredictable that not even the great mage who had ended the mage wars had dared to use it it had required a magicchannel a living channel either no one in urthos contingent of mages happened to be a channel or else the mage of silence hadnt wanted to risk the life of such a person in the use of this weaponin either case it had remained unused with a warning plaque advising against its use or else he couldnt get any volunteers not that karal could blame anyone for not volunteering his first experience at being a channel had been singularly unpleasant but the second had been of a different order of magnitude altogether he honestly didnt remember too much of what had happened to him once the weapon had been activated both the hawkbrother adept firesong and the halfshinain andesha had assured him that was all for the best and he believed them when both andesha and firesong agree on something he had the shivery feeling that he really didnt want to know exactly what had happened if he knew hed have to think about it and that gave him a very queasy feeling it was much easier to lie in his bedroll and deal with pain than to think occasionally the sounds of the others moving about in their daily chores made their way past the pain oddly muffled or magnified by the strange acoustics of the place andesha and the shinain shaman loisha were talking softly their voices blending together into a meaningless murmur as oddly soothing as wind in leaves or the whisper of water over rocks someone probably the kaledain kestrachern silverfox was cleaning cooking utensils soft metallic clinks punctuated the soft sounds of conversation nearer at hand the hawkbrother firesong sang absently to himself firesong was probably mending something firesong always sang when he was mending something he said it was to keep him from saying something he would regret he didnt much care for mending or for any other choresthe tayledras adept had been used all his life to being waited on having to fend for himself was an experience that firesong was not enjoying on the whole karal was of the opinion that he was bearing up well under these pressures and added responsibilities so much for the human members of the group and as for the ones who were not humanwell karal knew where altra the firecat was the furry vibrating blanket covering him from neck to knee was altra not some arcane shinain cover let somehow unlike mortal cats which would inexplicably increase their weight when lying on a human the firecat had decreased his making himself no heavier than a thick woolen blanket only the steady radiating warmth and the deep soothing purr betrayed his presence somewhere beyond the chamber where karal was lying one of the horselike creatures known to the valdemarans as a companion the one called florian listened attentively to andesha and the shaman if karal opened his mind a little he would hear the voices that were only a vague music to his real ears but he would hear them through the senses of the companion the bonds between himself and the companion and firecat were stronger now than only weeks ago he had only to think of them to sense the whisper of their thoughts and he was aware of their presence in his mind as a constant warmth something had happened during the time he could not remember that bound the three of them even more firmly together anything they saw heard or felt he could experience himself if he chose he didnt know if the reverse was true but he rather thought it wasnt he was the one whod been changed not them that was another thing he didnt want to think too closely about the firecat was not entirely a mortal creature and the companion while mortal enough like the firecat was a human reborn into a body of magical nature so if something had happened that bound him to themand so very tightly that he no longer had to work to reach their minds he shivered and the cold he felt had nothing to do with the snow pack on his head oh no i cant have changed that much this is probably just temporary something that will go away when im stronger he redirected his thoughts and noticed that at least now he could think coherently thats an improvement anyway now where was everyone else he kept his eyes closed and listened carefully trying to locate them all by sound alone rather than take a chance that opening his eyes would wake the pain again the remaining nonhumans the two gryphons were busy packing up their few belongings they muttered to each other with little hisses and beak clicks and their talons scraped against the leather of the saddlebags they had borrowed from the shinain for their journey north they had decided that they had been away from their twin offspring long enough and no one in the group was heartless enough to insist that they stay the thrill of walking where the fabled black gryphon had once walked was probably beginning to pall in the face of being away from their beloved little ones for far too long and with the gates down it would be a long trip back even for creatures that flew and it could very well be that coming as close as we all did to getting seriously hurt treyvan and hydona have decided that they dont want to leave their little ones as orphans who could blame them for that yes he was definitely able to think more coherently now coherently enough to notice my neck muscles are in knots hardly a surprise karal sighed a little and relaxed tense shoulders into the embrace of his sheepskincovered pack which was now serving him as a pillow its a good thing that i have clothing in there instead of books the snow pack was working after all if he noticed that his shoulders hurt that meant the headache wasnt overwhelming everything else grand so now i get to enjoy how much the rest of me hurts but as the pain behind his eyes eased so too did the tension in his muscles which were probably contributing to the pain of the headache in the first place so annoying how all these things managed to feed back on each other well id be a poor sunpriest if i couldnt make myself relax now wouldnt i such relaxation techniques were part of every novices training you couldnt pray if you werent relaxed how could you keep your mind on the glory of vkandis if you were being nagged by a cramp he patiently persuaded his rebellious body to behave itself getting muscles unknotted that he hadnt even known were tight as he did so the ache in his head ebbed further thus proving his guess that part of the headache was due to muscle tension thats better thats much better if his head would just let him be he might actually begin to enjoy this invalid state at least a little for once he felt completely justified in lying abed and letting others take care of him the depleted state of his entire body had convinced him that he had actually earned a rest and after all it wasnt every day he had a tayledras healing adept waiting on his every wish how many people could boast of that he couldnt even sigh without having firesong ask him if he needed anything a rather odd turn of events given that firesong was the one used to being waited on he wasnt at all certain what prompted firesongs attentivenessthere were others who would certainly have played nursemaid if the adept hadnt insisted on taking the dutybut the hawkbrother did make a very good and considerate nurse i certainly wouldnt have expected that from him it just doesnt seem like him at all well maybe it wasnt much like the firesong he knew but such a thought was as shallow as the flippant surface that was all the hawkbrother would ever reveal to him given a choice he immediately chided himself for that thought that was unworthy as well as unkind there is far more to firesong than i will ever see we are all trying to cope with extreme situations and if that is the way he chooses to cope he has a right to it just at the moment even when his head wasnt splitting karal was in no shape to do anything other than wonder and enjoy the attention he could hardly move his hand without tiring himself and simply getting to his feet to go to the privy area left him so exhausted he could only lie in his bedroll and doze for marks afterward that worried him unless he regained his strength soon he would not be able to travel if he couldnt travel he wouldnt be able to leave with the others when they returned to valdemar the impatient gryphon parents were not going to wait for the others but the humans could not wait much longer either if they didnt leave now they might be caught and trapped here by winter storms on the other hand it might already be too late the gate that brought us here is down and if i were a mage i wouldnt chance reopening it we might be stuck here until spring even under the best of conditions its going to take an awfully long time to walk back so long in fact that returning home might be the very worst thing that they could do at this point the solution to the problem of the magestorms he had depleted himself to provide was once again a temporary solution only this might be the very best place for them to work on a permanent answer they certainly had resources here at their disposal that they wouldnt find anywhere else for one thing the ancient weapon that they had used to cancel the stormwaves had been only one of several available to them and it hadnt been anyones first choice only the one they understood the best perhaps one of the others would provide a better chance the kaledain had promised to provide a historian a specialist in their own languages and the ancient writing they alone had preserved out of the cataclysm perhaps when he arrived he would be able to provide better translations than the gryphons we havent even begun to explore this place yet this was the heart of the mage of silences stronghold he is said to have been the greatest there has ever been with vast resources can we really assume that we have seen all there is there might be other rooms here rooms they hadnt found yet that might hold more answers to their problem maybe they would be much better off by staying here and looking or studying the remaining weapons it was an option no one had suggested yet but he wondered if they all werent thinking about it much as they would prefer to return home the main problem as i see it is that we dont have anyone with us from the mathematicians and the artificers that alone worried him the last two stopgap measures had been created at least in part by master levys group of clever logicians with the help of these scholars all of them had been able to examine the problem from an original perspective we need them firesong might not like them but we need them he knew that with certainty as if vkandis himself had placed that certainty in his heart he was as positive of it as he was of anything in his life this was not a problem that could be worked through unless all of the minds available contributed to the solution he sighed and as he lifted a hand to move the snow pack off his eyes he heard firesong come to take it for him the cold damp weight lifted away would you like a new one the apparently eternallyyoung mage asked he opened his eyes and shook his headonly a little so as to avoid undoing the good that had been done firesong didnt look very much like a nurse the incredibly handsome young mage had managed to pack a full wardrobe of his intricately styled brilliantly decorated silk clothing into his single pack karal could not imagine how he had done it at the moment he was all in muted silverblues which at least made it possible for karal to look at him without pain from his precisely styled silverwhite hair to his immaculate leg wrappings he was every inch the exotic mage and not at all servile the amused smile he wore reassured karal if there had been anything really wrong with him he was fairly certain firesong would not be smiling not at the moment thank you he said surprised at the rasp in his voice as if he had been screaming until his vocal cords were raw you really dont firesong chuckled surprising him oh theres a reason behind all of this he replied with a smile youre ridiculously easy as a patient and if im tending you i dont have to do any of the more tedious chores his voice took on the merest touch of arrogance id rather keep putting snow packs on your head than wash dishes i assure you karal had to laugh weakly now that sounded more like the firesong he knew oh good he said i was afraid that youd suddenly been filled with the spirit of selfsacrifice and i wasnt certain i could bear that for very long now firesong laughed and tossed his long silver hair over his shoulder keep your tender sentiments to yourself karsite he said mockingly out of my own selfinterest i want you to stay an invalid as long as possible and if you keep saying things like that i might be tempted to do something to keep you that way you promise but you never follow through karal retorted surprising himself with his enjoyment of the exchange i think my tender hide is safe from you you doubt firesongs brow rose and he raised his gaze to a point somewhere past karal probably listening to florian the companion his next words confirmed karals guess well maybe youre right a hoofprint in the middle of my face would not improve my looks he dropped his gaze to meet altras brilliant blue eyes and i dont like the way that cat of yours is flexing his claws either i wouldnt hurt you where it showed altra said dryly into both their minds silverfox might object to my alterations however but you would make a charming girl firesongs silver eyes widened in mock fear but there was a tinge of respect in his look as well remind me never to anger you altra thats a bit vicious even as a joke if i thought for a moment that you were serious it wouldnt be a joke the firecat deliberately raised one paw and licked his flexed talons since altra was the size of most large dogs and his paws were correspondingly huge those talons were wicked looking indeed thats not very subtle cat karal thought warningly knowing altra would hear him it wasnt meant to be subtle the firecat replied in his mind only there was a time when he contemplated injuring you if he ever strays in that direction again i want him to have something to think about karal kept his face straight as altra imparted that choice bit of information so he did not reveal a reaction that was certainly news to him and now everyone seems determined to protect me but firesong was waiting for him to say something so before the mage could ask what it was that made him look so odd he raised a shaking hand to rub his eyebrow cats you cant live with them and the furs too thin for a rug altra gave an exaggerated snort of disgust as firesong laughed aloud you are feeling better he said this time without the mockery good maybe tonight youll be able to stomach something besides that tasteless slop the shaman has been feeding you just try not to get well so quickly that im forced to wash my own plates again any time soon before karal could reply firesong rose to his feet to take away the dripping snow pack he turned his head slowly to look in the direction of florian and the others sure enough a little way past the chambers entrance florian stood with his head just above andeshas shoulder looking at something the shaman was drawing on the floor he could if he just relaxed a little see everything from florians point of view he didnt want to relax that much honestly i just want my headache to stop i want to be able to get up and do things like the others i truly do want to stop being a burden it isnt the place of a priest of vkandis sunlord to be the one given comfort it is the priests place to give comfort he closed his eyes and tried to find some meditation technique that would at least enable him to sleep despite the pain if he fell asleep at least he wouldnt be quite so aware of what a nuisance hed become without any warning footsteps he felt a touch on his arm his eyes popped open all he could manage in the way of a startled reaction he found himself looking up into a pair of extremely blue eyes amused eyes in a triangular face with golden skin the eyes and the face topped a body wearing shinain garments of unornamented dark sablebrown the color he now recalled that swordsworn usually wore when they werent engaged in one of their rare but vicious bloodfeuds the swordsworn had another name kalenedral the ones sworn to the service of kalenel the warrior he knew more about them now than any karsite alive the person sitting lightly on his heels would be one of the swordsworn who had guided them here and guarded them on the way who had with the aid of kleshya excavated a way into the tower he couldnt tell if this person was male or female with the swordsworn it hardly mattered since they were not only vowed to chastity and celibacy but were by their bond to their goddess rendered incapable of a sexual impulse that was a state that had no parallel in the sunlords hierarchy although sunpriests were not encouraged to wed they were not denied that state either well this was not what we intended when we opened our secret to you young outclansman the shinain said in a clear slightly roughened tenor voice that could have belonged to a man or a woman the sworn one spoke with very little accent in remarkably good valdemaran karal was relieved his shinain was rudimentary at best we thought you would be here and gone again the shinain paused then as if suddenly aware that the gone very nearly had been permanently gone karal shrugged this wasnt our plan either sworn one he said politely the shinain laughed true enough and i think not even your god could have predicted this outcome certainly our goddess did not or if she did she saw fit not to grace us with the information but nowwell given that the gate that brought you here is gone and our winter storms are closing in we have determined that we will have to become true hosts at one point karal would have been shocked by the reference to a deity other than vkandis sunlordmore shocked that such a deity as the shinain stareyed was spoken of in the same breath as he later he would have been able to accept that but would also have been driven speechless by such a casual reference to a deity as if the person speaking had a personal relationship with kalenel now he knew better these swordsworn did have such a relationship she had been known to speak with her special followers on a regular basis and even occasionally intervene in their lives which was after all not entirely unlike the relationship vkandis had with the son of the sun i have been told that affairs were at such a turning point that any and all outcomes were equally likely he said carefully squinting around his headache perhaps that is why she gave you no indication that we were to be unexpected tenants rather than guests well said the shinain replied warmly well then tenants you are dwellers among our tents and as such it becomes necessary that we provide you with something better than the hasty arrangements of aforetime first i am chagren shena lihairden and i am to be your healer loisha is a good man and a fine shaman but his healing skills are rudimentary at best i am better suited to helping you trust me in that karal could not help but show his surprise a healer among the swordsworn chagren saw his expression and chuckled given our task of serving as the guardians of the plains does it not seem logical that we must need a healer now and again i was a healer before i was sworn and swore myself in part because i was one of those who joined the battle with ancar and i vowed i would never again find myself unable to defend those who i had come to heal i petitioned she accepted not all of us who come to serve her so closely have tragic tales of great personal loss behind them then his expression changed becoming serious for a moment though there are many those who have seen too much to endure and remain sane often petition her and are taken into her ranks those who have seen too much to endure karal glanced involuntarily at andesha and chagren followed his glance he looked back down at karal interesting your thoughts on that one karal blinked at the shinains directness i sometimes wonder if there is any place for andesha after all he has endured chagren lost that amused smile entirely and his eyelids dropped momentarily to veil his eyes there is he said after a pause if he chooses to take it among us there is no tale so strange that we cannot encompass it not among the swordsworn i think but among the wise those who wear the blue of the night sky and the days ending they are sworn to wisdom rather than the sword and i think it is among their numbers he would feel he has come home but that is for him to decide the smile returned meanwhile it is for me to ease some of your discomfort while my fellows bring the wherewithal to make this into a home for as long as may be so you have been healed before not really karal confessed the one valdemaran healer i saw decided that all i needed was herbs and potions not real healing a wise healer knows when to heal and when to let time do the healing chagren replied with approval well then this time you shall be the recipient of true healing such as i believe some of your sunpriests are known to practice i require of you only that you close your eyes and relax and that when you sense my spirit permit it to touch yours that should be easy enough yes i think so karal replied as the headache returned with a vengeance any reluctance he might have felt vanished at the onslaught of further pain he closed his eyes as instructed and waited slowly willing each muscle to release its builtup tension the moment he sensed chagrens spirit he knew exactly what the shinain had meant he felt something very akin to the sensation he had when he first communicated with florian and as he had when florian had requested that karal let him into his mind he let down those internal barriers he hadnt realized existed back when he had been plain karal of karse but this time instead of thoughts and sensations flooding into his mind a warm soothing wave washed over him and where it had passed the pain was gone leaving behind comfort and reassurance he opened his eyes he thought it was only a moment later but chagren was gone in his place stood a metal pitcher and cup and in his chamber and the rooms beyond new comforts and a few new figures had appeared as if conjured there was a small castmetal stove at his feet and he had been heaped with more woven blankets several long flat cushions arranged like a more comfortable bed than the one he currently occupied lay beside that on top of the stove there was a steaming pot beyond his room he saw at least one more stove and reckoned that there were probably more better bedding had appeared and more amenities firesong appeared and glanced in the door to his chamber and when the mage saw that he was awake the hawkbrother walked unhurriedly and gracefully to his side youve been asleep through all the excitement firesong told him more of those kalenedral appeared with a veritable caravan of goods and this place is now almost civilized he smiled and there was no mistaking the fact that he was pleased they even promised none of us will have to cook anymore though we will still have to do the work of hertasi i fear that is just as well since i do not believe i could have eaten another of my own meals even if i died of starvation karal croaked a chuckle and discovered to his delight that it did not make his head hurt my headache is gone he exclaimed with glee firesong nodded that fellow chagren said it would be i will probably be helping him the next time he heals you he told me what had caused your aching skull and once he explained it to me it was obvious he held up a hand forestalling karals questions and i will explain it all to you in detail some time later when we have the time for me to explain how and why a mage or a healer is able to do what he does suffice it for now to say that you have misused that part of you that channels magic as if you had bruised it by battering a rough stone around inside your skull and that was why your head hurt he was able to take care of the bruises so to speak karal tried to lever himself up and found to his profound disappointment that he was still as weak as a newborn colt too bad im not completely back to normal but i suppose chagren cant heal everything at once he answered with a sigh as firesong caught his elbow to help him obviously he cannot the mage replied reasonably there are some things such as strength and endurance that time will restore as much as he now if you will move thus and so we will get you onto this more comfortable bed and then you must drink what he left you and eat and then sleep again for the next couple of days making your way to the privy and back will be all the exercise youre fit for with firesongs aid karal moved over to the pile of flat bed cushions which turned out to be even more comfortable than they looked the mage piled all of his blankets rugs and furs back on top of him then handed him the metal cup it proved to contain another herbal potion but this one had a pleasantly fruity faintly sweet taste with a refreshingly astringent aftertaste that quenched a deeplying thirst no amount of water had been able to satisfy at firesongs urging he drank a second cup and while he finished that andesha appeared with a bowl and spoon chagren promised that you would at least be able to feed yourself so that is your task for the day andesha said handing him both the bowl held real soup not the tasteless gruel that loisha had been feeding him although his hand shook a little he managed not only to feed himself but to finish every drop in the bowl andesha and firesong sat watching him like a pair of anxious nursery attendants all during the meal and andesha took back the empty bowl with a grin of triumph soon enough you will be sweeping and washing with the rest of us andesha said as he rose karal leveled a sober gaze on firesong as the young shinain left the chamber i feel as if i should be sweeping and washing for both of you you and silverfox together he said with guilt he could not conceal i am taking up so much of your time and contributing nothing now firesong replied sternly that says nothing of what you have done in the past or will do in the future and you are taking up very little of my time since you sleep a great deal which is by the by what you should be doing now sleeping once you have another cup of this excellent beverage obediently karal drank down a third cup and closed his eyes again although he felt no real urge to sleep but evidently there was something in the drink or he needed sleep so badly that his body would take any opportunity to seize some for no sooner had he closed his eyes and begun the first stages of his ritual of relaxation than he was fast asleep firesong waited until he was certain young karal was deep in dreaming then gathered up the nowempty pitcher bowl and cup and carried them off to be washed the chamber through whose outer wall they had entered the tower had been dedicated to cleaningeverything from pots to people judicious use of magic on firesongs part had driven a pipe to the surface at the surface was a blackenameled basin connected to the pipe that the shinain kept filled with snow no magic melted the snow shoveled into the basin just the sun supplemented by a simple horsedung fire the pipe slanted down into the chamber where it was closed by a stopcock taken from a wine barrel and simply turning the stopcock gave them water enough for about any purpose waste water went into a second pipe going down into the earth set just outside in the tunnel so far it had been sufficient silverfox was at the washing basin used both for dishes and clothing and he felt a stab of guilt of his own that the kestrachern should be wasting his time and talents on so menial a task as cleaning dirty dishes this seemed as unreasonable a task as to ask a fine sculptor to shovel snow yet there he was serenely working away the soil of camp life with his slender fingers but the handsome kaledain looked up and smiled at his approach and said lightly would that all troubles are so easily washed away as these all things considered i have actually been enjoying myself on this little jaunt i could almost feel that i am on holiday here firesong handed him the dishes with a groan why do i suddenly have the sinking feeling that you are one of those benighted individuals who thinks that taking himself off to the utter wilderness for a fortnight or more constitutes a holiday what the kestrachern replied innocently and you do not his blue eyes twinkled as he continued think of the splendid isolation the uncrowded vistas the joy of doing everything for yourself knowing you need rely on no one else selfsufficiency feeling yourself unconstrained by all the rules and customs that can come to smother you think of the lack of civilized conversation the dearth of entertainment the deprivation of decent food hot baths and reasonable sleeping accommodations firesong retorted i had rather endure a bored little provincial courtier babble for an hour than listen to a brook do the same while my toes are cold and my nose even colder and there isnt a cushion to relax upon and i do not particularly take joy from washing dishes and mending clothing i promise you those are tedious tasks at best and wasteful of valuable time at worst but silverfoxs clever sharp features softened for a moment for you perhaps but unless he is in a circumstance like this one a kestrachern is never free of the needs of others for you this place is an exile but for me a holiday in the wild is an escape now firesong suffered another twinge of guilt and he sat down beside the washtub and even here you are not free of demands he said reproaching himself for there are my demands on you but silverfox only laughed and shook his long black hair back over his shoulders no those are not demands ahela those are mutual desires i could say that my demands on you are as improvident but i wont but there is thisfor once i can act on my own desires rather than concentrate on the needs of another to the exclusion of anything i feel firesong felt the guilt for this at least lift away from him i make you feel more free simply by being as i am in that case perhaps i should be more demanding the kestrachern laughed as the two gryphons loaded with their travel packs poked their beaks into the cleaning chamber with curiosity why all the rrrevelrrry treyvan demanded arre potsss ssso amusssing that depends on who is cleaning them old bird silverfox replied are you ready to depart yet the female gryphon hydona nodded vigorously now that morrre help hasss come yesss if i werrre young and unpairrred i would ssstay but but nothing firesong said firmly reacting to the anxious tone of her voice sensing she was afraid that he would demand that she stay your little ones need you far more than we do not that we arent grateful when the keeper of hissstorry comesss we will be sssuperfluousss anyway treyvan admitted he will be able to rrread the old wrritingsss here much morrre clearrly than we it was obvious to firesong that the gryphons were chagrined at their inability to decipher the ancient texts that had been found here and they took their failure personally they had all made an incorrect assumption about clan kleshya they had assumed that the last clan that could truly have called itself kaledain rather than shinain or tayledras had a purer form of the original tongue than either splinter group given that the gryphons should have been able to decipher the ancient texts and they had also assumed that since kleshya had come to dwell among the haighlei a people who shunned change their language would obviously have remained as pure as it was the day that they all went through the gates to escape into the west but while the haighlei shunned change the kaledain had not and their language had drifted from the ancient tongue as inevitably as had shinain and tayledras perhaps it had not drifted so far or so fast but nevertheless it had drifted and in a direction that rendered the ancient writings as vague to the gryphons as to firesong or loisha however providentially enough there was among the pioneers of kleshya an individual who had not only come along to record what transpired in their new home but one who had made a hobby of studying the most ancient scripts while this historian was not the expert that a true scholar of the earliest days of white gryphon would have been he had volunteered to come and assist the party at the tower and he should prove more of an expert than the two gryphons that was the theory anyway very little in this strange situation had gone according to theory i will be sorry to see you leave firesong said sincerely you both have been very patient about this but even i can tell that gryphons arent comfortable underground hydona didnt say anything but treyvan shivered all of his feathers quivering it hasss not been easssy he admitted and all that hasss kept me here at timesss isss the knowledge that the grrreat ssskandrranon walked thessse sssame chamberrsss firesong nodded with understanding not that long ago he would have said the same thing in the same reverent tones about visiting the heartstone chamber in the palace at haven where his own ancestor vanyel had once worked that however had been before he had been kidnapped by that same ancestor and shoved willynilly into the affairs of the kingdom of valdemar being conscripted by a stubborn spirit to the aid of a place and people that were hardly more than misty history to him had given him a slightly more jaundiced view of honored ancestors than most folk had oh ill leave them to their illusions skandranon is not likely to stick his beak into our affairs now thank the gods if he was going to show up the way vanyel did hed be here already if that was all it took to help them bear the feeling of being buried alive here their illusions are valuable besides skandranon had died peacefully in extreme old age surrounded by a vast flock of worshipful grandchildren and greatgrandchildren there were no stories of a haunted forest in which uncanny things happened connected with his legends and his long line of descendants had legends of their own but firesong couldnt help but wonder now and again just what his own ancestor vanyel was planning hed given no indication that he planned toas it weremove on once the dual threats of ancar and falconsbane had been dealt with by now he must have recovered from the effort of taking down the weband vanyel at full strength had been powerful enough to wrest away control of a gate he had not erected to transport five humans four gryphons a dyheli two companions and two bondbirds all the way from a site at the edge of the dhorisha plains to the heart of the forest of sorrows beyond valdemars northern border there was no telling what he might still be capable of i think i know why he didnt confront falconsbane directlybut i would not have given odds in favor of falconsbane if vanyeland yfandes and stefenhad been given leave to deal with him themselves do we take it that you arrre ssstaying then treyvan asked both firesong and silverfox nodded but it was silverfox who answered thats why that caravan of swordsworn showed up with all the new equipment we just now told karal but that is only because he hasnt been awake long enough to listen to anything complicated the kalenedral pointed out that we were lucky that we didnt encounter any winter storms coming in but we cant count on our luck holding if were caught we would have to do what the shinain dodig in hope we dont freeze to death then settle in for the rest of the winter once the trail out is obliterated by a storm theres no reestablishing it if were going to be stuck id rather be stuck here where we can continue to research what urtho left behind im looking for secret doors or concealed rooms while the rest figure out what the effect of the cancellation wave we sent out will be and how long it will last i think you are wissse treyvan said gravely i do not think that karrral would sssurrvive the trrrip much lessss a grreat sstorrm nor do i and that was why i voted to stay firesong said then added with a sigh even if it means living like a brigand until spring treyvan gryphgrinned at that and gave him a mock cuff with a tightly fisted claw peacock he chuckled you arrre jusst dissscontented becaussse therrre isss no one herrre but sssilverrrfox to admirrre yourrr handsssome face no i am just discontented because i am not especially fond of sewing split seams and scrubbing pots which is a perfectly reasonable attitude firesong retorted and made shooing motions with his hands be on your way im sure you cant wait to get back to cries of but papa said we can but andras mama lets her and do i have to when he wished to exercise that talent firesong could be a wicked mimic and he so accurately rendered a childish whine that both gryphons eartufts went back in alarm perrrhapsss hydona could go ahead of me treyvan ventured then ducked as his mate leveled a killing gaze on him orrr perrrhapsss not well why not we faced ancarrr we faced falconsssbane we faced the imperrrial arrrmy and the magessstormsss what arrre two merrre childrrren againssst that worse than all of them put together because theyll always get what they want firesong suggested and hydona turned her deadly glare on him of course my opinion is hardly valid he amended hastily after all i dont have children hydona snorted but looked mollified and firesong wisely opted to keep the rest of his opinions to himself well all miss you he said instead but youve done more than your duty and children need their parents fly safely friends thank you treyvan said simply even though the shinain had labored to open the hole in the outer wall to give them all a wider door into the tunnel it was still a squeeze for the gryphons to get through burdened with their packs as they were as a courtesy firesong sent a magelight on ahead of them though treyvan was perfectly capable of making his own not that they were going to get lost in a straight tunnel but the light might make the tunnel itself seem less confining silverfox sat looking after them for a while after they were gone you know he said finally they were the only creatures i ever envied when i was young gryphons in general firesong asked or those two in particular gryphons in general silverfox replied turning back to his dishtub the main thing was that they can fly of course but besides that they are just marvelous creatures they grow their own wonderful costumes of feathers they are armed better than any fighter with those talons and that beak and they can take on virtually any task except those that require unusually fine dexterity they can even become kestrachern so i envied them and now firesong asked now im old enough and experienced enough to have seen the price they pay for all those gifts youd be amazed at how delicate their digestion is they are devastated by certain diseases that are only an inconvenience to a human and their joints tend to stiffen up and get quite painful as they age im still of divided opinion about whether or not the drawbacks are worth being a gryphon he added but i no longer envy them i never did firesong said softly i only envied myself and left it at that and the mage of silence brought all of the armies back to his stronghold here in kavenusho chagren said pointing with his charcoal stick to the appropriate place he had drawn on the floor karal nodded and concentrated fiercely while chagren related the rest of the history of the mage wars hed heard it all once from loisha of course but chagren had actually experienced a compressed version of this history that had been during a special moment in his training when he went to katashinain and entered a holy building that housed something he called the webs of time karals grasp of language was not quite good enough to give him a clear idea of what physical forms these webs were in but chagren said that they held the memories of those who had made them and that under certain specific conditions those memories could be awakened and experienced karal was disposed to believe him after all that he had seen what was one more supernatural marvel the gryphons had already given him their own version of the story more heavily weighted with the heroism of the black gryphon of course even silverfox had a slightly different tale as handed down among the kaledain kestracherns from amberdrake tadrith wyrsabane and the generations since them so that is why this place was hallowed for us even before we know there still were working weapons here chagren finished mind i said hallowed not holy we of the plains do not count any human holy not even her avatars or the kalenedral the mage of silence was a good man a fine man and flawed as all men are what made him different from most other men was that he saw his weaknesses and spent all his life trying to keep them controlled so as not to harm others with them that he devoted a larger percentage of his life to the wellbeing of others than most ever even think of doing what made him dangerous were the things he never troubled to control his curiosity and his desire to meddle and change things for the sake of change itself karal digested that it was interesting to hear the various versions not only of the story of the cataclysm but the way the three cultures viewed adept urtho to the gryphons at least urtho was the ultimate great father which was hardly surprising since they knew he had created them to silverfox he was both a familiar figure of history and a figure of semiveneration less than a god but far more than human to the tayledras he was a figure of the misty past and they recalled very little of him most did not even know his name and called him only the mage of silence to most shinain he was not even that except to the kalenedral to them he was a man powerful good of heart and soul but one who could not resist meddling in things he should never have touched without a doubt that was because their version was flavored with their own form of prejudice against magic even chagren was not immune from that prejudice though he suffered from it less than some the shinain had been assigned the guardianship of the plains by their goddess herself although most of them were not aware that there really was something here that needed to be guarded from interlopers certainly being a goddess she could simply have removed the weapons and dangers entirely had she chosen but deities work in ways that are often not obvious even after centuries of scrutiny it must have taken a direct edict from the shinain goddess to get her chief servants the kalenedral to open the plains and this tower at its heart to strangers he could hardly imagine what their reaction must have been to learn that they would be opening the tower to mages their faith must be very great he thought with wonder look how long it took me to accept that heralds and companions were not demonicthey gave over their fears in a much shorter time or if they had not given up their fear they had certainly worked past it he had encountered no hostility from these people only the wariness he himself felt faced with strangers from a strange people then again perhaps the kalenedral had been very careful about which of their folk were permitted to aid the foreigners i could do with a little less change myself he said with a weak laugh but the magestorms arent giving us much of a choice in that chagren grimaced his aquiline features making the expression more pronounced yet another mischance that some would lay at urthos door had he not made the choices he did some would say that none of this would be happening now interesting choice of words could it be that chagren is taking a wider view of things but not you karal asked delicately chagren looked for a moment as if he was not going to answer then shrugged but not me i am not certain that urthos great enemy maar would not have unleashed worse upon the world after all look what havoc falconsbane and ancar wrought who were lesser mages than maar then again my leshya teachers had experience with mages now that was a new word he thought he vaguely recognized the root something about a soul what kind of teachers he asked to test his guess i suppose youd call them spirits although they can be quite solidly real if she wishes chagren replied matteroffactly as if he spoke with ghosts every day well perhaps he did at some point in the lives of most swordsworn they encounter one or more leshya kalenedral there have even he broke off his words and stared past karal for a moment and halfchoked his eyes widened and he gave a slight bow of his head i believe outlander he said in an entirely different and very respectful voice that you are about to find out for yourself karal turned to find that another of the swordsworn was standing in the doorway this one was very clearly a woman but also very clearly a warrior in every fiber she was dressed entirely in black from head to toe and wore a veil or scarf across the bottom half of her face a sword and long knife hung from her belt and she bore the weight easily negligently in two paces she had crossed the chamber and stood at the side of karals pallet looking down at him she could have seemed frightening intimidating from her clothing alone and yet there was nothing menacing whatsoever about her competent yes certainly imposingbut karal would have had no hesitation in trusting her her blue eyes above the black veil were both amused and kind and he sensed that she was smiling forgive me that i cant rise to greet you properly lady he said with deepest respect oh not at all she replied and her voice had a very odd hollow quality to it as if she were speaking from the bottom of a very deep well as i understand it youre rather indisposed at the moment he narrowed his eyes as he began to see or sense that there was something unexpected about her she reminded him of something very familiar in fact there was some indefinable aura about her that was likelike sunlord shesnot i must presume he said carefully after a deep breath that sworn ones such as you who choose to instruct further generations do not bother to take a physical vehicle such as a firecat or a companion shes a spirit thats what she is like andeshas avatars only more here more real he felt positively giddy at his own daring looking a spirit right in the eyes like this and speaking to her as an equal say rather are chosen rather than choose and you have it rightly young priest the spirit replied a hint of a chuckle in her hollow voice though i have to admit that she has toyed a time or two with the notion of black companions or perhaps black riders since karal could well imagine florians indignant response to that idea he had to stifle a smile of his own black companions oh the heralds wouldnt like that at all i believe youve met a kinswoman of mine the spirit continued she left her mark on you which leads me to think that she regards you favorably shes a hard one to please he tried wildly for a moment to think of who the kalenedral could mean ahyouquerna he hazarded trying to imagine how that rather aloof lady could have left any kind of a mark on him the spirit laughed aloud at that no young clanfriend kerowyn i see youve lined up anything that could serve as a weapon hurled or otherwise so that you can reach everything in the order youd need it thats the sort of mark i mean shes trained you so deep its a habit startled he looked down involuntarily and saw hed done just that with the things hed have to throw at the farthest point of his reach and his dagger right at his elbow he flushed what must chagren be thinking now that he distrusted them all that they had let a potential assassin into their midst oh dont be embarrassed boy the spirit chided gruffly thats one of the best habits to be in what if someone unfriendly got in here what if one of our more fanatical brethren decided that she had been deceived by you lot and you all had to die dont you know what we say know where all the exits are never sit with your back to the door watch the reflections watch the shadows keep your hands free and your weapons loose sunlord he thought desperately im being bombarded with shinain proverbs what a terrible way to die he meant that lightly but it seemed that the kalenedral intended to continue until she had recited every proverb on the subject of selfdefense that the shinain ever invented never sit down to eat with your sword at your sidestrap it to your back for a faster draw better an honest enemy than a feigned friend when who is wisest says least he interrupted desperate to cut through what looked to be an unending stream of proverbs were shinain all like that even kerowyn tended to spout shinain proverbs at the drop of a hint and a spirit kalenedral probably knew every proverb ever composed the spirit laughed aloud again well said she applauded keep that sense of humor and you might just survive this chagren take special care of this one hes deeper than he looks chagren bowed low as you say teacher he replied karal wasnt prepared for the spirits departure he barely blinked and she was gone a chill ran up his backbone but he was determined not to show it if you see a swordsworn in black with a veil chagren said slowly it is leshya there have been some few here among the rest of us we think they come to ensure your safety or ours its debated which its more likely both karal said feeling a bit dizzy kerowyns kin to her chagren shrugged so she says that is something new to me but the leshya are not inclined to talk about their pasts often we do not even know their names she is my first teacher of the sword and came to me the night that i was sworn he broke off what he was saying to shake his head i am babbling and you young outland priest can consider yourself as having passed a kind of examination none of the sworn are likely to question your right to be here ever again with that rather surprising statement he turned and left the chamber leaving karal alone with his thoughts which were to say the least very complex although there was one thought that was not at all complex so my right to be here will no longer be questioned thats all very well for me but what about the others firesong sighed as he regarded his much abused shirt with a frown his favorite sorts of garments were not meant for rough living and a camp existence glaring at it wont put the hem back up silverfox remarked around a mouthful of pins you might as well give up and do it the hard way firesong growled under his breath but took up needle and thread grudgingly all very well for you to say he complained but youve been able to trade off sweeping and scrubbing the sleeping room to andesha in return for cleaning his dishes and youve traded loisha massages for cleaning and airing the bedding i havent got anything anyone wants to trade for valdemar barbaric as it was is looking better all the time silverfox chuckled it could be worse we could still be eating your cooking i believe that our kincousins are being very generous in taking over the larger portion of the work firesong growled again you only say that because you can do things even the kalenedral are interested in im a mage thats all i know and they dont want a thing i can do for them silverfox put down his needle to look up at him with sympathy you arent just a mage you are a lover but you are so exotic to them that they could more easily entertain fantasies of bedding clouds if there is really something you detest would you please tell me and let me do it or barter a massage or something to one of the sworn and have him do it you are a mage ashaka and i feel in my bones that soon enough you will have more important things to worry about than hems and ripped seams firesong started to reply then shook his head and laughed at himself why is it when you say things like that you manage to deflate my selfimportance rather than inflating it and simply fill me with dread silverfox merely tilted his head to one side and replied do i lets change the subject he thought i can do without too much introspection magic is working more reliably now that the counterforce is evening out the stormwaves it is still a horrid mess but i think i can get a gate up to the rim of the plains soon if i can do that we can at least ask for a few more things to make life tolerable around here how much would kleshya be willing to part with in the way of amenities do you think i havent had a real bath in weeks and neither has anyone else a big tub would be very welcome even if its real intention was to water horses a copper boiler to heat water would be even more welcome silverfox looked thoughtful there might be a fair amount they could send us both of leftover tayledras gear and some of our own and you knowif we could get a gate open we could get some hertasi volunteers to come through they cant cross the plains in winter without a great deal of hardship and i wouldnt ask it of them but they could come through a gate provided they were sure we could keep them warm enough over here firesong closed his eyes for a moment in longing oh how he missed his little army of hertasi helpers if he had just one or two he wouldnt have to do another tedious chore for himself again they loved to do exactly the sorts of things he wanted to avoid here and could probably show even the natives some lessons in organization before we try that we ought to see if we can find out what sejanes and the rest back in haven have found out about gating he replied after another moment of cautious thought not that i wouldnt be willing to give up a lot for a couple of hertasi but i wouldnt want to put them at any risk its one thing to toss a tub or a sack of meal through its quite another torisk a living being silverfox nodded and bit off his thread should we send karal back if we can get a gate up thats safe for a living creature hed be better off with kleshya once again firesong hesitated now theres a question he would be better off in a place where he could be properly cared for buthow many more of the devices here need a channel what are we going to have to do in order to counter that final storm the one thats the reverse analog of the original cataclysm you can ask andesha and loisha if you like but i have the sinking feeling we still need him if he decides hes willing to stay here we should let him he took a few more stitches and knotted off his own thread i think hes going to insist on it sometimes that child makes me feel ashamed of myself i sit here wailing and moaning because i have to pick up after myself and hes fretting because hes too weak to help he shook his head maybe thats why hes a priest and youre not silverfox said gently he seeks to give of himself even when theres nothing left to give it hurts him but it also makes him feel effective we cant all turn out that selfsacrificing lady knows im not he was interrupted by the sound of someone running heyla you two andesha poked his head into their chamber come to karals room altra made a jump to haven and hes back with word from sejanes both of them dropped their mending and got to their feet hurrying toward karals chamberwhich once held the weapon that had discharged all of its formidable power through him firesong hadnt mentioned that to karal yet when they had elected not to move him he had deduced that since all the chambers looked alike karal probably wouldnt notice which one he was in im not sure how hed react he might not careor it might make him very nervous and unhappy being in the same room where he nearly died when they arrived at the chamber they found loisha a few of the kalenedral florian and andesha already waiting there with altra on karals lap and an unopened message tube beside them firesong blinked and realized that after all the time of working with the mages and artificers back in haven hed been unconsciously expecting to see more people so its just us now i dont know if i like that i hate to admit it but those artificers had some good ideas i hope this message is written in valdemaran but it probably isnt karal said i know enough of imperial tongue to translate though if you want me to go ahead firesong said motioning to him to pick up the tube i dont even read valdemaran that well youre the best reader we have except for florian and i can just picture florian trying to unroll the paper karal chuckled though firesong noted that florian came to look over karals shoulder probably to help with the translation if only aya could read foreign tongues he thought with envy we could each specialize in a language it would be so convenient karal broke open the tube and extracted a roll of paper he unrolled it with an accompanying crackling sound evidently it was in valdemaran karals frown faded and he began reading immediately probably florian was prompting him the letter began abruptly greetings and do not attempt to make or use a gate we have already tried and the results were unfortunate thats with a capital u by the way firesong winced i was afraid of that things must be more unsettled than we thought andesha said with alarm my little magics have been working so well i thought certainly that the larger ones must surely be all right that might simply be a function of where we are firesong reminded him for all we know there are upper shields on the remains of the tower strong enough that we could do almost anything in here and not be affected by whats gone on outside karal cleared his throat to get their attention again firesong turned back to him and nodded and the young man continued i fear this means you are exiled for the duration colleagues we built a small local gate as soon as we could after you unloosed the power of your device and we attempted to transfer a few small nonliving items through it i am glad now that we opted for caution and made those items of a nonliving nature for the result on the other side was rather messy parts were recognizable and that is the best i can say many suffered from desiccation aging or physical compression altras jumping seems to cause no such problems for the moment even when he carries someone with him but he reports that it is becoming more and more difficult to lump as time passes at this altra himself raised his head and spoke up i find that the distance i can jump decreases as time passes i am afraid that within a few weeks i will not be able to jump across a given distance any faster than a companion could run across it firesong let out the breath hed been holding in i wonder if i ought to go back to kleshya after all im not sure i can continue to live like this and not begin to lose my temper if not my sanity well thats not welcome news he said as casually as he could is there anything else karal scanned the letter quickly once the bad news is out he gets a lot more formal and technical the short version is that altra can probably bring one or two people from haven to here before he cant jump anymore but that we need to work on a way to communicate with havenmaybe using scrying magic that doesnt transfer or move anything physical seems to work better than magic that does i just hope that if there are shields protecting this place they wouldnt interfere with scrying too he handed the letter over to firesong here you can get all the details yourself later most of what he says only partially makes sense to me ill study it later firesong promised the question now is what are we going to do if were going to have altra bring someone over wed better do it soon if we can get them andesha said slowly id like both sejanes and master levy here firesong rolled his eyes up at that but had to grudgingly agree if theyll put up with the unpleasantness of jumping they would be the best choices he sighed sejanes has an entire magic discipline that is foreign to us and master levy he paused for a moment reminded himself to be charitable and chose his words carefully master levy has a very unique way of looking at our problems if not him then we should have at least one of the master artificers here even i have to admit that we could not have accomplished anything here without their help andesha and karal both nodded vigorously in agreement which made him feel a bit sour but he had to admit that without the artificers they would be working without a resource as valuable as the presence of an adept we need that utterly different viewpoint here and master levy might even be as intelligent as he thinks he is master levy and sejanes have already volunteered altra put in unexpectedly i was just waiting to see if you would welcome them here i can go back for them now if youd like although it will take a few days to get there and back with them now firesong was startled a few days altras jumping distances had been severely curtailed if its going to take you days i think you had better start back now he told the firecat i dont want to think how much faster the situation could deteriorate if we wait the firecat nodded and vanished from karals lap only loisha looked at all dubious when altra was gone whats wrong shaman firesong asked politely seeing loishas troubled gaze the shinain shrugged i am only wondering if we should have asked permission of our hosts before we brought more folk in hopefully they will not be offended by the addition of two more strangers curiously that slight objection had the effect of hardening firesongs decision if wed had them here in the first place we might have a permanent solution instead of a temporary one he said stubbornly i for one want them here wind and weather loisha if youre worried that they might somehow overpower us and escape with secrets of urthos forbidden magic master levy doesnt know the first thing about practical magic and sejanes is so old that if you spoke a harsh word to him all his bones might break under the force theyre hardly a threat singly or together oh i agree but it is not my opinion you must have loisha began then shrugged again or well perhaps it is i suppose i have as much authority here as the kalenedral he grimaced much as i dislike taking on authority i suppose it is time that i did so since it was firesongs opinion that it was more than time that he did so he simply nodded and held his tongue karal looked fatigued and firesong stood up abruptly i am going to search for another hidden room i have the feeling that this place hasnt even begun to divulge its secrets to us anyone care to join me urtho may have been one of the most brilliant and compassionate minds in historybut his architects were no small geniuses themselves firesong already had found one small hidden room by carefully probing the floor of the washing room when he noticed that water dripped in a particular place drained away through cracks invisible to the unaided eye it hadnt held anythingin fact it had probably performed the task of simple storagebut now he knew that there might be more such places under the floors here and he had the feeling that if he just looked hard enough he might find more than just storage areas ill help andesha said unexpectedly he smiled come along then he replied im trying the skull chamber next the skull chamber was the one in which they had discovered a bizarre contraption that looked like the leavings of half a dozen artificers and shamans all jumbled together with the remains of a few feasts the centerpiece was a highly ornamented cow skull and none of them could even begin to guess what the device was for they would have been afraid to dismantle it except that the delicate construction had already fallen apart in several places already and the shock of their magical working had made it fall completely to pieces without any other ill effect rather than use magic since the chamber itself reeked of magepower firesong was using perfectly ordinary senses taking a cue from the water drainage he had a skin of water with a bit of ink in it to make it more visible and he dribbled it over the floor watching to see if it moved or vanished with andesha helping the two of them were a lot more effective than he was by himself it was very boring work and he had expected andesha to start a conversation but he had not anticipated the subject youre thinking about going back arent you andesha said to kleshya if not your home vale he didnt reply at first he pretended to be paying close attention to the water on the floor im not used to this sort of living he said refusing to answer directly its harder on me than it is on you i wont debate that andesha agreed and i hope you dont think id put any blame on you for leaving the gryphons did but they have two children who need them he snapped i dont i havent any excuse for leaving except wanting to be comfortable again he felt irrationally irritated at andesha for voicing all of his excuses as if he were so transparent that andesha had no difficulty in anticipating what he wanted to do and his rationalizations the trouble was that every time he looked at karal he felt ashamed of himself its not as if you havent done more than most people would have already andesha said gently first you faced down falconsbane mornelithe falconsbane was a challenge but no more than that he replied stiffly its not as if i was alone in facing him its not as if you had any real reason to andesha pointed out inexorably valdemar wasnt your home falconsbane didnt threaten the vales youd done your duty in training heralds to be mages and then some you could have gone home once youd done that much leaving whom to face falconsbane firesong demanded his face flushing one of those halftrained heralds elspeth darkwind perhaps none of them could have freed you im not certain even need could have freed you and dealt with falconsbane andesha simply nodded quietly but when it was overyou could have gone home then you could even have taken me with you and things might have turned out differently youve long since gone past anything anyone could call your duty firesong no one would fault you if you were too tired of all this to go on and how am i going to compare to someone like karal if i do that he demanded flushing still further too tired how would i look quitting now next to someone who literally put his life in jeopardy over this you make him sound like a wouldbe martyr andesha chided karal is quite a few things including stubborn occasionally bigoted and now and then incredibly naive but hes no martyr and neither are you nor any of us so aya must have felt his distress the firebird sailed in the chamber door adroitly avoided the snare of wires and junk and landed on his shoulder he petted the bondbird reflexively in a blind search for comfort if hes not a martyr then he stopped aware that his voice was getting high and strained he took two or three deep breaths andesha i dont know why youre baiting me this way then in a moment of blinding insight he did know hes forcing me to think things through so that i come to a real decision instead of letting some unfinished business and an entire bundle of emotions sway me back and forth andesha nodded as if he saw all that written on firesongs face i cant make a decision because im trying to demonstrate that im somehow better than karal and i cant make it out of guilt either so why am i staying what karal does is up to karal butwell im not too old to take a youngster like him as a good example he smiled weakly you all need me just as you need sejanes or master levy or altra im staying because even though im tired and i hate living here it would be wrong of me to go off and leave you without my skills i dont want to die in the cold and filth but if i must i will it would be wrong to abandon all those people who are hoping well find a solution to the final storm it would be wrong to break my word to the people i promised i would help are those reasons good enough for you andesha laughed at that dont think to bait me firesong i was coached by an expert to steer you through your own thoughts and motives he scowled at that are you happy with the result he growled the question is not whether im satisfied its whether you are andesha countered and if you are it is not for me to object if your decision will interfere with other concerns then that must be dealt with then he stood up and moved over to another section of floor firesong felt an imp of perversity rise inside him and he knew he had to have the last word and i didnt mention the best reason of all yet he said silkily surprised andesha turned back to face him what reason is that he asked as if the words had been pulled from him unwillingly firesong smiled silverfox wants me to stay he replied can you think of a better reason two elspeth sighed her breath streaming out in a fog of icecrystals and pulled the ends of the scarf wrapped around her neck a little tighter once again she sent a little thought of gratitude back over her shoulder toward valdemar and the tireless kleshya hertasi who had fashioned her current costume the little lizardfolk who had arrived with the bargeload of envoys from clan kleshya had taken one look at her winter wardrobe and taken it upon themselves to refashion it as if they didnt already have enough to do the hertasi of ksheyna had already made her heralds whites in the style of the tayledras but those had all been of summerweight fabrics these new hertasi had remade her whites in wool fur and leather layered in silk according to patterns designed for her by darkwind these had been her midwinter gift from him to her and a welcome surprise they had been indeed for they were certainly needed winter field whites had been designed for harsh weather but not as harsh as the unprecedented weather currently holding hardorn in its icy grip and hardorn was where she darkwind and a small group of mixed valdemaran guards and kerowyns mercenaries found themselves headed shortly after midwinter festival there hadnt been much choice it was clear that valdemar was going to have to send some form of envoy overland to grand duke tremane once it became impossible to put up any more gates elspeth had been present when that last gate had been attempted the mangled crate that had come through had looked as if it had been turned inside out and nothing in it was recognizable it was just a good thing that the crate had only contained a few things for sejanes and that they had been cautious enough to test the gate with mere cargo before sending anyone living through but travel to and within hardorn was not easy by any standard even those of one who had journeyed from valdemar to the dhorisha plains and patrolled the weirdling lands being cleansed and protected by a hawkbrother vale in all of her life she had never seen snow this deep the road they followed into hardorn had been kept clear for traffic but only enough to permit a cart pulled by two horses to pass and even then the wheels of the cart would scrape the walls of snow now and again every ten leagues a wider place had been cut so that carts going in opposite directions could pass but otherwise the snow was piled up on either side of the road until it reached shoulderhigh on a horse in places where the snow had drifted deeper than that it could be taller than a riders head and the cold the windin many ways she was grateful that those tall snowbanks were there because without that shelter theyd be facing a wind that bit as cruelly as any blade and carried right down to the bone hertasidesigned tunics with fur linings and riding coats of sheepskin with the wool turned inside were the only things that made this journey bearable she was quite grateful that the mysterious industrious lizardfolk had been able to outfit the entire company with such coats before they all left why the sigh darkwind asked his breath puffing out in frosty clouds with each word his bondbird vree clung to the padded horn of his saddle with no sign of discomfort whatsoeverexcept that his feathers were puffed out all over his body and his head was pulled down tight against his shoulders so that he resembled a fat ball of wool with a beak but then vree was a forestgyre and darkwind had once told her that they had come from stock adapted to harsher climes than this darkwind himself cut an odd figure and not just because of his hawkbrother costume or the bondbird on his saddlebow darkwinds mount was neither a horse nor a companion but a creature as intelligent and as foreign to valdemaran eyes as a gryphon it was a dyheli a white dyheli at that and the representative of his own race to valdemar his name was brytha and he had brought firesong from ktreva to ksheyna then from ksheyna to valdemar and now consented to bear darkwind on this current mission why she didnt know darkwind didnt know either and the dyheli seemed disinclined to explain they were both grateful to him although not the equal in endurance and speed of a companion the dyheli was better suited to this mission than a horse more surefooted and vastly more intelligent the rest of their party rode tough shinainbred horses especially selected for endurance shaggy as dogs with blunt blocky heads im sighing because ive decided that the one thing i will never say again is to say never again she replied with a crooked smile because as sure as i say it im forced to repeat the act i swore never to repeat he chuckled ruefully without needing any explanation neither of them had ever thought they would be riding back into hardorn again their previous visit although memorable had not been particularly pleasant either for them or for the hardornens when they had finished mad king ancar and his adviser hulda were dead at their hands magecaused storms were lashing the countryside the capital was in a state of total chaos and the imperial army taking advantage of the moment was pouring over the eastern border and although very few hardornens were aware of the fact elspeth and darkwind were directly or indirectly responsible for most of the damage and chaos they left behind them not that the imperial army was our fault but thats just about the only thing we can say we didnt have a hand in and after the invasion came the real magestorms triggering incredibly vicious weather and unleashing real horrors on the unsuspecting countryside those were not the fault of anyone living but they did make life in hardorn even more miserable than anyone had ever dreamed possible so riding into hardorn didnt seem particularly likely or sane a few moons ago but that had been before duke tremane offered alliance before it dawned on everyone in this part of the world that the magestorms were a greater menace than anything mere humans could unleash on each other now things that wouldnt have occurred to anyone as possible scenarios were being hastily put into motion have you noticed something the weather might be vile but the land isnt suffering anymore darkwind observed its not exhausted and ill anymore its just sleeping waiting for spring i dont know about you but that was one of the reasons why i didnt want to ever come back here again elspeth nodded and so did her companion gwena the bells on her bridle chiming crisply in the sharp icy air without ancar draining the land of its power things are returning to normal gwena replied the land and presumably the people are no longer sickening and much as i hate to say itthe blood and lifeenergy of all those poor folk killed in the invasion may have sped that recovery thats a horrible thought darkwind observed with a shudder for gwena had made certain to include him in her mindspeaking elspeth shivered intellectually she knew it was probably true but it was horrible all the same that just sounds entirely too much like something falconsbane would have come up with she said reluctantly but then again falconsbane simply perverted things that were perfectly normal and good and i suppose it would be even worse to think that all those people died and their lifeenergy went for nothing or worse was used by someone like falconsbane mages and those with earthsense have known for centuries that this is the reason why the countryside blooms after a war gwena observed dispassionately it isnt just that things seem better and it isnt just that the people are ready to greet any positive signs with enthusiasm its because the lives lost go back to the land and when the war is over the land can use them to heal itself we can at least be grateful that grand duke tremane is apparently more interested in allowing the land to heal than in using that power for his own means darkwind replied as he turned for a moment to stare off into the east he said nothing more and elspeth thought she knew why they had only the word of three youngsters and tremanes own people that he was to be trusted at all just at the moment apparently was the only word any of them could use with regard to the leader of the imperial forces those few facts that they had about tremane were not much comfort tremane had been sent by his master emperor charliss to conquer a weak and chaotic hardorn for the empire of the east this assignment was to prove him worthy or not to be the imperial heir the imperial army had taken roughly half of hardorn before it stalled held in place by hardornen fighters in mostly uncoordinated groups ranging in size from tiny bands to small armies united only in their determination to oust the interloper since they were fighting on their own ground they had the advantage once the front lines stretched out and the imperial forces were thinned by distance nevertheless if nothing had changed tremane would probably have been able to reorganize regroup and complete the conquest possibly even carrying it into valdemar but things did change and in a way that no one could have foreseen the change had come from a direction no one would have looked for it had come out of the distant past we never do consider the past do we but we should have wasnt falconsbane a revenant of that past and shouldnt that have warned us to turn our eyes and thoughts in that direction but then again how can we truly plan for everything every possibility even if we knew all of the threats at any one moment the defenses for half of them would negate the preparations for the other half we are better off being resourceful than omniscient i think once before there had ever been a valdemar in a time so distant that there were no records and only the vaguest of hints about it in the great library of the heralds ancient wars had ended in an event known only as the cataclysm and until elspeth had met with the tayledras of legend the shinain of the dhorisha plains and the last lost clan of the true kaledainprogenitors of both the hawkbrothers and the shinainthat was all those in valdemar had known now though with the help of histories both arcane and mundane the full story had been put together elspeth considered that story as she did every time she had the leisure to do so intent on extracting the least bit of useful information from it despite the huge amounts of power involved there were still human motives and actions behind what had happened so long ago even madmen would act according to their needs so the more that one considered events of history the more one could deduce what those needs had beenand once one understood the needs and motivations of the people involved one could expound upon what else might have happened or realize that an obscure detail was actually something significant in context there had been two adepts back then perhaps the most powerful that the world had ever known called urtho and maar maar the scion of barbarian nomads had been infected with the mania for conquest at first for noble reasons of uniting clans to keep them from annihilating each other urtho the epitome of civilization and scholarship had resisted him but despite the best efforts of civilization maar adept and bloodmage had triumphed but only for a moment in the very hour of maars victory a dying urtho had brought defeat to his very door with a pair of devices that released the bonds on all magic within their spheres of influence one he triggered in his own tower one was sent to maar the devices acted within moments of each other and the results were both devastating and utterly unpredictable when it was over there were two enormous craters where urthos tower and maars palace had stood the first became the dhorisha plains the second lake evendim and the interaction of the two series of shock waves created terrible magestorms that had raged over the land for a decade or more raising mountains and flattening them disrupting magic causing living creatures to change and warp out of all recognition even transplanting entire sections of countryside from one part of the world to another eventually the storms faded to be forgotten in the ensuing centuries assumed by all to have been gone forever but the forces released by the cataclysm were stranger and stronger than anyone guessed and now the magestorms had returned echoing back across time from the other side of the world growing stronger with every new occurrence that was what had changed the situation tremane had walked into changed it out of all recognition the situation in valdemar had been bad but not a complete disaster valdemar had only newly rediscovered truemagic and did not depend on its power for anything the other effects of the magestorms the vicious and unpredictable weather the warping of living creatures and so forth could all be dealt with in one way or another but for tremanes forces dependent on magic for everything from communication and supply lines to the means to scout the enemy and cook their food it was a disaster as they found themselves completely cut off from the empire effectively blind and hungry as a fighting force as for what was going on in the empire itself that was anyones guess tremane had initially assumed that the storms were a new weapon unleashed by the alliance of valdemar karse rethwellan and the shinaintayledras clans he had reacted accordinglyand in a direction entirely typical of the empire where treachery and assassination were so commonplace that children were given bonded bodyguards as cradlegifts he had sent an assassin to break up the alliance that was the single act that elspeth and any other valdemaran found so difficult to think past valdemar had not attacked imperial forces neither valdemar nor any of her allies had shown any sign of aggression other than increasing the guard on the borders and covertly helping to supply the hardornen loyalists tremane had no reasonexcept for the obvious fact that valdemar was not suffering from the storms as badly as the imperials wereto think that this was an attack by queen selenay or her allies nevertheless he had treated it as one and had sent a covert operative armed with magic weapons to kill anyone of any importance at or in selenays court the man had succeeded only insofar as murdering the envoy from karse and the one from the shinain and wounding several others that was bad enough but was sheerest good fortune that it wasnt worse and no one made any mistake about that if the assassin had waited until the predawn hours when people were sleeping in their beds he would have succeeded in killing everyone from selenay down to the gryphons herein lay the heart of elspeth and darkwinds current problem now they were supposed to trust a man who used assassins against those he only suspected of aggressive action elspeth found it difficult to think beyond that fact even though tremane had won over to his side the last person likely to ever forgive himyoung karal the secretary and protege of the envoy of karse sunpriest and mage master ulrich tremane had even somehow convinced solaris son of the sun and high priest and ruler of karse of his sincerity and his wish to make amends though only the gods knew how hed done that well he hasnt convinced me and he hasnt convinced darkwind she thought stubbornly whatever spell of words or personality he put them under i hope its going to be more difficult to work the same magic on us i know mindmagic and darkwind is so foreign to tremanes experience that he might as well be another species altogether and whats more i wouldnt be in the least surprised to discover that kerowyn slipped half a dozen special operatives into our escort two sides can play the assassination game if it comes to that she hoped that it wouldnt but she had enough experience now to make her plans around pessimism rather than hope she didnt officially know that kerowyn had planted her own agents but she knew the skybolts and they were one and all irregulars their skills were not those of straighton fighters although they could act and fight as a disciplined skirmishing unit and had in the past on the other hand solaris has hansa the other firecat if she wanted to kill tremane there is no way he could stop her so maybe that fact alone will make him behave himself from now on that was certainly something else to consider the firecats possessed the ability to jump themselves and anyone in physical contact with them from one location to another and elspeth was not entirely certain what their range was certainly it was good enough that altra and hansa served as messengers between solaris and selenay and between the party in the remains of urthos tower and the mages and artificers in the valdemaran capital of haven solaris was perfectly capable of placing an assassin of her own right under tremanes privy to poke a knife up into him if she so desired and for that matter there was no reason why hansa himself could not kill a man if he chose although firecats had the ability to look like common cats if they wished to in their true form they were the size of enormous hounds and their claws and teeth were correspondingly long and sharp elspeth blinked at the images that thought conjured up my thoughts are certainly taking a grim turn today maybe im concentrating on spilling blood as an antidote to all this whiteness dear gods its coldand we havent seen another human soul since our guides left us theyd been lucky when theyd reached the valdemaran border a couple of hardornen exilesvouched for by kerowyns agentshad cautiously decided it was safe to return and acted as guides up until this morning in exchange for two pouches of currency and two packs of supplies now though they would have to go on without guides because the husband and wife had gone as far as they intended last night the party had reached the village from which the couple had originally fled even though it proved to be deserted abandoned like the other villages they had passed on this road the two wanted to stay even in thick white desolation they had a dream of a time in the future when there would be children running and playing in a verdant town square their journey thus far had been an unnerving one riding through a landscape devoid of humans elspeth could only wonder what had happened the land might be healing but where are the people true ancar had decimated the population but why hadnt they met with anyone on this road why were all the villages they passed through completely deserted the abandoned villages raised more questions than were answered for everything had been taken except the heaviest of furniture and there was no sign of violence was this the result of systematic desertion or systematic looting who was cleaning off the snow were the hardornens hiding from an armed and possibly hostile group given the fact that this was a nation racked by war that was possible but why when there was a herald of valdemar riding conspicuously in the front perhaps because at a distance theres no reason to assume i really am a herald its not that hard to get a white horse and a set of white clothing what are our plans for stopping tonight or do we have any she called back to the leader of the troop they hadnt provisioned themselves for camping though they had brought all their own food assuming that rations might be short given the horrible mageweather hardorn had endured it was a good thing they had or theyd have had a choice between starving and literally eating crow in theory theres a town ahead that used to have a weekly market and five big inns the leader replied his voice muffled by the scarf swathing his face whether or not its still tenanted he shrugged someones been keeping the road clean for traders and im hoping its them so was elspeth fervently she was not looking forward to spending another night in an abandoned derelict building there was always one building that could be made to serve and there was certainly no shortage of firewood but she had always been glad of the presence of the others around her shed found it hard to sleep at night with her shoulder blades prickling as if unseen eyes watched her no one had actually seen or heard anything that could be taken as a ghost but such places felt haunted she couldnt begin to imagine how rusi and severn could bear to stay back there in what was left of their village granted there was plenty of material to make more than one of the houses sound and weather tight again and granted they were wellequipped to do just that but the aching emptiness of the abandoned village would have sent her screaming for valdemar within a week it was more than she could bear to think about right now ive done a great deal that people think is brave but im not that brave but that was also assuming that the land around the village was as deserted as it looked when the magestorms created killing weather and murderous monsters would it have been safer and smarter to fortify the farmsteads and stay where the food was or to come into the village and trust in numbers and weapons but chance the food running out it wasnt a decision elspeth had ever needed to make and she hoped it was one nobody in valdemar would be forced to face for that all their hopes rested with that tiny group in the middle of the dhorisha plains in the ruins of urthos tower if anyone could find an answer it would be them although elspeth and darkwind were both adeptclass mages elspeth was relatively untutored and darkwind had abandoned magic for so many years that despite his considerable prowess he still considered himself out of practice as mages they were of no help to the researchers who had gone to the tower they might be of some use with the imperials and they would be of great use as envoys she knew that queen selenay had debated long and hard before deciding to send elspeth and darkwind as envoys from the alliance to tremane the queen hadnt wanted to send elspeth but elspeth was the only logical choiceshe could make autonomous decisions she had been trained both as a herald and to wear the crown herselfshe was the next best thing to selenay when it came to being able to think for valdemar elspeth had proven that she had good judgment and because she was no longer the heir since her abdication she was of little value as a political hostage moreover she had been trained by kerowyn to defend herself against assassins she could take care of herself in an ambush or an even fight and she was as suspicious as even that redoubtable woman could have wished then there was magic in which she was an adept tremane was no more than a master though of a far different magical discipline than the one she had been trained in very few of the heralds of valdemar were mages at all much less adepts and although their companions would be able to help them to some extent in matters of magic it was no substitute for being mages themselves all that might not have been enough except for darkwind he was an adept as well and of longer standing than she he had been a tayledras scout which made him something of a fighter as well he would have refused flatly to accompany anyone else he was not a herald and his loyalties were to her not valdemar whereas she would hardly have gone anywhere without him of course and together they were a formidable pair between her own qualifications and darkwinds there simply was no one as right to go on this mission as elspeth and if she had been anyone elses daughter selenay would not have hesitated for a moment to send her to give mother credit she didnt hesitate long elspeth was actually a bit pleased at that selenay had been treating her less as a daughter and more asas an adult and elspeth had gotten the feeling more than once that when the queen forgot to think of her as her daughter she acted naturally in a way given the queens behavior of late elspeth had been a little surprised that her mother had given second thoughts to the mission i wonder if some of what has made her hesitate in the past was more guilt than anything else could it have been elspeth and her mother had never been comfortable with each other no matter how hard she tried she always saw my father in me in so many ways i was more talias child than hers now selenay had the twins children she could give her whole heart to could she be feeling guilt that she didnt have that same maternal bond with elspeth was that why she had always overreacted when elspeth did something that might put her in jeopardybecause she felt as if she should have been more worried more emotionally involved than she was an interesting theory and one ill never learn the truth of i certainly couldnt ask her that and the only other person who would know will never tell me talia would never betray anything she learned of mothers heart and rightly so elspeth gave herself a mental shake did it matter not really except thatif that was indeed the case she wished she could convince her mother that it didnt matter the last thing that the queen of valdemar needed was one more thing to feel guilty about she already carried enough guilt for twenty people and i would rather be queen selenays friend and fellow herald than her daughter but the thought did present one explanation for some of selenays contradictory behavior and it was certainly worth keeping in the back of her mind she could watch for evidence of her own and it would be interesting to act on that theory and see what happened meanwhile there was a long and difficult job ahead of her and there was a danger they might all freeze to death before they even got to it if they didnt find some hardornens soon how much farther do you think this town is she called back over her shoulder she glanced back to seewhat was the guardcaptains name vallen that was itto see vallen shrug the movement barely visible beneath his multiple layers of fur sheepskin and wool soon i think but that is just a guess he replied despite the scarf he wore about his face his words came clearly over the muffled hoofbeats of their various mounts over the creaking of the packed snow beneath those hooves he gave his horse a nudge with his heels and took the lead position as elspeth and darkwind moved aside to let him by elspeth stood in her stirrups for a moment to peer up the road ahead but if there were any signs of habitations such as plumes of smoke that could have been rising from chimneys they were invisible against the uniformly graywhite sky the sun was nothing more than a fuzzy lighter spot about halfway down to the horizon she settled back down in her saddle the way the road wound about it wasnt possible to see very far ahead and they only got a view of the countryside when the snowbanks allowed we could be right on top of this town and wed never know it she thought minutes later the road gave another turn and dropped away in front of them the snowbanks themselves inclined down to about waistheight as if conjured up in a scrying crystal the watchedfor town appeared ahead of and below them down in a shallow valley the houses sticking up out of the snow like so many tree stumps in the snowcovered forest this was not the first time a town had appeared before them but now for the first time there were signs that the place was inhabited some of the houses were nothing more than snowcovered lumps but some had been cleaned of their burden of white thin smoke wreathed up out of about half the chimneys to be snatched away by the wind before it climbed up to form a plume there were a few figures moving about on the road near the town and it was clear from the purposeful way that they moved that the party had been spotted if not anticipated the place looked marginally better than the deserted villages they had already passed perhaps half the buildings were in disrepair one or two had collapsed roofs and it was hard to tell under the snow how badly some of the others had suffered she had to guess that only the buildings with smoke rising from them were actually lived in and she caught her breath at the thought that ancar and all the other troubles visited upon hardorn had literally cut the population in half maybe more she reminded herself how many deserted villages did we pass through were conditions like this everywhere if sowell she did not envy any leader the task of trying to bring this country back from such devastation if tremane can get the hardornens to accept him he has more work ahead of him than id care to take on a group of about a dozen people had formed up ahead of them on the road barring them at least for the moment from entering the town they were as bundled up in clothing as elspeths group was making it difficult to tell anything about them including their sexes but in spite of that handicap she thought that their stances showed a mix of fear and belligerence fear when had anyone ever feared her they werent so deep into hardorn that the natives should be unaware of what a herald was and what one stood for how could they fear a herald had ancar created that fear in them so strongly she sensed the fighters behind her surreptitiously loosening their weapons placing hands casually on hilts and increasing their watchfulness so it was not her imagination they sensed hostility too vallen reined in his horse and allowed her to take the lead darkwind signaled the dyheli to drop back with his head even with gwenas flank elspeth brought them all to a halt about a length away from the welcoming party by gesturing with an upraised hand we are peaceful travelers from valdemar she said in their own tongue pulling her scarf down so that they could see her entire facethough she did wonder if theyd believe the peaceful part with so many weapons in evidence who is in charge here two of the figures looked at each other and one stepped forward though he did not reveal his face as elspeth had now that elspeth was closer to them the ragged state of their clothing was painfully evident their coats were carefully mended but with patches that were not even a close match for the same material as the original me im in charge as i reckon the foremost man said gruffly and he folded his arms clumsily over his chest he had no weapon in evidence but elspeth did not take that to mean that these people were helpless if shed been in charge shed have archers with drawn bows at every window she did not look up to see if her guess was correct whatre you here for the man continued his arms tightened and his posture straightened his voice rose angry and strained if you think you people in valdemar are going to come in here and take us over us and our land no elspeth interrupted cutting him off more sharply than she had intended the mans nerves had infected her and she took a deep breath to steady herself no she repeated with less force wevaldemarhas no intention of taking one ell of hardorn land until ancar attacked us we were always the loyal friend and ally of hardorn and we intend to return to that status now that ancar is gone he laughed but it was not a sound of humor ha he jeered you say that but why should we believe you i swear it on my honor as a herald she countered quickly you must know what that means at least surely you have not lost faith even in that this all had the feeling of a test as if what she said here would make all the difference in how they would be treated from this moment on do they have some way to communicate with other communities still she couldnt imagine how anyone could cross this frozen wasteland faster than they were already doing but the party of valdemarans was confined to the road and perhaps the natives had some way of cutting across country to spread news perhaps the old signaltowers were still working that could be the answer and it could be how they knew we were coming i swear it as a herald she repeated and as the envoy of the queen valdemar has no designs on hardorn nor do any of the other parties to the alliance though solaris had to restrain a few hotheads in karse or rather vkandis did were only traveling she continued smoothly wed appreciate your hospitality for the night though we did bring our own provisions we know how difficult things have been for you and we didnt want to strain anyones resources there was a long silence during which the man peered at her closely and finally nodded as if satisfied with what he saw that outfits kind of outlandish but youve got the horse blue eyes and all and that cant be faked he shrugged then and made a gesture that she suspected told those hidden archers that all was well i guess we still believe in heraldsmostly since ancar tried so hard to make us think you was some kind of witchy crew that had traffic with demons ill take your word as bond for you and the rest of this lot but you better remember that you stand personal surety for them she nodded trying not to show how unsettled his words made her feel this was literally the first time she had ever encountered anyone this close to the border of valdemar who didnt accept and welcome a herald with trust what had happened to these people to make them this way ancar is what happened to them dear they will be long in trusting anyone ever again gwena said quietly it may be that this generation never will so where are you going then the man asked still wary tell him the truth kechara darkwind said softly in tayledras dont dissemble we might as well see now what kind of reception were going to have while we still have the provisions to turn around and go home we cant afford to fight our way across this country to get to tremane she nodded slightly to show that shed heard him he was right of course if they couldnt get to tremanes headquarters without fighting there was no point in going on were on our way to a town called shonar she said carefully wondering how much or little he knew he knew enough the man rocked back a pace youre going to tremane he demanded the impie duke she couldnt tell if he was angry or not but she was already committed to the truth so she nodded were the valdemaran envoy to tremane she replied hehe wants to join the alliance things that we have learned make us inclined to trust him to be honorable we hope there were murmurs from the group behind the man and elspeth took heart from the fact that they didnt sound angry just thoughtful the man himself considered them for a moment then waved his followers aside we need to talk herald from valdemar he said with a touch of formality and theres no point in doing it in this cold come along the inns still in repair and heated even if the innkeepers gone and if youve got bedrolls to sleep in theres beds to put them on if you can tend to yourselves and feed yourselves we can give you fair shelter for the night that was the most welcome statement shed heard yet on this journey and she allowed gwena to fall in obediently behind the man as he led the way to the inn the inn was in good repair as promised and so were the stables the group dismounted in the innyard and led their mounts and the pack animals inside a stout building with a surprising number of animals in the stalls they must be keeping all of the horses and ponies in the town here she realized after a look around that makes more sense than scattering them one and two to a stable the hardornens quickly set to throwing down straw from the hayloft to make up the remaining stalls for the visitors as it turned out they also had hay though no grain to spare that was fine though the valdemarans had brought a string of chirras with them loaded down with their supplies the chirras did perfectly well on the hay alone and there was plenty of grain in the supplies for the horses gwena and the dyheli brytha everyone in the party pitched in to help in the stables elspeths cardinal rule learned from kerowyn was that the welfare of their beasts came before the needs of the humans and no one disagreed with her with the horses chirras brytha and gwena warmly bedded down and fed and the sun setting behind the veil of gray cloud they all trudged into the inn carrying their baggage once inside they stood in a tight group for a moment looking carefully around the common room a large chamber with a huge fireplace at one end stout wooden floor and walls and smokeblackened beams supporting the roof had none of the air of neglect and decay that elspeth had feared she guessed that the villagers had turned the place into their informal meeting house for the place was too clean to have been swept out just for their benefit the other door the one that led into the street kept opening as more and more people came in and it looked to her as if most of the adults were gathering in the common room they had all brought firewood with them as well which relieved one question in elspeths mindit would have been difficult for the valdemarans to supply firewood for themselves the fellow in charge had not yet pulled off his coat but he had removed the scarf from his face he pushed to the front of the crowd and waved a mittened hand at the staircase and his weathered careworn features were kinder than elspeth had expected rooms are upstairs take your pick he said when youve settled yourselves come down here where we can talk several of those waiting came up the wooden staircase with their guests bringing firewood to leave beside each hearth before returning downstairs they didnt say anything but elspeth got the impression that was more because they were taciturn or shy than that they were hostile with fires warming the chambers that had fireplaces and bricks heating up to warm the cold bedding of those in chambers that didnt the valdemarans finally trickled downstairs to meet the eyes of their erstwhile hosts elspeth took the lead the rest following her the natives watched elspeth with covert curiosity but the moment that darkwind descended the staircase they gave up any pretense of politeness and just stared mouths agape with amazement the corners of elspeths mouth twitched but she managed not to laugh out loud at their expressions i doubt theyve ever seen anything like my darkwind he must seem like something right out of a minstrels ballad to them darkwind really was quite a sight with his long silver hair his strange exotic clothing and the enormous bondbird on his shoulder when he reached up a hand to vree casually lifted him off his shoulder and cast the forestgyre into the air so he could fly across the room and take a perch on a beam every hardornen in the place ducked and several looked as if they were afraid the bird was going to attack them for his part vree was on his best behavior perching where there wasnt going to be anyone sitting directly beneath or behind him that was extremely polite of him for if he fell asleep his instincts would overcome his training if he had to slice and a bird the size of vree could produce an amazing amount of hawkchalk she waited for darkwind to reach her side and took his hand in hers this is darkwind ksheyna a hawkbrother from one of the hawkbrother clans in the alliance she said as matteroffactly as if she had said this is thom a farmer from the next valley their eyes bulged at that and she didnt blame them even in valdemar up until recently the hawkbrothers had been nothing more than a very spooky legendwhat must these hardornens think he is my fellow envoy my partner and my mate she continued representing the hawkbrothers the shinain and other interests as i said we are traveling to shonar to grand duke tremane as official envoys of valdemar and other members of the alliance the fellow who had taken charge of the meeting nodded he had by now divested himself of his coat and wore the clothing of a craftsmana blacksmith if elspeth was any judge by the scorch marks and mended places that might have been burn marks he looked much shabbier than any blacksmith elspeth had ever seen in valdemar where they tended to be the more prosperous citizens of a town perhaps he is the most prosperous man here what a thought if hes as shabby as a beggar how are the others faring the fact that he was the blacksmith would be the reason that ancar had not recruited him for the army given that he was ablebodied and neither too old nor too young to fight a town this size depended on having a blacksmith and the local smith would need to have more skill than an apprentice im hob the man said and gestured to one of the tables if hed been fed as well as he should have his face would have been round like an old weathered ball he was not starvedlooking but his bones were showing just a hint that these people had seen bad times as if she didnt already know that if some of your people want to go fix up your food wed like to talk with you and youryour mate there wed be happy to share what we have elspeth began flushing a little with guilt but he shook his head weve got enough to hold us so long as spring dont wait to midsummer he said and youll need every bit youve got to get to shonar thanks to ah some good advice most folk between here and there have enough but theres none to spare i doubt youll find anyone that can sell you so much as a sack of oats and even if they would it wouldnt be for money elspeth looked back over her shoulder to vallen he nodded and with a gesture sent four of the guards off to the kitchen the rest took seats with and carefully around elspeth darkwind remained at her right hand and she was not in the least deceived by his casual pose if anyone so much as raised his voice in a way he considered threatening the offending party might find himself facing the point of a knife or being held in the bonds of a most uncomfortable tanglespell or racking paralysis and thats assuming i didnt act on a perception of threat first for myself hob sat across the table from elspeth and rubbed his nose as if wondering how to begin finally he just set his shoulders and blundered in you say youre going to shonar how much do you know about this tremane not long on tact but i doubt hes used to being the leader of these people he probably hasnt had much occasion for tact elspeth shrugged what we know is this hes brought in his entire force to shonar and hes broken off all hostile actions with hardornen loyalists from what weve been told hes going out of his way to avoid conflict with loyalist groups which youll admit in this weather isnt exactly difficult hob snorted in agreement not only has he expressed an interest in joining the alliance he loaned us several of his mages to help us with she hesitated how much would he understand if she told him about the magestorms with the magical problem thats at the heart of all the weird things that have been happening the monsters the weather them circles hobs eyes widened and he grew quite excited tremane helped you with fixing them he did and he continues to elspeth replied its a bigger problem than you may realize it isnt just hardorn thats been plagued by all these calamities its valdemar the pelagirs rethwellan karse the dhorisha plains and were guessing just about everywhere else right out to the empire the alliance with tremanes help managed to fix things temporarily in the area covered by the alliance nations she decided that it might be best not to mention solaris personal interview with the grand duke after all she only knew that it had occurred not what had been said as for the rest that we know about tremane we have been told that the citizens of shonar and the surrounding area have come to look upon him as their protector we have heard that he has been doing good things for them aye hob said slowly weve heard the same weve heard that them as was fighting against him have come over to his side that hes been acting likelike we was his people and now hes helping you in valdemar she nodded he pursed his lips and exchanged glances with some of his fellow villagers they werent very good at hiding their expressions what she was telling them agreed with some of what they had heard and they were surprised to have an outsider confirm what theyd clearly thought were hopeful but unlikely rumors weve heard as how things are pretty fat in shonar all things considered he said finally weve heard that its because of tremane weve heard he set his men out helping with harvest building walls around the town doing other things like that sides taking down monsters she spread her hands in a gesture he could read as he chose weve heard the same things she said i dont know yet how much truth is in what weve heard but im certain that your sources are completely different from ours i can tell you this not all of our sources are tremanes people and when two people say the same thing aye there was a great deal of murmuring behind him he chewed on his lower lip all the same all the same its possible that he is putting on a good face for us hoping to lure us into accepting him she said as bluntly as he would have we dont know and we wont know until we get there hob traced the grain of the wood of the table with his finger and avoided her eyes all the same ladywe need a leader theres nobody left of the old blood damned ancar saw to that and people have been talking about accepting the duke that was more than she had expected to hear on this side of the former battle lines a foreigner an imperial the duke not his bloody empire someone said in the back we heard his emperor left him hanging out to dry when the troubles started we heard hes not charliss dog no more hell he couldnt be could he if hes comin to you with his brass hat in his hand looking to get into the alliance hob said looking hopeful hes proving himself for shonar if he proves himself for shonar why not for hardorn but what if he doesnt just want to be your leader elspeth asked softly what if he wants to be your king hob hesitated a moment then shrugged thats all cake or calamity tomorrow isnt it he said philosophically we got to get through the winter first he favored elspeth with a shy smile i can tell you this theres one way wed take him even as a king darkwind asked quietly he nodded slowly even as a king hed have to swear on something wed trust that he wasnt charliss man then hed have to swear to hardorn and hed have to do what ancar his father even what his grandfather never did he paused for effect hed have to take the earth in the old way elspeth shook her head thats nothing i know of she replied hob smiled again the earthtakingthats old lady older than valdemar or so they say whats old is sure thats the saying anyway they say them as takes the earth cant betray it theres still a priest or two about that knows the way of earthtaking if this tremaned take the earth and the earth takes himwell theres no going back hes bound harder and tighter than if we put chains on him elspeth kept her feelings of skepticism to herself after all shed seen there was no telling whether hob was right about this earthtaking of his or not well you can believe that valdemar has no interest in taking the rule of hardorn away from the people what you do about it is your business elspeth said carefully our business is to see if what weve been told is true and to advise the alliance if it is not he nodded and did not add the obvious question of how she expected to get herself and her party out in one piece if tremane turned out to be playing his own game that wasnt his problem and she couldnt blame him for not volunteering to help if things got difficult the people of hardorn had all they could do to survive and they had nothing to spare for foreigners out of valdemar comforting aromas of cooking food emerged from the kitchen and hob took that gratefully as his escape from the conversation looks like your people have your food ready well go leave you in peace with it you can leave in the morning when you chooseandah he flushed a little youll have better welcome farther along signaltowers are still up and theres still a few as know the old signals well be passing along that youre all right that youre going on up to tremane nobodyll hinder you therere enough places with four sound walls and a roof that youll get shelter at night as he stood up elspeth remained seated but raised a hand toward hob and does the grand duke know that the towers are still working she asked he laughed which was all the answer she needed so tremane was not aware of this rapid means of passing news along that could be useful if it turned out he was playing a deeper game than they thought hob and the rest of his people filed out leaving the valdemarans alone and elspeth turned first to vallen as the kitchen crew put bowls of stewed dried meat and preserved fruit and plates of travel biscuits onto the table well she asked what do you think he sat down across from her in hobs place and picked up a biscuit and a bowl before answering this matches what wed heard and didnt really believe he said slowly dipping his bread into his gravy and eating the biscuit with small neat bites tremane sounds too good to be true altogether an admirable and unselfish leader there was a faint echo of mockery in his voice so does selenay if you look at things objectively darkwind reminded him and yes i know tremane has no companion to keep him honorable but im not sure one would be needed in this case at least for now hes in a precarious situation with the way things have fallen out his position and his level of personal danger arent that much different from the average craftsman in shonar he needs them as much as they need a leader if they fall it wont be long before he does too if they rebel he has no population base to support his troops this summer they were fighting against him and it wouldnt take much mistreatment to make them turn on him elspeth nodded agreeing with him although vallen appeared a bit more dubious he has armed troops loyal only to him vallen pointed out hell have a hard time feeding those troops without farmers elspeth replied and he can have all the silver he needs to pay them but if they havent anywhere to spend it their loyalty will start to erode you cant keep an army under siege starving and far from home without losing it vallen speared a bit of meat and blew on it to cool it all i can say is this the guardcaptain said after hed eaten the bite its not all that difficult for a charismatic leader to sway the people immediately around him with words instead of deeds its a lot more difficult to do that with people out of the reach of his personality theyre inclined to look for something to corroborate what theyve heard and if theres nothing there they forget him but youre surprised at what youre hearing from hob elspeth stated vallen nodded very and not the least because a few months ago these people would have fought with everything they had left to get rid of the man now theyre considering accepting him as a leader doesnt it sound as if theyve heard and learned something very compelling over the past few months i just hope that what theyve heard has more substance than twicetold tales elspeth sighed and nodded as she and everyone else applied themselves to their food this was the first warm meal theyd had all day and their supper last night had been hastily prepared over a smoky fire in the remains of a halfruined house not cooked in a proper kitchen as the gnawing hunger in the pit of her stomach eased and the warmth from their dinner filled her she became aware just how tired she was when she glanced around the table there wasnt anyone except darkwind who wasnt leaning his head on his hand as he ate she felt the same way worn down by the cold and quite ready to go to bed as soon as she finished the last bite darkwind seemed in his element and she would not have hesitated a moment in trusting the entire expedition to him some of the others looked quite ready to fall asleep over their plates its the cold darkwind said quietly dont worry this is normal its being in the cold from dawn until dusk without a chance to warm up then going to bed in cold beds and unheated rooms tonight will make a difference with a good hot meal and warm beds tomorrow everyone will end the day without being quite so exhausted if we can get shelter like this for the rest of the trip our people will revive in no time at all he ought to know and she should have remembered then again perhaps she was not at fault for forgetting when shed worked beside him as a scout and borderguard at ksheyna vale theyd lived in the vale theyd return from their shifts on patrol to an ekele in the midst of a garden spot as warm as a midsummer day before that hed refused to live inside the vale and there might well have been times when hed returned home to a chilled ekele or might even have remained overnight camping in the wilderness just because she had never personally experienced such hardship that didnt mean he hadnt lets go to bed vallen said abruptly after jerking his head up suddenly for the third time as he nodded off in spite of valiant efforts to stay awake i cant keep my eyes open anymore ill clean up im good for that elspeth volunteered and smiled at the look of surprise from vallen what did he think she considered herself above such chores or had he forgotten that at the last several stops shed taken her turn at gathering fodder from the ruined barns putting together makeshift stalls for the horses and chirras and gathering clean snow for water i was a heraldtrainee once or dont you recall ive scrubbed my share of pots in my time and i think i can manage without breaking anything darkwind picked up empty bowls knives and spoons without comment other than a wink sometimes they both forgot the way other people saw them she caught vallen staring after darkwind with an even greater look of surprise than hed shown when she volunteered to clean up does he think hawkbrothers magic their plates clean oh well he probably does and it doesnt occur to him that it would be harder work to clean a pot by magic than to do it by hand she gathered up what darkwind couldnt carry and both of them went into the kitchen this had been a particularly fine inn once with a pump supplying water to the kitchen the cooking crew had left water heating on the hearth both the regular guards and kerowyns mercenaries were used to every aspect of this kind of mission when it came to cooking they were nothing if not efficient it didnt take long to clean the bowls and cutlery and the two pots they had used for heating the food i keep having second thoughts about this trip elspeth said quietly darkwind nodded i can understand why you would feel that way but i believe we are doing one of many things that could be the right path he replied carefully wiping out a pot and putting it away it was a typically tayledras response we must remain in contact with tremane that much i am certain of how we do thatwell this is one way there would have been others but this is the way we chose and i do not think we have chosen amiss at least in this case well have our own eyes and ears in shonar she sighed he smiled and tongues as well we can also advise if tremane chooses to listen to us the pots bowls and utensils had all come with them and she repacked them in the bags with the supplies given the way things have been going so far she observed its only too likely i suppose for something entirely unexpected to happen out here and in that case the alliance had better have people in place to observe and reassure darkwind slipped his arm around her shoulders turning his hug into a way to turn her toward the door to the common room and to fix transform leverage and otherwise turn things for the better tremane according to kerowyn comes from a culture in which treachery is a commonplace he reminded her if anything unexpected were to occur that would be the first explanation that would come to him she shook her head and let him draw her toward the door if she hadnt been too tired to think properly she might have been able to make some kind of rational discussion out of this as it was you know i almost feel sorry for tremane she admitted reluctantly as they mounted the stairs to their room rank did have privileges and she had laid claim to one of the rooms with a real bed and a fireplace it had probably been one of the expensive chambers when this had still been an inn she was looking forward to sleeping in a bed warmed by a hot brick at its foot well maybe not sleeping at least not for a little while i do have darkwind here i do feel sorry for him darkwind said unexpectedly and i believe i know why young karal forgave him just because he has been forced to deal with daily treachery does not make him a treacherous individual we do not know what he is really like except that we may guess somewhat through his actions this speech had taken them up the stairs and to the space just outside the door to their room elspeth opened the door drew him inside and stopped the rest of the speech with her lips on his i have had quite enough of tremane to last me until morning she said firmly as he responded as she had hoped he would by pulling her closer and simultaneously closing the door to their room i think we can afford not to think of him for a little while at least oh at least he agreed and then said nothing more with words for quite some time hob was as good as his word from that time on they began to see and interact with the people of hardornthose that remained at leastand were given the limited hospitality that this sad land could afford elspeth continued to be surprised at the suspicion with which the valdemarans were met it didnt make any sense to her that the natives should persist in considering them the harbingers of another invasion if they had been a real invading force they would have had a small army at least if they had been the advance scouts of an invasion they wouldnt have come so openly she gradually decided that the reason had nothing to do with logic ancar had already poisoned his peoples minds about the valdemarans and some of that poison still lingered at the very beginning of his war with valdemar when his people had not yet been aware of the kind of man he really was he had told them that his war was justified that the valdemarans were responsible for the murder of his father and most of the high council and that the queen of valdemar intended to annex hardorn as a subject state of her own land later of course ancar proved even to the most naive of his countrymen that he was never to be trusted but some of his lies still remained in the back of peoples memories perhaps they no longer even recalled it was ancar who had spread those lies in the first place and to folk who themselves were never warlike to begin with and who were now suffering privations worse in their way than even their life under ancar an armed force like hersobviously welltrained wellfed wellarmed and in top conditionmust look very much like an army these folks hadnt yet seen the imperial army theyd only heard rumors of it how large it was how incredibly professional away from the conflicts at the border they had never seen anything larger than the garrisons ancar bivouacked in their villages to insure their cooperation and to collect taxes perhaps their imaginations couldnt encompass the idea of an army how large one had to be yet here was her force quite large enough to take over every town in its path and they didnt have to imagine what it was like for it was real and right in front of them the natives usually came around after a short meeting such as she and her troop had had with hob at that point the valdemarans were treated like travelers instead of conquerors villagers would recall the old hospitable customs and would usually open the inn the temple or a guildhall to them then there were warm beds warm rooms and once in a while a bit of fresh meat to add to their own rations there was no trouble with finding firewood this winternot with half or more of the buildings in any given community standing empty and falling down sensibly the survivors had moved into the best homes and kept them in repair and were using the rest for materials and firewood they might be on short rations but they were going to spend the rest of the winter in warmth and that elspeth realized as she and her party continued to brave the cold that penetrated even the warmest of clothing and left them aching by days end was what would save these villagers they could get by on less food as long as they were warm enough they might emerge when the snows melted as gaunt as spring bears but they would be alive for the cold would kill more quickly than short rations but the nearer they got to shonar the more people seemed cautiously impressed with tremane or at least with the stories they were hearing about him once the terrible killing blizzards caused by the passing waves of magestorms had subsided into more normal winter weather he had begun making tentative overtures toward those who lived out past the area he had secured for himself and his army he had sent his men out to clear the roads and keep them clear he had encouraged such small trade as there might be in the dead of winter if the rumors were true he had also sent his men ranging in a limited fashion on monsterkilling expeditions supposedly anyone within a threeday range of shonar could come and request his help with killing a monster provided that they knew either where it denned or what its range was the grand duke evidently had no intention of sending parties of his soldiers off to wander about in the snow trying to find a monster and possibly making targets of themselves tremane would send out a team of twenty of his trained soldiers all armed to the teeth and experienced in fighting mageborn aberrations and all the natives had to do was lead them to the monster or to where it might be trapped or cornered the soldiers did the rest the natives got the privilege of deciding what happened to the carcass often if it looked remotely edible they would ask the healer who traveled with the group to determine if it was safe to eat and the healer invariably obliged in addition once the monster or monsters were disposed of the group would remain long enough to conduct a hunt of feral stock which was generally not all that difficult to find half of what they killed they took back to shonar the remaining half they left to feed the natives since this was always more than the locals had before the hunt began no one protested when tremanes men claimed the imperial share and in addition while the hunts for monsters or feral cattle were going on the healer who always accompanied the expedition would tend to any illness or injuries among the natives in short when the imperial group returned to shonar they left behind a stockpile of muchneeded meat people who had received medical attention the like of which they had not seen since ancar took the throne and land that was now safer if not as pastoral and tranquil as in generations before if any new monsters appeared the natives had only to request help again and the entire scenario would be repeated tremane would not give aid against wolves bears or bandits the first two it was said he had decreed were perfectly well within the means of the natives to deal with and as for the thirdhe claimed that he could not tell the difference between bandits and patriots and he was not going to try this was a bit hard on the hardornens who were suffering from the depredations of fellow humans but perhaps it gave them incentive to track down those who had once been their neighbors and reintroduce them to a law that had been long absent from hardorn all of this was very impressive in tale and rumormore impressive in that the stories were remarkably consistentbut elspeth waited to see what was being said nearer to shonar finally they came within that threeday sphere of tremanes influence and they saw for themselves that the stories of tremanes philanthropy were true unexpectedly they had stepped from a road cleared just enough to let a single cart pass to one which had been completely shoveled free of snow right down to the earth or gravel of the roadbedand one which obviously was kept free of snow they saw for themselves the trophy heads or other parts from the monsters that tremanes men had tracked down and killed and they heard from the natives who had been fed and healed out of tremanes bounty just what a good and just leader he was no one was mentioning the word king yet but elspeth sensed that it was not far from anyones thoughts how could it be when in the face of the worst times that hardorn had ever experienced this man was slowly imposing order and sanity on the face of the land and it wasnt the arbitrary selfish order of a tyrant either theyd seen enough of that under ancar to recognize it if they saw it this was law and order that they could live with and be at peace with elspeth couldnt help but contrast their lot with that of their fellow countrymen who did not have the advantage of living within three days of shonar reluctantly she had to admit that if she were in their boots shed have felt the same way more than that she found herself agreeing with most of what hed done and ordered here a few things represented laws or customs from the empire that she wouldnt have imposed but the restit was just the hand and the mind of someone who was concerned about the welfare of the people and knew how to derive the greatest good from a limited amount of resources the day before they were to meet with duke tremane himself elspeth and darkwind were approached by a solemn group of hardornens as they ate their evening meal this time the innkeeper still tenanted his inn but it had been a long time since he had actually served guests he had offered a chance for elspeth and darkwind to have a quiet dinner together without the company of their escort and the prospect was too enticing to turn down he put them in a small private dining room with the troop seated in the larger room outside elspeth had not realized how much she had missed being able to talk to him without worrying about the ears of others there were things she had wanted to discuss that needed to wait until they were alone in their roomif they were alone since they often shared their sleeping quarters with the others they lingered over their last drink making the most of this private timeand that was when the innkeeper interrupted them town council would like to talk sir lady he said diffidently poking his head into the room alone here if you please elspeth sighed she did not please but there was no point in saying so if they must she replied allowing some but not all of her annoyance to show the innkeeper vanished and the delegation must have been waiting right outside for they trooped through the door immediately we wont take up much of your time envoy said the bestdressed of the lot a fellow who still boasted the velvets and furs of earlier prosperity its just something wed like you toto say for us to duke tremane not a complaint added a second only slightly less elegant than his fellow no not a complaint something he might want to hear maybe theres been talk the first interrupted with a glare at the second weve heard the talk oh i was guildmaster for the wool and weavers guild for this whole region which explains the finery elspeth thought and keplan here was master for the leather and furriers guild so as i say theres been talk and people have come to us with it duke tremanes proven good for us and there are some that want to make him our leader the guildmaster waved his hands expansively some who are even sayingking the second interrupted his fellow guildmaster now weve sent out word looking for some of the old royal blood of hardorn weve got ways of sending word out farther and faster than youd believe and theres no one not one person of the old royal family left alive i cant say that amazes me elspeth told them dryly ancar wasnt one to tolerate rivals and he wouldnt let a little thing like the age or sex of a possible pretender stop him from removing someone he wanted out of the way the woolmaster coughed ah aye and woe betide anyone that got in the way back then he looked up hopefully to see if elspeth agreed with this attempt to exonerate himself for not attempting to interfere by that she inferred that at least one opportunity had occurred and he hadnt even tried but who am i to judge i wasnt there i dont know what happened if he took the cowards path his own guilty conscience may be punishing him enough by now you were saying that there isnt anyone of the old royal blood left she prompted so sowelltheres some consensus that we might offer duke tremane the crown with conditions he held his breath and waited for her reaction an interesting proposal darkwind said quietly i presume that the conditions would be unusual since you mention them at all the woolmaster switched his attention from elspeth to darkwind they could be he said itswell its something our old kings hadnt done for generations its hed have to take earthbinding the furrier burst out weve got a priest of the old beliefs one that knows the ceremony and can make it stick hed have to bind himself to the earth to hardorn so that anything that hurt the land would hurt him the woolmaster stared at his fellow appalled but elspeth only shrugged it sounds like a sensible precaution on your part she told them and if the opportunity presents itself we will convey your message to the grand duke but we cant promise anything and we certainly cant promise that hell agree to any such thing thats all we ask envoy the woolmaster said waving at his little group and backing up himself with a great deal of haste thats all our thanks as he spoke he herded the others out in front of him and with the last word he shut the door to the dining room behind him darkwind looked at elspeth and she grimaced well she said into the heavy silence that was certainly interesting and it leaves the question begging he replied with a rueful smile just how would one present such a proposition to tremane i think that we can wait until we ride into shonar itself and we get a chance to see what the empire representsas molded by the hand of grand duke tremane she replied that in itself will tell us whether or not theres any point despite the icy wind cutting through her coat elspeth sat back in her saddle and stared until her eyes hurt from snow glare i cant believe they raised all this in a single season she muttered and without magic gwena reminded her shifting her weight in tiny increments to keep muscles warm granted they did have a great deal of incentivethe possibility of hostile hardornen troops attacking and the certainty of monsterswhat did that fine young man call them boggles elspeth replied absently taking in the reality of a twostorytall wall and not a wooden palisade mind but a brick wall this edifice circled not only the entire city of shonar but the much larger camp and garrison of the imperials and an open sward that had once been the towns grazing commons as well a monumental task without a doubt then add to that the equally monumental task of constructing barracks buildings for the imperial forces before the snow fell and it became a job to stun the mind in its scope how had he gotten all that built where had he found all the laborers were very proud of our work siara said the fine young man in imperial uniform who had met them half a day out of shonar and escorted them in siara was evidently the generic title of respect applicable to either sex that the imperial military used when the person doing the addressing did not know the true rank of the one being addressed it was probably the equivalent to sir mercenaries generally addressed their officers as sir regardless of gender a perfectly sensible approach of which elspeth approved we all worked on the walls and the barracks every man of us the young soldier continued his cheeks flushed in the cold except when some of us went to work on the harvest and then we traded work with townsfolk however many it took to make up the work that one of us could do thats what duke tremane traded so the walls and the barracks could keep going up sensible did you notice the boy says that tremane traded work for work not that he conscripted workers gwenas head was up as she made her own survey of the walls granted it wouldnt have been very smart to conscript workers for a wall youre building for your own protection but that hasnt stopped rulers in the past from doing things equally stupid elspeth nodded no point in confusing the poor fellow by answering someone he couldnt hear the imperials were already confused enough by her insistence on special treatment and housing for gwena and the dyheli brytha although they had agreed to such a condition before a single valdemaran set foot on the road to shonar darkwind cleared his throat gently as impressive as these walls are i suspect our fellow travelers are as cold as i am and we are not growing any warmer for standing here the young soldier snapped to immediate attention and stammered an apology of course siara forgive me well be on our way at once he nudged his own horse awkwardly with his heels sending it ambling toward the gate ahead of them he obviously at least to elspeths eyes was not used to riding and the horse was certainly not a cavalry mount thicklegged jugheaded and shaggy it probably belonged to a farmer who didnt have any need for it in this season he was probably grateful he hadnt had to ride out too great a distance to meet them he handled the reins as if afraid the steady old gelding was going to rear and bolt at any second the horse had no intention of doing so he was just perfectly happy to be heading back to the city a warm stall and a good feed she wouldnt hurt the poor boys feelings by laughing at him but she was very glad for the scarf wrapped around her face concealing her mouth the guards patrolling the top of the wall looked down at them with interest as they approached though with no sign of alarm there was some nudging and pointing when those nearest caught sight of darkwinds dyheli but that was to be expected for her part elspeth saw absolutely nothing to make her instincts issue an alarm except for the uniforms these men could have been any force in any of the alliance nations watching the envoy of one of the other allies ride in there was no show of hostility from them and no sense of entrapment on her part they went through the gate without a challenge and followed their guide through the main street of the city it was strange after all these weeks of not hearing their mounts hooves do more than thud dully on the creaking snow to ride once again to the peculiar music that gwenas silver hooves made as they chimed against the cobblestones once they passed the wall punctuated by the staccato clicking of brythas cloven toes townsfolk evidently warned of their coming gathered along the side of the street to cheer and wave welcomes and stare at darkwind she was reminded of the way they had last entered towns in hardorn as part of a traveling faire they hadnt stood out then in the midst of so much outlandish gaudy somewhat tarnished finery probably onlookers had assumed that the dyheli had been an ordinary horse or pony in disguise now darkwind had everyones undivided attention and to his credit he seemed just as nonchalant as if there was no one gaping at all they passed several goodsized inns and several more buildings that might have quartered them and came out on the other side of the town they were heading in the direction not of the moundlike barracks buildings but of a stone edifice rising at least four stories in height in the main with towers of five or six stories above that it seemed they were to be quartered in this fortified manor tremane had appropriated as his headquarters elspeth wondered how many clerks officers and other underlings had to be reshuffled to make room for them she was not going to be parted from her escort and she doubted that tremane was going to be foolish or naive enough to expect anything different and that would mean displacing a fair number of people the previous owner had a very small stable actually inside the manor the young soldier said as they approached a second set of walls about the manor the entrance is on the courtyard and it is situated beside the kitchen the dukes horsemaster said he thinks it was for very valuable mares in foal there are four looseboxes and its warm enough for people to sleep in at need will that do for yourahmounts he looked questioningly at brytha and gwena as if he still didnt understand what all the fuss was about for her part elspeth was just grateful that theyd not only found a decent place for the nonhuman members of the delegation but that it was gong to be within the same building complex that should be perfect now it was her turn to hesitate were going to want to see to them before we are taken to our own quarters or even meet with grand duke tremane for the first time i hope he will understand the soldiers nod made it clear that he didnt think tremane would understand but that he was prepared to put up with the peculiarities of the valdemarans gwena chuckled in elspeths mind never mind dear the only person we have to persuade of my intellect is tremane and that wont take long and it can wait until tomorrow hes going to have enough shocks today as it is frankly im more interested in a nice warm mash and a rest in a warm place than in meeting tremane anyway gwena surely was easier to live with these days or maybe ive finally grown up elspeth chuckled to herself allowing herself to relax the tiniest amount if there had been anything untoward gwena would probably have sensed it the walls about the manor were much much darker than the walls around the city these had been made of cut stone like the manor itself a dark gray that somehow stopped just short of being depressing there were more guards on the top of these walls as well but again their manner was casual while these men were professional and ready to act on a moments notice their manner led elspeth to think they did not consider themselves to be under any particular threat they entered a gate with an iron portcullis but instead of passing under the walls into the yard between the walls and the manor they went into an arched tunnel which actually passed under the walls of the manor torches dispelled part of the gloom but not all of it elspeth did not miss noting the murderholes in the ceiling above them nor did anyone else in their party the holes were spaced so closely that if the gates on either end of the tunnel were dropped there would be no escaping boiling oil or other unpleasantness coming out of those apertures this would have made her a great deal more nervous had the manor not predated tremanes arrival not that he wouldnt use them he just had not put them there in the first place the nasty mind that came up with them was a native hardornen possibly one of ancars ancestors the delegation split exactly in half once they were in the courtyard half of vallens troop took the luggage to what was going to become their ambassadorial quarters and the other half remained with darkwind and elspeth while they saw to the comfort of their mounts elspeth was just a little irritated at the tooobvious guardians but she was experienced enough to realize they were a necessity until they really knew the situation here it was better to be too cautious and formal and reinforce the imperials perceptions of herself and darkwind as people of diplomatic importancewhich of course they were her irritation was shortlived for vallen and his people made themselves useful instead of decorative and things were soon settled in the stables to the comfort and satisfaction of everyone one of the imperials had remained to take them to their quarters and with their own guards trailing behind she and darkwind followed him across the cobblestoned courtyard to one of the many entrances opening onto it weve given you this tower he said diffidently as he led them to a staircase his hardornen stilted and painfully correct duke tremane hopes it will suffice your needs i believe it ought to she replied as they climbed to the first residential floor the half of their guards that had gone on ahead were already making themselves at home this was quite a spacious room furnished with beds and chests and not all that dissimilar from barracks in valdemar the second floor was identical to the first but untenanted at the moment they continued to climb the staircase which wound around the outside wall these will be your quarters sir and lady said their escort as they reached the third level they were standing in a public reception room set up on the third floor with a table and chairs suitable for conferences with writing tables and an arrangement of three comfortable chairs beside the fireplace your bedrooms and a study are on the fourth floor and there is a storage room on the fifth their escort said i am one of duke tremanes aides and i will be at your disposal as elspeth and darkwind explored their personal quarters he explained very seriously that they did not really want to use that top floor for anything except storage it had no fireplace and was exposed to the winds in every direction after poking her nose up there and seeing a thin layer of frost on the stones elspeth agreed tremane gave them a decent period of time in which to get settled and into presentable clothing elspeth very much missed the comforts of the palace at haven a hot bath here meant heating water over the fire in kettles and pouring it into a tub the servants brought into the bedroom the rest was just as primitive and she wrinkled her nose at the sight of the chamber pot but the alternative could be worse and it wouldnt be the first time she and darkwind had made do finally when they were presentable tremane sent another of his aides to invite them to dinner with him as good a time and place to open relations with him as any when darkwind gave her a little nod she accepted for both of them and they followed the young man down the stair and into the main body of the manor they traveled down a dark and faintly chilled hallway for some time with their only light coming from lanterns mounted in brackets at intervals along the wall finally they reached another stair and the aide led them up into what was clearly another tower in fact if this tower held tremanes quarters and was laid out in a similar manner to theirs they could probably look right into his bedroom from their own an interesting thought and one which showed a measure of trust from tremane if one could look one could also shoot they discovered as the aide ushered them into a room that corresponded to their own reception room that this was to be an informal meeting the table was set only for three with a single aide standing by a sideboard full of covered dishes tremane was already waiting for them and elspeth scrutinized him carefully even as he was looking both of them over with the same care she would not have taken him for the brilliant military leader he was supposed to be he didnt look anything like a professional soldierbut then neither did half of kerowyns best fighters he was losing his mousebrown hair and what remained was going gray his intelligent face showed signs of age and strain both tremane embodied contradiction his shoulders were firmer and broader than any clerks but there were inkstains on his right hand he wore a sword as one for whom it was a standard piece of attire but there were lines at the corners of his graybrown eyes that people got when they habitually squinted trying to read in dim light on the one handscholar on the otherfighter he stood up after a moment as if they had surprised him by arriving sooner than he had expected and extended his hand elspeth found his expression impossible to read closed but somehow not secretive a gamblers face perhaps the face of a man unwilling to give anything away but what his face might not reveal other signs might his clothing was a variation on the imperial uniform but with none of the fancy decorations she normally associated with someone of high rank there was just a badge with a coronet and another with what might be his own device nowhere was there evidence of the imperial seal or badge although the badge of a crossed pen and sword looked as if it had been sewn in place of a larger badge come to think of it no one ive seen wears the imperial badge that more than anything else told her he really had given over his allegiance to the empire soldiers set a great deal of store by what device they fought under if the imperial seal was gone so was their loyalty to what it represented the lack of decoration thoughmilitary men took pomp and decoration for granted what did that lack of decoration say about tremane that he was modest or that he wanted to appear modest tremane extended his hand to her and she clasped it returning his clasp strength for strength he didnt test her but his clasp was firm and so was hers i am pleased to meet you at last princess he began she shook her head and he stopped in midsentence tilting his head a little to the side in what was probably a habitual gesture of inquiry not princess if you please she corrected i renounced that title some time ago in favor of other responsibilities envoy will do or ambassador or even my lady although i do still hold lands and title that are the equivalent to yours grand duke no one in valdemar even considers me as being in line for the throne anymore must not let him think hes being slighted by having someone sent to him who is of lesser rank my partner and spouse darkwind ksheyna is an adept his people do not have any equivalent titles specifying nobility she continued but we judged his status as a mage to be significant in place of a title tremane nodded released her hand and took darkwinds the two men gazed measuringly into one anothers eyes before releasing their grips i am very pleased to meet you both at last and i would deem it an honor if you would dispense with titles and simply refer to me as tremane as my people in my home lands did the grand duke replied softening his formal manner with a slight smile would you take a seat i fear you will find my fare somewhat plain but these are not the times for overindulging it was darkwind who replied as he held out a chair for elspeth i could not agree more tremane he said but it does appear that the folk under your command are prospering better than most in hardorn tremane waited until both of them were seated before he took his own chair that is as much a matter of luck as anything else he replied luck in that we have one resource that hardorn lacksmanpower there is enough to be scavenged if you have enough ablebodied men tremanes aide offered elspeth a simple dish of vegetables baked with cheese and she nodded in acceptance as he finished spooning a portion onto her plate and turned to darkwind she took up the conversation nevertheless you have impressed those natives here who live within your sphere of influence tremane took a sip of his wine one of the virtues of the empire is that its leaders are welltrained he said after a moment its vices are many but it is wellgoverned at the best of times its citizens had little to complain of and at the worst darkwind asked bluntly tremane bowed his head for a moment so much power is easily abused he said finally and applied himself to his food ending the conversation for the moment when it resumed they spoke of inconsequential things tremane was a decent conversationalist though not a brilliant one he was not a courtier or at least not someone who devoted most of his time to such pursuits but he was also too careful to be blunt too practiced to say anything that might cause him or his people damage he was a survivor of a very dangerous court and he had learned his lessons in that court well when they bid their host a cordial if guarded good night elspeth knew only one thing for certain grand duke tremane was a man who kept his own council and it would be difficult to penetrate the walls he had built about himself he would clearly protect his honor by maintaining silence at judicious times and practicing deflection when possible anyone who attempted to divine this complex mans deeper motives would find themselves with a nearly impossible task yet that was precisely the task elspeth and darkwind faced three emperor charliss sat enrobed in his heavy velvets of state amid the grim splendor of the panoply surrounding his iron throne he endured the burden of the wolf crown pressing down upon his brow ignored the content of the peoples chatter and watched his courtiers vainly attempt to conceal their jittery nerves outwardly this court was like any other except in degree gossip flirtations negotiations assignations betrayals confidencesthe highborn ranked and wealthy all danced their dances just as they had for years as their fathers had and as their grandfathers had over the years their forms of jockeying and presentation had gone from custom to manners to mannerism tempered by fashion and fear today each attempted to hold their clothing and their overly expensive accessories in their practiced ways but their true state showed in their stilted movements the nervous glances toward his dais and in the faintly hysterical edge to their voices as they murmured to one another his court had always been noted for flamboyance of dress but fewer and fewer of his courtiers were taking the time and care needed for truly opulent displays which showed more clearly than any other outward signs that their minds and energies were directed elsewhere they were afraid and people who were afraid did not concern themselves with inventing a new fashion or impressing an enemy with their wealth below the dais people milled in the patterns dictated by rank and custom but he was acutely aware of the holes in the patterns the court itself held little more than half the usual number of attendees how could it be otherwise those who could leave for their estates already had despite the fact that the season was well underway this was wildly contrary to custom no one who pretended to power or importance left the court in winter summer was the time when the highborn of the empire retired to their estates not winter winter that time of the year when snow and ice barricaded the isolated estates one from the other was the time to take ones place at court and engage in revelry and endless intrigue while ones underlings dealt with the tedium of estate caretaking and become immersed in the round of social intercourse known as the season those with youngsters to marry off brought them here to display them to the parents of other youngsters or potential older spouses those who wanted power jockeyed for position those who had it campaigned to keep it those who pursued pleasure came here to pursue it only the impossibly dull preoccupied or solitary remained in their homes during the season but not this winter when the first of the magestorms had come sweeping out of nowhere across the empire disrupting or destroying all the magic in its path except that which was heavily shielded the emperor had been angry but not seriously alarmed such a powerful work of magic could not have been easy to create and he had not expected that the senders would be able to repeat it at any time soon granted it had taken down every one of the portals that were the fundamental means of longrange transportation across the empire but it had been possible to set them back up again in a relatively short period of time the storm had caused inconvenience but no more he had never had any doubt that the mages of the empire would restore conditions to normal and then he would deliver a punishment to the fools who sent such a thing this punishment would send terror not only through their ranks but into the hearts of anyone else even peripherally involved but then without any warning the second storm had passed over the face of the empire that had been impossible by the rules of all magic as he knew it and then came a third and after that storm had passed still more and the intervals between them kept decreasing even as the magnitude of the damage that each wrought increased the courtiers might not have been aware of the damage that was being done in the empire as a whole but they were certainly aware of the impact on their own lives magefires heating their rooms and baths no longer functioned magelights vanished and had to be replaced by inferior candles and lanterns normally only used by laborers to light their hovels meals even in crag castle were often late and frequently cold one could no longer commandeer a portal to bring something from ones home estate there were servants enough that discomforts were rectified to a certain extentbut not entirely those in the court that had no truly pressing need to be here and who had the intelligence to see what might happen if conditions continued to deteriorate found reasons and the means to get home by now it was next to impossible to maintain anything of a magical nature without exhaustive work on shields and every time another stormwave passed those shields were so eroded that they required intensive repair transportation within the empire was at a standstill and communication sporadic at best physical constructions such as buildings and bridges that had incorporated static magics into their construction had crumbled every structural disaster created more disruption and fear and sometimes involved great loss of life nor was that the only physical effect of the stormwaves great pieces of land had been changed out of all recognition and bizarre monsters were appearing as if conjured out of the air itself migrating birds had altered their patterns or flew entirely lost wideleafed plants as tall as men stinging to the touch grew inexplicably from stonework and soil alike and all over the capital and nearby provinces vines strangled horses in the night carcasses of creatures that looked like nothing of this world were brought in as proof that these storms were only making their world stranger and more horrifying with each passing day by this time anyone who stood the slightest chance of reaching his or her estate by purely physical means had left the court at home a courtier would at least have reasonable foodstocks at hand and many had estates that relied on old fashioned nonmagical purely physical sources of heat light and sanitation one irony was that the poorer and less pretentious of the courtiers who had not had the spare means to spend on magical amenities in their estates were now the least uncomfortable of their peers as perilous as life on the estates could become now with monstrous creatures attacking without warning or provocation the wise and forethinking knew it was not only possible but probable that life in the capital would become far more dangerous how long before food riots set the disaffected against the wealthy charliss gazed upon his courtiers through narrowed eyes and his normally inscrutable face betrayed some of his annoyance he wondered if these who were left realized just how perilous life here could become there were a remarkable number of very foolish people here now people he had heard saying some amazingly silly things i come here to the season at court to forget the world outside these walls one woman had said testily in his hearing i dont care to hear anything about it while the season is on i have more important things to think abouti have balls to attend and five marriageable daughters to dispose of but the world outside the walls of crag castle was vanishing even as that woman danced and displayed her offspring and no amount of willful ignorance was going to change that already those outlying provinces of the empire that had but lately come under the rule of the iron throne had revolted regaining their independence charliss did not know in most cases what had become of the imperial forces that had been stationed there some few had made their way back to lands that were still within imperial sway but others had vanished into the silence perhaps they had revolted along with those they were supposed to rule but more likely they had been slaughtered or had merely surrendered and were now prisoners he did not know nor did anyone else reluctantly he was forced to admit to himself in recent days that his empire powerful and vast had one particular fatal flaw it was entirely optimized toward controlling any and all threats from inside itselffrom riots to political intrigueto civil warbut was pathetically unprepared for outside disrupting influences such as these storms within the empire itself with transportation reduced to the primitive level of horse and cart matters were degenerating much faster than he could prop them up food was the most critical item usually imported into the cities all winter long from the estates that supplied it foodstuffs were running short as even imperial storehouses were emptied food was getting into the cities brought by individual farmers or carters a sledgeload at a time but there were not only distances to consider but the dreadful winter storms as well prices for perishable items were trebling weekly with the cost of staples following suit though more slowly since he had ordered imperial stockpiles to be put on the market to stabilize prices in some cities food riots had already broken out and he had ordered the imperial troops to move in to quell the unrest by whatever means necessary at least on the estates which were used to supporting themselves there was plenty of food in storage and most nobles had their own personal forces to maintain order there would be more cooperation than competition among their dependents and underlings if a lord or lady was a wise governor of his or her property if not well they would get what was coming to them there had already been extensive rioting in those cities where major public aqueducts maintained by magic had collapsed leaving the entire city with no source of fresh water he had been able to repress news of those riots but he was not certain just how long he would be able to repress news of food riots if they became widespread somehow when news was bad it always managed to spread no matter how difficult the circumstances it was not the weight of the wolf crown pressing down on his brow that made his head ache it was the weight of the misfortune why am i the emperor upon whom all this is visited why could it not have waited for my successor one bizarre effect of these disasters on the citizens of the empireas if there were not enough bizarre effects alreadywas that strange religious cults were springing up all over what was left of the empire it seemed as if every city had its own pet prophet most of them predicting the end of the worldor at least of the world as the citizens of the empire had known it every cult had its own peculiar rites and proposed every possible variation on human behavior as the only means of salvation some preached complete asceticism some complete license some advocated a single deity some attributed spirits to every object and natural phenomena living or not some sent the most devoted out to sacrifice themselves to marauding monsters in the hopes of appeasing whatever had sent those monstersbut of course nothing was ever appeased but the appetite of the particular monster and that was only a temporary condition needless to say those cults did not long survive for either their followers grew quickly disillusioned and abandoned their leaders or they grew quickly angry and fed their leaders to those same monsters the cults neither worried nor really concerned charliss even though many of them had recruited untaught or illtaught mages and were raising impressive though shortlived power he left it to his own corps of mages to deal with that power or drain it he left the daytoday emergencies in the hands of his underlings mostly from the military he had more personal concerns most of his attention these days was taken up with his own wellbeing even his own survival both of which were in great jeopardy he had depended on reliable and consistent magic to maintain those spells keeping him alive and healthy after two centuries of life and magic was neither reliable nor consistent anymore he could die before he was ready and he had come chillingly close to it more than once that above all was something he wanted no one to learn many of his courtiers were mages and he wondered how tempting it would be for one of them to take advantage of his precarious situation he was under no illusions about the ultimate loyalty of his courtiers he had once been one of them and like them his ultimate loyalty had been only to himself there were two sorts of folk out there in the great hall now those who were still here because they were fools and those who were still here because they saw opportunities the latter were drastically more dangerous than the former and he never forgot that he had been able to keep his own existence from being eroded by keeping the heaviest of shields upon himself but he required an increasing number of lesser mages to do that and he lost more ground every time another wave of storms passed not even his corps of mages knew just how delicately his life was hanging in the balance at the moment he had managed to keep the fact that there was even the slightest thing wrong with him a secret his courtiers did not seem to notice any difference in his appearance but it was only a matter of time before some sharpeyed individualor one with a good network of informantslearned that all was not well with the emperor by assembling all of the small hints into one concise answer the moment that happened the panic in the cities would be replicated in miniature in the court unless charliss could quickly exert total control over every courtier here how could he do that when every spare iota of time and energy was spent bolstering his failing reserves he felt events slipping like sand between his fingers and his very helplessness raised a rage in him that was as powerful as it was futile my empire is disintegrating beneath me soon i may not have an empire i may consider myself fortunate to still retain a kingdomor a cityor my life but he did not despair despair was an emotion for weaklings and failures with no place in the heart of the one who wore the wolf crown anger a cold fire in his belly rose in him until he felt he had to find a direction for it or burn away the realization of how his anger should be channeled rolled in and struck like a thunderbolt in his mind he knew precisely where to place the blame for this situation and his anger pointed like a poisoned arrow into the west and the home of his enemy valdemar there could be only one source for his troubles for the magestorms and all they had wrought nothing like this had ever happened before he sent tremane to finish taking hardorn and consider taking the kingdom of valdemar which lay beyond hardorn valdemar did not have magic as the empire knew it and yet they had defended themselves successfully against all of ancars magical attacks the rulers of valdemar had prevented his own agents from penetrating its borders for decades with great success only a handful had obtained any intelligence only three informants had ever gotten into the court itself two of the three had not been mages which had seriously hampered their effectiveness and the third had been forced to forgo magic while she remained within the borders which had the same effect valdemar had allied itself with foreigners as weird as any of the monsters currently springing up everywherewith the grim shinain and the alien hawkbrothers with the monotheistic fanatics of karse valdemar would be the only power to have come up with so completely unpredictable a weapon the fact thatat least at last reportvaldemar and her allies were not suffering the effects of the storms only confirmed his revelation surely only the people who had sent out such an encompassing weapon would know how to defend against it affecting them as well besides valdemar had murdered his agents and envoys that he had personal proof of for they had fallen through the portal from hardorn with daggers bearing the royal seal on the pommelnuts his advisers differed in their opinions on whether or not this had represented a deliberate provocation an act of war or simply a challenge but there was no difference of opinion on whose hand had done the deed it had to be someone actually in the royal household either the heir or the personal agent of the queen not just any provocateur or herald tremane parked on the very doorstep of valdemar had agreed with that assessment but the measures that he had taken to disrupt the alliance had gone seriously amiss or had they it could be that he had never taken those measures at all that he had concocted the story of his tame assassin out of whole cloth had he been planning to defect to the valdemaran alliance all along in the hope that they would give him a kingdom when he saw that he could not win the war with the hardornen rebels that would make very good sense considering that charliss had made the promise of the position of imperial heir contingent on whether or not tremane won hardornthe whole of hardornfor the empire given the choice between coming home in disgracebarely retaining his own duchyand winning himself a kingdom it could have been an easy decision all this was speculation of course but charliss did have certain facts to guide him without question tremane had revolted looting an imperial supply depot declaring to his men that the empire had deserted them and making common cause with the hardornens he had been sent to subdue chances were that the valdemarans had persuaded him perhaps had even given him the idea to revolt in the first place tremane had been the best choice charliss had from among those to whom he had offered the opportunity to earn the heirs coronet tremane was no fool but nothing in his makeup had given charliss the impression that he could be induced to revolt he was intelligent but not particularly imaginative yet one agent who had made his way across country against impossible odds had painted a very clear picture of grand duke tremanes traitorous words and deeds that betrayal was as bitter as any experience in charliss long life and reign and it would not go unpunished it was a pity that tremane had left no potential hostage in the form of a wife or child at court and that his estate was so far away on the borders of the empire that reaching it to despoil it was about as practical as going after tremane himself of course charliss could and would assign it to someone else but that was an empty gesture and both he and the recipient would be well aware of that no one would be able to get there until late spring at best and if the empire continued to fall apart they might as well not try still a gesture would have to be made hollow or not these people below him fools though they were would have to be shown once again that he was the emperor and he was not to be trifled with he signaled to his majordomo who rapped his staff three times on the marble of the floor to gain the courts attention nothing disturbed the icy tranquillity of the majordomos demeanor men had been cut down by the imperial guards at his very feet and he had not turned a hair arrayed in a splendor of purple velvet and gold bullion embroidery and bearing the wolfheaded imperial staff which stood taller than he was no magemade homunculus or clockwork manikin could have been more controlled than he so completely did his office subsume him that charliss did not even know his name silence fell immediately with the first rap so that the next two echoed down the hall with the impact of death himself rapping on a door all eyes turned at once to the iron throne and charliss stood up to face them all his heavy robes dragging at his shoulders he braced his calves against the throne grateful for the invisible support he could have had the majordomo make the announcements but that would lessen the impact and it might give the impression that he was no longer vigorous he could not have that especially not now he must appear to be as powerful now as the day he took the throne his voice echoed portentously out over the crowd of courtiers amplified and rendered more imposing by clever acoustical design around the dais intelligence has reached our ears that gravely grieves and angers us he said sternly into the silence we have received news from an unimpeachable source that tremane grand duke of lynnai has turned traitor to the empire to his vows and to us the gasps of surprise that rippled through the court were not feigned and only confirmed charliss impression that those courtiers still remaining were for the most part not among his brightest and best he scanned for a few particular faces men and a few women who were numbered among his advisersand there was no surprise or shock registering there good its agreeable to know that i havent chosen any complete idiots there can be no doubt of his intent or his thoughts charliss continued as the gasps and murmurs died down again he has orchestrated the looting of an imperial storage depot for his own profit including the contents of the exchequer there monies intended to pay the faithful soldiers of the empire their just and wellearned stipends he cast a glance at the stiff figures lining the walls ah my own guards are looking black at that one good word will spread through the rest of the army and may the hundred little gods help him if he shows his face where a single imperial soldier can find him of all the truths in the empire guaranteed to preserve life limb and prosperity this was the truest pay the army pay it well and pay it on time charliss permitted a touch of his anger to show on his face and in his voice he has declared his allegiance to the empire at an end and has subverted his troops entrusted to him to renounce their oaths as well he has broken off hostilities with the rebels of hardorn has entered into unlawful and traitorous alliance with them and is acting in all ways to have set himself up as king of that benighted land shaking heads and avid looks told him that every one of the power seekers still gathered here was hoping for profit from tremanes downfall well in the void left when a great tree fell little trees could climb to reach the sun even in these strange days that might still come to pass now however was the time to alert these idiots to their danger worst of all he has entered into alliance with the vile and duplicitous monarch of valdemar which nation has sent unprovoked assaults by magic lately against this our peaceful empire he paused for a breath steadying himself against the throne under cover of his robes that last was only supposition but even those with intelligence networks the nearequal of his could not be certain of that and really would not care tremane had no friends here those who had been nominally his allies would be scrambling for new men to attach themselves and their fortunes to and proving that the current misfortunes had a recognizable origin might consolidate some of these idiots into a cohesive whole there was nothing quite like a common enemy to make a force out of disparate and bickering parties now to show them that the old lion had teeth he put on his most dreadful look the one that left even hardened guards with trembling hands and quaking knees and made his next words thunder out like the pronouncement of some barbarian god we therefore declare tremane of lynnai a traitor his title and lands forfeit and his name anathema we pronounce upon him the sentence of death to be executed by any that have the means and opportunity let no loyal citizen of the empire aid him on pain of that same sentence let his name be stricken from the rolls of his family and let the house of lynnai die with his father let his name be chiseled from monuments of battle be erased from the records of the empire and let it be as if he never was born that was the harshest sentence possible to pronounce within the empire and no few faces below him turned pale for most of these people this erasure was worse than a sentence of execution for it extended tremanes punishment into the hereafter if and when tremane did die he would have no immortality for without some record on earth of who and what he had been his soul would vanish at the moment of his death or would wander aimlessly in the cheerless empty limbo between earth and the afterlife without any knowledge of who it had once been or so it was believed when a citizen of the empire believed anything he believed in the immortality of records when he worshiped anything he always included his ancestors to remove someone from his rightful place among his ancestors was to remove a piece of the very cosmos charliss smiled grimly now they know i havent gone soft just because i was prepared to name a possible heir he allowed his expression to soften we know that this has come as a great shock to all our loyal subjects the more especially as the nameless one had been put forth as the potential heir to the imperial crown such a betrayal harms you as well as us by threatening the security of the empire we would not see our children distressed by the taint of betrayal mingled with uncertainty therefore we now do name our successor and bestow on him all those lands goods and titles that were once the property of the nameless one the looks of greed and avidity were backthough only briefly and quickly controlled at this moment no one knew who charliss was going to name least of all the recipient once tremane had been designated charliss had taken pains to show no partiality to anyone else he had wanted to give tremane as fair a playing field as possible in a court as filled with intrigue as this one and besides by not showing favor to any one person he had virtually opened up the fieldif tremane failed to conquer hardornto anyone the scrambling and jockeying had been most amusing when hed had the leisure to take note of it every one of his advisers had the potential to be named heir as far as anyone knew and several of his mages as well those who thought themselves in the running were moving up through the crowd almost without realizing that they were doing so attempting to place themselves nearer the throne where he could see them better but his thoughts were wandering the suspense was about to send one or two out there into a fit of apoplexy he had to end the suspense although there would be several who were shocked or affronted at his choice nevertheless melles had been his second choice before he sent tremane off to conquer hardorn and melles had remained in that position all along we therefore do name as successor and heir the most worthy and knowledgeable adviser and most loyal servant of the empire court baron melles he had just named tremanes most fervent and implacable enemy and if anyone was going to put in the astounding effort it would take merely to attempt to execute the imperial death sentence on tremane it would be melles there was real hatred between the two of them a hatred more powerful than charliss had witnessed in a very long time there was not much room for hatred in the imperial court it was better to keep emotions superficial for todays enemy might be tomorrows ally melles had been standing just to one side of the dais visible but unobtrusive as was his normal habit he was a slightly betterlooking version of tremane in some ways thinner and not as muscular with none of the physical attributes of a fighter he was not balding his hair was darker and he was two or three years tremanes junior otherwise though they could have been cut from the same cloth and sewn by the same tailor both of them had cultivated the art of being ignored and overlooked though charliss suspected that their motives for this differed greatly he knew what melles motives were now in retrospect he could guess at tremanes melles was not a hereditary noble like tremane he was a court baron a man with a title but no lands as his father had been before him melles wealth came from trade as did the wealth of most of the court nobles although the commodity that melles bought and sold was quite unlike that of his livestockbrokering father it was no secret that an ambitious tradesman with enough ready cash could buy a court title for himself and with further applications of his wealth could arrange for the title to be inherited by his son there was no shame in thisthough many of the court nobles were extraordinarily touchy about their titles and many of the landed gentry made no secret of the fact that they considered the court nobles to be purest upstarts there was some friction between the two factions although it was quite astonishing how quickly that friction vanished when a family with title but no fortune was presented with the heir or heiress to a fortune with no title as a matrimonial prospect was that how the enmity had begun between tremane and melles had tremane or tremanes father snubbed melles or melles father it seemed unlikely that such hatred could spring from so trifling a cause oddly enough charliss could not imagine tremane being rude to anyone not even to someone he held in contempt tremane had always been too clever to make such enemies casually well it didnt really matter now whatever the cause it served the emperors ends barronnow grand dukemelles moved forward out of the knot of courtiers at the very foot of the steps leading to the dais he stood alone for a moment then walked with solemn deliberation up the three steps permitted to one of his new title bowing his head and going to his knee at the fourth charliss motioned to the guard at his right to bring up the coronet of the heir from the niche at the side of the dais where it had resided since charliss himself had resigned it to put on the wolf crown although the acts of this ceremony appeared spontaneous it was anything but it was another dance the steps dictated by the custom of ages past every move choreographed centuries ago only the participants in the dance changed never the steps themselves even the guard who brought the coronet to melles had rehearsed just this action a thousand times even though there was no telling which guard would be directed to retrieve the circlet nor who it would be given to it was simply a part of an imperial guards duty rehearsed along with every other part the guard performed flawlessly handing the circlet to melles who in accordance with tradition solemnly crowned himself just as he would crown himself with the wolf crown when charliss died power and authority in the empire came from within the man and were not bestowed by the hands of priests and in token of that every emperor and heir bestowed the trappings of power upon himself once crownednot that the coronet was all that imposing just an iron circlet in the shape of a sword with a topaz matching those in the wolf crown set as the pommelnutmelles stood up and bowed to his emperor charliss surveyed him with satisfaction thinking that he probably should have chosen melles in the first place unlike tremane melles was a powerful adept who could with a few decades of practice be charliss equal in magic given that and despite current conditions it was just barely possible that melles would contrive to bring back tremanes head charliss mentally resolved to resign on the spot if melles managed to pull that one off not that he considered it likely but such diligence would deserve a reward and there wasnt much else charliss would be able to give him and if he can do that hell be strong enough to take the wolf crown from me it would be better to resign it with grace and concentrate on keeping myself alive no matter how powerfully his enemies among the courtiers would gladly have plunged daggers into melles heart at that moment not one of them would betray himself go and take your welldeserved congratulations from our court charliss directed with cool approval we will discuss your new duties and privileges later melles bowed and backed down the steps there was no throne for the heir nor any special place for him at court ceremonies emperors of the past had not deemed it necessary or advisable to give their heirs too much power or the appearance of it lest they acquire an addiction to it and crave more as melles turned at the foot of the steps to face those thronging to greet him charliss decided that the emperors of the past had been very wise melles could certainly be one of those who would crave more than his just due charliss decided to keep him on a short leash as he watched the dance of power begin swirling about this new center one tremane was enough after all melles had often thought of late that there had been so many upheavals that there was nothing that could evoke the feeling of surprise in him anymore and although his intelligence network was extraordinaryin fact it had been one of his spies who had brought word of tremanes defection back to crag castlehe really had not expected to be named charliss heir according to his own calculations he wasnt the logical candidate even though there were personal considerations involved since the onset of the magestorms and the consequent disasters spread over the entire empire it had seemed to him that the emperor would have to name someone who had absolutely no enemies at court whatsoever whoever came after charliss would have to cope with a muchreduced empire revolt everywhere a possibly hostile army he would have to somehow convince the worst of enemies to act together and forge alliances until the empire was stable again melles had far too many enemies who would rather die than work with him in any way tremane was not the only one nor was he even the most deadly melles was a man who made enemies far more easily than allies on the whole he preferred enemies for it was much easier to manipulate them than allies and there was never the risk of disillusion when they realized they had been manipulated friends were quite out of the question a friend was a potential hole in ones armor and he had not permitted himself such a weakness since he became a man then there was the matter of his position and duties under charliss which did not endear him to anyone he could not think of a single person who liked him in the entire court many feared him some admired him grudgingly others tolerated him as a necessary evil but no one liked him but there they all were flocking to fawn on him as if they couldnt wait to become his best friend some of them in fact might very well have plans in that direction foolish as such plans might be he was after all surrounded by fools they wouldnt be here now if they werent he smiled and accepted their congratulations with an expression that suggested that he would be eager to become their best friend why not even fools had their uses and just like the emperor who had bestowed his new title he had never been the kind who threw away a potential tool the men thronged about him first jostling one another in their eagerness to say something that he might remember later reminding him of past favors they had done for him offering favors for the future it was quite astonishing the sort of things they considered to be favors he could not for a moment imagine why anyone could think that invitations to incredibly boring social gatherings featuring meaningless entertainments would ever be sought after and the women they were worse than the men if they were unmarried they were pressing about him with looks and poses that were just short of open invitations to do as he pleased with them if they were anything other than blissfully happily married and there were damned few of those at court especially now they were behaving the same if they had daughters of anything resembling marriageable ageand plenty of these women had very liberal ideas about what constituted marriageable agethey were alluding to their daughters admiration of him and dangling invitations on their behalf as if any of them had the faintest notion who i am or what i look like no that was unfair not all of these people were here because they were blind idiots who wouldnt have their season spoiled by a few petty disasters some were here because they couldnt get back to their estates others because of their positions as imperial advisers and some because they had no estates there were young girlsand not so young girlswho knew very well who he was and what he looked like as they knew the identities properties and titles of every unwedded man expected to be at court this season that was part of their duty as they and their parents went about the serious business of husband hunting he might not have been very high on their list of desirable matches until now but they knew who he was and if he made an appearance at a private party a musical evening or other entertainment each of them would proceed with grim determination to try to convince him that nothing would make him happier than to take her as his lawfully wedded soontobeempress that no less than an hour ago most if not all of these maidens would have cheerfully confessed that the idea of wedding him made them ill was of no consequence now look how these same women throw themselves at charliss the old mummy it isnt his handsome face that makes them act like shameless cows in season around him furthermore melles was well aware that if he had evidenced any preference for young men he would still be under siege from these women and their parents after all he would still be expected to try to produce an heir of his body the fact that only about half of the emperors of the past had been the physical offspring of their predecessor didnt matter he would still be expected to try and if some of what ive read in the private archives is true some of them went to some fascinating extremes in trying well that didnt matter either he wasnt a lover of men or boys and not of little girls either but he would wait until he wore the iron crown himself before he took a wife and when he did his first choice would be an orphan with no living family left whatsoever just for spite yes of course he murmured to one of the womenafter being certain that he was not agreeing to anything of importance it would be a grand joke on all of them if he selected his bride from among the common citizens it would certainly be easy to find an attractive orphan there he whispered an aside to one of the other advisers a man who had been a disinterested ally in the past this is all going to my head there will be time to think about women later now is the time to concentrate on consolidating my base of power and determining what can best be done to get the empire through this crisis pleasures of all sorts would have to wait until the empire was stable perhaps sometime in the future there might even be an opportunity to execute the emperors sentence of death on tremane but that time was not now and he would wait for it to come to him hatred was an emotion that brought him a great deal of energy and entertainment and he enjoyed it it was not for nothing that his enemies often compared him to a spider sitting in the middle of a web if there was one virtue he possessed it was patience for patience was the only virtue that eventually brought rewards now that the dance of courtiers and court was over and the business of the empire had been disposed of in council melles got his private audience with the emperor private well not precisely the emperor was never alone but no one of any pretense to wealth or rank in the empire ever really noticed servants or bodyguards unless of course that person was melles or someone like him to the emperor without a doubt they were invisible to melles they were possible spies the subject of conversation as befitting the position and duties of the new heir was the state of the empire melles was not particularly surprised to discover that charliss had less information on this subject than he did the emperor had not been concerned with the daytoday workings of his empire for decades he had been able to leave that to his underlings in melles opinion he no longer had that luxury my lord emperor melles said patiently it seems to me that you have been insufficiently acquainted with the desires and needs of the common man they compare me to a spider in its web melles thought dispassionately as he watched the old man glare at him over the expanse of a highlypolished black marble table they should see him when he is not playing his role he looks like an ancient turtle deciding whether or not to stick his nose a fraction more outside his shell inside the sheltering back and arms of the emperors thronelike chair that was precisely what charliss resembled and like the turtle melles suspected that the emperor really did want to pull himself back into his shell entirely he did not seem disposed to learn or deal with the basic changes in the empire and that fit with melles plans so what i need to do is to persuade him that not only is that a good idea for him but also that he can trust power in my hands melles already had a great deal of power he had been in charge of dealing out whatever punishments the emperor deemed necessary for many years now not quite an executioner and considerably higher in status than a mere lawkeeper when something unfortunate occurred to a member of the court and the emperor took special notice of it everyone knew whose hand had been behind seeming accidents or twists of fate melles value to the emperor lay in making certain that it was impossible to prove anything when such accidents occurred the accidents werent always supposed to be fatal or at least not fatal to the physical body sometimes ruin suited the emperor better than death whether it be the ruin of a reputation or of a fortune a ploy that melles particularly favored was to contrive romantic liaisons that were entirely disastrous it was amazing what people would do to prevent their follies from becoming widely known when that folly involved sexual favors infatuation or a combination of the two just what exactly do you mean by that the emperor asked querulously melles spread his hands wide i mean lord emperor that the common man is an extremely simple creature you are thinking of him now in terms of the mob which is a being with many arms and legs and no head and as a consequence behaves in ways no rational man can predict i am thinking of him as he is before he devolves to that mindless intractable state he tilted his head to one side that had been a much longer speech than he usually gave to the emperor and he had learned to make certain that the emperor always had openings in which to insert his own comments so what is the socalled common man when he isnt in a mob the emperor mocked melles was not about to let his own mask of serenity slip such mockery was as much a test as tremanes assignment had been and i am not likely to be lulled by the illusion that i am the emperors only executioner if he perceives me as a failure i will not live long enough to rebel he inclined his head a little not quite a bow but enough to acknowledge his subservience even as he corrected the emperors ignorance as i said serenity he is simple what he needsdesiresthose things are just as simple first of all he wants the roof over his head to be sound and the food on his plate to be abundant he wants that food to arrive every day he wants to be left alone to pursue his work and the pleasures of his bed home and table if you give him these things he is not inclined to argue overmuch about the means required to deliver them if he is deprived of them he is likely to welcome whatever measures are taken to restore them he raised a single finger to emphasize his next point most if not all of your common citizens have been so deprived and see only a steady decline in the quality of their lives but if measures could be taken that will restore many of their comforts those things they consider so important to their lives i see your point the emperor replied with no more mockery in his voice he sat in silence only the movement of his eyes betraying his alertness he could have been a grotesque statue if not for those glittering eyes the emperor did not fidget did not visibly shift his weight in his chair or perform any of the other tiny unconscious movements of lesser beings partly it was a matter of training for such utter stillness enhanced his image of supernatural power partly or so melles suspected it was simple good sense to conserve his waning energy and resources finally the emperor spoke his voice low deep and grating you want me to give you the authority to order whatsoever you think is necessary to restore order at the level of the streets melles nodded very slowly as those powerful eyes blazing with the deadly life of a finelyhoned blade pinned him to his seat he could not dared not return that glare he was not here to challenge the emperor he was here to get the old man to share out some of his power but he also wouldnt get anywhere if he didnt admit what he wanted it was an interesting observation by one of his tutors that there were only three classes of people who could afford to speak the unvarnished truththe very bottom the very topmost and children the lowest classes could afford it because they had nothing to lose the highest because there was no one who could call them to account for it and children because they held no power and hence were no threat melles had never forgotten that observation nor did he forget the implications of it the emperor could speak pure truth melles could not when the emperor asked a direct question melles had better be careful how much of the truth he told but there was another factor here at the best of times when the emperor had been in his prime he hadnt had time enough for everything no great ruler did that was why they had underlings and delegated their authority to those they thought could be trusted with it now the emperor was old his powers waning and he had the very personal and pressing matter of preserving what was left of his life to concentrate on the real question the one melles had no answer to as yet was just how close to the end the emperor was that would tell him how reluctant charliss would be to give up power to his heir would he clutch his powers and possessions to him or release them to clutch at life itself those sharp chill eyes measured him and missed nothing in the process very well the voice was as cold as the eyes have the orders written and i will sign and seal them granting you authority over city guards militias and authorizing you to make use of the army in quelling local disturbances that will be enough to see if you have the insight into the common man that you claim a thin humorless smile stretched the emperors lips if you succeed i shall consider granting you more he waved a hand at the emperor in mute disavowal of wanting any other powers that will be sufficient my lord emperor i assure you i wish only to restore order without order these seeds of chaos will spread to engulf us all charliss only made a wheezing grunt full of cynical amusement i doubt that you intend to limit your grasp but this is all you will get for the present go to the clerks and draw up the orders that was clear dismissal and he took it as such he stood bowed with careful exactitude and walked backward until he reached the door the emperors eyes were on melles every step of the way and the slight smile on the emperors lips would have chilled the blood of a lesser man he reached behind him and opened the door without looking at it backed through it and closed it without taking his eyes off the emperor as the door closed the imperial eyes were still fixed on him still measuring still watching him for a hint of insubordination as the door shut with a decisive click melles let out his breath slowly that went better than i had any reason to hope hes still sane if he stays that way i can handle him he turned and stalked silently down the cold gray marble hallway with its high ceilings and austere decorations of captured weaponry from ages and wars long past like the room he had just left the hallway was chilly enough to make him wish he had worn heavier clothing ostensibly it was due to a failure in the enchantments of heating but in fact it was deliberate to discourage loitering the hallway was meant to impress one who walked it with his own insignificance and its acoustics underscored the message well here so near to the highest seats of imperial government the audience chamber the council chamber and the great court hall one necessary adjunct to so much power was a highlytrained cadre of imperial clerks to make decisions into orders nothing could function without written orders articles commands and doctrine no matter how seemingly small had no official life until they were quantified as documents these pieces of paper were so vital to the working of the empire they were like water food or air to a soldier and an official document would carry more power in its words than any courtier posturing and spouting similar verbiage and of course there was such a group of vital clerks a small army of them ensconced in the one comfortable chamber on this floor between the court hall and the council chamber an efficient empire was one dependent on though not run by clerks though they might not know it their masters did and always had and took care to ensure the comfort of these allimportant workers in the hive of imperial rule large windows screened against insects let in cooling breezes during the heat of summer and although the heatingspells had failed elsewhere in crag castlelegitimatelymeasures had always been in place in case of such a failure in the clerks chamber there were three great fireplaces on the wall shared with the council chamber and two more on the one shared by the court hall all of them burning merrily charcoal footwarmers sat under desks and those allimportant fingers kept warm and supple with metal handwarmers on each desk each clerk had his own oil lamp to read and write by and there were pages assigned to this room only to bring food and drink whenever called for somealways among the new nobility who were not yet acquainted with the way things workedgrumbled at this treatment of mere clerks what they were not aware of was that these clerks werent mere anything and most of them were higher in rank than the grumblers here the offspring of the noblest families in the empire paid their service even those intended eventually for the army they were accustomed to preferential and comfortable treatment but that did not mean they did not earn it by their labors there was never an hour when there were not at least six clerks on duty here and there were twenty between dawn and dusk only the most skilled and most discreet served here and their ability to remain closemouthed about what passed over their desks was legendary to open the heavilyguarded door and enter this haven of heat and light was a decided relief melles felt tight muscles relaxing under the influence of the gentle warmth it was still early enough in the day that all twenty clerks were in attendance melles scanned the rows of desks and went straight to the first unoccupied clerk he saw the young man he chose sat like all the rest at a large wooden desk with everything he required arranged neatly on top of it a stack of rough draft paper a smaller stack of imperial vellum inkpots containing red and black ink blotting paper blotting sand glass pens and his handwarmer were all arranged in a pattern he found personally the most efficient off to one side was the book he had been reading which he had immediately laid aside when melles neared him the only sign of individuality was a small eggshaped carving of white jade in a motif of entwining fish the clerk himself was nondescript unmemorable as all of them were they were taught how to be forgettable and selfeffacing before they came to this duty here they were a pair of hands and a brain full of specific skills interchangeable with every other clerk in the room melles alone among his acquaintances had never taken a turn in this room but that was because he had been serving empire and emperor by learning another set of skills entirely while the clerk made rapid notes he dictated the orders the clerk first made a rough copy checking it word for word with him then from the corrected rough made a final copy on imperial vellum incorporating all the changes melles was being very careful in how he phrased these orders giving himself precisely the amount of authority that the emperor had specified and no more three more clerks were summoned to make copies at this point for a total of five copies in all as yet obviously the orders were nothing more than paper when he had finished the clerk summoned a page from the group waiting and chattering on a bench beside the fire and sent him to the emperor with the finished documents the page would not walk down the corridor that melles had just left he would use a special passage between this room and the emperors chambers reserved only for the pages so that he could not be stopped and questioned or detained melles did not go with him he was prohibited from doing so nor would the emperors guards permit him to approach with documents to be signed in hand this was to prevent him from somehow coercing the emperor into signing and sealing them or being tricked into doing so before he had read them all these convoluted customs had their reasons at length the page returned and the glitter of the imperial seal on the uppermost document told melles that all had gone well the orders were approved with no changes had there been changes the page would have returned with one copy not five which would have had the emperors revisions written on it the rest one of the emperors guards would have burned on the spot so that the seal could not have been counterfeited on them melles accepted his copies with a bow of thanks and left the room the chill of the hallway struck him with a shock despite being prepared for it but he didnt hesitate for even a moment now his first priority was to get one copy of the orders into the hands of the commander of the imperial army the cooperation of the army was needed before he attempted any of his ambitious plans he had been careful to phrase his orders in such a way that the commanders authority was not being subsumed by his own the last thing he wanted was to make an antagonist out of general thayer the general made a very bad enemy one who never forgot and never forgave the orders as he had dictated them gave him the authority to coopt regimental groups or smaller depending on need but only if they were not currently deployed on some other duty if i cant quell a riot with less than a regiment i wont quell it with anything larger thats not a threat to thayer and it means i wont be countermanding any of his standing orders to the army as a whole with luck he wouldnt need to use imperial soldiers very often but luck had not been with anyone of late he already knew that he would have to disperse at least one riot in each city by giving the soldiers orders to kill it would be the first time in centuries that imperial soldiers had been used against civilians and it would come as a tremendous shock he hoped that the shock would be great enough that he would not need to repeat the lesson the loss of civilians meant loss of taxpaying workers and at this point the empire could not afford to lose much in the way of taxes the imperial commander had quarters here in crag castle as every emperor since the third had preferred to have the commander of his armies where he could keep a watchful eye on him the third emperor had originally been the imperial commander and he had not approved of the second emperors choice of heir he had taken matters into his own hands the moment that the second emperor was dead and had decided not to give his own imperial commander the kind of opportunity that he had taken advantage of the rest had followed his wise example as melles moved down various corridors and staircases he passed through narrow zones of warm air alternating with much more extensive zones of chill to positively frigid air since the denizens of crag castle were now relying on fireplaces and other primitive providers of warmth heating was unreliable and often unpredictable there would be illness in the castle before the year turned to spring illnesses of the kind more often associated with poorer folk the times are interesting and likely to become more so before the end the corridors themselves never varied in decor only in size and height they continued to be built of the same gray marble and continued to feature only captured weaponry as decoration once melles left the area of the emperors quarters and the official chambers of government the hallways he traversed became much narrower and the ceilings dropped to a normal level but that was the only way to tell that he was not within the quarters of the emperor himself the imperial commander was one of the highestranking officials in the council so his chambers were correspondingly nearer to the imperial chambers only those of the heirwhich melles servants were currently engaged in arranging to suit himwere nearer the commanders personal bodyguards stood at attention to either side of the door showing that the great man himself was inside as melles had expected melles would shortly have a pair of those guards outside of his own chambers now that he was the designated heir they were not just to protect the life of those they were assigned to they were meant as protection for the emperor the imperial guards were an elite group trained and spellbound to the service of the emperor no force on earth could turn them against charliss and if either the heir or the imperial commander proved troublesome well only the details of burial would prove troublesome once their guards were finished with them it was possible to break the spells sealing them to the emperor and it was possible that the storms themselves had already done so the only way to be sure would be to approach them on the question of eliminating the emperor and if the spells were intact that could be a fatal mistake tremane had managed to leave his pair of imperial guards behind him when he went off to command the conquest of hardorn probably because the emperor had not expected trouble from him away from crag castle perhaps if charliss had insisted that tremane take along his watchdogs things might have turned out differently or perhaps not except that the guards would have solved our problem by dispatching tremane for us and i would still be heir there would still be magestorms to contend with the empire would still be falling to pieces and all else would be following much the same paths the only change would be that they would have one less danger to worry aboutmelles knew as no one else in the court did that it was by no means certain that tremane had allied himself with valdemar in point of fact he hoped fervently that this was not the case these magestorms were bad enough random and untargeted as they seemed to be if the mages of valdemar had at their disposal an expert one who knew everything there was of any importance about the empire what would happen then what if the storms could be targeted accurately to cause the most disruption and damage if tremane really were to ally himself with valdemar that might be what they would have to deal with as for what such a revelation would do to the emperor when he was fit and not beset by so many problems he would simply have been angry gotten over it and would dismiss his anger until someone brought him tremanes head now i cannot be sure because it is possible that he like the empire is disintegrating and his sanity will crumble along with his physical body he nodded to the two guards who saluted and stepped aside for him as he displayed the imperial seal on the documents he carried he knocked once on the door then opened it and stepped inside he entered an anteroom lushly carpeted with battlebanners on all of the walls but holding only a monumental desk three comfortable chairs and a single servant dressed in a compromise between military uniform and private liverywho was obviously one of thayers secretaries i have imperial orders for the commander he told the bland individual behind the desk and if the commander has time for me i should like to discuss them with him conciliate be polite and humble it costs nothing and keeps the peace the secretary immediately rose to his feet and held out his hand for the orders i will deliver the orders to him directly high lord heir he said smoothly please take a seat i believe i can assure you that the commander will always have time to discuss matters of the empire with you for he left standing orders with me to admit you to his presence regardless of other circumstances as melles suppressed his surprise the secretary took the paper from his hand and exited quickly through the doorway behind his desk melles took a seat examining the fingernails of his right hand minutely as a cover for his thoughts he had been aware since he became a member of the council that thayer was an astute politician but he had not known how astute most of the other advisers were still scrambling to decide how to handle melles now that he was officially the heir that thayer had left standing orders with his underlings to admit melles at any and all times was an interesting development and melles wondered if it meant that the commander was prepared to cooperate with the new heir on all levels if so that would make melles tasks incalculably easier to have the commander of the imperial army in my pocket half the power of the empire will be divided between us and the rest well that can wait the secretary returned before melles needed to find some other object to examine please follow me great lord the young man said as he bowed deeply the lord commander is eager to speak with you without delay melles rose to his feet and followed the secretary into the next room of the suite this one very similar to the antechamber the commander had excellent taste he had carpeted over most of the floor with one of the rich plush rugs of the biijal tribes of the eastern islands some of the more attractive captured battlebanners hung on the walls and there was a good fire going in the fireplace like the antechamber this room held little in the way of furniture just another monumental desk several comfortable chairs and two smaller tables oil lamps served for illumination in place of the magelights that would ordinarily have been here with darkness falling these had been lit and burned brightly general thayer was waiting the imperial orders in his hand standing beside his desk rather than sitting behind it in the silent protocols of the empire he was receiving melles as an equal rather than melles arriving as a supplicant this was another good sign thayer was not going to challenge his authority at all the general could have taken his place in the ranks of his own forces though his hair was as gray as granite his body was as hard and tough as that stone the very few fools who had challenged thayer to single combat over one pretext or another had not survived the experience enemies and friends alike compared him to a wolfenemies compared him to a ravening insatiable hunter friends to the powerful pack leader gray as a wolf he was and his teeth and wits were just as keen that sharply chiseled face wore a friendly welcoming expression today however and although melles knew the general to be an astute politician he also knew that thayer was no good at all at hiding his feelings as surely as his mind was a great asset his face was a great handicap in the game of politics to counter that handicap thayer made every attempt to play the game in writing and appeared in person only when policy permitted truth the general extended his free hand toward melles with a smile as the secretary bowed himself out and melles took his hand with an answering smile by the hundred little gods i was hoping youd come to me first before any of the rest thayer grated a hiltthrust to his throat as a young man had left him with a permanently marred voice congratulations melles the emperor finally made a good choice tremane was a little too popular with his own men to make me entirely easy in my mind about him whereas i am so equally unpopular with everyone that you find me more acceptable as heir melles raised one eyebrow delicately and thayer barked a laugh lets just say that when the commander discovers that one of his generals is popular it makes him wonder why that general is cultivating popularity thayer bared his teeth in a smile as melles nodded his understanding sometimes it happens that popularity is an accident but more often than not its been deliberately sought you however i who am known as charliss executioner need not trouble himself about such trifles as popularity melles softened the comment with a wry smile i would rather have respect than popularity thayer answered that sally with a lifted brow of his own in that as in other things we are likeminded the emperor may he reign long is not the only one who needs to worry about underlings with ambition and i am glad enough to see tremane eliminated so about these ordersyour idea melles nodded carefully gauging thayers reactions before saying anything he need not have been concerned it was clear that thayer could not have been more pleased had he dictated the orders himself damned good idea come sit down so we can talk about this in detail the general waved him to one of the chairs beside the fireplace and took another tossing the orders onto the desktop but making no move to place himself behind the desk melles took his seat and the general moved his own chair nearer to that of the heir before sitting in it damned good idea he repeated declare martial law and youll have the cits up in arms and starting a revolt in the streets but bring in the army without actually calling it martial law and theyll fall in line without a whimper if you can restore order he coughed give them back their easy lives and theyll call you a god and not care how you managed it my idea is to use the smallest number of soldiers that i can to crush disturbances absolutely melles said cautiously i dont want people to begin muttering that weve called out the army on them i believe that is one thing the citizens of the empire wont tolerate if youll look at those orders youll see ive been given direct command of city guards constables and militia the way i see it if i use those forces in the front ranks and only use the army regulars to back them up and add strength to their line ill get the effect that i want without it looking as if the army is taking over good sound strategy thayer confirmed out in the provinces they expect the army to put down trouble but the cits think theyre above all that put down the first riots efficiently kill a few of the worst troublemakers and i dont think youll have any trouble reestablishing order i was hoping someone would figure out that were in for a spot of domestic trouble and would plan on dealing with it and of course he didnt dare suggest it himself charliss would see that as a direct threat to his own authority and i would have been asked to find general thayer aretirement thayer knows it too he nodded and leaned back in his chair feeling much more confident with thayer as an open ally its not common knowledge but there have already been small disturbances and i expect larger ones as food runs short and hardships build up he said easily if were readyand ruthless in suppressing the troubles to comei think the citizens will accept what we do as a necessary evil yes as weve said find a way to get them their meals and peace and the cits will accept anything short of burning down the city thayer retorted with contempt now how exactly do you want me to help you want a special regiment detached to go wherever its needed or thayer paused looking eager but a bit reluctant to put forth his own ideas well im a military man i dont have any experience in riot control but you have an idea of your own melles said leaning forward with interest please id like to hear it weve still got limited communication magetomage with all the military bases and you know theres at least one near every large city thayer told him now if i were to move a certain number of men a company say into each cityif you were to get the militias and city guards and so on organized in the way you want beforehandwell as soon as a riot started your city militia would naturally go take care of it and just as naturally the captain of the company would offer his help your militia captain would accept it and why not theyre both in military brotherhoods as it were with the backing of the army i dont see any reason why we couldnt squash any riot and technically since i doubt every hothead in every city would take it into his head to riot on the same day you wouldnt be exceeding the number of men you asked for he grinned slyly you see theyd only be under your command for the duration of the riot after that theyd come back under my authority melles allowed himself a dry chuckle general thayer was obviously a past master at the fine art of manipulating loopholes and his strategy was an application of the very orders that he had written that he himself had not considered but then i didnt have any reason to suspect that thayer would make quite such an eager ally that general is a brilliant plan quite perfect for all our purposes he replied allowing approval to creep into his voice the general smiled a smile with just as much steel in it as warmth good were agreed on it then thayer nodded decisively now in return id appreciate it if you could do something about some domestic orders for menot exactly requisitions more like assignments it all still comes under the heading of restoring domestic order ill do what i can melles had expected this trading favor for favor was the accepted way of doing business in imperial politics he wouldnt commit himself until hed heard precisely what thayer had in mind but thayer knew that already put the army in charge of all intercity transportation of supplies thayer looked him straight in the eyes as it is stuffs being moved inefficiently what gets moved is random and carters are getting fat no matter what the armys suffering because were having to pay through the nose just like the cits are conscript the carters take over the cartage guild make em subject to army discipline and well cure whats causing some of your riots in short order every dog in the empire knows whats going on and theyll be happy to see the cartage guild get whats coming to them the cits are as tired of the profiteering as i am and you and your officers will get fat on the profits instead of the cartage guild melles saw right through that one but thayer was right about several things transportation was a hitormiss matter right now and the profits that the carters were making were obscene putting the army in charge would reduce profiteering to an acceptable level and get transportation organized and there had been unrest over the profiteering at least one of the riots had destroyed a cartage guildhall and the buildings near it no there will be no weeping if i conscript the carters their beasts and their vehicles the question was could he get away with that assignment as an interpretation of the orders that charliss had just signed he unrolled one of his own copies and scanned it quickly then looked up into thayers flat brown eyes i think this particular set of commands gives me that authority he said knowing that the emperor wouldnt care so long as he could keep anyone from lodging complaints against it and since thayer was going to have pressing reasons to prevent complaints when i send out copies of the original orders ill see to it that this particular amendment is added thayer smiled with satisfaction ill have my mages get to work he promised by tomorrow night therell be companies picked by the next day ill have them moving into barracks in the cities dont worry ill send orders to select steady men veterans men who wont panic wont shoot unless theyre ordered and wont exceed their orders ill send captains who have every reason to keep peace steady men not sadists who enjoy breaking heads army efficiency he thought enviously its a beautiful thing to see working my orders will have to travel by signal and sometimes courier but theyll get to most of the empire in a fortnight he replied and stood up it will be a pleasure working with you lord commander he finished holding out his hand as the general stood up thayer took it in another firm handclasp an equal pleasure here he said and a damned sight better than working with one of the infernal groatcounters let me tell you he followed at melles elbow quite pleased to accompany his visitor to the door melles knew what he meant several of the possible candidates for heir were men less of vision than of caution few of them would have the imagination to foresee the riots he knew were bound to come much less to plan how to quell them just rememberwe want our actions to be as unobtrusive as possibleso that the citizens welcome the sight of soldiers in the streets rather than fearing it thayer opened the door to the antechamber for him nodding vigorously exactly ill draw up a set of riot orders for you you look them over and tell me what you want changed he waved melles through grevas see the lord heir out would you lord melles i cant thank you enough for coming here yourself think nothing of it i am glad that we could reach an understanding so quickly melles passed into the antechamber where the secretary received him with a deep bow of respect then hurried to open the door for him he waved his thanks at the underling and entered the cold hallway feeling as if he had done a good days work indeed now what else orders to requisition food if its necessary and it will be and orders to requisition extra beasts and vehicles from the estates placing them in the hands of the army have to specify rules about requisitions taking a farmers only cart and horse is only going to be counterproductive put one of my secretaries on it mertunhe was a farmers son that would be enough for now too many orders all at once and it would cause more unease and unrest than already existed and i need to consolidate my personal position that fortunately was mostly a matter of reinforcing his own standing orders to his special operatives those operatives would act as needed and bring him the information he required and insofar as power in the council of advisers and the court wentwell most mouths would smile and utter compliments and he would accept them action would speak the real truths and his operatives would ferret out what those same mouths said in private there was a single exception to all of that if the army could manage to keep their lines of communication open it meant that they were able to get some magics to work probably those of short duration and that may be the secret that and a great deal of power forcing the magics through i have power and i have more than one mage in my own pay i simply hadnt thought to apply great power to small goals but maybe those goals are not so small after all now he hurried down the corridor to his new quarters only a short distance from the generals and found his own imperial bodyguards waiting at the door for him they opened the door for him with great ceremony and he was greeted on the other side by his own servants who surrounded him and began fussing over him immediately with great ceremony and a little fear impatiently he waved most of them away his new quarters were fundamentally identical to his old except that the rooms were a bit larger the furnishings those that were not his personal gear more luxurious and the suite itself was situated better with regard to conveniences in the time hed spent conferring with the emperor and general thayer his servants had removed all signs of the former occupant and had made it seem as if he had always lived here his own carpets were on the floor his tapestries and maps on the walls his books in the cases and on the tables he went straight to his desk to draft the ordersor rather elaborationsthat were to be appended to the imperial orders he had with him when he had finished he handed the rough drafts to his own secretaryalong with the four copies of the imperial orders he still retained take care of theseand have mertun specify under what conditions a mans beast and vehicle are to be exempt from requisition he ordered his secretary bowed and took the papers out only then did he permit himself to relax putting himself into the care of his valet his secretary would see that three sets of the orders got into the hands of the imperial clerks for distribution and dissemination one set would remain here for use as a reference he walked into his private chambers at the direction of his valet with his own furniture here in the same positions as in his old rooms he could almost convince himself that nothing had changed almost its begun i have started the avalanche there will be no stopping it now he allowed his valet to extract him from his stiff coat of heavy embroidered satin and help him into a much more comfortable robe within a short period of time he was settled in a chair beside a fireplace with food and drink and a book on the table at his right hand he stared into the flames amused and bemused by everything that had happened today it had certainly been an eventful day and one he would remember for a long time nevertheless his day was not yet over he rang for his valet and when the man appeared murmured a certain phrase that meant his operatives were to be contacted and called in one at a time my agents will have to watch for some new things now as well as the old my mageswell if the army can accomplish communicative magics perhaps there are a few things that we can accomplish too it occurred to him that although vengeance on his old enemy tremane was probably out of the question at least he ought to be sure just exactly what tremane was up to scrying was another magic of limited scope and duration and it was just possible that enough could be learned by means of scrying to warn him if tremane was actually a danger to the empire he settled back sipped hot spiced wine thoughtfully and waited for the first of his spies to appear no much as he would like to he could not dispose of that annoying tremanebut he could not ignore the man either and in the kind of war he waged the best and most reliable weapon was knowledge it was time to wield that particular weapon and with more finesse and care than he had ever exercised before four the cavernous interior of urthos tower was remarkably quiet with the gryphons gone andesha hadnt quite realized until now how much sound the gryphons producedlike the constant click of talons on stone the windlike bellowssound of their breathing and the rustle of feathers hed gotten used to those whispers of sound and without them his own voice seemed unnaturally loud despite the sussuration of other activity look here its really quite logical andesha said with one finger under the line of charactersthe same words written in three different languages karal peered at them his forehead creasing with concentration this is the hawkbrother this is the shinain and you can see how similar a muffled thud interrupted him followed by the sound of alarmed and complaining voices startled he looked up past karal and into the central room of the tower he knew those voices although he had not expected to hear them today he got up and moved to the doorway just to see if he was somehow mistaken he wasnt the aged imperial mage sejanes in his robes of oddly military cut was a strange contrast to master artificer levy in his practical yet luxurious black silk and leather both of them however looked pale and ill and much the worse for their travel walking ahead of them was altra by the hundred little gods said sejanes every hair on his gray head standing straight out if i never have to travel this way again it will be too soon master levy swallowed looking to andesha as if he were fighting to keep his stomach from revolting his face had a greenish tint and the knuckles of his clenched fists were white i quite agree with you sejanes he said in a strangled voice i believe that given the option i will walk home altra looked at both of them with unconcealed contempt stalking off into karals side room to bonelessly flop down onto the foot of karals pallet andesha followed him andesha didnt hear the firecat say anything but karal pulled his mostlyuntouched bowl of stew over to the cat who gratefully inhaled it as if he hadnt eaten in weeks meanwhile firesong loisha silverfox and two of the shinain hurried over to greet the aged mage and younger master artificer there wasnt much in the way of furniture here but silverfox brought both of them folding stools to sit on and they sagged down onto that support with evident gratitude andesha didnt blame either of the newcomers for their reactions he knew from personal experience that they were not exaggerating their exhaustion and illness andesha had traveled once in the care of altra the firecat in the creatures bizarre distancedevouring method of transportation called jumping and he would not particularly care to experience it again the firecats were somehow able to cross great distances in the blink of an eye and could take with them whatever or whoever was touching them the experience was a gutwrenching one similar to a gatecrossing but repeated over and over with each jump the closer together the jumps were the worse the effect was the amount of cumulative effect varied with each person but from the look of these two altra hadnt paused much between jumps and this latest journey had been quite a rough ride for them andesha watched for a moment but firesong silverfox and the rest seemed to have the situation well in hand sejanes clearly needed to go lie down and master levy to sit down and have something to settle his stomach after a brief rest both of them were taken into the vacant side chamber that had earlier served as the gryphons nest karal meanwhile was fussing over altra who for the first time in andeshas experience was looking rather shopworn evidently the trip hadnt been easy on him either he remembered what altra had said about the fact that even jumping had become much more difficult are you feeling all right he asked the cat as karal hovered over him anxiously i have felt better the firecat replied dryly but i believe that with a short rest and food i shall be fine the currents in the energyfields are vicious it has become very dangerous to jump even a tenth of my usual distances i do think that from here on in i too would prefer to walk where i need to go given the choice the clacking of hooves on the floor signaled the arrival of the companion florian oh dont be ridiculous altra the companion said mockingly of course you wont have to walk youll convince one of us to carry you altra ignored him pretending to concentrate on the vital task of licking the bowl clean that didnt take too long and as soon as the last hint of gravy was gone he curled up in such a way that he wouldnt be in the way of karals feet if the young karsite needed to rest im going to sleep now the firecat said with great dignity and he closed his eyes firmly still ignoring florians jibe florian made a whickering sound that was so like a chuckle that there was no doubt in andeshas mind what the companion was thinking oh leave him alone florian he told the companion at least for now you cant deny that he has done more than his share for some time to come if gating is dangerous how could jumping be less than hazardous true enough florian replied equitably you are correct andesha and i am at fault here altra has served heroically and i should not have teased him especially not when he is as exhausted as his passengers i beg your pardon cat and i grant it horse came from the seeminglysleeping firecat florian stepped over and touched his nose to the firecats fur in a conciliatory gesture then backed off to the chamber entrance he stood with one eye cast toward the main chamber and the other watching over altra and his friends before finally quietly clopping off well we have everyone we need andesha said to karal except perhaps that kaledain scholar we have been promised we can certainly resume investigating the other devices we found i keep thinking that there are more rooms and chambers we havent found yet karal replied lying back down on his pallet taking care to not to disturb altra there probably are andesha told him weve found signs of at least four more places where there might be storage chambers or even a passage to a lower level the problem is that we havent been able to get them open perhaps sejanes or master levy will be able to help there he smiled at his friend to tell you the truth i suspect it will be master levy i have the feeling that the tricks to getting these hatches open are purely mechanical karal smiled back i think you may be right that would fit well enough with what treyvan was able to tell me about the mage of silence it would be like him to put a mechanical catch in a place of magic knowing that anyone who came here intending mischief would probably be expecting magic and not be prepared for mechanics andesha chuckled and that would certainly put firesongs nose out of joint poor firesong at every turn it seems as if his great powers as an adept are less and less important karal nodded and rubbed the back of his neck in thought it must be awfully difficult for him to face each day just look at what has happened he went from being the brightest star in the skies to finding his powers unreliable and lessened with new methods to do what he used to do coming up every day some of them are even contradictory to what he has known as fact all his life andesha frowned and nodded sometimes i feel like i cheated him out of his glory by being who and what i am but i know that none of us dictated or could have predicted the way things would unfold i owe him my life by the stareyeds grace and i am grateful to him but i wish that he could feel the happiness now that he used to enjoy in the vales and as for things being contradictoryyouve been experiencing much of that yourself spiritually so have we all i think he paused fingers tented as he carefully considered his next words stillmaster levy says that all things in our world no matter how illogical they may seem are still consistent under unseen laws the spirits i have spoken with on the moonpaths have implied much the samethat magic in all its forms works under those laws as surely as rain wind and beasts do perhaps firesong and all of us are learning new aspects of the laws we have been subject to all our lives with master levy here to confound us all with his teachings on universal laws youll need me for a secretary again karal said as he smoothed down his warm robes brightening considerably ill be glad to be useful again andesha nodded with sympathy he knew how idleness even enforced had fretted his friend and he would also be glad to see karal feeling as if he were contributing his share realistically karal was not able to help at all with bruteforce physical tasks but the role of secretary was perfect for him he would have said something but he noticed that karal seemed very tired and it occurred to him that the two of them had been working quite steadily on comparing shinain tayledras and kaledain writing ever since breakfast mental work could be just as exhausting as physical labor even for those like karal who had a knack for it why dont you look after altra for a while he said cleverly using the firecat as an excuse to get karal to rest ill go see if our hosts want to know anything about sejanes and master levy karal nodded and caressed altra with one hand while he closed his eyes andesha collected the empty stew bowl and made a mental note to get something more suited to altras tastes from the shinain he left karal beginning to doze altra already asleep and florian watching over them both and went out into the main chamber in the center of the tower master levy already recovered was examining the floor of that chamber on his hands and knees he looked up as andesha entered has anyone looked at the floor here he asked we looked but we didnt see anything the shinain replied why have you found something perhaps master levy got to his feet when i was still studying i used to earn spending money by designing and helping to build hidden doors and chambers for wealthy or eccentric clients i think there might be something here huh andesha looked closely at the floor and had to shake his head ill take your word for it do you think you can get it openif there is anything there perhaps master levy repeated ill have to examine it later when im not exhausted this is all sheer nervous energy you see plus a rather stupid wish to seem in better physical shape than old sejanes and its all about to run out im going to get a bowl of that stew i smell and then i am going to sleep for a day andesha laughed as master levy shrugged ruefully and with selfdeprecation as the master artificer drifted in the direction of their little charcoal stove and the bubbling stewpot atop it he started back toward karal but halfway there he turned a little surprised as a soft voice hailed him it was one of the few blackclad kalenedral and with him was another wearing dark blue the one in black he knew terhala an old man whose bloodfeud would technically never be completed because the one who murdered his oathbrother had been mornelithe falconsbane it was doubly ironic that andesha and terhala had become friends over the past few days terhala knew who and what he had been of course andesha understandably nervous had asked him why he continued to wear black terhala had laughed and said that he was used to the color and too old to change terhala andesha greeted him who is your friend the kalenedral sketched a salute of greeting this is chesera young friend he wished to meet you andesha bowed slightly i am always honored to meet one of the servants of the wise one he said politely though he could not for the life of him imagine what had brought so many of the reclusive scrollswornas he called them to distinguish them from the true swordswornout of katashinain and their stronghold there we are all truly grateful for the hospitality and tolerance you have shown to us i wonder if the reason is that weve just added two more meddlers to the group and one of them is a mage from a completely unknown land he thought though he kept his thoughts to himself not that i blame them were the interlopers here the stareyed gave them the keeping of this tower and its secrets not us chesera returned his bow i am pleased to meet you andesha he replied his voice so carefully neutral that andesha could not read any second meaning into the words it is not often that one of the plains who goes to become a mage ever returns again it is not often that the shamans permit him to return andesha replied as calmly and carefully as he could although he could in no way match the lack of inflection in cheseras voice until only recently mages have been forbidden the plains even those of the people well and you can certainly see why chesera countered immediately gesturing at the tower remains about them this would all have been a great temptation can you say had you become a mage of the taleedras that you would not have been tempted to try to use one of these weapons against the one they called falconsbane andesha shuddered he still had far too many of falconsbanes memories of the life he had led using andeshas body for comfortand behind those memories marched others a seemingly endless parade of atrocities stretching back into a dim past as ancient as this tower i would he admitted slowly i would have been tempted by anything that might have brought the monster down anything that would have saved others from the horror he wrought chesera shrugged and yet it took how many of you working together to simply use the energy of one of these weapons rather than the weapon itself and yet you permit us here now andesha allowed one eyebrow to rise we do and that is in part why i wished to speak with you chesera told him may we speak privately you and i for a little while shinain to shinain now andesha was considerably more surprised and not at all certain what chesera had in mind this was the first time in his reckoning that any of the shinain here had addressed him in such a fashion most seemed uncomfortable with the concept of a shinain who was also a mage and some seemed of the personal opinion that his halfforeign blood made him more alien than shinain certainly if that is what you wish he nodded toward the sleeping chamber my friend karal is asleep in there he will not hear us and if we speak quietly we will not disturb him i fear that is the most privacy i can offer as it is in somewhat short supply here despite the vastness of the place chesera nodded that will do he said and gestured to andesha to lead him onward andesha did so walking with great care past karal and altra although neither stirred nor in fact gave any indication that they were alive except for their steady breathing at the moment he was suffering from mixed feelings he was both curious and apprehensive to hear what chesera wanted to say that required privacy he gestured at his own pallet waiting until chesera took a seat at the foot before seating himself so he said wondering what he was letting himself in for what is it you wish of me sworn one when chesera left him at last he sat back against the gentlycurving stone wall and simply thought of nothing for a while he felt as if chesera had taken his mind had turned it upsidedown and shaken it examined it poked and prodded it turned it inside out and then when he was finished put it all neatly back in place with the ends tucked in he had probably been the most skillful interrogator that andesha or any of falconsbanes many incarnations had ever encountered you know i suspect that at this point he could predict my reaction to virtually any situation and do so with more accuracy than i could although his questions had covered virtually every subject chesera seemed particularly interested in the avatars that was the one thing that hadnt surprised him since virtually all of the sworn had wanted to know about dawnfire and trevalen sooner or later some of them here had actually been present when dawnfire trapped in the body of her bondbird had been transformed into an avatar in the first place it had occurred to andesha that as far as he was concerned such a transformation was a poor substitute for returning dawnfire to her proper human form but then again perhaps that had not been possible granted the stareyed had been able to undo most of the changes falconsbane had run on andeshas own body but that was in the nature of restoring something to its rightful state not changing it into something else altogether perhaps all that she would have been able to manage would have been transformation into a tervardi one of the birdpeople and that might have been a truly cruel reward for her since the tervardi are frail and not very humanlike at least this way she is still fundamentally herself and she is anything but frail he also sensed that there were other complications to the story that no one had told him about and there was of course the factor that dawnfire had been mourned for dead and her human body buried when the bond to it was snapped by falconsbane it didnt necessarily do for a deity to resurrect people the question would inevitably arise why this one and not my father mother sibling lover better on the whole not to do any such thing look at all the effort that the companions went to in order to preserve the secret of their own nature and they werent even returning as humans just such philosophical questions had arisen in the course of cheseras questioningthough on his part rather than cheserasand the sworn one had neatly deflected them perhaps it had been because chesera wanted him to think of possible answers for himself there had been that kind of feeling as the conversation progressed and in all of that i didnt learn a thing about chesera himself now that was truly unusual since falconsbane had been a rather skilled interrogator and some of that expertise was available to andesha given the proper occasion that was one of falconsbanes abilities that andesha did not mind coopting but he had not been able to insert so much as a single personal question of his own the entire time the two of them spoke chesera was most unusual even for the sworn andesha rubbed his temples feeling as if he should have a headache after all that chesera had put him through even though he did not activity that was what was called for there were dishes to wash there was clothing to mend and there were all manner of things to be done or perhaps he ought to go look at the food supplies the shinain had brought and see if there was something more that could be done with them than the seemingly endless round of soups and stews they had been presented with thus far he wasnt precisely a grand cook but he did have experience in dishes that no one else here did he rose and went in search of something useful to do the clothing and kitchen work had already been taken care of but as it turned out there was something new he could concoct in the way of dinner for them all there was fresh meat brought in by shinain hunters there were beans and a few other winter vegetables such as onions and there were spices and dried peppers that particular combination reminded him of a recipe karal had made up for him once when theyd been too late to catch dinner with either the court or the heraldic students he diced some of the meat and hot peppers and browned them together added onions beans and sweet spice and set it all to cook slowly while all of those ingredients had been used before no one in the group had ever used them in that combination it would definitely be different from anything the shinain had been cooking and that was what he was looking for it had taken a long time to dice the meat as finely as the recipe called for and having his hands busy allowed his mind to rest his mind wasnt the only thing resting however and although karal was still sleeping others were awake again at about the time he finished with his concoction master levy was out in the main room on his hands and knees looking intently at the floor and prying at invisible cracks with some very tiny tools he took from a pouch at his belt andesha washed up the utensils hed used for his preparations dried his hands and went out to join him though no one else seemed at all interested in what he was doing is there anything i can do to help he asked sitting on his heels just behind the master artificer well there is something here all right master levy replied in an absent tone this is a movable stone and i would guess that it drops down and fits into a slot carved into the rock it may take me a while to figure out the release though tell me something do you have any idea if this mage thought in patterns in numbers of things as inoh the karsites think in terms of one seven or eightif they build a device with a catch it will either have a single triggerpoint or seven thats because they have a single god but in the usual representations of vkandis as the sun rising there are seven rays coming from it and in the ones of the suninglory there are eight rays the rethwellans almost always use three for the three faces of their goddess most valdemarans use three or two three for the same reason as the rethwellans or two for the god and goddess its not a conscious thing its just the kind of patterns that people establish as very small children you might try four andesha said after a moment of thought urtho shared the kaledain faith if he shared anything religious with anyone and thats the same as the shinain except where its freeflowing and curvy theres a great deal of square and diamond symmetry in the decorations around here master levy grunted what sounded like thanks and seemed to widen his scope of examination a bit finally he sat back on his haunches stretched all his fingers and shook his head shall we see if were supremely lucky and were not dealing with a random placing he asked andesha his saturnine face showing rather more humor than andesha was used to seeing from him if your guess is right i think ive found all four trigger points if mine is right this far inside his tower urtho would not have bothered to be terribly clever about hiding his additional workrooms and the catches wont be difficult i dont suppose youve got a clue about an order in which to push four triggerpoints do you if youre not supposed to push all of them at once you mean andesha thought again east south west and north thats the order in rituals with the maiden being in the east and the crone in the north that sounds as good a guess as any lets see what happens master levy reached out with one of his tools but andesha shot out a hand to stop him wait a minute he stammered if you do this wrong is anything likely towellgo wrong will the ceiling fall in and crush us or poison gas start seeping in here or something master levy paused there is that possibility he began and laughed at andeshas expression oh for havens sake its not very likely hed put something like that in the floor now is it where it might be triggered by accident just by people standing on it andesha flushed embarrassed i suppose not he replied letting go of master levys hand the master artificer continued his interrupted task depressing a small spot in the stone of the floor andesha noted with fascination that it remained depressed so that if one had placed a coin on the spot it would be flush with the rest of the floor master levy then touched a second and a third both of which also remained depressed after he touched them and although andesha had not been able to spot the second place once he had the distance between the first and second he was able to deduce the locations of the third and fourth spot before master levy touched them andesha held his breath in anticipation when the master artificer pushed on that last place nothing happened for a long moment and andesha sighed with disappointment master levy however had his head cocked to one side and as andesha sighed he stood up looked fixedly at a place in the pattern of the floor shaped like an octagon then stamped sharply down on one corner of it with his boot heel with a reluctant grating sound the stone moved a trifle dropping down by about the width of a thumb master levy stamped downward again and the stone moved a bit more its stuck old you know he quipped he continued urging it with carefullyplaced blows of his heel as it dropped down about the distance of a mans hand measured from the end of the middle finger to the wrist then began to slide sideways once there was a sliver of a gap between the octagonal stone and the rest of the floor he got down on hands and knees again and peered at it by now thanks to the sounds of stamping and the grating of stoneonstone he had attracted the attention of everyone in the tower who was not asleep will you look at that silverfox exclaimed as the curious gathered around we never guessed that was there i am looking at it i think im going to need something to pry with master levy replied the mechanisms are rather stuck which shouldnt be too surprising considering their age im afraid once i get this open its not going to shut again i dont see a problem with that firesong said dropping down on his heels to peer at the stone himself beside master levy while silverfox went off to get a pry bar from a plainsman if theres anything down there worth bothering with we wouldnt want to close it and if there isnt well clean out the trash and use it for sleeping quarters or something master levy grunted and nodded his head as he felt along the crack with great care then put his nose to the crack to sniff at it gingerly i dont smell anything that shouldnt be down there he said after a long moment while he concentrated on the scent with his eyes closed and i always did have the best nose in my yeargroup when the students were experimenting my alchemy master always used to count on me to know when to evacuate the workroom if something went wrong comforting considering there might be a mechanism to release poisons into the room below if not this one said sejanes coming up to the rest with his hair all rumpled from sleeping silverfox arrived at that moment with the pry bar and shook his head at the imperial mage not urtho and especially not in his own tower the kestrachern said decisively he was a compassionate and considerate man safe and resourceful but not vengeful he would only create wards to protect things not to punish he wouldnt have taken the risk that a curious hertasi or some other innocent might set such a thing loose sejanes looked skeptical but didnt say anything silverfox however read the look correctly youre not dealing with the empire sejanes he said youre not dealing with people looking to gain in rank by whatever means it takes urthos personal servants and close friends were loyal enough to die for himand many did to his sorrow here in the heart of his personal stronghold he would not have used safeguards that could harm his own people as well as intruders master levy inserted the tongue of the pry bar in the crack and pulled the stone grated and moved slightly then kept on moving for a little after master levy stopped pulling now the gap was about as wide as a large mans palm do we want to investigate before we open this any further the artificer asked silverfox i defer to your judgment since you seem to know more about the master of this place than anyone else here silverfox looked pointedly at andesha who shook his head in answer to the silent question my knowledge is tainted since it comes from his enemy he said at once maar is far more likely to have underestimated a foe he considered sentimental and soft it wouldnt hurt to drop a lantern down on a string silverfox said to master levy then at least well be able to see what were dealing with for all we know this is just a well and not any kind of a storeroom or workroom a source of water other than melted snow from the surface would be welcome loisha murmured quietly master levy heard him and nodded in answer to both statements this time it was andeshas turn to go off and rummage for a lantern and some appropriately strong string they hadnt needed lanterns since they arrived here although the shinain had brought some just in case the magical lights failed the magic lamps hanging from the center of the ceiling of each room had been quite enough to serve their needs and showed no signs of being harmed at all by the magestorms that made magic problematic outside the tower andesha dug one of the lanterns out of a pile of articles no one had found a use for and got some string from the kitchen area he filled the lamp with oil trimmed the wick with thread clippers from a sewing kit and lit it before bringing it out to the rest master levy made the handle fast to the string and lowered the lantern down into the cavity while the others crowded around andesha couldnt see anything from his vantage and neither could most of the shinain well called chesera whats there stairs mostly master levy replied so this isnt a well i believe i see something like furniture at the bottom but the light doesnt go very far down its not dimming in bad air is it andesha asked anxiously vague memories of tomb openings intruding from one of falconsbanes previous lives even if there are no poisons the air could have gone bad from whats been sealed inside no its burning brightly enough its just a long way down to the next floor and the light is between me and whats down there master levy replied it is an issue of contrast and visual acuity well no help for it back to hard labor he inserted the tongue of the pry bar and continued to lever the stubborn stone out of the way while at least a couple of the observers looked at each other wondering why the artificer used such flowery terms to say he couldnt see well suddenly with no warning whatsoever the frozen mechanism gave way the stone slid beneath the floor into hiding and master levy taken completely off guard fell over backward the pry bar dropping out of his hands and clanging endoverend down the staircase only andesha remained to assist the winded artificer to his feet the rest of the spectators made a rush for the stair with firesong in the lead in mere moments they had descended out of sight then firesong spoke a single word light poured up from below and muffled exclamations were drifting up through the hole in the floor you might say thank you master levy called after them and sighed rubbing his hip where he had landed we may as well go find out what theyve discovered i only hope it isnt urthos treasury there isnt a great deal of good that gold and gems would do us in this situation urthos treasury would have books not baubles andesha assured him but we ought to go down too before they all get carried away in their enthusiasm master levy went with andesha following him taking the stone stairs carefully for they were quite steep they also went down farther than he expected for the stone floor of the room above was at least as thick as his hand was long perhaps a little thicker which accounted for the fact that it hadnt rung hollow and had sounded like solid stone to their footsteps it looked as if this room had actually been hollowed out of the bedrock after the tower itself had been built although the air was a bit stuffy and very dusty with a hint of strange metallic scents it was not at all damp nor was the room as gloomy and illlit as andesha had anticipated there were more of those magical lights everywhere and as andesha looked around he had no doubt at all just what urtho had used this room for it was a workshop with everything necessary for an inveterate tinkerer who was interested in literally everything needless to say the room was very crowded despite the fact that it was just a little smaller than the main room above this was not a mages classical workroom a place where only magic took place and few if any physical components were needed this was a place where anything and everything could be worked with played with investigated here was a bench with an array of glassware and rows of jars that had once held chemicals both liquid and solidmost of the former long since evaporated leaving only dust or oily residue in the bottoms of their bottles there stood another bench with a small lathe clamps a vise and tools for working wood and ivory and beside it a similar bench with the tools for shaping soft metals and a third bench with the tools for cutting and polishing lenses glass and crystal looking incongruous beside that was a potters wheel and glassblowers pipes and along the back wall were a forge a kiln a glassmakers furnace and a smelter they probably had once shared a chimney long since blocked up by the destruction of the tower above there were more benches and work spaces set up but from the staircase andesha could not tell what they were only that most of them had been in use up to the day of the cataclysm andesha simply stood and stared as the others wandered about looking but not touching master levy on the other hand looked supremely satisfied by what he saw as he surveyed it all from the staircase now this is much more in my way of doing things he said folding his arms across his chest and looking over the workshop with approval i believe i could have liked this urtho on all of the benchesall of themwere projects in various states of completion it was difficult to tell what some of them had been intended to do if anything there were pages of notes arrayed neatly beside each of these projects it appeared that in his workplace at least urtho was a tidy and methodical man firesong stood beside a particular bench laden with some very odd equipment indeed he gazed on these pieces of paper with longing although he forbore to touch them this is maddening he complained hovering over a small sheaf of scrawled manuscript im afraid even to breathe on these things for fear that theyll fall to dust but i think i may die if i cant read whats on the next page but something about the way the paper looked stirred echoes in andeshas deepest memories he descended the last few stairs and made his way over to what appeared to be a small jewelers workbench there was a halffinished brooch there nothing magical or mechanical obviously just a piece of jewelry in the shape of a hummingbird to be inlaid with a mosaic of tiny agatepieces formed into stylized feathers wait he muttered the original design lay next to it and after a close examination of the sheet andesha picked it up silverfox stifled a gasp and firesong bit off a protest he waved the intact and flexible drawing at them to prove it was not hurt by handling pick up what you want he urged its not paper or rather it isnt like the paper we know and use now its a special ragpaper treated with resins so it wouldnt disintegrate you can write on it in silverpoint crayon or graphitestick but not ink ink just beads up and wont penetrate really master levy walked to the bench nearest him and picked up another piece of the paper very useful around chemicals i would guess very useful around anything that might ruin your notes firesong observed snatching up the papers he had stared at so covetously ohnow thisoh my he held the papers up so that silverfox could peruse them too as between them they tried to decipher urthos notes in ancient kaledain using the hawkbrother tongue firesong knew and silverfoxs modem kaledain as guides chesera looked at them curiously but loisha laughed at their immediate absorption oh we have lost them for a time he said indulgently i know that look the weaver is one with the loom not entirely firesong responded absently but i will be very pleased when this scholar of silverfoxs shows up so he can help us with this if these notes are right this may be the answer to our isolation here he waved a hand at the bench and what looked to be a pair of mirrors serving as the lids to a matching pair of boxes these are completed or all but some cosmetic fripperyand theyre supposed to act like a pair of linked scrying spells except they dont use truemagic they use mindmagic apparently it can work over unknown incredible distances somehow they amplify it so that it only needs one person with mindmagic to make both boxes work or so i think this says that made every head in the place turn toward the adept and he finally looked up from the notes he was sharing with silverfox shaking his hair out of his eyes got your attention then did i he asked with a sly smile if these devices use mindmagic they wont be disrupted by the magestorms commented a mental voice from above and altra flowed gracefully down the staircase taking a seat on one of the steps at about headheight to the humans that would be more than merely useful if we learned how to use them i could take one to haven if we learned how to make them i could take another to solaris and i certainly have enough mindmagic to make them work no matter who wishes to use them i thought you said that you didnt want to jump anymore firesong said sardonically andesha chuckled i dont want to but devices like these could replace that aspect of my duties as well as give us the resources of all of master levys colleagues at haven the firecat replied with immense dignity for that matter if we could concoct a third device i would not necessarily have to jump it to solaris hansa could come and get it instead andesha hid a smile at the unspoken implication behind altras statement an implication that altra felt his colleague and fellow firecat had been getting off a bit too easily in the transportation department our ability to jump is partly truemagic partly mindmagic the firecat continued for once without any hint of irony or mockery in his mindvoice it is growing hazardous for passengers to jump with us as master levy and sejanes discovered it is no longer comfortable for us to jump very long distances and i was not exaggerating earlier about how i felt when we arrived i was exhausted and drained not a common occurrence until now i can predict a time very soon when it could become actually inconceivably dangerous for us to jump but if we have a way to communicate with haven and karsesuch a thing would be beyond price i had deduced that for myself thank you firesong replied with a touch of acid if you can just conjure up that kaledain scholar we have a chance of learning how to use these things before the time comes when you cant take one back to valdemar the scholar will be here soon chesera put in looking up from the glassware bench his darkblue clothing reflected richly from the surface of the dusty glassware the main problem has been that since his assistant is awhat do you call the lizardfolk hertasi silverfox interjected the handsome kestracherns face lit up at cheseras words ah so it is tarrn who is coming oh that is very good he may be frail but he is the finest scholar in the ancient version of our tongue outside the lands of white gryphon and a good being as well silverfox seemed immensely relieved by what chesera had said and that in itself made andesha feel as if they were all beginning to make some progress at last yes it seems the problem has been to find a way to bring both of them in a gryphon fourharness carrybasket and still keep the hertasi warm without magic chesera left the glasswarebench and moved back toward the staircase when i left a means had been devised and they were planning on arriving within two or three days of when i expected to be here they had only to manufacture this device whatever it was and then they could leave i would have told you earlier when i first arrived but you all seemed quite busy and i had business with andesha that i wished to conclude before i dealt with anything else that is even better news now firesong seemed much happier as well so much so that he forbore to comment on that last statement i vote that if we cant on superficial examination find anything more important to investigate than these devices well concentrate on those for our immediate goal if we can communicate with all of the mages and artificers on a regular basis it will be as good as being at haven with all the advantages of being here in the tower to implement what we deduce he looked around at the rest of the party most of whom shrugged with indifference or bafflement you and sejanes should be the ones to decide ill be of very little use without a translator in any event master levy said with great candor at the moment i have nothing really to work on as i believe we need to develop a new set of theories to match the changed conditions those i feel must come from things we can learn by studying the cataclysm itself and urthos own methodologies so until the translator arrives what i can and will do is attempt to find out if this place holds any more secrets in the floor very little use firesong actually snorted after you were the one who found this place no false modesty thank you master levy i may be of some slight assistance here below chesera said with great caution i shall examine those objects that seem to partake of the nature of the shaman and see if i may make something of them we shinain lost some things when the cataclysm destroyed our land and sundered the clans i may be able to rediscover some of what was lost and that may be of some help hah andesha thought with triumph now i know what you are o mysterious one both sworn to the old one and a shaman now is it a need to keep an eye on all these mages that brings you here or was it the hope of keeping us from finding things that the clans would rather we didnt learn is it an interest in what you might find within the walls of this tower or is it something else altogether myself perhaps it could be but he was not going to have the hubris to assume that the latter was the case there were plenty of reasons for the kalenedral to want a shaman here most of the sworn were not leshya with a direct link to the stareyed though they could all walk the moonpaths when they chose although andesha had seen more than one or two of the veiled ones about they had never stayed for very long and he had the feeling that they were not permitted to take a physical form for too longperhaps just long enough to serve some specific need or be in themselves a kind of message the moonpaths perhaps i ought to go walk them myself i havent seen or spoken to trevalen and dawnfire since we burned out that weapon of urthos firesong looked up as if distracted for a moment and cast a speculative look at andesha you know he began it is all too fortuitous that we find these things andesha smiled a little as he noticed chesera looking at him in a similar way he heard himself saying it is the way of the stareyed to provide such opportunities for those who will help themselves if i were you id be careful with these new finds for she is unlikely to hand over easy answers the mind that controls the hand must use the tool wisely and all tools can harm their user firesong grunted and actually looked for a moment as if he could be considering those words in the way a shinain would acknowledge the cryptic advice of a shaman as being worthy of meditation then the adept shrugged a little and made off with the sheaf of notes andesha looked about the workshop to see what the others were doing chesera cracked a slight smile and rejoined loisha huddling together over a workbenchs treasures in the far corner sejanes was examining the bench with some of the equipment that andesha could not immediately identify firesong and silverfox were halfway up the staircase in no time with their papers in their hands chattering to one another and ignoring everything else about them master levy was already back up on what andesha was now thinking of as the ground floor and karal was probably still asleep there might or might not be other kalenedral besides chesera about they preferred to spend much of their time in the camp on the surface and since he had arbitrarily taken care of dinner preparations there was really no need for any of them to be inside the tower at this point this would be as good a time as any to walk the moonpaths undisturbed he went up the stairs as quietly as he could nodding to altra on the way the firecat nodded back with immense dignity then turned to follow firesong and silverfox tail waving like a jaunty banner evidently he wanted to hear what they were up to probably because they were the most interesting creatures in the tower at this moment andesha turned his steps in toward the sleeping chamber karal was indeed still asleep he noticed as he paused in the doorway that master levy was in the side chamber where andesha and karal had found indications of another trapdoor the artificer was back down on his hands and knees and peering at the pattern in the floor florian was beside him occasionally tapping a hoof on the stone at his direction andesha tiptoed past karal to his own sleeping place you know if i look more as if im taking a nap im less likely to be disturbed he pulled off his boots and curled up in his bedroll arranging himself in what he thought was a very naturallooking position it occurred to him as he closed his eyes that he was being very secretive about this when there really was no reason for him to do so on the other hand i dont think i want chesera to know everything im doing until i know more about him if chesera turned out to be as rigid and inflexible as jarim first was or as hidebound as the shaman of andeshas home clan it would be easier to keep away from him and his demands if he wasnt aware of everything andesha knew or could do all ive told him is that the avatars appear to me not that i can go look for them i think ill keep it that way for now he settled himself comfortably then slowed his breathing and began the combination of relaxation and tension that marked a moonpath trance this for those who were not trained in the technique was more difficult than it sounded too much tension and the trance state would never be reached too much relaxation brought on a nap rather than a trance once he hovered on the edge of trance with all of his attention focused and nothing from the real world intruding he sent his mind going in and then out in the pattern that trevalen had shown him that felt like so very long ago he found himself in his vision standing on a path made of silvery sand that sparkled with a subdued glimmer in the midst of an opalescent mist that swirled all around him or rather he seemed to be standing there this body was an illusory one and he could change it to another form if he concentrated on it this was a comfortable form one he didnt have to think about to maintain and it didnt seem reasonable to waste time and energy changing it to something else he still was not certain if the moonpaths themselves were an illusion he had never bothered to test his surroundings to find out the mist had no scent and was neither cool nor warm the sand beneath his feet neither so soft as to impede his steps nor so hard as to be noteworthy trevalen he called out into the mist his voice echoing off into the distance in a way that had no counterpart in the real world dawnfire the mist swirled about him following his words with eddies of faint colors that faded within moments he had no answer immediately but he didnt expect one the avatars were not in existence to serve and please him after all and he was well aware of that instead he moved out along the path of soft sand occasionally calling the names of his friends quietly into the mist eventually if they were not occupied with something more important they would come to him and so they did they came winging through the mist in their bird shapes forms the shape of a vorcelhawk but the size of a human and with the sparkling fiery multicolored plumage of a firebird he knew they were coming before they arrived for they lit up the mist in the far distance like lightning within a thundercloud as they flew toward him their flight paths spiraling around each other leaving a double helix of light through the fog in their wakes here they did not need to backwing to a landing as they would if they had taken real hawkforms in the world they simply slowed then went into a hover above the path then flowed into the vaguely avianhuman shapes they normally wore to speak to him trevalen was dressed as the shinain shaman he had been before he became the stareyeds avatar but dawnfire though clearly tayledras rather than shinain wore a simple tunic that could not be readily identified as coming from any particular culture her long silver hair moved slightly like the mist that swirled slowly about her they both seemed to be completely ordinary humansexcept for their eyes not eyes but eyeshaped windows on the night sky the darkness of all of night spangled with the brightest of stars so beautiful it was said that kalenel herself had eyes like that in this way she marked these two as her avatars a way that could not be mistaken for anything else younger brother trevalen greeted him warmly it is far too long since we have seen you but i pledge that we have not been idle in that interval not all that long for a mere mortal he corrected with a smile but a great deal has been happening to us as well i was not certain if you knew about what we have uncovered and learned and besides that i wanted to make sure that you two were all right after the working not that i could have done anything if they werent dawnfire shrugged fluidly poor young karal bore the brunt of our working and we two were only a little drained she said and extended a cool hand to him which he took in brief greeting it sounds as if you have not been idle eitheryou in the tower that confirmed one of his guesses that the avatars for all their power were neither omniscient nor omnipotent they were bound by some physical laws at least was that because they were not really physically dead as the spiritkalenedral were or was it because they had been granted wider powers by the stareyed would you like to tell me what you can or hear what news i have first he asked your news i suspect that much of what we have to tell you will be mere confirmation of what you already know trevalen told him we have been ranging far in the world and in the void to see what changes the working wrought on the energypatterns of the storms and how farreaching those changes were i fear i bring no startlingly good news andesha nodded and detailed everything that had been happening since the working of which karal had been the channel from the effect that being the focus of so much energy had wrought on the young karsite priest to the departure of the gryphons and the arrival of sejanes and master levy to the comings and goings of so many kalenedral to cheseras intense interest in him lastly he described the events of the afternoon the opening of the hidden trapdoor and the discovery of the workshops below they both listened with concentration and apparent interestand surprise when he described the workshops so the existence of the workshop is something that the stareyed did not tell them though her agents have certainly been about interesting there may be answers there trevalen said at last and for a fleeting moment his face took on that listening expression that karal wore when either florian or altra mindspoke him andesha wondered if the stareyed might be speaking to her avatar at that instant and his next words might have been a confirmation of that certainly firesong should pursue the investigation of the mindmirrors they should not be difficult to revive nor to duplicate and they will serve you all in the days to come oh my even more interesting perhaps my intuition about the stareyeds providence was wellfounded dawnfire placed one long hand on trevalens shoulder and with a rueful expression admitted this is the only concrete advice we can give at the moment would it were otherwise but the future is still trackless and without a clear path and even our goddess is bound by constraints she cannot break so that we may all work out our futures with a free will andesha sighed but saw no reason to doubt her so we are still muddling our way through a point when there are many futures possible i had hoped after the working that we would at least have gotten our feet on a clear path again trevalen looked uneasy the danger has only been postponed not negated but luckily the forces involved have not worsened he told andesha you knew that the working was not a solution to the magestorms only a reprieve and that has not changed we have been tracking the results of the working since the initial release of the energy contained in urthos weapon dawnfire took up the thread of conversation the effect is all that one could have wished over valdemar the pelagirs karse and rethwellan and even hardorn the waves that you sent out are canceling the waves of the magestorms butonly to a point what point he asked instantly sensing that this was important although he did not know why yet just beyond the border of hardorn in the east trevalen told him also south just at the borders of the haighlei empire and around white gryphon and its environs but they know how to deal with the effects and in any case the storms are weak there north well into the icewall mountains to the west well that is pelagirwilds and the storms will hardly change that it is east that concerns us for the empire is the recipient of the worst of the storms and they are causing great havoc there among those who depend so much upon magic andesha gave that some thought that could be good for us or bad he said finally given what the emperor did to us im not at all sad to hear that they are having troubles id rather that the empire was so busy trying to hold itself together that they had no time to think of us but duke tremane thought we were the source of the storms and what if the emperors people assume the same and retaliate trevalen nodded precisely warn your friends andesha and when the mindmirrors are working and in place use them to warn valdemar such things could be possible could be possible he says yet if i understand the constraints the avatars labor under pointing out something specifically as possible may be the only warning they are allowed to give of a future they have seen or perhaps not despite the unpleasant information andesha felt a warm glow of satisfaction the avatars avoided giving direct advice most of the time but he was getting better at deducing what they wanted him to think about and what information was the most critical to the current situation what about the storms themselves he asked eventually theyre going to become strong enough to overcome the counterstorm we sent out arent they thats why we knew what we did was only going to be temporary he watched trevalens face carefully and took his cues from the faint changes in expression as he suspected he was supposed to do so eventually what happens were getting aa reversal of the original cataclysm am i right that was why we used this spot for the working because its the place where the waves converge eventually the storms are going to overcome the working and build up to something very bad he swallowed uncomfortably as trevalens slight nod told him he was on the right track so then what obviously the storms that got set off arent going togo back into the weapons and things they came from do we get the cataclysm all over again trevalen shook his head but not in negation and dawnfire spread her hands wide that is just what we do not know she admitted and i confide in youneither does she there are too many possibilities and some of them rest on very subtle factors we do not yet know what the mages and powers of the empire will do and that will have an effect there are many things that you could do here all of them effective but in different ways and with differing results probably there will be another lesser cataclysm unless you here manage to do one of the things that could avert or absorb it there are many things you could do you could do nothing whatsoever as well and from any action that is taken there are the possibilities of prosperity or ruin in varying degrees whatever happens that is all we can tell you for certain he groaned that is not much comfort he complained but i suppose that it gives me enough to tell the others for now trevalen managed a ghost of a smile we never pledged to bring you comfort younger brother he chided gently only enough help that you need not make your decisions blind deaf and ignorant let me ask about something closer to home then andesha replied chesera what is chesera to me or i to chesera sooner or later he will deduce the source of my information whether or not i actually say where it comes from in his presence trevalens expression softened with affection what is chesera to you simply enougha teacher if you should decide for yourself that you wish to learn what he has to teach and what are you to chesera largely affirmation he has been searching for someone to pass his knowledge on to and he hopes that you will be that person but it must be your decision and he will not urge it upon you he isa good man and much in the same way of thinking as master ulrich was karal will be like him one day so there it was out in the open at last his invitation to become a shaman and not perhaps just any shaman but one sworn to the goddess in her aspect as wisdom keeper he sighed wishing that he could be as certain of what he wanted as karal was but at least now he knew that chesera was neither a fanatic nor inflexible that took a few worries from his shoulders at least you will be seeing more of us in days to come dawnfire told him her sweet face full of seriousness i promise you andesha we will tell you and help you all that we can we see no good reason to leave you without aids and guides in this trevalen looked out into the mists suddenly and right now we must go trevalen interrupted her there are more things we must investigate and watch for you fare well younger brother time is running and it is not on our side and with that andesha found himself alone again on the moonpaths as if the avatars had never been there with no further reason to remain he sent his awareness dropping slowly back into his physical self going down then out as he slowly woke his senses he heard karal stirring at last and smelled the distinctive scent of the meat and bean mixture he had prepared earlier his stomach growled and he opened his eyes i brought you some dinner karal said looking at him intently as he handed andesha a bowl you were with them werent you karal hooked his thumbs together and made flapping gestures with his fingers by way of definition he saw no reason to deny it and nodded as he sat up slowly and accepted the bowl and spoon from karal they didnt tell me anything we didnt already know or at least not much ill let firesong and sejanes know as soon as ive eaten karal looked better than he had in days and andesha wondered if that was all due to the work of the shinain healer or if the avatars had a hand in it he suspected the latter and not for the first time wondered what the link between vkandis and the shinain goddess was the avatars seemed quite drawn to karal and he to them on the other hand they are very compassionate by nature and he certainly deserves compassion and sympathy florian and i are going out for some fresh air do you want to go with us karal invited nonchalantly im tired of being down underground like a hibernating bear i want to see the sun before i go mad he shook his head i cant imagine how that mage was able to stand being cooped up in here you may see the sun but you wont feel it andesha cautioned its so cold that if you pour out a cup of water itll be ice before it hits the ground so ill bundle up karal shrugged ive felt cold before karse isnt exactly a pleasure garden in winter and up in the hills theres snow on the ground for half the year im beginning to sympathize with the gryphons if i dont see some open sky im going to start babbling then ill go with you it didnt take andesha very long to pull on a heavy tunic a second of the same weight then his quilted shinain coat over it all but karal needed a little more help getting all that clothing on he was quite steady on his feet however which andesha took to be a good sign of his recovery by now master levy was deep in his prodding and poking of the floor and he jotted down measurements and diagrams in one of his notebooks silverfox and firesong were sitting on their heels the pages of notes neatly stacked in front of them regarding another sheaf of their own notes with some dubiousness where are you two going silverfox called as the three of them passed by were going out for some fresh air karal replied why dont you join us well go frighten the shinain into thinking what you found in the workroom turned us all into monsters he made a hideous face and silverfox laughed fresh air not a bad idea firesong raised his head as karal tendered his invitation we arent making much more out of these notes maybe a little sun will wake up my mind go on out well catch up with you andesha noticed at once that their hosts had been at work on the tunnel to the surfacethe opening they had made into the side of the tower was large and quite regular without any debris of broken masonry to trip over the tunnel was also wider though no higher and there had been some extensive work done in shoring it up since the last time hed come through it it was still claustrophobic but on this trip he no longer had the feeling that the tunnel was going to collapse and trap him at any moment he sent a small magelight on ahead of karal he couldnt see past florians rump so a magelight was hardly of much use to him altra had declined to come saying that he had seen quite enough of snow and was planning another nap in karals bed he scented the outside before he saw any indication they were nearing the entrance although the air below remained remarkably clean and the scents that lingered thanks to some small magics on his part and firesongs were all pleasant in nature there was a fresh quality to the outside air that nothing below could duplicate some of that was due to the cold but not all the other thing they could not duplicate below was the light as he stumbled out into the late afternoon sunlight he squinted and put out a hand to steady himself against florians side there wasnt a single cloud in the sky the great bowl of the sky itself was an intense and blinding blue and with all of the glare reflected off the snow there was as much light coming from below as above karal stood to one side taking in huge gulps of air his pale face taking on more color with every breath florian trotted off and kicked up his heels friskily seen from the outside the tower itself was hardly more than a snowfrosted stub of meltedlooking rock protruding from a snowcovered rolling hill the only projection above the otherwise flat plains at all not prepossessing except for its size because they had dug a long slanting tunnel to reach the wall of the tower below the entrance came out quite some distance from the remains of the tower itself and it was at the foot of the tower precisely above the point where they had broken into the walls that the shinain had pitched their tentvillage the round felt tents white and brown and black made a very orderly and neat array against the snow so neat and orderly that it looked like a model rather than a place where people were actually living and working whoof firesong exclaimed from behind andesha as florian frisked and gamboled in the snow with karal laughing and throwing snowballs for him to dodge very bright out here i shouldnt wonder if you could get a worse sunburn than in high summer silverfox ducked as karal turned and lobbed a snowball at them karal laughed and the kestrachern pelted after him swearing vengeance while firesong looked on indulgently so the adept asked quietly while karal and silverfox took shelter behind facing snowbanks and hurled missiles at each other what did your avatars have to say for themselves andesha flung him a startled glance and firesong chuckled at his expression you have a certain quiet glow after youve gone visiting them the mage told him its not terribly obvious but its there if you know what to look for so what did they have to say anything useful mostly that nothing has changed that much weve successfully bought some time for ourselves and our friends things outside the areas we protected are deteriorating quickly and eventually even our time will run out andesha said wishing his news was better firesong nodded unsurprised and when our time runs out well getwhat a replication of the cataclysm after all everything is supposedly converging here maybe even they dont know for sure andesha sighed if she has any idea shes not saying anything if you want my guess the gods are doing what they always dounless and until all life is threatened with catastrophe theyll see to it we have the tools and the information to find our own solutions then leave us alone to find them the avatars think the things were finding in the tower will help us but but theres no clear future to see or even guess at firesong looked surprisingly philosophical im determined to see this as an opportunity for once in my life there isnt a god or a spirit or the hand of fate or prophecy or anything else demanding that i trace a certain pattern on the pages of time were going to make our own future here andesha and nothing is going to interfere with us to make it go some other godordained way theres a certain satisfaction in that you know i suppose so andesha replied he would have said more but silverfox suddenly broke off the snowball fight to peer into the north and point look he exclaimed with glee as karal dropped his final snowball without throwing it to squint in the direction he indicated gryphons yes they have a carrybasket and i think theyve brought tarrn andesha shaded his eyes and narrowed them against the glare and finally made out four sets of flapping wings with a halfround shape beneath them he couldnt think what else would have that particular configuration except four gryphons and a large carrybasket come on silverfox crowed lets go meet them he set off at a run florian loped up and halfknelt beside karal who pulled himself onto the companions back the two of them quickly overtook silverfox firesong cast an amused glance at andesha and indicated the others with a finger shall we trundle along behind he asked it would only be polite andesha pointed out and besides the shinain have cleared a perfectly fine path between here and there it would be a shame not to use it they followed in silverfoxs wake though at a more leisurely pace by the time they arrived at the shinain tentvillage the gryphons and their passengers had already landed and been taken into one of the tents it was easy to tell which one there was only one that was large enough to hold four gryphons at once and only one whose pallet of snow had been churned by gryphon claws darkclad kalenedral nodded as firesong waved to them then went about their own business andesha pulled the entrance flap aside and he and the mage entered the tent being careful to let in as little cold air as possible it took quite a bit of time for andeshas eyes to adjust to the darkness inside the tent after all the snow glare outside he stayed where he was while he waited listening to the chatter of at least half a dozen creatures all speaking at once he looked around as soon as he could make anything at all out he didnt recognize any of the gryphons but he hadnt expected to they were all arranged at one side of the tent and it came as no surprise to see that they were eatingor rather gorging not only would they have to recover from the stress of carrying their passengers all the way from kleshya vale but they would have to recover from the stress of dealing with the cold as well karal was conversing with the gryphons occasionally helping them where the quarters were too cramped for them to move themselves silverfox however was engaged in a highspeed conversation with a graymuzzled but jauntylooking kyree this odd creature vaguely wolflike as to the head and coat but also vaguely catlike in body shape and proportions was easily the size of a small calf andesha knew more about kyrees from personal experience than from falconsbanes memories as mornelithe falconsbane in all of his incarnations had very little to do with the creatures andesha on the other hand was quite familiar with rris the kyree representative to the kingdom of valdemar and the alliance rris might look like this old fellow many years from now his muzzle was quite white and his head was liberally salted with paler hairs among the black he was tired but clearly in good spirits and he chatted with silverfox like the old friend he probably was or to be more accurate silverfox chattered the kyree who could only mindspeak nodded and made replies in his own inaudible fashion until tarrn chose to speak in the public mode no one would hear him except those he chose with him bundled in so many layers of quilted clothing he resembled a roll of brightly colored kaledain bed coverings was a hertasi he was practically sitting on a brazier since the lizardfolk were very susceptible to cold it wasnt that they were coldblooded precisely it was that they were not able to control their own body temperatures very efficiently opinions were divided on whether hertasi had been created by urtho or by an accident involving magic but in either case their physiology had some flaws and this was the major one the poor thing could very easily lose limbs to the cold or would go involuntarily into a kind of hibernation layers of clothing would not necessarily help this especially not during a long journey in bitter cold hence the brazier now and whatever other measures the kaledain had taken all that could be seen of this hertasi was the end of the snout and a pair of alert bright and apparently happy eyes peeking out of the depths of the hood a great deal more of tarrn was visible andesha knew kyree from his acquaintance with rris but he had not had much opportunity to get to know any hertasi a few had come with silverfox and the kaledain delegation to valdemar but he hadnt had much to do with them and of course falconsbane was universally despised by both races in all his lives so he would hardly have had any congress with them at just that moment the hertasi spoke up the hertasi associated with the kaledain tended to vocalize far more often than they used mindspeech the exact reverse of the habits of the ones associated with the hawkbrothers i believe i am thawed enough to make the dash for the tower he said in a highpitched voice with hints of a whistling sound underlying the tone excellent lyam the kyree replied they tell me our baggage is already there waiting for us if we truly make a dash you wont get too much of a chill florian says hell be happy to carry lyam if lyam thinks he can cling on karal spoke up florian can get him to the tunnel mouth faster than he can get there on foot he turned toward the hertasi polite but a little uncertain in addressing such an odd creature a companions gait is very smooth and ive never heard of one losing a rider and you should see one run i have never tried riding but if i can get from white gryphon to here without the loss of limb or tail i think i should be able to survive an attempt on a companions back the hertasi said with warm good humor and almost anything is worth not having to walk through snow myself we ssshall ssstay herrre overrrnight one of the gryphons said thisss issss verrry comforrrtable and we do not want to go underrrgrrround even to sssee the towerrr the others nodded with agreement it isss wonderrrful to be wherrre the grrreat ssskandrrranon once wasss but he did not have to crrrawl underrrgrrround said another flicking his wings nervously i do not know how trrreyvan and hydona borrre it the kyree didnt shrug but andesha had the impression that if he could have he would have suit yourselves you will have to make do with my descriptions then yourrr dessscrrriptionsss will be asss if we werrre therrre the first gryphon said firmly i will fly the ssssky that ssskandrranon flew and that will be enough forr me tarrn stood up and shook himself thoroughly one more dash then and we will be where no kyree or hertasi has set foot in thousands of years he seemed to relish the prospect with scarcelyrestrained glee and the air of a creature a quarter of his apparent age well friends let us take these last few paces at the gallop firesong who had known many kyree and hertasi in his life was comfortable with these two immediately tarrn had all of the warmth and wisdom of irrl one of firesongs academic teachers and lyam had a great deal more assertiveness than most of the normallytimid valesbred hertasi although firesong loved to be petted and made much of by his own hertasi he had always found the shyness of the vale hertasi something of an irritation someone once suggested that their manner was reflective of the deep trauma they had suffered during the cataclysm and that worried him deeply if that was so how would they react to another such event theyll cope i suppose its the thing they do best i dont know how they manage both kyree and hertasi were at heart cave and dendwellers and both of the new arrivals were obviously comfortable in the tower they settled into the same room shared by karal and andesha with every evidence of content they had not yet moved in their luggage but the shinain had brought appropriate bedding material for both of the new guestsand extra warming pans for both beds as far as personal belongings went the two had traveled much lighter than he had expected their main luggage consisted of boxes of very special writing materials books of tough paper with waterproof metal covers that locked over the contents like protective boxes and ink that would never run once it had dried even if water was spilled directly on it tarrn was a historian not a traditional kyree historian like rris who memorized and recited from memorybut the kind of historian like the chronicler of valdemar who attempted to personally view as much as possible of epochal events and to note the honest and bare facts in recordbooks called chronicles only when those hard facts had been listed would tarrn then make his own interpretations of the events written separately in commentaries tarrn was very serious about his calling he would rather have the fur pulled out of his tail until it was as naked as a rats than put a personal interpretation in the chronicles actually that wasnt precisely true tarrn would dictate for having no hands he could not write lyam would do the actual writing lyam was tarrns third secretary in a long life as a historian and his relationship with the kyree was obviously based on affection and mutual respect normally it was lyam who cared for the kyrees needs but with lyam just now the one who was in need tarrn was seeing to it in a quiet and dignified manner that lyam got first priority lyam needed warmth more than anything else and karal volunteered to take care of him firesong had an idea that he knew why too at heart karal still considered himself to be the young secretary who had ridden to valdemar from karse and he must be feeling a great deal of empathy for lyam thats good they are both strangers in strange places and it will do them good to have a friend with the sameoutlook status they have a lot in common anyway tarrn however was quite ready for work and looked it he had been consulting with silverfox all the way here from the tentvillage firesong could not imagine where he was getting the energy he approached firesong with silverfox still in tow as soon as karal took lyam off to be wrapped up in warmed blankets and given something hot to drink firesong tarrn wants to speak with you privately before we get to work silverfox told him with a quizzical expression he says he has something for you but he cant tell me what it is the kyree nodded his head as firesong turned to look down on him with surprise indeed firesong ktreva tarrn said with grave courtesy i have would you come with me to where they have brought our belongings certainly firesong replied with equal courtesy would you prefer that i mindspoke with you that will not be necessary but thank you tarrn replied turning and walking slowly toward the heap of bundles that the shinain had left just inside the main room of the tower it is not that this is a secret matter the kyree continued it is simply that i have not been given permission to say anything to anyone else before i discharged my obligation oh this was getting odder with every moment firesong couldnt think of anything or anyone among the kaledain of kleshya vale who would have had anything to send to him tarrn stopped beside the pile of belongings if you will please remove the three bags of lyams clothing there he indicated the drab bundles with his forepaw you will find what i brought you beneath them it is wrapped in blue wool and it is very long and narrow firesong easily moved the three packages revealing a long narrow packet wrapped in blue wool cloth and tied with string firesong picked it up and it mindspoke to him hello boy the grating decidedly female voice was all too familiar to him although it was not one he had expected to hear ever again need he gasped as he tore at the wrappings trying to free the blade within lyam must have wrapped it the string was tied in a complicated knotpattern only a hertasi or a kestrachern could admire he finally pulled off the string the fabric fell away and there was the ancient spellbound sword she looked precisely as she had the last time he saw her strapped to falconsbanes daughter nyaras side as she and herald skif rode out of valdemar to become selenays envoys to the kaledain and tayledras and possibly to the shinain as well need what are you doing here he hadnt been taken so completely by surprise sincesince hed been kidnapped by his ancestor vanyel nyara doesnt require me anymore shes better off on her own the sword said to him theres nothing at kleshya that she skif or the kaledain cant handle you on the other hand are dealing with very old magics i am very old magic and i still recall quite a bit i helped you once before and im hoping i can help you again firesong held the sword in both hands and stared at it it was very disconcerting to be mindspeaking with what should have been an inanimate object a sword didnt have a face to read eyes to look into and it was difficult to tell if it could read his expressions but theres something about all this that doesnt quite make sense yet i find myself wondering if there is something more to this than just an urge to help us here he said finally youve never put yourself in nonfemale hands before hmmlets say ive never done it deliberately but it has happened and it was usually with lads who had the same taste in men as my daughters the sword chuckled but he sensed there was still a lot more than she was telling and he decided to press her for it try again he said sternly in mindspeech youre avoiding my question a sword could not sigh but he got that sensation from her all right i could tell you to work it out yourself but why waste time youve got magestorms disrupting magic youve managed to get them canceled out for the moment but we all know this is only a temporary respite not a solution im magic ive managed to hold myself together this long but each storm gets stronger and sooner or later im going to lose to one i dont know what will happen when i lose but its going to happen she paused for a moment worst case is that ill go up in fire and molten metal the way the sword was made best case is that the magic will just unravel and there wont be anything here but a perfectly ordinary sword he had never once thought that need might be affected by the storms she had always struck him as being so capable so impervious that it never occurred to him that she might have been in trouble this bothered him i cant promise anything he said soberly i dont even know if were going to survive the end of this ourselves to his surprise the sword laughed though rather sardonically you think i dont know that if i go pfft i dont want little nyara to see it happen she had enough troubles in her life and she shouldnt lose an old friend and teacher in that unexpected a fashion besides if im going to go i want to do it while im trying to accomplish something how could i miss a chance at getting my hand in on what youre trying to doits complicated its dangerous its challenging its irresistible if you say so he said aloud but strapped the sword on anyway for she required his presence to be able to see and hear clearly without a bearer it took incredible effort for her to perceive anything and at that it was only dimly he didnt often carry a blade and she felt very odd slung across his back in tayledras fashion andesha will probably be happy to see you but youre going to have to explain yourself to the rest they dont know anything about you and the gods only know what the shinain are going to make of her yes kethry had carried her and kerowyn after that but stillshe was yet another creature of magic inside the heart of the plains how much more were they going to be willing to allow i cant wait need replied with a bit less irony than he expected theres something rather amusing about the reactions people get the first time i talk to them amusing oh gods firesong buried his irritation at this particular complication in an already complicated situation after all need was right about her abilities she did know much older magics than anyone here and that included andesha that might be crucial at this point for there could be something ancient and longforgotten that would give them all the clues they needed to solve this situation she was a powerful mage in her own rightsomething near to an adept or she never could have made the magics that bound her human soul to an iron blade he andesha and sejanes were the only true mages here having need with them gave them a fourth and if she is right and the magestorms overwhelm her along with the rest of us she wont have to worry about how she unravels if she dissolves into flame and melted steel we here among all these dangerous machines of power will have far more to worry about than her on the other hand dealing with needs irascible personality was not going to be easy he rubbed his temples feeling another headache coming on she mindspeaks perhaps i can get tarrn interested in her when he is not translating for us wouldnt she be fascinating for a historian he could only hope that was the case because he had the feeling that need was not going to give him a choice about becoming her bearer in this allmale enclave he was probably the closest she was going to come to an acceptable bearer for by now even the female companions they had ridden here on had begun the long journey back to valdemar well we might as well get this over now he said aloud as tarrn watched him with interest i assume sir that you have made the acquaintance of my metal friend here i have and i hope she will continue to impart her tales of the past to me here when our work permits tarrn replied gravely which made firesong feel a little more cheerful about the situation at least he wouldnt be burdened with needs presence and personality all the time well most of my other colleagues here dont even know she exists so wed better introduce her to them before she startles one of them into dropping something critical by mindspeaking to him without warning need remained silent after that little sally which either meant that she agreed with him or that she was insulted and was plotting revenge an excellent plan tarrn replied carry on he gathered them all together by the simple expedient of going into the central chamber clearing his throat and announcing excuse me friends but something ratherunexpectedhas come up that you really ought to know about that certainly brought everyone who understood valdemaran boiling out and the few shinain who didnt know the language followed the rest out of sheer curiosity silverfox was the first to arrive and stared at him as if hed grown a tail firesong the kestrachern began incredulously what are you doing with a sword he removed need from her sheath just in case the leather and silk hampered her ability to mindspeak at all and held her out in front of him balanced on his palms as the others arrived well thats what i wanted to tell you all about he said flushing a little it seems we didnt get two additions to our little group here we got three id like you all to meet need those of you who havent already encountered her need andesha had only just emerged from the sleeping chamber but there was no doubt that he was glad to see the mageblade what is she doing here this is wonderful firesongs expression must have been a bit sour for andesha took one look at his face and laughed oh its that way is it youre the chosen bearer he looked down fondly at the blade firesong is much too certain of his own expertise dear lady i trust you can teach him that there are other people here who are just as expert in their crafts as he i warn you though he looks much better this way than in a dress dont be so hard on him boy the blade replied amused leave that job to me ive got more experience at it by now all the rest had gathered around and were staring with varying degrees of fascination and puzzlement at the sword what is this sejanes asked brows knitted is this by any chance the famous sword called need that the ancestress of talesedrin clan once wore asked loisha as the other shinain gathered in a knot behind him murmuring the one carried by our clansib herald kerowyn the same firesong all but groaned to answer you sejanes need is a magically made sword with the soul of its maker bound into it and she is unbelievably ancient either she or tarrn can probably tell you the story of why she did such a daft thing hardly daft reckless yes and probably less than wise but at the time we didnt have many options and all of those were worse than what i did of course i could have just folded my hands and done nothing at all butlets just say that went against my conscience and my nature those who didnt know what she was went wideeyed with startlement at the sound of her projected mindvoice the point is shes from a time that actually predates the mage wars and the cataclysm at least so far as we can tell and that makes her an expert in magics much older than the ones we know firesong said noting as he spoke that andeshas eyes were unfocused which probably meant he was talking privately to her she has volunteered to come help us since her last bearer no longer requires her tutelage master levy rubbed his chin with one hand as he looked down on the sword with speculation what happens if and when the magestorms overwhelm us here he asked if she is magically made then unless i can manage to shield myself which im not certain i can i either go quietly or dramatically and i dont know which it will be need replied bluntly these storms disrupt the patterns of magic so deeply they may as well be spells of unmaking but that would happen whether i was here or somewhere else and id just as soon be trying to accomplish something i told you im not one to sit with folded hands even if i still had hands to fold wait a minute sejanes objected speaking directly to the sword glimmering with reflected light from above if you predate the mage wars and the cataclysm how did you survive them in a shielded casket in a shielded shrine in the heart of the triplyshielded temple to bestet the battlegoddess she replied promptly and when the cataclysm was over the shields on the shrine and the casket were gone and i felt as if id been drained to the dregs it took me years to recover and by then id been moved to the armory since no one could figure out why id been put in with the goddess regalia in the first place if i were inclined to such things id have been indignant sejanes nodded it would be difficult to find such a situation again he observed stroking his chin with one hand indeed it is quite surprising that you were in that situation during the first cataclysm the only reason they had shields like that was because of the war with maar i dont know of any temples now with that kind of protection need went on or to be more honest i dont know of any that would offer me shelter i might as well be doing something useful and i just might be able to save myself while doing it do you fear death so much karal asked softly light rippled across the surface of the sword as if need reacted to that question firesong expected a sarcastic reply or none at all but was surprised by both her answer and her sober tone i dont fear death youngling she said with great honesty what im afraid of is more complicated than that i dont want to vanish without fighting i dont intend to just lie down and accept death passively there is the possibility that i could meet my end violently and if that is the case then it would be better here sejanes said with finality as a chill crept up firesongs spine if there is a second cataclysm and the effect penetrates this place your demise will be insignificant compared to the violence that will be unleashed light rippled along the surface of the blade again good youd already considered thatneed sounded relieved id hoped i wouldnt be the bird of ill omen forced to point that out to you i would rather hope we can pull this off right to the very end thank you no just the one who forced us to think about it a little earlier than we wanted to firesong sighed now she gave him one of her typical sardonic chuckles consider it incentive to find a solution she told him now of course those who had never met need wanted to speak with her firesong handed her over to andesha for that although he was quite aware that she was not going to change her mind about her choice of a bearer somewhat to his surprise karal separated himself from the group for a moment and approached him im not quite sure what to say except that i know it isnt going to be easy or very entertaining to have need literally on your back while we work our way through all this karal said quietly ive had teachers like her they were very good but not easy to live with and you have my sympathy for what its worth thank you karal he replied with some surprise the last thing he had expected was sympathy or understanding from the karsite just trying tooh i dont know karal smiled crookedly believe it or not i like and admire you firesong we irritate each other sometimes but who doesnt and i never properly thanked you for what you did for me firesong found himself blushing hotly something he hadnt done since boyhood oh please he replied for once at a loss for words dont thank me we all karal shook his head i know very well what all of you did and i wont mention this again since it obviously makes you uncomfortable i just want you to know that its appreciated and you are appreciated andwell i think ive said enough considering that firesong didnt think hed be able to flush any hotter karal was probably right when the karsite rejoined the group talking to need it was a decided relief ahem this time the mindvoice was tarrns and firesong was very glad to hear it can i help you sir he asked looking down at the kyree who was in turn looking up at him with amused golden eyes the white hairs of his muzzle contrasted strangely with the youth in those eyes since virtually everyone else is involved with speaking to our metallic friend why dont we go have a look at those notes silverfox says you are so concerned with if this device is what i believe it to be then the translation will be a simple one and we may have some answers within a quarterday really firesongs eyebrows rose mind you this is likely to be the only case where the translation will be so easy tarrn cautioned and that is only because i am familiar with similar devices used by our gryphons i think this is probably an improvement on those devices allowing visions as well as thoughts and he stopped and shook his head until his ears flapped and we really ought to just see for ourselves before i make too big a liar of myself shall we firesong got the notes and spread the pages out on the floor in one corner of the main chamber he and the kyree bent over them in intense concentration with lyam taking notes beside them and before very long tarrn was able to determine that the device was nothing more than an improvement on something he called a teleson at that point silverfox joined them again and by the time supper came and went they had worked out not only the way to activate the devices but also how to make more provided of course that there were sufficient parts to do so there were some esoteric components that needed to be prepared beforehand and firesong wasnt certain whether or not there had been any of those components among the parts in bins on the workbench both tarrn and silverfox were of the opinion that although the kaledain could probably make more of these components eventually it would take a great deal of trialanderror to do so given the vagaries of the way the language had changed over the centuries well lets confine ourselves to activating the two we have firesong said at last sitting back on his heels and stretching muscles that had cramped in his shoulders and back if they work then we can see if we can make a third and get it to work with communication open back to haven that will give us more than wed hoped for open it to sunhame and were doubly advantaged we can worry about being able to build more of these devices from scratch later when we have the leisure that seems a good plan to me silverfox concurred rotating his head and neck to stretch out cramps of his own let me go and get one of the devices and bring it up here and that way we can actually test it over a little distance he looked around well need someone with mindspeech up here that would be tarrn i suppose that seems reasonable the kyree said agreeably we will also need a magesejanes perhapsto activate it and ill go down to the workshop and activate and man the other device down there firesong said getting to his feet he and silverfox descended the stairs down into the workshop silverfox took one of the two devices from the bench and carried it carefully up the staircase again the instructions for activation had been quite unambiguous and equally simple phrased in language that not even the passage of time had altered even a child had he both truemagic and mindspeech would have been able to follow the instructions it was obvious from the notes now that the reason these devices had not been put into use by urtho was that anyone could eavesdrop on conversations held with their aid that rather negated their value in a time of war urthos notes had made it very clear that maar had many folks gifted with mindspeech in his ranks and that he used it as he would any other tool firesong only hoped that communications sent through these telesons would not be forced into the minds of those with mindspeech if that were to be the case their use would be severely limited having to maintain ordinary shields was one thing having to put up shields against something like coercion in order to block these communications out would be very uncomfortable and for those who were untrained and unaware of their gift it would be impossible i dont want to drive people mad by having them suddenly forced to listen to strangers talking in their heads well there was only one way to find out for certain a very little magic was needed to help activate the device and none to maintain it once it was active there was nothing for magestorms to disrupt the device took mindspeech and amplified it using some resonance of an arrangement of crystals the trick was even those who normally would not be considered to have mindspeech would be able to use it also it only needed one so gifted on one of the two telesons in order for the trick to work that would mean that master levy could talk with one of his fellow artificers through the intermediary of a herald or a mage so gifted could speak with sejanes who was not hmm and if the device isnt urgently needed young karal can talk with natoli the idea delighted him now and again he had the urge to matchmake and this was one of those times it might be the strangest courtship ever on record but if it worked worry about that when you can get this ancient construction to operate he scolded himself and bent his concentration to doing just that a moment laterwell it seemed to be working so far as he recalled the notes it looked as if he had activated it but firesong if it had been a real voice and not a mindvoice the shout would have deafened him as it was it was excruciatingly painful aiii he shouted clapping his hands over his ears even though he knew that wasnt going to make a difference sorry that was a more normal volume although there was no sound involved is that better he didnt recognize the mindvoice it certainly wasnt tarrn it also sounded rather odd and he couldnt tell why who is this he sent back cautiously so as not to blast their minds sejanes i must say this is an interesting way to speak firesong blinked for a moment both to clear his thoughts and to try to pinpoint just why the mindvoice felt so strange the mental images wait thats it there are no mental images theres no emotional flavor no images no leaking over of other thoughts this is just like speaking not like mindspeech at all and that for those who were not gifted and not used to sorting through the wealth of additional information that came along with mindsent words would be a good thing i believe we have a workable pair of prototypes he sent back with glee his elation was matched by the others after making certain that both devices were working according to the notes and that all of the components were wellseated the consensus was that they had earned a real respite but before they took that wellearned rest everyone gifted and not had a try at the teleson pair the notes were correct so long as one of the operators was gifted the result was the same crisp clear mindspeech with no overtones of anything else if both were gifted then the results were different precisely like normal mindspeech to firesongs relief there was no spillover from the devices to those who were gifted although as urtho had indicated the gifted could listen in with perfect ease when the devices were in use right now that might be an advantage it certainly wouldnt hurt to have more than two people at each mindsent conference altra had recovered enough from his last jumps to take the device to valdemar immediately and insisted on doing just that then and there he saw no reason whatsoever to delay and every reason to make all speed with every mark that passes it is more difficult to jump he said firmly why wait it will be easier to jump with an inanimate object but easier does not mean easy i want to get this over with there were no dissenting voices so as soon as the mindmirror teleson had been wrapped in a cushion of quilts to keep it from any possibility of damage altra left saying that he thought he would return in four days well know if the device still works or if it works at the distances that urtho claimed in two days of course sejanes observed as they all prepared for sleep not that any of them really thought he would get much sleep after all the excitement that day in two days hell be in haven and then it will just be a matter of getting one of the heralds to try calling us he crept into his own bedthe only one that was a bed since it was not possible for him to get into and out of a pallet on the floor or one of us can call them karal pointed out and yawned he was already in his bedroll with florian curled up at his back taking the place of altra as a living bedwarmer you know i was really excited a couple of marks ago and i thought id never be able to get to sleep but now he yawned again and looked puzzled now it seems as if this is an anticlimax firesong had the answer to his puzzlement well were all worn outits been a very busy daybut theres more to it than that he tied up his long hair to keep it from knotting up while he slept permit the old pessimist need interjected its not an anticlimax child its that this hasnt been the climax you think it should be we have a new tool and nothing more if those devices hadnt worked we would have gone on without them we will find the answers here if there are answers to be found but the teleson is not one of those answers and that is why it feels as if what we accomplished with them is only a minor addition to our work and not a major part of it ah karals face wore a sober expression of understanding i see what you are saying were not at the end of our work just the beginning and its not even close to the point where we can celebrate well thats a little disappointing but at least we havent fallen back exactly said firesong which is all the more reason why you should get a good nights sleep well need everyone in the morning he leveled a sober look at karal especially you i think well have work enough to make you and lyam wish there were four of you ill be glad to get back to work karal said with a weak smile and on that note firesong extinguished the lights with a word and it was not long before even he was fast asleep five what is the shinain saying darkwind asked himself as he watched duke tremane trying to make out careful plans for the time when the magestorms finally overcame the latest efforts to stave them off ah i remember the best plans never survive the first engagement with the enemy how has the empire done so well when they insist on having detailed plans for everything the three of them sat around a small table in the grand dukes personal quarters a table currently quite full what with papers glasses of water and maps strewn across it what do you two think duke tremane asked setting aside the plans he and the valdemarans had been discussing and leaning over the table as he looked up at them his graybrown eyes seemed anxious my scholars havent been able to unearth any more information about the cataclysm and my mages have not been able to predict anything that these magestorms have done elspeth grimaced i dont know that much either im afraid she replied honestly she glanced over at darkwind who shrugged slightly i can only tell you of the effects the cataclysm had according to our records and traditions he told the grand duke those effects were widespread and allencompassing all magic was disrupted from the icewall mountains in the north to the borders of the haighlei empire in the south and in an equal distance east and west of what are now lake evendim and the dhorisha plains if any shields survived the cataclysm i am not aware of it but i must add that the kaledain groups my people are descended from had none of the greater mages with them so shields might survive tremane persisted fiddling nervously with a pen oh how he wants to have some way to get his sort of magic back now that this area of hardorn was buffered from the worst effects of the magestorms tremane had given orders for some judicious use of magic to take some pressure from scarce resourcesmostly burnables the barracks and headquarters were all heated and lit with magefires and magelights now and about half the time food was cooked using magefires in the stoves it did make things more comfortable especially in the barracks which had been heated with dried dung and were hardly illuminated at all but darkwind and elspeth could both tell how much the grand duke wanted to be able to use magic for all of the things he was used to the only trouble with that idea was that it just wasnt possible to do so for one thing magical energy ran thin and low here ancar had depleted it sorely and it would take a long time to recover there was enough for lights and firesbut not for something more complicated such as blind scrying or creating magewalls to keep the boggles out for another hardorn was only buffered there were still slight effects and those were increasing a little at a time with every passing day darkwind spread his hands wide shaking his long silverstreaked hair back over his shoulders as he did so that i cannot tell you the people to ask would be the kleshya and they are somewhat difficult to reach at the moment he caught elspeths face taking on that slightly vacant look that meant she was mindspeaking to gwena and he waited for her to say something tremane was always forgetting that gwena was present in spirit if not sitting at the same table and the companion would hardly forgo a chance to remind him gwena says that she can relay an inquiry to skifs cymry at kleshya vale and get the answer back in a couple of days elspeth said her dark eyes crinkling at the corners telling darkwind that she was holding back laughter gwena had probably said far more than that probably about tremane and his faulty memory but this was a diplomatic mission and such things would not be diplomatic to relate there are enough mages there that surely someone will know the answer and she says if not then she can relay on to florian at the tower and see if andesha knows anything not every companion had that longdistance capability in fact there were only two in all of the world as far as darkwind knew one was gwena and the other was rolan the companion of the queens own they were special groveborn the heralds called it and claimed that instead of being physically brought into being in the normal way they simply appeared fullgrown out of a grove in the middle of companions field they had unusually powerful abilities in mindmagic and through most of the history of valdemar there had never been more than one groveborn companion at once but then again this was by all accounts both sacred and secular a crucial point in the history not only of valdemar but of this entire part of the world and if ever there was the need for a second groveborn companion this was the time tremane chewed on his lip and ran a hand over the top of his balding head you know he said cautiously the fact that those weapons they are looking at in the tower survived at all might indicate that some shields held wouldnt it surely there were very powerful shields on that tower at the time of the cataclysm and it might only indicate that things at the heart of the cataclysm had some natural protection like things in the eye of a whirlwind elspeth reminded him twisting a silverthreaded chestnut curl around one finger i wouldnt count on that i also wouldnt count on any of us singly or together being able to replicate shields created by the mages who lived back then these were people capable of creating living beingsgryphons basilisks wyrsaand i dont know of anyone living now who would even attempt such a thing darkwind cleared his throat softly to regain their attention to get back to your question about the effects of the original cataclysmafterward the natural flows of magic energy in those areas changed completely and we can only assume that the same thing will happen again and as for the physical worldwell we hawkbrothers are still healing the damage that was created in the wake of the original storms if you think the monsters that youve seen so far are bad wait until there are hundreds thousands of them when the number of warped and changed creatures equals or exceeds the number of normal creatures he drummed his fingers on the table for a moment as he made some quick calculations to give you an idea it has taken us something like two thousand years to clear an area approximately half the size of your empire of dangerous creatures and even more dangerous magic tremane brooded over his stack of paper for a moment so your suggestion would be elspeth and darkwind exchanged another look and it was darkwind who replied if our group at the tower cant do anythingwarn everyone you can reach create what shields and shelters you can assume that they wont hold and endure make your plans after you see what the effects are this time the duke made a sour face but did not respond elspeth tried some sympathy duke tremane i know this is difficult for you but at least you are in command of an area in which much of the magical energy has been drained away and which never relied on magic to get things done in the first place she pointed out you can count on most buildings staying up most bridges standing firm count on fires heating your barracks as they always have candles lighting the darkness and food cooking properly in a wellmade oven hardorn is prepared for everything except what the final storm will do to the physical worldand in a way you can even prepare for that simply by knowing what the last cataclysm did tremane sighed and rubbed one temple with his fingers yes i know this and i also know that this is not going to be the case in the empire things were falling to pieces so badly that when i mounted my raid on that imperial warehouse complex the men there hadnt heard from their superiors in weeks and nowi cant even imagine the state of chaos the empire must be in its just that things were difficult for us before and the one comfort i had was that i couldnt envision them getting any worse now i have to and plan for it somehow elspeth shook her head emphatically you cant plan for this tremane all you can do is to warn people of what they might expect and put things in place that will give you information once the worst happens the signaltowers for one thing they work almost as well as companions and you ought to make it a priority to get them manned by people who know how to use them you ought to make it a priority to get more of them in place if it is at all possible if every little village had a tower the way every village has access to a herald youd be able to get help to people long before a messenger could have reached you darkwind nodded dont plan for specific events doing that will inevitably prove to be an exercise in futility plan for flexibility you mean the duke considered that for a moment and nodded all right i can see that then he sighed and plan for communication put ways of bringing in information in place while we still can thats good as long as the trouble spots are places where there are still people living but if they arent there could be a nest of something brewing some monstrous creatures say and we wouldnt know about it until the creatures had wiped out an entire town maybe not even then he rubbed his forehead and darkwind saw the shadow of physical pain in his eyes in the tense muscles of his homely face i just wish there was a way to watch the land he said fretfully i used to be able to get my mages to scry entire stretches of countryside and thats what id give my arm to have working again darkwind exchanged another look with elspeth what do you think this is the best opening hes ever given us if we can make him believe in earthsense she replied with some pessimism still youre right it isnt just the best opening its the only opening hes ever given us you or me he asked me first just to open the subject im the local royalty the local herald and the local expert in mindmagic i could be expected to know about these things and know if the hardornens were just making something up you pick up if you see an opening to insert something you know he folded his hands on the table in front of him as she cleared her throat duke tremane she said i may have a solution to that particular problem and oddly enough it is a part of a proposition that the hardornens outside your domain wanted me to make to you on their behalf she smiled apologetically i think you probably were anticipating that the loyalists might ask us to serve as their envoys as well as envoys for the alliance we promised we would put their proposal before you at an opportune time but we promised nothing else that seemed harmless enough he looked up sharply and a little suspiciously a proposition what sort of proposition elspeth bit her lip and looked down at her strong wellmuscled hands for a moment they were hardly the hands of a pampered princess and darkwind had a suspicion that tremane had noticed this well its a rather interesting one it seems that theyve been watching how you manage things here and youve frankly impressed them there seems to be a general consensus that under certain very specific circumstances they would not only be happy to arrange a truce with you but they would be willing to offer you the crown of hardorn itself he looked as if she had hit him in the back of the head with a board it was the first time he had ever actually shown surprise the crown theyd make me their king what about their own claimants there arent any darkwind said crisply ancar was very thorough when it came to eliminating rivals we were told that there werent even any claimants on the distaff side apparently he didnt in the least see any reason to exclude his female relatives from the purges nor children nor even infants from all anyone can tell he went back to the fourth and fifth remove of the cousins by the time he was finished well you have as much right to the throne as any of the natives thats how thin the royal connections are we learned most of that when we were here last but i dont think it would be politic to mention that little trip tremane didnt exactly pale but he did look a little shocked and i thought that politics in the empire were cutthroat he murmured as if to himself then he blinked and collected himself so just what are these specific circumstances you were talking about and how will all this give me intelligence about what is happening to the land elspeth toyed with her glass of water this is where i am going to have to ask you to stretch your imagination a bit tremane she replied you know that mindmagic exists now that youve seen the members of our party use it he nodded cautiously you also have your own healers who use healing magic which is similar to but not identical with mindmagic she continued and you know that neither are affected by the magestorms which are disrupting what we in valdemar call truemagic im following you so far tremane said with a nod well as near as we can tell there is another form of magic which is like mindmagic and like healingmagic but isnt exactly either of them she told him leaning forward earnestly its called earthmagic and it seems to have entirely to do with the land the health of the land and restoring that health we think thats what hedgewizards and earthwitches use rather than truemagic people who are trained in those disciplinesso they tell mealso refer to their power as earthmagic and they call what you and darkwind and i are accustomed to using by the name of highmagic right so you tell him about hawkbrother healing adepts while i figure out how to segue this into the earthbinding ritual darkwind nodded very slightly and caught up the conversational ball we tayledras have specialized adepts called healing adepts who have the ability to sense the poisoned places the places where magic has made things go wrong and fix them again he told tremane who was sitting back in his chair with an odd expression that darkwind could not read and if you need evidence of how well this works it is in the fact that we have restored so much of the land to the precataclysm days the special ability that makes this possibleelspeths people would call it a giftis something we all call the earthsense its not just tayledras healing adepts and earthwitches that use this both the king of rethwellan and my stepfather prince daren have earthsense in fact she said taking the narrative back it seems that the gift has always been in the rethwellan royal line they havent needed it for generations but its obvious how useful it is when you know that even though daren was not familiar with hardorn and not ritually tied to the land here he could still sense what ancar had done to it when he came here to help valdemar drive ancar out that actually proved to be of tactical value since it gave us an idea of where ancar was finding all the power he needed tremane nodded his brows knitted intently and seized on the phrase that they had both hoped he would ritually tied to the land he asked just what does that mean the monarchs of rethwellanand i presume of hardornhave always taken part in a very old ritual known as earthbinding she told him because we in valdemar do not have that particular ritual i cant even begin to tell you how it works or why but when it is over every major injury or change to the land is instantly sensed by the monarch ancar obviously never participated in that ritual or he could not have done the things he didi suspect that as in rethwellan the earthbinding is part of the hardornen private rites that take place just before the public coronation ancar crowned himself without the usual rituals so she shrugged my stepfather says that those who even have earthsense latently can have it aroused by such a rite the point here is that the people of hardorn have found some of the priests of the old ways who know that ritual darkwind continued as she glanced at him to cue him to take up the narrative they think that if you were to be tested for earthsense and had it even latently that would qualify you for the hardornen crown and if you were to undergo the earthbinding ritual thus awakening the earthsense and binding you to hardorn you would be aa safe monarch for hardorn because you would be unable to harm abuse or misuse your land the way ancar did because harming the land would hurt me he lifted one eyebrow skeptically is he going to laugh elspeth sounded dubious and darkwind didnt blame her this was such a primitive unsophisticated conceptfor someone from the eastern empire so sophisticated in the ways of magic that its power was used for practically everything this must seem incredibly savage and crude but he didnt laugh and in fact he seemed to be thinking the concept over can you tell me anything else about this earthsense just what does it entail how do you learn to use it among my people it isnt very complicated darkwind told him you dont so much learn to use it as you learn to keep it from using you its rather like empathy in a way or extremely strong mindspeech you actually learn how to shut it out so that it doesnt affect you all the time interesting i can see how it would be inconvenient to be affected adversely by the very condition you are attempting to remedy his brows creased in thought and does it go the other way does the physical condition of the king affect the land havens no elspeth exclaimed for one thing the king is not exactly asas monumental as a country it would be like a flea stepping on a horse for another its only a sense like the sense of smell and she trailed off in confusion as darkwind shook his head i hate to have to contradict elspeth but thats not entirely true duke tremane he said feeling the need to be totally frank under certain very specific circumstances the health of the king who is bound to the land can affect the land he can in fact sacrifice himselfgive up his own lifeto restore the land to its former health this is something that my people know and that the shinain not only know but have even very rarely practiced i must also say however that i personally do not believe that the hardornens ever practiced that form of earthbinding as with all crafts there are scores even hundreds or thousands of ways to do them and nothing that they told us gave me any indication that they even know such a possibility exists and i must also point out that to be valid to have any chance of working the sacrifice must be a selfsacrifice entirely voluntaryand indeed eagerly sought by the sacrificial victim he managed a thin smile hauling ones king to the stone of sacrifice and spilling his blood upon the ground only serves as a sort of gruesome fertilizer to the local grass it wont change anything else without that will to be sacrificed tremanes brows crept halfway up his forehead as darkwind imparted that choice bit of information but he made no comment after a moment he stood up id like to go think about this for a little he said i assume you have a way of contacting someone if i make a decision i can find a contact gwena said firmly in both their minds we do elspeth told him then give meabout a mark he replied ill send for you if you have no objections since it had been a very long time since breakfast and this would provide an excellent excuse to send their imperial aide in search of food darkwind had no objections whatsoever and neither did elspeth with a polite exchange of bows they retired to their own quarters leaving him sitting back in his chair staring at the ducal ring on his finger clearly deep in thought they were about halfway through a solid if uninspired meal of bread and cold sliced meat and pickles when gwena announced that she had found the contact she had promised go to the hanging goose tavern after dark she told darkwind it will have to be you since i dont think that elspeth would be welcome in this particular tavern and if there are two of you he might suspect a trap elspeth exchanged a wry glance with darkwind and shrugged applying herself to her food you want to speak to the bartender who dispenses the beer not the one who handles the harder drinks she continued you tell him i drink my beer very cold he is supposed to reply thats an odd habit and you say i picked it up in the west hell nod and ask you what your message is he has a perfect memory hell pass it on word for word if tremane decides to take the gamble i suspect youll have your delegation priest included within a few days maybe sooner they might have moved someone into a village nearby hoping you would be able to offer him the proposition soon after we arrived i rather suspected that the loyalists had agents in the city elspeth said as she ate the last bite i couldnt imagine how they knew so much about him just from hearing things but this sounds as if the network has been well in place for some time it takes a long time to find someone with a perfect memory who is trustworthy enough to act as a message drop it makes me wonder if this tavern wasnt a contact point for other things she smiled suggestively at darkwind he chuckled i am just a poor hawkbrother scout with no knowledge of you city dwellers and your ways he protested what other things smuggling maybe possibly intriguing against ancar and ill bet the reason gwena doesnt want me to go there is not because i wouldnt be welcome alone there either she grinned at something gwena said only to her i thought so she reached out and patted darkwinds hand the ladies working in this tavern will be selling more than just strong drink and food my poor uncivilized hawkbrother i suggest that you make it very clear to them that you arent interested in their wares or you might bring something inconvenient and uncomfortable home with you that would require a healers help to clear up he grinned back at her and was trying to think of a clever retort when tremanes aide came to fetch them the grand duke was waiting for them when they arrived looking no different than when they had left him they took their seats and waited for him to speak frankly i am not entirely convinced that this earthsense you told me about really exists he said after a moment and i honestly do not think if it exists that i happen to have it it just seems all too very pat and too coincidental that out of all the people who might have been sent here i would happen to have this sense which is needed at this particular time he frowned a little its rather too much like something a taleseller might make up possibly darkwind replied but you might consider it before you dismiss this proposition outofhand if you take as your premise that earthsense does exist and that the extreme form of it could only be induced let us say by this ritual then the lesser or latent forms would be very useful to anyone who was in a position to rule even a small area having such a thing could explain why some landowners are more successful at managing their property than otherswhy some landowners have an uncanny ability to gauge what is going on with their property and people and why some have remarkable hunches that always prove correct i can see that tremane acknowledged so given that it is logical to assume that those landowners whose lines were so gifted would be more prosperous than others would accumulate more property and would eventually rise to higher and higher positions of power over the many generations darkwind persisted and in short it would actually be logical to assume that a man who had been a ruler of property or even a king would be so gifted because his predecessors could not have prospered so well without it tremane laughed out loud it was the first time that darkwind had ever heard him laugh and he liked the sound of it he often judged aspects of peoples character by their laughter tremanes laugh was open generous and not at all selfconscious i think that if you had not been born among the hawkbrothers you would have become a diplomat a courtier or a priest master darkwind he said finally you certainly can turn a fine argument now hear me out if you please darkwind and elspeth both nodded and tremane set forth his own reasoning you must know and they must know that with or without this earthsense if my men and i can recreate order hereas we already have done you might notepeople will come to my banner without the title attached to it that is the great secret of imperial success we wait until a land is disorganized and demoralized and then we move in offering peace order and prosperity usually people welcome us then when they see the high level that imperial prosperity represents word spreads and the lands we move on generally are halfconquered before the army itself ever reaches them that makes rather too much sense elspeth put in dryly he nodded his acknowledgment and continued tapping his index finger on the table to emphasize each point you must make it very clear to these people that no matter what happens i intend to go on holding this particular piece of hardorn from now on for myself my men and those hardornens who have accepted my rule and my order without any of this earthbinding business i think they are already well aware of that tremane she answered just as frankly but i will make sure that arrangement is openly acknowledged on both sides to be honest with you there is no way that you can be dislodged with the few resources these hardornen loyalists have at their command that would take an army the only armies large enough are those commanded by the allies and we are here representing the allies in a gesture of peace and goodwill so i dont think you need concern yourself about losing your hold on this place good just so that were all clear on that he toyed with a corner of a piece of paper for a moment i cant say that i really care for the idea of subjecting myself to this ritual it all sounds terribly primitive somehow but perhaps even if i dont believe i have this socalled earthsense the priest will be convinced that i do and will let me go through with this ritual even if it is meaningless frankly if that happens it would be the easiest and quickest way to get all of hardorn under my wing and it would be done with absolutely no bloodshed he smiled an oddly shy smile and darkwind had the feeling that it was a rare smile as if tremane had even less to smile about than to laugh about how could i possibly turn away that kind of opportunity in your position i certainly would not darkwind told him well is that the whole of your message tremane nodded and if youll excuse me i have matters regarding my men to see to my aide can escort you back to your quarters and if there is anywhere in the city you need to go he can give you the proper directions that wont be necessary gwena said thank you darkwind replied without giving any indication that he would take tremane up on his offer once again after a polite exchange of bows they departed for their own quarters elspeth had a thoughtful look on her face but waited until they were alone again before saying anything she stood with her back to the castironandbrick stove holding the magefire warming herself at it a real fire also burned on the hearth and between the two their rooms were as comfortable as any in valdemar but the hallways of this fortified manor were still cold despite the addition of such stoves and they both tended to get chilled going from their quarters to tremanes there was no doubt that this was one of the worst winters that hardorn had ever experienced even without the effect of the magestorms the main difference in the weather now that the magestorms had abated according to their aide was that now there were only snowstorms not killing blizzards every two weeks or so with the incredible blanket of snow covering the ground the sun couldnt even begin to melt it before another layer fell the modified heralds whites that the hertasi had designed for her seemed particularly wellsuited to the icy landscape outside he wondered what the imperial soldiers thought when they saw her did they believe that her costume was meant to reflect the season as tayledras scout gear did you know elspeth said finally in tayledras this situation has some interesting parallels in the history of valdemarthe founding specifically oh darkwind joined her hands outstretched to the warm stove wishing that there was something like a hawkbrother hot spring or soaking pool about it never seemed possible to be entirely warm except in bed he responded in the same language i wasnt aware of that well valdemar was fleeing the empire rather than serving it when he and his followers trekked out in this direction but when he got to the point where haven is now and started building he actually built beside an existing village elspeth replied turning to face the stove and rubbing her hands together the locals there were not entirely thrilled with having a foreign power moving in although they never actually opposed him but once they saw the advantages of coming under his protectionand the way in which his own followers were treatedthey began to act the way the hardornens are with tremane and eventually of course they insisted that he call himself a king she chuckled that was really rather funny it seemed that every little petty ruler for leagues in every direction was calling himself a king and his own people were embarrassed to be led by a mere baron they had a crown made up called in a priest to concoct a ceremony and had him crowned before he had a chance to object i gather that he was rather startled by it all darkwind laughed that may be the first time ive ever heard of someone being tricked into becoming a king he responded but youre right i do see the parallels there she stared at the stove frowning i think we can assume that tremane is going to be offered the crown no matter what i think that is a foregone conclusion yes lover dark wind admitted even if he doesnt have earthsense the priest may perform the binding anyway just to make him eligible i think he was right about that she sighed and nodded the next question may be how we arrange for there to be the same cheeks on the king of hardorn that there are on the son of the sun the king of rethwellan and the queen of valdemar solaris has to answer to vkandis faram has both the earthbinding and his familys sword to contend with and selenay has her companion she chewed her lip then againwe may already have those checks partially in place solaris did curse him with speaking only the truth after all yes but not the whole truth he reminded her there are ways of lying simply by not telling all of the truth she grimaced and turned away from the warmth to pace the room as she often did when she was thinking you may think im going mad but im beginning to agree with young karal i think this man has a basically good nature that entire interview about the assassins when we first arrived darkwind nodded for he had come away with the same impression out of that interview that tremane was a man who would bear the dreadful burden of indirectly ordering the deaths of innocent people and he would feel guilt about that for the rest of his life real guilt not feigned and it didnt matter that he had good reason at the time for his actions what mattered was that he himself had changed over the course of these several months what had been acceptable to him before no longer was but darkwind also was aware that the man could be a very good actor most rulers were to a greater or lesser extent i still have some reservations he said after a moment what occurred in the past is immutable he has done terrible things to us and without any provocation perhaps he has regrets now but i find myself wondering if he might not revert to his old ways under pressure she sighed i think wed better continue this conversation in a way that cant be overheard she cautioned good idea sejanes had some magical way of learning valdemaran and other tongues there might be someone else here who can do the same thing granted there might not be enough mageenergy for them to do so but why take the chance we tayledras are more suspicious than any other race i think but i wish i knew if it was tremanes better nature that had been subverted by the expediency of the empire or his expedient nature that has chosen to disguise itself as a good heart forwell hes in a position to do everyone more good than harm right now gwena pointed out joining the conversation gwenas right and in fact thats exactly what he has done elspeth seconded look at his record granted he coopted the best structure in the area for his headquarters but other than that he lives a relatively lean life for someone who is basically the uncrowned king of this area he eats exactly the same food as his men he isnt wasting precious resources on extravagant entertainments for his own benefit in fact hes pouring a lot of those resources back into the community here he never asks his men to do anything he wouldnt and hes usually out there leading them in person he thinks first of his men then of the local folk then of their land and their beasts and then of himself gwena put in that is the pattern that im seeing and honestly while some of that might be expediency it cant all be explained by that darkwind chuckled im glad hes not handsome id be jealous hes managed to seduce both my ladies away from me elspeth picked up an inkstand and pretended to throw it at him he ducked consider yourself kicked gwena retorted honestly kechara i would like to give him the chance to prove himself and the way he handles the next crisiswhich is going to be very very bad i thinkwill tell us what hes really made of elspeth replied darkwind chewed on that thought a while before replying wondering if they were all making a terrible mistake he wanted to believe in tremane and in the idea that the man was finally allowing himself to behave in a moral fashion rather than a calculated one how must it have felt to spend most of ones life having to plot each and every action without regard to whether or not it was ethically right if he himself had been in that position hed have been driven mad all right he said at last but i have one proviso his jaw tensed as he hardened his mind if he proves treacherous and a danger to the allianceif he is going to cost more liveswe take care of the situation ourselves you mean kill him elspeth nodded very slowly i dont like itbut i dont want another ancar much less another falconsbane hes used to using magic and it would be very tempting to resort to the bloodpath to get the power hes used to having she shivered and so did he they had both seen far too much of the results of that path weve done this before and id rather the blood were on our hands i suppose than find that even more innocent blood had been spilled it was a nasty moral trap when was murder acceptable but that was the moral trap that the tayledras had always been in darkwind himself had faced it many timeswarning trespassers three times and assuming that if they did not heed the warning they were in hawkbrother lands for evil purposes how many wouldbe enslavers of tervardi and hertasi mages hunting for yet more power for the wrong purposes and wouldbe murderers of hawkbrothers had he eliminated over the years enough that he had lost count elspeth only had a handful of deaths on her conscience but she was prepared to add another if the need was there and with any luck well all discover that our pessimism is unfounded gwena said cheerfully ill tell you what i will see if i can tell whether or not tremane has earthsense while you make contact with the loyalists darkwind my dear we need to rummage through your wardrobe and find something in it that will not scream foreigner to every person in the town what do you mean we horse he asked her darkwind found his messengerand gwenas careful probe of duke tremane uncovered only a verdict of maybe four days later their aide knocked tentatively on the door to their quarters just after theyd finished breakfast excuse me envoys he said when darkwind opened the door to him i dont want to interrupt but theres a religious gentleman below who says that you called for him elspeth turned in surprise despite gwenas assurance she hadnt really expected an answer to their message this quickly the man really must have been fairly close by that argued for certainty on the part of the hardornens that they had made tremane an offer he would find irresistible we have been expecting him jem darkwind told the young man we just didnt know when he would arrive if you are reasonably sure that it is safe to do so please show him the way up otherwise if you are not happy with a potential breach of security we can arrange to meet him in the town jem flushed oh no hes just an old manit wont cause any problems i just didnt know if you wanted to be bothered with him if he might be a charlatan or he flushed even redder realizing that he might have inadvertently insulted all of them thats fine jem please show him here and arrange for something hot for all of us to drink and perhaps more food he might not have broken his own fast yet elspeth said in her kindest tones the aide bowed a little still red with embarrassment and left quickly tremanes aides were far more used to military situations than to the diplomatic ones they now found themselves hipdeep in elspeth found it rather charming actually military men were in general much easier to deal with and much more straightforward than civilians the old man and the second breakfast arrived at the same time elspeth privately thought that she wasnt too surprised jem had taken him for a possible charlatan there was nothing at all remarkable about him his hair gray and a touch on the shaggy side looked as if he had not put a scissors to it lately his build was that of a longtime clerk whose parents may have been merchants or tradesmen of modest means his face square with a small beard was lined with care yet had smilecreases bracketing his mouth and eyes his robes and cloak were clean and serviceable but hardly impressive he wore no liturgical jewels and his manner was unassuming and cheerful all of which in her experience meant that he was probably a very good priest good priest like good leaders gave more to their followers than they kept for themselves and were not particularly conscious of appearances they introduced themselves and offered the old man who called himself father janas their hospitality as elspeth had anticipated he hadnt eaten and he applied himself to the food with a hearty appetite they kept conversation to a minimum until he had finished once he had taken his cloak off it was fairly obvious that like most hardornens he had been sharing in the hard times he wasnt emaciated but he was thin enough that he had probably been on the same short rations as his followers oh that was lovely he said at last when he had finished and leaned back in his chair cradling a cup of hot tea laden with honey im afraid that my besetting sin is that i cannot resist good food he laughed since we are supposed to be concentrating on the spiritual world rather than the secular world i suspect i shall be chided for my failing sooner or later by those to whom i must answer darkwind smiled at that i would rather say that you were showing proper joy and respect for the bounty of the earth darkwind replied and the old priest chuckled a twinkle in his eyes well shall we deal with the reason that i am here rather than engage in rationalizing my shortcomings he asked after taking a sip of his tea as i assume you suppose i have come to test duke tremane for earthsense which will mean that i will awake it if it is there and once i have done so i will bind him to hardorn now nothing i have been vouchsafed has given me any indication that he does or does not have the sense and i am quite sure that he has no idea what is going to happen do either of you elspeth shook her head we dont use that gift in valdemar or rather if we do it isnt used by heralds bards or healers and those are the only ones whose training im familiar with she said my stepfather has it but weve never discussed it much and he was never formally bound to valdemar ive heard of other latent gifts being awakened as a theoretical possibility but no one in my lifetime has ever tried such a thing darkwind shrugged as the priest turned to him the tayledras healing adepts all develop earthsense along with their other abilities he replied it doesnt come on them all at once and if anyone has it latently weve never bothered to awaken it i havent any idea how someone would react in such a circumstance father janas raised an eyebrow it can be rather dramatic he said cautiously assuming that one has it latently rather than having a very weak version of the sense that is we have always conducted this particular ceremony several days before the actual coronation of our kings precisely because of that it sometimes takes the recipient a good deal of time to get used to his new ability if heretofore it has only been latent and when actuated proves to be very strong elspeth nodded rather like suddenly being able to see i suppose she offered well that is all very well in theorybut you are here to put theory into practice how soon would you care to see duke tremane are there any preparations you would like to make any vestments you need to change into before you are presented father janas smoothed down the front of his robe selfconsciously much as i wish i could present a more impressive picture i am afraid that i am wearing my bestindeed my only vestments he licked his lips and looked apologetic ancar did not persecute priests and clerics directly but he found many ways of doing so indirectly i do not think you will find a single religious organization in all of hardorn surviving at better than a subsistence level and many simply vanished altogether as old members died and no new ones came to replace them he shook his head sadly at any rate it is all moot i have no preparations to make and i should prefer to see the duke as soon as possible as soon as he has the time free darkwind rose to request their aide to take a message to the duke elspeth had some other ideas however she wrote a short note while darkwind was talking with jem and asked the aide to take the message down to tremanes chief of supply on his way back from delivering their request for an audience to the duke jem looked baffled but agreed he was obviously not going to question why the envoy wanted to send a note to the supply sergeant just what are you up to darkwind asked her as they closed the door behind his retreating back and returned to their guest elspeth seated herself before replying tremane told me that he and his men had virtually gutted an entire imperial warehouse complex she told him as well as their guest now given how the empire likes to regiment things even though there is no official imperial religion i am betting that somewhere among all the uniforms brought back are at least a few standard imperial army chaplains robes or something of that nature and im also betting that they look pretty much like every other priests robes ive ever seen precisely because an imperial army chaplain would have to be able to conduct the rites of several religions hence the uniform robe will be as bland and as general as possible i follow your reasoning so far darkwind said still puzzled but why should the supply sergeant let us have one of these uniforms if they exist she grinned ive been talking to the townsfolk i know that it is tremanes standard procedure to sell anything in stores that is not immediately useful to his soldiers if a civilian wants to buy it youll find a lot of townsfolk outfitted in surplused uniforms of some of the odder auxiliary disciplines if you know what to look for i asked specifically if i could purchase a set of chaplains robes if there are any and asked him to send them up as soon as he found them she turned to the priest who was a little flushed well have plenty of time to alter them into something approximating your own vestments before tremane has time to see us father janas looked even more embarrassed really thats too good of you she interrupted him with a cautionary hand youre being generous and forgiving i know that this was a bit highhanded of me but we may be more anxious to settle this than you are and id prefer not to leave anything to chance the grand duke isnt even certain that he believes earthsense exists i suspect his attitude is more that he is humoring us than anything else we all want him to agree to go through with something he already considers to be mummery and we want him to agree to do it now the better the impression your appearance will make on him the more likely he is to do that darkwind nodded thoughtfully actually he put in using an imperial uniform may serve us better than if you had come with your own vestments he has lived with the chaplains he is going to respect the uniform and what it represents without realizing he is primed to do so father janas uttered a faint laugh in selfdeprecation well it is certainly true that most people rely on ones outward appearance for their impressions and i am afraid my appearance is hardly likely to inspire confidence his admission only deepened his obvious embarrassment and darkwind quickly changed the subject to that of the conditions over most of hardorn the priest was only too willing to talk about the hardships people all over the country had and were suffering and the spirit with which they were enduring those hardships everything you saw as you journeyed here is representative of conditions everywhere in this land he said with real sadness people are not starving but they are hungry they are not freezing to death but they are cold there is not a single soul in this country that did not lose at least one member of his family to unnatural death in the last five years and as you saw entire towns and villages have been emptied temples and other places of worship are deserted or tended by a few old men like myself worst of all we have lost most of a generation of young men and no matter how much better things become how can we possibly replace them who will be the parents of our next generation of citizens there are several thousand young men none of whom will ever be able to return to the empire camped right here elspeth thought and most of them would be perfectly happy to become the parents of the next generation of hardornens i wonder if hes thought of thati know tremane has at length jem returned with the answer from duke tremane he would be free immediately after lunch to receive the priest and if necessary could clear a good portion of the afternoon for the interview that would be wise father janas said as darkwind deferred to him please return tell him this would be very much to my liking and ask him to do so jem went back with the reply not long after he left one of the many locals who had been hired to run errands within the imperial complex arrived with a large neat package and a handwritten bill elspeth accepted both made a face at the mildly extortionate price the supply officer was charging but rummaged in her beltpouch for the correct number of silver coins anyway they were valdemaran rather than hardornen or imperial but the price had been quoted in silverweight and not a specific coinage given the circumstances she doubted that anyone would care whose face was stamped on them so long as the weight was true those she sent back with the errand boy as darkwind handed the package over to father janas just as she had suspected the official uniform of an imperial chaplain was once the rainbow of specific accoutrements for various religions and liturgical events were set aside virtually identical in cut to the threadbare robe father janas already wore it was even a very similar gray in color he retired to the next room to change and returned looking much trimmer darkwind surveyed him with a critical eye just what form does your deityor deitiestake he asked the priest forgive me but i think we need to make you look a little more impressive the priest looked confused but answered readily enough the earthfather and skymother are usually represented by the colors green and blue and by a circle or sphere that is half white and half black but darkwind had already turned to the pile of multicolored stoles and other accessories sorting through the plethora of plain and appliqued fabrics and came up with one stole that was green and one blue quick work with his knife gave him four halves two of which he handed to elspeth she had already divined what he was up to and had gone into the other room for her sewing kit a few moments later she draped a stole about father janas neck that was green on his right side and blue on his left but it was still too plain and she took it back from him while she cut halfcircles of black and white fabric from two of the other stoles to applique to the ends of the new one darkwind left for their bedroom and returned with a bit of his personal jewelry this probably isnt much like something you would ordinarily wear he said apologetically but it will probably do for now and tremane isnt going to know the difference between hardornen and shinain work he handed a copper medallion on a tanned leather thong to janas elspeth recognized it at once as the sort of token the shinain carried to identify themselves or their allies to tayledras she had once carried a similar token meant to identify her to kerowyns kin as well as to any tayledras she might have encountered this one was engraved with a swirling abstract pattern on one side and a deer on the other but a leather thong simply would not do now it was elspeths turn to go back to the bedroom and rummage through her jewelry copper what do i have that is copper when they had left she had simply tossed everything she owned into a bag including some of the pieces meant to go with the costumes that darkwind himself had designed for her a glint of copper at the bottom caught her eye and she untangled an interesting belt made of a heavy copper chain entwined with a light one she purloined the light chain to hang the medallion from then as an afterthought suggested to father janas that he use the heavy chain for the original purpose of a belt that was the final touch that he needed for the robe had been just a bit long on him now with the new robe stole belt and medallion janas presented quite a different picture from the man who had arrived he seemed to feel the change as well he seemed less weary stood a little straighter and with confidence matching his natural cheer all in all elspeth reckoned that they had put in a good mornings work it isnt precisely canonical janas told them but as you said no one here is going to know that and it does lookwellmuch more respectable in the sense of worthy of respect i cant begin to thank you enough thank us if all of this bears fruit elspeth replied firmly and speaking of which heres our lunch as usual it was rather plain fare but there was plenty of it jem seemed startled by father janas transformation but treated him with more deference than he had shown initially thus confirming elspeths feeling that the effort of reclothing the priest was more than justified jem lingered while they ate which all of them read as an indication that tremane was impatient to have the interview over with quickly spurred by that they made quick work of their meal i think we should let janas take the lead in this now she told darkwind i agree it will establish his authority from the beginning after all officially were only involved in this peripherally we were never more than the informal intermediaries darkwind replied elspeth signaled the priest with a slight nod as she set her cup aside he read the hint as adroitly as she had thought he would i think we are ready to see duke tremane if he is ready for us father janas said to the aide standing up and settling his new vestments with an air of brisk competence he is ready for you sir jem responded with all of the respect that any of them could have asked if you would care to follow me he then looked for a moment with confusion at the two envoys as if he had for that instant forgotten that they were involved clearly he was uncertain whether they should be properly included in the invitation father janas solved his problem i have asked the alliance envoys to accompany me he said smoothly if duke tremane has no objection jems face cleared as janas took the question out of his hands and he bowed slightly to all of them certainly sir if you would all please come with me all during the quick walk to the grand dukes private quarters elspeth was conscious of an increasing feeling of irrational excitement something was going to happen she wasnt quite certain what it was but this visit was not going to pass without an event of some sort i wish there was something more of foresight in my family than just an ability to get an occasional hunch she thought fretfully it would be nice to have some warning when a mountain is about to drop on us at last they were finally closeted with tremane seated across from him in three chairs arrayed before his desk this was not to be the less formal tremane was never informal sort of meeting that she and darkwind had been having with him of late he had arrayed himself as the grand duke the commander of the army and the local power he wore his uniform minus the imperial devices but with all of the other decorations and medals to which he was entitled he had both a crackling fire in the hearth and a magefire in a stove imparting a generous warmth to the room and a fragrant scent of pine resin to the air sunlight streamed in through the windows whose heavy velvet curtains had been pulled back to let in as much light as possible he had a choice of chairs to use here and he had selected the heaviest and most thronelike for his use the desk separated them from him like a fortress wall made of dark wood she was very glad now that she had gone out of her way to dress father janas appropriately if he had entered this interview looking as shabby as he had when he had arrived he would have begun on an unequal footing with tremane as darkwind had speculated she could see tremane responding to the implied authority symbolized by a uniform he recognized and father janas assumed his rightful position as an authority equal to his as for elspeth she was acutely aware of everything around her her senses sharpened by her anticipation her feeling was so strong that it was amazing to her to see that duke tremane was concealing a certain amount of polite boredom under a smooth and diplomatic courtesy if janas was put off by tremanes attitude he didnt show it duke tremane father janas said you know why i am here those who have led the struggle against imperial subjugation have heard of your defection from the empire seen how you have governed and protected the people here and have come to the conclusion that you at least are not necessarily an enemy to hardorn tremane nodded at this recitation of the obvious and waited for him to continue behind him a knot in the wood on the fire cracked explosively no one jumped janas had clearly rehearsed his speech many times until he was comfortable enough with it that he didnt have to think about it the consortium of loyal fighters believes that since there is no one man who has been able to become their clear leader and since no one in hardorn commands the resources that you do you may be the appropriate person to take up the defense of this land against outsiders and current adversity he smiled thinly i will not mince words with you duke tremane these men are willing given other conditions to allow you to purchase the rule of hardorn with the resources and men that you command he seemed a bit surprised by father janas bluntness that would seem reasonable he replied with care and i am certainly willing to put those resources into hardorn father janas nodded so i have been sent here by those men to discover if you are both fit and willing to lead this nation and help to defend it against those who would subject it to the rule of a foreign powerincluding the empire janas tilted his head in inquiry the fire popped again scattering sparks as he waited for an answer tremanes reply was brief but polite i would welcome the opportunity to prove my worth but i would like to point out that i am not and never have been a traitor to any cause it was the emperor and the empire who abandoned us here we broke none of the oaths that we had given but now that those vows are broken we see every need to hold fast to the oaths that we gave to each other and if in keeping those vows we aid the people here that is all to the good times are perilous and whenever loyalty is found it should be rewarded with loyalty his face hardened but any new responsibilities that i assume must work with my vows to my men there will be no conflict janas nodded and there was a great deal of satisfaction on his face in keeping with our traditions the ruler of hardorn must be possessed of the quality we know as earthsense and be bound to the land if he has that quality in order that your consent to be tested is informed i shall explain precisely what that means he went into a much more detailed explanation than elspeth or darkwind had done and in elspeths opinion tremane was a bit too cavalier about the entire thing she had not been certain until this moment that the test for the earthsense involved actually awakening it if it was latent and tremane was clearly preoccupied with some other thought as the priest explained that if he showed the symptoms of having the earthsense he would be expected to undergo the earthbinding ritual immediately perhaps his own statements to janas had reminded him of things he needed to deal with among his own people perhaps it was only that he was not inclined to spend his time on something even peripherally connected with religion she had the feeling that tremane was a man who gave secular respect to religious authority lipservice to the rituals and otherwise gave no thought to the subject and he considered the entire business of earthsense and earthbinding to be essentially religious in nature a matter of faith rather than fact he has already made up his mind that nothing is going to happen darkwind commented as he watched tremanes attention wandering he is good enough at reading people to know that janas thinks he can be a good leader for hardorn and i suspect he thinks that is the only test he needed to pass i think he has decided that janas will make a couple of mystic passes then declare he has the earthsense mumble a few phrases and say that he is bound to hardorn all without anything he can detect actually occurring i think hes making a mistake if thats the case elspeth offered i wish hed listened a bit more closely because i dont think he really knows what he might be getting into well it was already too late to say anything for tremane nodded with relief when janas finished and said please i am quite ready if you can begin now and janas was not going to give tremane a chance to change his mind for the priest stood immediately if i may come to your side of the desk sir janas asked and at tremanes nod moved around the desk until he stood behind tremanes chair and placed the tips of his fingers on tremanes temples before tremane had a chance to object the priest closed his eyes and opened his mouth before tremane could pull away from the unexpected touch elspeth started literally jumped as what emerged from janass mouth was not a chant but a single pure belllike tone the sound resonated through her filling her ears and her mind driving every thought from her head and rooting her to her chair she couldnt have moved if the room had suddenly caught on fire she couldnt even be afraid the tone drove out all emotion including fear it had exactly the same effect on darkwind who stared at janas with round vaguely surprised eyes but it did not have that effect on duke tremane beneath janas hands the grand duke stiffened and his own hands came up to cover the priests but not as if he was trying to tear janass fingers away from his head his eyes closed and his hands were clearly holding janass hands in place his own mouth opened and a second tone harmonizing with the first emerged from his throat the effect of the two tones together was indescribable and even as elspeth experienced it she was unable to analyze it she was suspended in time and place and nothing existed for her but the twonote song that resonated with every fiber of her body and soul in fact every sense was involved colors intensified and became richer and there was a scent of growing things and spring flowers filling the air that could not possibly have been there how long that went on elspeth could really not have said it took no time at all and it took forever the moment when it stopped was as dramatic as that when it had started for suddenly tremanes eyes opened wide then rolled up into his head his mouth snapped shut cutting off the tone he let go of janas hands and he collapsed over his desk as if his heart had suddenly given out elspeth was still frozen unable to stir janas stopped his singingif that was what it wasthe moment tremane fell forward for a moment he stared at the grand duke in something like shock shaking his hands as if he had touched a burning coal well he said finally he certainly has earthsense before either elspeth or darkwind could move the priest pulled tremane back up into the support of his chair and shook him gently until he awoke is darkwind began half standing janas waved him back duke tremane is simply suffering from the confusion of having a very powerful new ability thrust upon him the priest said in a preoccupied voice but there is nothing wrong with him i promise you in fact he may well be more right than he has ever been before in his life tremane was clearly still dazed as janas reached for a letter opener on the dukes desk seized one of his hands and stabbed the tip of his index finger with it he was so dazed that he acted as if he hadnt even felt the point of the blade piercing his skin janas held onto the dukes hand so that tremane couldnt pull it away and reached into a pouch on his belt pulling out a tiny pinch of earth he inverted tremanes maltreated finger over the bit of dirt and squeezed until a single drop of blood fell and mingled with the soil in the name of the powers above our heads and below our feet i bind you to the soil of hardorn tremane he intoned letting go of tremanes hand and seizing his chin instead in the name of the great guardians of the people i bind you to the heart of hardorn he continued and took up the pinch of mingled blood and earth in the name of life and light i bind you to the soul of hardorn and by this token you and the land are one he held out the bit of bloodsoaked earth to the dukes mouth tremane opened his lips to receive it and fortunately he swallowed it rather than spitting it out which would probably have been a very unfortunate gesture and a terrible omen janas stepped back watching the duke narrowly and tremane blinked owlishly at him for a moment then without any warning he made an odd little mewling cry and clapped both hands to his head covering his eyes with his palms now elspeth started to rise but the priest waved her back as well its quite all right he said with immense satisfaction i cant begin to tell you how well this is going he has the strongest earthsense that i have ever seen in someone for whom it was latent until nowand just at the moment hes a bit disoriented disoriented the duke said from behind his hands by the hundred little gods that is far too mild a description he sounded breathless as if he had been running a long and grueling race i feeli feel as if i have been deaf and blind and suddenly been given sight and hearing and i havent the least notion what the things i am experiencing mean or what to do with them he brought his hands down away from his head but it was quite clear from the bewildered expression he wore and the dazed look in his eyes that he was undergoing sensations he had never experienced before i think i may be ill he said faintly i feel terrible im going to be very very sick in a moment no you dont janas soothed thats not your own body youre feeling its hardorn the land is sick not you sick and weary separate yourself from it remember how you felt when you woke up this morning that is you and the rest is the lands ills thats easy for you to say priest tremane replied feelingly you arent in my head he was pale and sweating and his pupils were so wide that there was scarcely any iris showing but janas had already gone to the door and had called for tremanes aides the duke is not feeling well he told them he needs to be taken to his bed and allowed to sleep i think it would be wise to cancel any appointments he has for the rest of the day both aides looked alarmed at the state of their leader and one put a hand on the hilt of his weapon and cast a doubtful glance at janas suspecting perhaps that the priest had somehow poisoned the duke or inflicted a disease on him its all right tremane reassured them i think ive just been overworking its nothing serious as if that had been a coded phrase to tell the aides that nothing the visitors had done had caused his condition both aides relaxed immediately and went to assist their leader to stand you know that the healers have been warning you about overworking yourself one of them scolded the duke in a whisper that the foreigners were probably not supposed to hear this was an older man the dukes age or even a few years senior to him and the aide clearly considered it his responsibility to take tremane to task now look whats happened to you you cant work yourself half to death and not expect to pay for it ill be all right i just need to sleep the duke said vaguely and although he was not paying a great deal of attention to his surroundings or his visitors he no longer seemed quite so disoriented at least to elspeth it seemed more as if he had focused his attention inward in a state of partial trance his two aides helped him into the other room and janas nodded at the door taking the hint elspeth and darkwind rose and followed the priest out dont you need to be with him to give him some kind of instruction darkwind asked anxiously as they made their way along the cold corridors back to their own quarters the old man shook his head he still had that air of great selfsatisfaction no he already has the instruction that was what i was giving him at the beginning its all there for him to use he just needs to sort things out while he sleeps dont worryweve been doing things this way for centuries not just with our monarchs but with priests whose earthsense is also latent but i must say this is probably the most successful ritual i have ever done he rubbed his hands together with unconcealed glee now well have to get word across the country what has happened plan for a coronation find something like a crownoh there are a hundred arrangements well have to make he shook his head interrupting himself as they reached the door of their quarters i hope you wont think me rude but i am going to have to leave immediately there is just too much i have to do and not a great deal of time to do it in well be sending important people here soon as liaisons with our new monarch in the meantime i think i can count on both of you to help him through the next day or two i can certainly help explain what he is feeling elspeth replied but with a little doubt opening the door and waving him inside ahead of her i suspect it might be like the first time i wasahblessed with mindspeech exactly exactly janas said as he gathered up his old robe and made it into a neat bundle then he looked down in confusion at the clothing he was wearing and for a moment certainty was replaced with uncertainty ahi consider the new vestments a gift from the alliance darkwind said divining his question before he could ask it and please feel free to approach us if any of your other liaisons might need similar outfitting janas turned taking his hand and shaking it with gratitude thank you thank you for all your help he said brimming with so much effervescent pleasure that elspeth could not help but smile back at him now i really must be off there is absolutely not a moment to waste he hurried to open the door to the hallway fortunately one of the sentries at the door intercepted him and offered to find an aide to escort him out he accepted absently as he pulled his shabby cloak on over his new finery and the last that elspeth saw of him he was explaining to the aide some of the preparations that would need to be made to get ready for tremanes coronation as the new king of hardorn elspeth closed the door behind them and joined darkwind who was sprawled bonelessly on the couch she suddenly felt as if she had been running an endurance test and collapsed beside him well he said finally i confess i am at a loss for words i have a few she told him putting her head on his shoulder but mostly i cant begin to tell you how relieved i feel she turned her head so that she could see his face and he smiled into her eyes you know how the shinain are always saying to be careful of what you ask for he chided gently and you did ask for some sort of cheek on tremanes behavior as a leader i did she took a deep breath and let it out slowly i cant say that im at all unhappy about how this has fallen out this means the probable end of conflict inside hardorn theyre going to have a real competent leader he is going to be incapable of misusing the land or the people and i have the oddest feeling that he wont even be able to think about going to war with anyone unless hardorn is threatened first darkwind kissed her forehead then rested his head back against the back of the couch staring up at the ceiling at the moment i feel a great deal of sympathy for him this may not be a punishment commensurate with what he did to our people but he is going to be suffering real and sometimes serious discomfort for quite some time if i am any judge of these things because of the state of the country you mean she asked he nodded absolutely you heard janas hardorn is sick injured and only now beginning to recover he gets to experience all that until the land is healed again whats more when the magestorms start up again whatever they do to the land hell feel as if its happening to him she chuckled a little heartlessly i wonder what having bits of the countryside plucked out and transplanted elsewhere will feel like nothing i would care to share darkwind said emphatically she contemplated the prospect and it didnt displease her and she knew someone else who would find the new situation very much to her liking i wonder how long it will take to get word of this to solaris she mused aloud not long trust me gwena replied and oh to be a fly on the wall when it does as the officialunofficial liaisons to tremane on behalf of the rest of hardorn elspeth and darkwind found themselves dealing with a dozen requests the next morning that were the direct result of father janas work the previous day you know it is just a good thing that all this is happening in the dead of winter elspeth remarked to her mate as she dealt with yet another request for royal patronage from a merchant in the town if we were in the midst of decent weather wed have half the country trying to get here for this coronation janas wants to arrange darkwind had handed most of the correspondence over to her for the hawkbrothers had no equivalent to royalty and the pomp and display that went with such personages he shook his head i feel as lost as a tiny frog in the midst of lake evendim or a foresthare in the middle of the dhorisha plains he said ruefully now i know what your people mean when they speak of feeling like a country cousin i havent any idea what half these people want from tremane frankly neither have they she replied dryly royalty is rather like a touchstone to those who are accustomed to kings and queens and the like one judges ones own worth by ones worth to the king whether or not the king is himself a worthy person all these people are attempting to gather about tremane in the hope that some of the glitter will rub off she would have said more but at that moment there came a knock on their door when darkwind went to answer it much to her surprise tremane himself stood in the doorway guarded by his older aide and looking a bit wan might i come in he asked something in these memories of mine says that you might be able to help me sort things out that is darkwind waved him in the aide remained behind but with a look that said he would station himself at the door and not move until tremane left again the duke took a seat on their couch and elspeth made a quick assessment of him for once he was hiding nothing she suspected that at the moment he simply was unable to he was still quite unsettled disoriented and distinctly wild eyed she handed him a fragrant cup of kav a beverage the imperials favored that she had also begun to enjoy as much for the effect it had of waking one up as for the flavor you know he began plaintively when you came here i told you that i accepted this mindmagic of yours but to tell you the truth i didnt entirely believe in it you could have done everything you claimed simply by having two welltrained beasts and a clever set of subtle signals spirits putting ones thoughts into someone elses headthat was all so much nonsense and only the really credulous would have given it much credence his voice trailed off and elspeth nodded now for the first time you are in the grip of something you cant explain right she asked he nodded looking oddly vulnerable and forlorn magic is supposed to be a thing of logic he protested it has laws and rules they are all perfectly understandable and they bring predictable results this is all sosointuitive so unpredictable so messy darkwind started to laugh and the duke looked at him suspiciously i dont see what is so amusing forgive me sir darkwind choked but very recently a friend of ours who truly and with all of his heart believed that magic was wholly a thing of intuition and art having nothing to do with laws and logic was confronted with the need to regard magic as you and your mages do and he sounded just like you do nowthe contrast is just he choked trying to swallow his laughter and elspeth who recalled quite well how firesong had sounded had to work very hard not to join him that would not have done tremanes spirit any good at the moment when you have gotten used to this i think that youll find it has its own set of rules and logic and youll be able to deal with it in a predictable manner she soothed this is simply as ifas if someone had dropped all of the rules of mathematics and geometry into your mind and expected you to deal with them youre overwhelmed with information and i promise you that will change darkwind managed to get himself under control and took a seat next to the duke ill help you as much as i can he pledged i am probably the nearest to an expert until janas or someone like him comes back here tremane let out a sigh and began slowly trying to ask questions for which the vocabulary was as new to him as the concepts elspeth listened carefully adding what she could and relaying when gwena had any useful information to add poor man she said to gwena though not without a touch of faintly vindictive amusement the only thing more unsettling to him right now would be for the ghosts of his ancestors to come back to haunt him or for a companion to choose him oh now theres a thought gwena replied and at elspeths reaction of alarm sent a chuckle of amusement of her own dont worry the only way that tremane would ever be chosen would be for most of the population of hardorn and valdemar to be swallowed up by the earth and even then i wouldnt put high odds on it at least now hell believe us when we say youve said something that was a satisfying realization then something else occurred to elspeth darkwind she told her mate i think this is best treated as something like empathy janas may have put the rules for dealing with it in his mind but if the gift is so very strong he may be so overwhelmed by the sensations that he cant actually relate them to what is happening try taking him through ground and centering then shielding just as you would someone with strong empathy he nodded slightly and changed his angle of attack on the problem to elspeths way of thinking this was actually going to be easier than dealing with someone with empathy there would be no changes in what he sensed as people around him underwent emotional changes since what he felt from the land was quite steady with no sudden increases in intensity once he learned to shield he would not have to learn to strengthen or weaken his shields in fact he wouldnt want to he needed to know when the land was harmed and he couldnt do that if his shields were too strong she watched the two of them as darkwind coaxed him through his first exercises she came to the conclusion watching his rapid progress that there was more to what janas had given him than mere instructions once he had a grasp of the technique darkwind was showing him it didnt take him long to apply the technique correctly too bad we cant teach every young herald the way janas taught him she remarked wryly to gwena it would take an ability most heralds havent got gwena replied frankly and a bit enviously for that matter most companions havent got it either i didnt realize until now just how remarkable old janas is oh really that made her reexamine the priest and his mission in an entirely new light and wonder just what his real rank in the hierarchy of his religion was something equivalent to the son of the sun perhaps probably only someone like solaris would be able to tell for certain the only conclusion she could make was that the hardornens had left nothing to chance in this venture and had gambled a great deal but she kept all of this to herself it wouldnt matter one way or another to the situation and tremane had enough on his hands right now with this new ability and the responsibility of becoming a king becoming a king what a strange idea that is i cant think of any ruler in this part of the world who has been picked by his people sincesince valdemar the parallels were coming closer all the time tremane absorbed all that darkwind showed him like dry ground absorbing rain slowly the lines of anxiety and strain left his face and the signs of disorientation and illness eased from his posture and expression finally he sighed and closed his eyes with relief i feelnormal he said as if he had never expected to feel that way again he opened his eyes and darkwind smiled with satisfaction that is precisely how you should feel the hawkbrother told him you shouldnt have to think about those shields for them to be there since you are already acquainted with setting magical shields they should remain in place until you take them down or weaken them yourself now the only things you will feel will be when something happens to hardorn for good or ill youll sense the change as soon as it happens tremane colored a little and coughed i seem to recall some injudicious words to the effect of wanting an ability that would give me that information darkwinds smile turned ironic but he didnt say anything he didnt have to surely every culture has a variation on the saying be careful what you ask for you may get it well sometimes the hundred little gods display an interesting sense of humor tremane sighed theyve displayed it more directly than i think you realize darkwind told him are you aware that thanks to this gift that janas bestowed on you that you are literally bound to hardorn you cant leave at least not for long tremane shot him a skeptical glance surely you are exaggerating darkwind shook his head i am not you will not be able to go beyond the borders of this land for very long janas was not speaking figuratively as we both assumed when he made his explanations to you i know enough of magical bindings to recognize one on you and i doubt that anyone can break it this is the magic of a very primitive religion meant to ensure that a ruler could not get wandering feet and go off exploring when he should be governing elspeth watched tremanes face though normally opaque this experience had left him opennot as open as an ordinary person but open enough for her to read his expressions what youre saying is this earthbinding they put on me ensures that there is no possibility of going back to the empire darkwind held his hands palm up the most primitive magics tend to be the strongest the hardest to break perhaps a better word would be primal i suspect this one may date back to the tribes wandering this area before the cataclysm it was a fascinating piece of work to watch no chants no real ritual just a tonal component as a guide for invocation and of course the mental component simple but powerful and that argues for a piece of work that is very old and so proven by time that it is in fact a benchmark by which later magics could be judged as tremane sat there with a dazed look in his eyes and a numb expression darkwind warmed to his subject it really does make sense if you have a tribe that has recently settled given up nomadic hunting and herding ways and gone into agriculture it stands to reason that your best leaders the ones who are likely to be the most successful at defending your settlement from other nomads are the people most likely to want to go back to the unsettled ways if you want to keep them where they belong and give them a powerful incentive to hold the land in trust and not plunder and ruin it youd bind them to it i get the point all too clearly tremane interrupted dryly seeing as i am the one blessed with this particular application of primitive magic and now am prisoner in an all too clear way he rubbed his head with his hand absently no disrespect to you darkwind ksheyna but speculation about the origin of this bit of religious arcana is moot and it can probably wait until the happy day when everything is settled again and you and janas can argue about history to your hearts content darkwind was not at all embarrassed in fact he graced tremane with the expression of a teacher whose student has missed the point of the lesson but all he said aloud was duke tremane if you wish to know how and why a magic works the way it does you must learn or deduce its origin and purpose in complex spellwork the causes triggers paths and effects are not always obvious and are often fragile in more primal spellwork the variables may be fewer but they are not necessarily any more obvious you cannot unmake a thingsupposing you should choose to do sowithout knowing how it is made supposing i should choose to do so tremanes voice trailed off and he stood up to go look out the window i am not by nature a religious man he said with his back to them we rather gathered that sir elspeth put in her tone so ironic it made tremane turn for a moment to give her a searching look there is not much in the empire that would make one believe in gods much less that they have any interest at all in the doings of mortals he said looking straight into her eyes tangible effect is the focus in the empire results and tasks of the day take a distinct precedence over thoughts of divine influence or the spirit world the closest thing to a religion of state is a form of ancestor veneration which takes its higher form as the honoring of previous emperors and their consorts who are collectively known as the hundred little gods not that there are exactly a hundred but its a nice round figure to swear by id wondered about that darkwind murmured nor have i in the past been one to put credence in either predestined fate or omens nevertheless he continued since arriving here i have been confronted time and time again with situations that have literally forced me into the path i am now taking i find myself beginning to doubt the wisdom of my previous position regarding destiny elspeth could not resist the opportunity if you would care for some further proof that your previous position on the divine is faulty she offered i am sure that high priest solaris would be happy to arrange for a manifestation of vkandis sunlord it was wrong of her but after all that tremane had been responsible for she could not help but take a certain amount of vengeful pleasure in the way that his face turned pale at the mere mention of solaris name that wont be necessary he said hastily as you wish she murmured with an amused glance at darkwind well talk about fire to the left and torrent to the rightnot only does he have solaris curse of truthfulness on him but the hardornen earthbinding gwena sounded unbelievably smug but for once elspeth was in full agreement with her i do believe that grand duke tremane is going to be very cooperative with the alliance from now onbecause if he isnt he hasnt got the option to escape and he knows it and i just thought of another good reason for putting the earthbinding on your king darkwind sent silently as tremane turned back to the window if you bind him to a place so that he cant escape from it he has to rule well because he certainly cant ignore what he is immersed in lets hope thats one of the things hes thinking about right now elspeth replied he is a skilled leader and an intelligent man and he is certainly a pragmatic one it should dawn on him soon just how deep in he is right now and then he will have to accept it and deal with the tasks at hand for the sake of the alliance as well as of hardorn i want him to know he has no other option but to rule wisely and honestly we cant afford anything less six paper rustled quietly the only sound in the cold cavernous room baron melles read the last page of commander sterms report with a smile of satisfaction on his lips jacona the throne city was now effectively secured although the capital of the empire was not precisely under martial law his soldiers shared the streets and the patrols with the city constables and both were happy to have the situation that way he had tried his plan out here where everything was directly under his careful supervision and his ideas had all worked they had not worked perfectly but he had never expected perfection they had worked well enough that he and thayer were both pleased as he had predicted the price of staple food supplies had increased as the availability had decreased to the point where the average person either could not find or could not afford two out of three meals that was enough to trigger food riots his first shoottokill order and his second tier of plans jacona was already divided into precincts with an elected official the precinct captain responsible for arranging local matters such as street repair with the city that made organization much easier the citizens of jacona were now under strict rationing with so many ration chits per commodity per week each as arranged and administered by their precinct captains price controls went into effect with the rationing no one was starving and prices while high were no longer as extortionate as they were food supplies from the surrounding countryside had been assured and those ration chits guaranteed that everyone would have access to a minimum diet the chits did not cover luxury items only staples permitting those with higher incomes the ability to buy what they chose naturally there would be some citizens who would choose barter away their own chits and even those of members of their families for cash or other commodities such as alcohol and naturally the empire officially took no stand on this so long as those who were involved were adults a child was different and precinct captains were on orders to watch for children begging for food if they found a child starving and if its parent could not produce its ration chits or enough food to cover the household the child and its ration allocation would be taken away and put in an imperial orphanage that would be the end of that once taken away a parent could not retrieve a child and it became the ward of the state once it turned fourteen if male it would go into the army if female underdeveloped or sickly an army auxiliary corps or a workhouseunless it showed extraordinary ability and qualified for higher training but that was child welfare and had nothing to do with rationing naturally there were luxuries and larger rations available for cash and the empire took no stand on this either so long as the commodities for sale on the gray market were not purloined from imperial stores meals and services continued normally in the homes of the wealthy although household expenses had doubled in the past few weeks from what melles had learned from his agents prices on the gray market had stabilized which meant that the wealthy would simply have to work a little harder to maintain their wealth many of them had already begun investment in coal wood and other fuels or speculation in food items there were a few with newbuilt fortunes in the city because they had seen the trend of things and had moved accordingly there were a few who were ruined because their stockintrade consisted of small items that depended on magic or because they were dealers in items like festival costumes that no one wanted to buy under the current conditions but so far as melles could see aside from these few unlucky or clever individuals nothing much else had changed there were no more riots after the first serious one that gave melles the excuse to issue his shoottokill order and which had resulted in the death of a dozen fools who happened to be leading it there were occasional demonstrations and a great many speeches on street corners which were officially ignored there were also no more collapsing buildings or loss of service because magic had failed this was because there were no more services leftor buildings still standingthat depended on magic there was plenty of work though and the one large change was that unemployment simply did not exist anymore those who demonstrated or made speeches did so when their working hours were overunless of course they happened to be one of the few wealthy eccentrics who did not need to work to have an income where magical aqueducts no longer supplied water and there were no communal wells brigades of otherwise unemployed citizens with buckets brought fresh water from reliable sources to fill newlyconstructed below or aboveground cisterns an entire newlyformed corps of citizens with handcarts now collected garbage cinders and ashes from fires and animal waste from the streets and yards fortunately the sewers were nonmagical in nature and still functioned reliably life in the city was not back to the way it had been and never would be again until these magestorms were over but the ordinary citizen went to work received his pay ate regular meals and slept securely at night if he was colder this winter than last or a little hungrier well that was the case for all of his neighbors too but not only were his streets kept clear of dangerous riots they were also kept clear of vagrants and beggarsfor vagrants and beggars swiftly found themselves in imperial workhouses or work gangs cleaning the streets and carrying water for the good of the ordinary citizen this made the ordinary citizen happy what made him even happier was the fact that imperial workers were toiling day and night to find ways to restore more of the things that he had come to take for granted in the days of reliable magic already some things had been replacedsafe stoves that could burn a variety of fuels from dried dung to coal were now being made available at a moderate price from imperial workhouses imperial bathhouses and laundries had been established so that if a man could not afford to heat water for regular baths and laundry he could still have those baths and get his clothing clean for a few copper bits the average citizen could look forward to eventually regaining the kind of comfortable life he had lost and if he had to give up some of his freedom to get that life back well all but a few malcontents thought that was an acceptable loss some folk even welcomed these new workhouses and work gangs and were happy to see soldiers patrolling the streets and sweeping up those with nothing better to do than to make trouble it was true that crimes like assault robbery rape and burglary had dropped to almost nothing after the deadlyforce patrols had been deployed on the street level well assault robbery rape and burglary by citizens against citizens have dropped to almost nothing no one in his right mind is going to report a soldier or constable for such a crime and if there is no report there is no crime and hence officially no problem so far everything that he had set in motion in jacona was working well or would be with a few slight adjustments now was the moment to plan the next steps he put both elbows on the desk tented his fingers together and rested them lightly over his lips thinking he stared at the flame in the oil lamp on his desk that replaced the magelight that had once burned there the desk itself had been placed near to the antiquated fireplace which held a better more improved version of the official stove a contrivance of ceramic and steel that burned coal rather than wood more imperial cleverness that coal fires burned hotter and longer than wood and although the smoke coming from them was dirtier and might cause a problem one day this new furnace invention would get them through the winter all the fires in the palace and in most of the homes of the noble and wealthy had these furnaces and the coal mines which once produced only fuel for the smelting furnaces for the metal trade now sent huge wagonloads into the city on daily deliveries a variation on this furnace heated the boilers that once again delivered hot water into the bathing rooms of crag castle and other edificesand also supplied the hot water for the imperial bathhouses and laundries interestingly enough this entire situation was proving to be surprisingly profitable for the imperial coffers for not only was the empire collecting more tax money since taxes were based on profits but the empire was also something of a merchant selling heating and cookstoves and the services of the bathhouses theft of coal was punishablelike all theftby being sent to a work gang so were the crimes of inciting to riot participating in a riot looting chronic public drunkenness vandalism vagrancy and delinquency any crime against property rather than against a citizen now bought the perpetrator a stint in hard labor rather than jail or the army the new policy made for quiet streets tremane would never have ordered all of this tremane didnt have the vision or the audacity and perhaps not even the intellectual capacity to mastermind such sweeping plans on such a broad scale at such short notice melles continued to stare at his lamp flame but nothing in the way of inspiration occurred to him he reached for another much shorter report and leafed through it again perhaps before he thought more about the next stage of his plans it was time to deal with his covert operations all in all once the food riots were quashed there had been fewer complaints than he had anticipated and very little civil unrest that came as something of a surprise because he had assumed there would be a higher level of resistance to his new laws than there actually was so all that meant was the good citizens of jacona were being very good going where he led like proper sheep there were of course a few wild goats out there stillthe inevitable underground freedom movement which he had also anticipated how could there not have been there were always those who would not be hoodwinked into accepting restrictions on their freedom no matter how one disguised those restrictions the citizens for rights group correctly identifies you as the source of all of the new edicts and punishments the report written by the head of his network of lowlevel agents in the city read they assume that the emperor knows nothing and that with enough work they will be able to draw his attention to your abuses and have you ousted failing that and assuming that you somehow have the emperor under your personal control they plan on a general citizens uprising to overthrow the entire government that was also precisely what he had anticipated not only did it not alarm him he was actually rather pleased that he had predicted the development so accurately his agent was not particularly worried but he wanted more instructions about what to do now that he had identified the movement its goals and its members he picked up a pen and took a clean sheet of paper from the tray at the side of his desk he wrote in code without having to think about the translation hed had enough experience at it that he could write directly to any of his agents in the correct code this was a contentsensitive code rather than an encoded letter to all appearances this missive was a perfectly ordinary letter about commonplaces from a servant in the palace to a relative in the city what it really said however was something else entirely do nothing to openly disrupt the movement against me as for the general citizens continue to feed them misinformation concoct tales of my helplessness in the face of the emperors growing tyranny make them think that i am trying to stem the emperors excesses and that charliss himself is directly responsible for everything they object to what i want is to hear that even the members of the movement are starting to call me the peoples friend continue to identify all new members of the movement and if any really effective leaders emerge identify their weaknesses and find ways to handicap them without actually removing them keep me informed at all times he started to seal up the envelope then thought of something else and added a second page there are always bureaucratic mistakes men taken up in a streetsweep who were actually on their way to work outright victims of some soldiers personal feud these people will know of each and every onesend me the particulars so i can arrange for investigations and turn a few loose with restitution if any of them have young children suffering hardship without their father mark them especially now he sealed and addressed the letter and put it in the tray for his house agent to take to the appropriate drop that last addition was nothing less than inspiration all he would have to do would be to have one of the clerks deal with the paperwork to free the man and send the family a little money some luxury food items and a basket of sweets for the children and melles would be a hero on the street and he neednt trouble himself about petitioners plaguing him either now that he was officially the emperors heir the layers of bureaucracy between him and the citizen on the street were so many so complex and so labyrinthine that the average citizen would die of old age before he completed all of the paperwork required for an audience with him this would only generate a little more work in the way of petitions and there were plenty of lowlevel imperial civil servants to take care of additional petitions perhaps another man might have sent soldiers to arrest every member of the movementbut another man did not have the depth of experience that melles did as long as he knew who belonged to these organizations who were the real leaders and workers and what their failings were he was better off leaving them all in place in times like these insurrectionist movements were like cockroaches squash one and a hundred more would hatch behind the wallboards rebels actually tended to thrive on a certain level of persecution since persecution validated their cause in the eyes of others in fact many of them absolutely required feeling persecutedand speaking loudly of itin order to validate their own meager existence since obviously only a great good would be opposed by a great evil what made this even funnier in a cripplepitying sort of way was that they would only proclaim their oppression to those peers least likely to disagree with them melles of course played one facet of the same game on a much higher more sophisticated level people invariably polarized their views when they were given little information about a situations complexities if someone was not for your cause then they must be against your cause if not black then white if not day then night while the perenniallyoppressed would use this tendency in human behavior to generate sympathy from others melles used it to steer public reaction his actual plans and coups were more complex than could be briefly discussed by any layman and he used frontslike the labor groups and the policeto act as buffers and visible representations he created simple concepts for laymen to absorb and react to while giving little information about the greater more complex goingson thus even the most clever leaders of rebel movements would be basing their actions upon incomplete information at best lowend rumor at average and utter fabrications at worst worst for them anyway for melles it was simply human behavior according to schedule no he would watch them occasionally nurture them frustrate and thwart them and use them but above all he would let them have their little committee meetings and make speeches and inflame one another that kept them quiet and mostly harmless the more they ranted about being suppressed under improving conditions the less anyone would listen to or believe in them it was better to remove the occasional competent and dangerous member than to go after the entire group if he could not manage to do so in any other way the really dangerous ones would tragically die while defending themselves against a street thug or a house robber then before the person could be martyred various carefullycontrived secrets about them would turn up during investigation of the deathevidence that they were child molesters for instanceto spoil the probable public outrage there would otherwise have been and that distaste would carry over to be associated with any of the persons movement it would only take ten or twenty such instances for the general citizenry to feel relieved that these troublemakers were gone on the whole he enjoyed the amateur freedom fighters as delightful entertainment and if no group had sprung up he would have had to start one just to have an organization to attract the real troublemakers the most dangerous would be the very few individuals who realized that groups were obvious targets and determined to undermine the authorities on their own if he could catch someone like that it would be by accident but the insurrectionist groups had their uses not the least of which was that they gave the hotheads a place to vent their spleen when they were making speeches they were not setting fire to a storehouse of records counterfeiting and giving away food chits or breaking into a work camp and freeing prisoners better a thousand fools ineffectual speeches than a single food riot he moved that report from the pending tray to the completed tray and turned his attention to the next in line if conditions had not been so dire he would have been positively gleeful never had he possessed so much power over so many and the sensation brought an intoxication he had not expected report after report from the heads of his specialized covert operations rings around the city indicated that events were proceeding with as much smoothness as anyone could reasonably expect the only things that could not be planned for were the effects of the magestorms and he hoped he had made enough allowance for the chaos those could cause the precinct captains were political creatures and although they were elected he could replace them at his discretion they could and would lie to save their jobs the imperial commander was less likely to lie yet still might shade the truth to conceal problems his agents however were carefully picked and trained and they never reported anything but the facts no matter how unpleasant that was their job he rewarded the truthful and got rid of those who were notsometimes permanently if they had been in a delicate or sensitive position these reports confirmed his impression that the city was his pacified and lying quietly in the palm of his hand that was good because he had no intention of leaving the capital and he wanted it secured so that he could turn his attention to the empire beyond without worrying about his personal safety and comfort the power that gave him his authority was here and although by now he could carry out his plans if the emperor changed his mind and made someone else the imperial heir it would be much more difficult to do so he had the army but that might not be the case if the emperor appointed a new manand to subdue the rest of the empire he needed the army now that he knew what was working with jacona he knew what would work outside the capital he returned to the longer report that he had set aside this was the condensed version of what was going on in the empire itself in the immediate vicinity the countryside could reasonably be declared pacified as well the sources of disturbance were those of chaos rather than mans intentionterrible weather and roving monsters rather than rioters within the small towns and villages people were in no danger of going hungrybut they were terrified physical storms could sweep down at any moment bringing snow that could bury a village to the eaves winds that could rip a building apart blizzards combining the two that lasted for days at a time that was bad enough but in the midst of the storms terrible malformed creatures came ravening into their very streets monsters that no one recognized or knew how to kill on the estates things were sometimes even worse for most nobles did not keep many retainers who were trained to fight this close to the capital keeping a small private army was generally frowned upon so there had already been a case or two of a storm burying an estate and before the servants could dig it out again a bloodthirsty creature had appeared that kept them all penned insideand in one case decimated the entire estate one less annoying minor noble to endure the army was handling that situation with all the efficiency that anyone could ask for melles was both pleased and surprised to learn that general thayer had deployed squads of monster hunters before ever implementing the requisition orders that melless secretary had drawn up with scores of monstrous beasts hanging from hooks on display in village squares and estate courtyards people had not only been happy to donate the items the army requisitioned they had even come forward with additional help some truly antique equipages had been made roadworthybut also some very clever work had been put into the hands of the army as well some genius of a village blacksmith had come up with a way to fasten runners on the wheels of carriages after locking those wheels in place so that instead of having to wait until snow had been removed from the roads carts could skim over the top of it practically speaking what that meant was that the army supply trains bringing food into the city could use roads with a single narrow track cut for the horse or mule rather than needing to clear the entire road pity that the wicker snowshoe for horses didnt really work then we wouldnt have to clear the roads at all or even use the roads it is ironic that the poor are turning out to be the saviors of the wealthy for only they had the knowledge of how to do things in completely nonmagical ways other than that life in the countryside was not at all bad certainly better than in the city firewood was immediately available so was food in a greater variety than the cities were seeing now life on the estates was even better and melles was fairly sure that those nobles who had fled back to their possessions were byandlarge congratulating themselves for having had the wisdom to do so so much for life in the immediate vicinity of the capital now for the other large cities with a few variations it seemed that what had worked for jacona would work for any large city in the empire he had to make allowances for local religion in a few places and for one brand new cult in deban that had virtually taken over the entire city but for the most part there were not too many changes he needed to make finally he finished the last of the replies he needed to make to thayer and to his own agents in the field his hands were cramped by the time he was done and one of the servants had come in to check the fire and add coal twice despite the fire the room was icy for all its luxurious fittings it was less comfortable than a warehouse perhaps a sheepskin cover for his desk chair would help and a charcoal brazier for under the desk better still he ought to have his valet bring in the same kinds of amenities that the imperial clerks used he flexed his aching fingers and rose feeling the cold in every stiffened joint he knew with grim certainty that his battle with the encroachments of age was failing before all this nonsense with the magestorms had begun he had started on his own minor rejuvenation magics he resented the fact that they had failed him now at a time when he most needed his body to be in perfect health he simply could not afford any distractions yet what were all these aches and pains but irritating distractions reminders of mortality he went to the heavy gilded and carved sideboard where the blownglass decanters of liquor and special cut crystal glasses were stored his nose and feet were so cold they were numb perhaps a drink would restore circulation and make him feel warmer he was well aware that the warmth that came from liquor was a false fugitive thing but he wanted the comfort of it just now and the paindeadening effects that would ease his aching joints his valet entered impeccable and correct in his livery of black and purple just as melles poured himself a small glass of potent doublydistilled brandy the liquor gleamed in the glass with the deep glow of fine rubies as melles held it up to the light admiring its color the valet waited until melles acknowledged his presence with a nod before speaking his imperial highness has called a court lord heir the man said smoothly one arm already draped with a suit of court robes in anticipation of the fact that melles would need them would you care to change your clothing here or in your more private quarters melles sighed this was the last thing he needed right now he was tired and cold and really wanted a moment or two to warm up and rest before he dealt with another crisis but bors porthas would not have interrupted his working hours if this had been some bit of social nonsense no this must be something serious and he had better steel himself to meet it here will do no one was going to walk in on him unannounced and porthas bland selfeffacing incredibly competent porthas would have brought everything melles would need with him the balding little man with the thin expressionless face was a miracle of efficiency but that wasnt too surprising hed had plenty of practice in more demanding service before melles retired him to this his own retinue in fact there were a great many of the higher nobles of the court who would have recognized porthas face as that of their own valued personal servant forced by sudden illness to retire a fair percentage would have been shocked into speechlessness and a few would have gone pale recalling that they had sent floral tokens to the funeral of this particularly faithful servant porthas looked remarkably healthy for a man who had been dead at least three times and rendered forever incapable of leaving a bed on another five occasions he looked ageless in fact and melles was aware that not only could bors porthas perform every possible duty that would be asked of a valet he could also still meet and beat many men younger than he in a bout of swordsmanship as for his other talentshe was the only person melles would entrust with certain jobs besides himself that trim body was as efficient as the mind that was housed in it and just as lithe melles sometimes wondered if after all the years of serving as melles agent the life of a mere valet was stultifying but then again porthas was no mere valet any more than melles was a mere courtier he was the coordinator for all of melles agents in the city outside of the city and most importantly of all within crag castle he and melles alone knew the real names and identities of all of melles agents and in the rare event that melles would need to have a removal performed with precision and absolute secrecy if he could not for some reason perform it himself he would entrust it to porthas there was no one else besides he who was anywhere near melles in level of expertise at their mutual profession and he actually seemed to enjoy being a valet perhaps after all his other activities serving as a valet was restful and amusing he was certainly nimble enough at assisting melles into the cumbersome court robes he despised in sartorial matters porthas was not melles equal he was melles acknowledged superior and melles was only too happy to give way to his expertise when the last fold and crease had been arranged to porthas liking melles thanked himwithout overdoing it but making sure that the man knew that his service was noted and valued with a smile of satisfaction porthas gathered up the discarded garments and retired to melles private chambers the long walk down the castle corridors accompanied by the silent and everpresent imperial guards allowed him to rid himself of some of his irritation he knew that there was something in the air when he entered the throne room nervous whispering did not cease at his entrance as it often did and the iron throne itself was vacant melles made his way up to the foot of the throne and his own proper place as first in the court general thayer was already in attendance with a frown on his face that told melles he had no more idea than anyone else why the emperor had called this particular court into session the general was also in full regalia ceremonial breastplate gleaming over the somber livery of imperial army fulldress uniform his ceremonial helm with its jaunty crest of purple horsehair tucked under his left arm from which position he could fling the useless piece of potmetal at a wouldbe attacker while he pulled his notsoceremonial sword with his right hand on one occasion the general had actually stopped his attacker with the helmet before the man ever came within reach of his sword have you heard anything he asked melles under his breath melles shook his head and the general swore several pungent oaths his face darkening i dont like this he said charliss never used to call full courts without notice hes been closeted with a messenger or an informantand now he calls a full court hes not acting rationally anymore and the hundred little gods only know what he can inflate out of tiny rumors if hes heard something it wont be about us melles said smoothly we are proceeding splendidly and the lawabiding citizens of the empire are very happy with us and with the emperor look at the reportslook at the streets and he signed every law edict and change to procedure weve instituted with his own hands whatever he has heard it will concern someone elses activities and not ours at just that moment emperor charliss appeared draped in his own ceremonial robes moving slowly toward the iron throne flanked by two of his guards with four more following melles was shocked at his appearance although he doubted that anyone other than a highly trained adept would notice the level of deterioration in charliss protections and rejuvenation magics it only showed in small thingsin the careful way that charliss moved and in the signs of pain and illness around his mouth and eyesbut it was very clear to him that charliss was losing his personal battle against age and the magestorms and as thayer had said only the hundred little gods knew what that deterioration was doing to his mind in the past the emperors mind had been the very last thing to go all of the emperoradepts had died with their minds clear even as their eyes closed for the last time but that was in the past with magic working properly what if the reverse was happening and charliss mind was decaying faster than his body what if the poisons of age were pouring into his brain acting like insidious drugs on his thinking processes the emperor surveyed his court with cold eyes then placed himself in the chill embrace of the iron throne and regarded his assembled court again as if searching for signs of insurrection finally he gestured and a single weatherbeaten man in the garb of an imperial soldier stepped out from behind the screen of guards moving down the stairs to stand below the iron throne one of our agents has returned from the west the emperor rasped and meanwhile there have been petitions and questions brought before this throne some among you doubt the wisdom of our declaring a second heir saying that the rumors concerning the nameless one are only that and that we should wait until we had real proof before we acted we have brought you all here to witness this report so that you may see that the emperor rules over you because he is wiser than you the man stepped forward went on one knee before the throne and began reciting a report in a dispassionate and unaccented voice his report was virtually identical to everything that melles already knew and he didnt pay a great deal of attention to it granted he had not realized that tremane had looted the imperial supply depot in fortallan quite so thoroughlythe man had practically taken the very walls of the place and melles had to give him credit for the sheer audacity of the undertakingbut it was still hardly what he would call news charliss himself had known all of this hed made it public when hed declared melles as his new heir and there should have been nothing in these words to cause the emperor to feel the need to call a formal court just so everyone could hear it in fact there was something odd about the fact that charliss felt the need to address the petitions and questions of tremanes few friends in the court charliss had always ignored such voices of dissent in the past it wasnt at all like the emperor to behave in such a fashion anymore than it was normal for him to sit and listen to a report hed already heard several times over nevertheless charliss was clearly agitated by what he heard and grew more so with every word the agent recited then the man reached the part of his report that was actually new informationa speech that tremane had allegedly given to his troops the contents of which were very clearly treasonable melles was fairly certain that the speech was accurately reported in no small part because the agent kept referring back to notes he had taken held in a small book that he took from his beltpouch melles paid very close attention to that speech once he realized this was the reason that charliss was so agitated as the man spoke the emperors hands clutched the arms of the throne and he leaned forward with his eyes narrowed cold rage in every nuance of his posture this was a problem the old charliss would never have betrayed the fact that something angered him but this was not the old charliss if the emperor lost his temper violently in public it was possible that his competence might be called into question if that happened his choice of heir might also come under fire the last thing that melles needed right now was a court on the verge of deposing the emperor and finding a new and more tractable heir supposedly tremane accused the emperor of violating his own sacred oaths to the army he accused charliss of being the one who created the magestorms as a mad experiment in weaponry of mass destruction he told his troops that charliss deliberately sent them all out to be left in the area of effect of this new weapon just to see what would happen to them he claimed that charliss had then deserted all of them leaving them to face magestorms and hostile enemy troops on their own with no supplies no pay and no reinforcements lastly he declared that they would have to make their own way for the empire no longer cared what became of them a strong speech and one that tremane might well have believed himself certainly with no clear source for the magestorms one could make a case for them coming from the empire rather than the insignificant little nation of valdemar given that the empire had centuries of tradition of magic use and valdemar so far as anyone knew had none it would be far more logical to assume that combatmages within the empire had originated the magestorms in fact if charliss had actually possessed such a weapon he might very well have used it in exactly the way he was accused the emperor was guilty of such callousness so often that a great part of his anger might stem from the fact that he had been accused when for once he was actually innocent then the agent dropped real news rather than just relating a speech by working a team of mages together his group had managed to get a clean scrying on tremane until the last magestorm had passed through they had proof besides the speech of tremanes perfidy he had made common cause with valdemar and her allies against the empire he had joined the alliance and would soon be crowned the new king of hardorn the land he was supposed to have taken for charliss and one of the stipulations that the hardornens had insisted on was that he and his men imperial soldiers would defend hardorn against any further attempts by the empire to invade and conquer their land it was at this point that charliss exploded with fury halting the recitation in midsentence melles and thayer exchanged a startled glance for neither of them had ever seen the emperor react in this uncontrolled a fashion and the moment that the emperor paused for breathwhich was thanks to his poor physical condition after no more than a dozen ragefilled wordsthey both stepped up onto the dais and flanked him i will handle tremane lord emperor melles said before charliss could start again that is why you chose me and believe me he will live just long enough to regret his actions and i will deal with the traitors who decided to cast their lot in with him thayer rumbled they are imperial soldiers under my command and as such they will be executed by imperial hands charliss looked up at them both face still contorted with rage and started to rise melles again exchanged glances with thayer and nodded at the side door that led from the dais to the imperial quarters melles moved his head in agreement and each of them took one of charliss arms to help him to his feet the emperor wishes to confer with us as to the appropriate punishment for these traitors melles proclaimed as they got charliss up and standing between them it wasnt a good answer but it was better than saying nothing and far better than letting the courtiers make something up for themselves before charliss could say anything else they had him moving and once they had him started in the right direction he continued until he was back in his austere gray marble highceilinged private chambers wisely the guards did not hinder them perhaps because they knew that if charliss went into a spitting foaming rage in public it would not do anyone any good except the rumor mongers once melles and thayer got charliss into a seat however the temper tantrum they had prevented from occurring in public broke out in private charliss hissed spat pounded the arms of his whiteleather chair and probably would have thrown things if hed had the strength to rise flecks of foam dotted his withered lips and the pupils of his eyes were dilated the guards stood at the door eyes straight ahead pretending to be deaf most of what he babbled was incoherent and it was painfully clear that charliss had completely lost control of his formidable temper and of his ability to think if it had not been for the fact that he was so angry he couldnt even control his voice his shouts would have informed everyone in crag castle just how outofcontrol he actually was but between his rage and his physical state his voice didnt get much above a hoarse growl and much to melles relief he also could not get out of his chair to paceor to destroy the contents of his chamber as he had once or twice in the past decades he could only beat impotently on the padded arms of the chair as he cursed tremanes name and lineage back to the days of the first emperor he and thayer took turns trying to soothe the emperor with promises of personal revenge and imperial justice not that any of those promises had any likelihood of being fulfilled the agent had made it quite clear that there were no more loyal imperials with tremanes troops for one reason or another they had all defected over to him the only way to get at tremane now would be to send a magical assassinand that would take the combined abilities of several mages in light of all of the other pressing needs there were for the little magic that could be made to function a magical assassin would be an extremely stupid thing to waste time and energy on while it was thayers turn to distract the emperor melles sent one of the guards for his physicians and looked around for something that might serve to blunt the emperors angeror at least anesthetize him this was a fairly public room filled with gray or whiteleather chairs arranged in small groups with a white desk of bleached wood that was too clean to be used very often off in a corner and rugs made of bleached sheepskin scattered about on the whitemarble floor there was a sideboard of gilded gray marble to melles right that was even more impressive than the one in melles rooms it was loaded down with crystal decanters of liquors he recognized and those he did not what in the name of the hundred little gods would a drink as yellow as a buttercup or as blue as a berry taste like or one as green as new spring grass or did he really want to know probably not if charliss was used to entertaining the minor rulers of his possessions here he would probably keep a stock of every vile concoction that every peltwearing barbarian ever invented in the name of something to drink over the years melles had sampled a few of these and he was not eager to renew his acquaintance with any of them there were some things man was not meant to knowor imbibe by carefully sniffing the necks of each of the likely bottles he found a decanter of the same potent brandy he himself had been drinking when the formal court had been called he poured a much larger portion than he would ever have drunk himself and took it to the emperor charliss seized it in a clawlike hand and downed it without even blinking then threw the glass across the room where it hit the wall and shattered leaving sparkling shards and a few rubyred drops of bloodlike liquid on the white floor melles raised an eyebrow at thayer who shook his head evidently the general figured he had the situation in hand and didnt need to turn the emperor over to melles just yet melles nodded got another two glasses of the wine kept one for himself and brought the other to thayer then he stood back until thayer needed him his enforced idleness gave him plenty of time to think about the imperial agents report tremane had shown more intelligence and initiative than melles would ever have given him credit for and on the whole melles was impressed he would never have gotten the troops to stand by him if he had not come up with a story to convince them that it was the emperor who had deserted them it was an adept use of polarity and to somehow manage to make peace with the alliance and convince the very people he had been fighting against to make him their new rulerwell that was nothing short of a miracle melles would have given a great deal to know how tremane had managed that particular feat despite the fact that he hated tremane with an unholy passion and would happily have seen him slowly drawn and quartered over the course of a lengthy dinner melles knew that in tremanes position he would have done exactly the same things for all the faults that tremane had stupidity wasnt one of them he wasnt as brilliant as melles but he was not stupid either he was lucky though and he had used all of the facts he had to make some reasonable conclusions melles had access to all the imperial records and he knew for a fact that charliss had not given tremane support or orders for months before the looting of the imperial depot once tremanes magics began to fail he would have found himself fighting an unsupported war in unfamiliar territorysurrounded by enemies he would have had no advantage over the enemy without magic to help by the time the winter storms began it would have been impossible to retreat across country to the empire so just what did charliss expect tremane to do at that point die in place like a loyal fool out of the old chronicles men like that had gone extinct in the days of the first emperor probably because they kept doing stupidly loyal things that bought them early graves charliss could not have concocted a better scheme to get rid of grand duke tremane if hed triedexcept of course if he had appointed melles to do away with him not that melles would have minded at all if tremane had been such a loyal fool but the fact was that he was loyal like most men only to a point and after that point he saw no reason to repay betrayal with more loyalty and his luck must be phenomenal for he had managed to pull an amazing victory out of a well that looked to hold only the bitter water of defeat but then tremane always had been unaccountably inexplicably lucky fortune always smiled on the man and doubled the effects of his adequate competence that was part of the reason why melles hated him the liquor had enough effect on charliss to get him to stop babbling he still pounded the arms of his chair but now he focused on thayer detailing the excruciating punishments he wanted tremane and his men to endure before they died thayer did not bother to point out that tremane and his men were quite out of reach of any imperial punishments he simply nodded gravely pretending to pay attention when in fact he was probably just hoping that charliss healers would arrive before the emperor erupted into incoherence again finally the physicians did arrive and in a moment they had taken over from thayer swarming over the emperor pressing medicines on him urging him to calm himself since charliss energy had been fading as the strong dose of liquor took effect he was finally ready to listen to advice to take those medicines to allow his servants to take him to his bedroom and put him to bed thayer and melles took the opportunity then to make their escape thayer was in no mood to talk i was dragged away from writing out orders for troop movement in the provinces he told melles brusquely and i need to get those orders out whether or not emperor charliss has other duties he needs me for melles nodded hearing and understanding the things that thayer had not said it would be best to get as many orders out as possible quickly while charliss was otherwise occupied it was all too clear that the emperor was no longer entirely sane or stable the problem was not that he was disintegrating melles and thayer between them could very easily take over if he dropped dead this very night the real problem was that he was not disintegrating fast enough until he either abdicated or died the imperial guards would make sure he remained the emperor that was their duty and not only were they trained and sworn to it they were geased to it he would not be the only emperor to have gone mad in the last few months of his life the empire had survived such rulers before and truth to tell with the difficulties facing the empire now being ruled by a madman was the smallest of its problems at the moment his obsessions were harmless enough as long as he insisted on pursuing the twin goals of the destruction of valdemar and the punishment of tremane melles would be perfectly content if all that happened was an occasional interruption of work it would be a small price to pay to have the emperor harmlessly occupied and out of the way of real business charliss was an adept and he did have an entire corps of mages who answered only to his demandsand it was entirely possible if he decided to sacrifice all attempts to keep his antisenescence magics working that he could find some way to destroy tremane valdemar or both granted such powerful magics would probably kill him and most of his mages but that was to be expected and it wouldnt bother melles in the least he did not intend to worry about anything as far beyond practical reach as tremane and valdemar was even farther than that the real danger to melles and all he needed to accomplish was that charliss might recover his senses and his priorities enough to decide to meddle in what melles had planned that would mean nothing short of disaster for the emperor had his own nets of agents and spies that rivaled the ones melles had in place and he would know very soon just what melles was doing overtly and covertly most of it of course was simply good strategy but there was that tiny fraction designed to make charliss into a villain and melles into a hero and charliss would probably not care too much for that charliss would also have his own planswhich would not be a bad thing if the emperor was still sane but he wasnt and the situation was only going to get worse as time went on if he began to meddle he could easily undo everything that melles and thayer had worked so hard to establish something would have to be done to keep that from happening all that flashed through melless mind as he stood in the frigid hallway with general thayer he nodded slowly we both have work to do he replied we need to get our structure too solidly in place to dislodge by any force that was an innocuous enough statement but a brief flicker of his glance toward the closed door of the emperors quarters brought an answering glimmer of understanding to thayers eyes jaconas under control thayer replied its the rest of the empire that we need to think about now and with your permission ill get to my part of it melles clapped him on the shoulder and i to mine after all what is the empire but soldiers and civil servants of various rank the general nodded in agreement and the two of them went their separate ways melles hurried his steps to his own apartments with the determination to get enough in place that no matter what mad schemes charliss came up with it would make no difference he returned to his suite to find the everattentive porthas waiting ready to remove the uncomfortable court robes and replace them with loose furlined lounging robes and sheepskin slippers when he raised an eye at that porthas shrugged i assumed that my lord would be working late into the night and would not wish to be disturbed i had arranged for a meal to be brought here and declined invitations on my lords behalf for a card party and a musical evening even as porthas spoke he assisted melles out of the heavy overrobe the moment that porthas mentioned the card party and musical eveningthe latter of which would probably be some idiots wife unmarried sisters and unbetrothed daughters all performing popular ballads with varying degrees of successhe shuddered the card party wouldnt have been much better when he played cards he played seriously and it would be a dead certainty that he would have been paired with an unattached female who either bet recklessly or was too timid to make a bid you were correct porthas he replied as the valet eased him into the comfort of loose robes heated on a rack in front of the fire and i do have a great deal of work to do charliss actions today had given him the spur that he needed to make some fairly bold moves that long report on the state of the rest of the empire had left him with uncertainty earlier but it was clear now that he had no time to waste first the empire second the court thayer would have no part to play in that second act of consolidation he sat down behind his desk and pulled paper and pen toward him as he had already anticipated local leaders throughout the empire had already secured their immediate territories wherever possible in places where the situation had not yet been secured he had only to expand his existing arrangements and he wrote out those orders first the drafts would go to thayer before they went to the clerks for copying just to make certain that they werent going to step on each others feet but the plans were simply extensions of what was already going on around jacona porthas placed a cup of hot mulled wine at his elbow the fragrance of the spices in it drifted to his nostrils he reached absently for it and sipped it holding it with one hand while he wrote with the other the real challenges would come in dealing with those local leaders people who had made themselves the top wolf in their own little territories and would not care to hear from a bigger tougher wolf than they were somehow he would have to persuade them that he had authority and power perhaps in excess of what he really had and that it was in their best interest to begin taking orders from him if he couldnt achieve that objective he was going to have to eliminate them without direct confrontation and put someone more amenable to authority in their places he put the cup down out of the way while he contemplated his options the real trick would be to get rid of them in ways that would not be traced back and connected with him getting rid of people was never difficult it was doing so without leaving any tracks or signs pointing to who was responsible that was the hard part those clever perceptive and skilled enough to trace blame were few but devastating and all plans had to be made with the assumption that such a sleuth would be investigating though the odds were slim as with cards duels and death sports look at the oddsbut consider the stakes he picked up the report leafed through it and scanned the list of those local leaders and their brief dossiers again his agents were good and it was possible to get some idea of who would cooperate and who would not just from the thumbnail sketches of their personalities that had been provided to him he had a short list of assassins to chose from special agents who were adept at making deaths look like accidents or illness it was going to be difficult to get them into place given the current conditions but it would not be impossible with the help of the army he ought to be able to get any individual to the right location within a few weeks it would probably be a good idea to place his best agents on his most likely targets immediately rather than waste time attempting to persuade some provincial idiot with an overblown sense of his own competence if the blow came before he even contacted a given fool it definitely wouldnt be connected with him that would leave the agent free to take on a second target if a at persuasion of someone worth saving failed he switched ink and paper to the special colors of both that would tell these operatives that he had a job for them the note he sent would be commonplace greetings of course no special agent would ever trust primary instructions that came written this was a gamble on his part for many of these people were freelance workers when they heard what he had to say they might even turn him down although they would be paid more for these targets than any of them had ever gotten for a job before getting to their targets through the miserable conditions that existed now could be a real problem and again that was the privilege of an agent who was as good as these were you couldnt persuade an artist to make a masterpiece by standing him in front of an easel and threatening him with death it might be possible to pick off one or two of these provincial leaders with ordinary assassins and if he came up short on the number of agents he needed that was what he would do but he really would prefer it if all of these operatives found the jobs enough of a challenge to take them on they were very good he above all should know he used to be one of them as did porthas and he had even trained some of them in technique there was nothing like being able to call on old school ties as he wrote out his list of invitations it occurred to him that he actually did have a way to fulfill the emperors demands and bring tremane to justice provided that the justice came in the form of a swift sure blade or the sharp bite of poison there were three of these assassinsfour if he counted porthas though he did not intend to do without that worthys talents right here who could and possibly would go to hardorn and eliminate tremane magical assassination being out of the question physical assassination would take a year or more but it could be done he paused to consider it even though the idea did not appear to be a particularly good one there was a certain amount of personal satisfaction to be had if he could somehow kill tremane how had the man managed to wheedle his way into the hearts and minds of the hardornens it did not seem fair that his old enemy should come through a situation that should have destroyed him only to be made a king granted he would never see his home again and granted melles was going to be an emperor not a mere king nevertheless the prospect was galling it would have been satisfying to bring him down altogether porthas took away the cup and left a fresh one and a plate of sliced fruit bread and cheese in its place this was a subtle hint that he should eat something he took the hint and ate without tasting any of it he weighed all the considerations given that the agent sent out would be brilliant crafty and given every resource the likelihood of anyone from the empire reaching the center of hardorn was remote success would be remoter still for an agent of the empire without the magical aids that would enable him to study the people and conditions surrounding his target would be operating blind in a foreign land he would stick out like a single red fish in a school of green fish in a way it was possible to sympathize with the emperors obsession tremane should be dead at this point normally he did not give in to his own emotions but there was a sick anger in the bottom of his stomach that twisted and bit as if he had swallowed a viper and it would probably never give him rest he wanted tremane dead and he wanted to do whatever it would take to get him there but even when he had been an operative himself he had known that there was a point past which it was inadvisable to pursue your target no matter what your employer said or offered this was one of those times he got up from his desk and poured himself another drink ignoring for the moment the cup of mulled wine not brandy this time but a thick cordial with no alcohol in it made entirely of syrup and stomachsoothing and gutdeadening herbs he went back to his seat let himself down into the embrace of the chair and tried to convince his heart of what his head knew were facts when the enemy is dead to the world one inhabits he might as well be dead in totality that was something his teacher had told him and it was as true now as it was then tremane might as well be dead his lands and possessions were confiscated his name erased from the records and he could never return here again he would have to be content with a petty kingdom in a land of barbarians pursuit of tremane was a waste of resources which were in very short supply especially good operatives there was no point in wasting a man who could serve melles better elsewhere it was time to bury the past vendettas with tremanes name there was no point in following the emperor into madness every time a magestorm washed over them anyone with any pretensions at being a magician felt it there had even been clever daylight robberies timed to coincide with the onset of a magestorm when the owner of a building would be incapacitated the storms were bad enough when they came during the daylight hours but when they occurred at night when everyone was asleep they were worse for they became part of ones dream and turned those dreams into nightmares melles woke up in a sweat clutching his blankets out of a nightmare of tumbling through empty space but the waking reality was no better and he hung onto his bedding with grim recognition of what was behind the dream complete disorientation nausea the feeling that he was on the verge of blacking out and yet could not have the relief that unconsciousness would bringthis was a magestorm to him and he was profoundly grateful that porthas and his guards were not mages and did not feel these effects at that his own bouts with the storms were not as bad as those of some of the other mages he knew though he had not ventured to ask the emperor how he weathered these things he had a theory that the amount a mage suffered was directly proportional to the amount of magic he had tried to work in the interval between the storms if magic was tied to its caster and the storms disrupted magic it stood to reason that when the storms hit they would give trouble to mage and magic together as a consequence he had tried to keep from working any magic at all even giving up his own rejuvenation magics when they had not survived disruption when the storm finally passed and his dizziness and nausea vanished as they always did he let go of the covers and tried to relax back into his goosedown mattress with any luck the emperor would be indisposed today after his bout with the storm and with further luck the magestorm would send his mental and physical state plummeting again it was too much to hope that the storm had killed him but it was certainly possible that this time he might wind up bedridden that would be an excellent thing for then melles would have to stand proxy and speak for him it might even be possible to frighten him into stepping down and making melles the emperor he would not hope for it and he would not urge it for the emperor might well take such suggestions very badly it was a fine dream though and one he was loath to give up he closed his eyes and tried to relax in hope of resuming his slumbers but it was of no use he could not get back to sleep again he opened his eyes and stared up at the canopy of his bed or rather at the darkness within the sheltering curtains of the bed no light penetrated those thick velvet curtains nor would it until morning when the servants pulled back both window and bed curtains to wake him now that there was no magical way to heat crag castle one needed those heavy curtains around the beds to keep the drafts out just as one needed goosedown comforters and featherbeds and many blankets even then he often woke with a cold nose he was not a heavy sleeper nor a long one and never had been some would say that a guilty conscience kept him awake or the memories of all of his victims but the truth was simpler than that sleep in his profession was a dangerous necessity the one time when he was completely vulnerable and had to entrust his safety to others he had trained himself to wake completely at the slightest disturbance and once he was awake his mind leaped into activity whether or not there was any need for it once he was that wide awake it was difficult to get back to sleep again he wondered what time it was if it was near enough to dawn it was hardly worth fighting to get back to sleep only to be awakened again he shifted his weight and a scent of pungent herbs filled the still air porthas had ordered the servants to add those herbs to the bedding in anticipation of problems when the verminrepelling spells failed that was yet another example of porthas foresight hed seen some of the councillors scratching surreptitiously at the last meeting of the grand council and suspected fleas since these were some of the same courtiers who kept dogs or other pets and insisted on having them here at court vermin spread with or without pets to spread them unless one took precautions fleas at court well they were not the only bloodsucking vermin here only the most honest about it in some ways melles would have preferred fleas to some of the other vermin he had to deal with on a daily basis that led his thoughts immediately to the current problem facing him the court he had always known there would be some opposition to him as the emperors heir but he had not thought that all of his enemies would forget their own differences to unite against him his only solid ally was thayer in thayer he had the armybut not the imperial guards those were answerable only to the emperor and led by commander peleun who was not a great admirer of melles how peleun had managed to climb to the heights he had while still retaining a fair number of illusions about honor and fidelity was quite beyond melles but he had and he was already causing some trouble he didnt care for the idea of a former chief assassin as an emperoralthough melles was following in a long and distinguished if not openly acknowledged tradition he had preferred tremane who at least pretended to honesty and had a fine career in both the civil service and the military behind him more important than peleun however was councillor baron dirak who was in charge of the imperial civil servants he had been one of tremanes staunchest allies still defended him openly at court and was not at all pleased with melles rise to power hed had some hope of wedding a sister to tremane and was very bitter about losing that chance for power either of these men alone could have caused him some small difficulty but with both of them allied things could become serious and if his sources were correct they were maneuvering to get councillor serais head of the tax collectors into their corner he had to consolidate his power in the court there were other candidates for the iron throne many of them just as qualified as melles it was entirely possible that someone could send an assassin out after melles peleun probably would be horrified at the thought but dirak would consider it and there were others who knew how to contact the same list of special agents that melles used melles hadnt been able to contact them all and that meant there were at least a few toplevel assassins unaccounted for peleun could use his power as the head of the imperial guard to allow anyone he wished in to see the emperor at any time and given the right set of circumstances the end result of such an interview could be a brace of guards arriving to put melles under arrest with the emperors mind so unbalanced it wouldnt be too difficult to persuade him that melles was not enthusiastic enough in his pursuit of tremane that alone would be enough to get him arrested and replaced if he was arrested his enemies would have the leisure to concoct as much evidence as they pleased to prove whatever they wished and he would not be able to interfere it was possible of course that porthas would take up the reins and act in his absence but melles preferred not to count on such enlightened selfinterest it was far more likely that porthas and all of his special employees would offer their services to what they perceived to be the winning side he was secure in the city jacona was quiet and entirely his he had issued his orders and sent out his assassins and negotiators along with thayers troops within a few weeks he would know how successful he had been at taking the rest of the empire under his rule now while he was waiting for word from the countryside would be a good time to consolidate the court that was one thing that his enemies never counted on that he would continue to work on another aspect of his projects while waiting for results from the previous phase they always started on a phase and waited to see what would happen before going on to the next but that was a costly way to operate as for the courthe would order no assassinations at least not yet and only use it as a last resort if anyone died in the next few weeks even if it was completely an accident he would be the first to be suspected of initiating foul play but he had always used the knife as a tool not an end and the skills that had made him the emperors most successful agent included blackmail information brokering andof courserumor creation he didnt need to kill anyone to be effective it was more effective to keep a small but omnipresent fear of death in peoples minds than to actually deliver the blow itself peleun dirak and serais he would concentrate on those three who were outwardly his enemies the little fish were probably waiting to see who came out the victor and the bigger fish the equals of those three had not yet openly taken sides peleuns weakness was his fortune or rather his lack of one he didnt have a solid financial situation and he had been speculating lately in commodities he had been doing very well in no small part because he knew just what commodities were going to be in short supply thanks to his contacts with the army the army of course had taken over the cartage guild and although the army did not own or profit directly from the cargoes carried there were army records of what had just come in that peleun could easily get access to before the goods ever came on the market everything had to go through inspection weighing and taxation before so much as a grain of wheat could be sold and that took several days enough time for peleun to purchase goods that were going to be scarce before anyone else knew that supplies were going to temporarily dry up until the next cargoes came in that was a great weakness in the current market situation for there was no telling what might come in besides staples there was no way to effectively communicate back to the farms and estates so at some point it might be impossible to find an apple and at another there was nothing in the way of fruit in the market but apples all melles had to do would be to see that peleun saw the wrong records or completely falsified records and within a few weeks he would be a ruined man dirak was a very nervous gentleman timid and altogether afraid of his shadow perhaps that was why he had gone into civil service in the first place the current situation had him gulping handfuls of calmatives on a daily basis surely there was something that melles could do to further destroy his nerves and as for seraisdid he but know it he was the most vulnerable of all some quick work among the imperial tax records and hundreds of thousands of gold pieces that had never existed in the first place would vanish from the treasury of course the errors would eventually be uncovered but it would take a great deal of work and require referring to all the original tax receipts and serais reputation would be completely ruined by the time it was over with any luck he was probably skimming a little off the top anyway and when melles was through that would have been uncovered as well that wouldnt be enough to keep the court completely under his thumb though he had to give the malcontents within the court another target than himself just as he had done for the malcontents in the city it could not be a target for blame however but a target of profit and reward it would be very dangerous to blame the emperor for anything and there was no point in spreading rumors accusing anyone else of wrongdoing when those rumors might well be turned on him no with all the uneasiness in the court offering people hope and profit would be far more effective what would happen when the magestorms were over what exactly would the empire need how could those courtiers who remained here profit from the end of the storms if he could give them a directioneven an entirely specious directionthat would get them too busy to concern themselves with him last of all he and thayer should work together to at least make his position look unassailable perhaps by tempting one of his three targets to attempt to persuade the emperor to do somethingsomething that melles could come out againstsomething that melles would know the emperor would never even consider reliable rumors that the emperor was actually in favor of the given action would spur the target onward by urging something the emperor was against the target would label himself as a troublemaker and potential traitor in the emperors eyes he smiled to himself and what better action could there be than urging clemency for tremane he felt his eyes growing heavier and his body relaxing he had a plan in the mornings he would implement it now he could sleep melles smiled and nodded graciously as one of viscount aderins six unmarried daughters blushed and dedicated her performance on the greatharp to him he watched her attentivelywhich had the effect of making her fumble her fingeringsas she labored through a rendition of an old chestnut entitled my ladys eyes musical evenings were the best cure for insomnia that he knew but attendance at this one was important if one was going to plant information this sort of gathering was the place to do soa room full of very minor nobility all of them hungry for advancement all of them so eager for a crumb from the tables of the great that they would listen to and believe practically anything they would never divulge where their information originated in the hope that those they imparted their choice bits to would think that it originated with them and give them credit for enormous cleverness and none of them could be directly linked to him he did not mix with them socially except at extremely large gatherings like this one which he had been urged to attend by the emperors minister of protocol he was not related to any of them no one had any reason to assume that he had any reason to give them information for all intents and purposes he was here to survey aderins daughters as possible marriage fodder not to chat with aderins friends in fact the girls werent that bad three of the six were discreet and submissive able to entertain without embarrassing him unlikely to try to put themselves forward attractive enough to satisfy him and tractable enough to smile and ignore any little excess of his own he could do worse and very well knew it this was probably why the minister of protocol had suggested the gathering at least in part there was some nervousness among the ministers about the fact that he was not yet married and showed no signs of wanting that particular state there had been a single emperor in the past who had been uninterested in the opposite sex and there had been trouble during his reign that he could have resolved with a marriage of state but had not done so this had eventually led to a costly minor war and at the moment the empire could not afford a cheap minor war of course he could always make the ministers happy by doing what the sixth emperor had done with his reign starting on a shaky note and unwilling to offend anyone by picking one girl over another he had handpicked the daughter of a mere squire a very plain very quiet child and had educated her to be the perfect empress she had offended no one in his court because she had deferred to everyone she had every skill needed in an empress even the fact that she was plain had been valuable because it was quite clear to everyone that she was the emperors placeholder and hostess and nothing more the emperor had been able then to appoint dozens of royal mistresses over the course of his reign all of them enjoying the same status and he had threaded his way through many intrigues on the basis of which mistress he chose to favor at any one time that might be the best solution of all and if he had to make a state marriage eventually well the emperor could divorce his wife and remarry within a day and a night and an insignificant placeholder would have no family to make trouble later in fact such a girl would probably be very happy to retire from court with a generous settlement as he caught himself playing with the various possibilities of such an arrangement he sternly brought his attention back to the real reason why he was here he was going to plant rumors and he had better get about it before people began indulging themselves a little too heavily in the mulled punch to properly remember what they heard before the evening was over he had started a whispercampaign about serais and the missing tax money had suggested several lines of profit to be pursued when the storms were over and had hinted that when he was emperor those who confined their attention to conservative ideas and relied on what always worked before would take second place to those with innovation and creativity since these folk were among the lesser nobility they had less access to rejuvenative magics and hence the average age here was much lower than for the court as a whole melles knew that the one thing he could do to attract the support of little fish like these was to suggest that he would be more receptive to fresh new ideas than his predecessor this indicated that there was room at the topand that some old tired titles might find their council seats and ministerial offices taken by those who had been languishing in their shadow it had been a profitable evening and in addition he had managed to deflect any accusation that he was actually pleased at tremanes downfall by pretending to a low level of disappointment in his old childhood friend thus lending another layer of obscurity to his motives now there would be a substantial number of people with the impression that he and tremane had been friends for most of their lives rather than rivals so when he laid the trail to suggest that the emperor might be willing to consider clemency for the grand duke there would be people ready to believe the suggestion since it came from him this very evening a bright young fellow whod brought himself to porthas attention by his brilliance with both forgery and fixing account books had been smuggled into the tax office and was ensuring serais downfall peleun had invested everything he had to spare and some that he did not have in smoked ham bacon and fancy sausage certain that the cargo that had just arrived from tival was frozen fish not meat tomorrow the double caravan of smoked ham bacon and fancy sausage that had arrived from tival would go on the market and peleun would be very lucky if he could hold onto his house in the city and as for dirak well melles had something very special in mind for him besides being nervous dirak was devoutor perhaps it was better to say that he was superstitious he was about to be the recipient of a great many omens of bad fortune together with many minor mishaps that might lend further credence to those omens if dirak did not collapse with nervous exhaustion before the end of a fortnight melles would be very much surprised melles was feeling pleased enough with the way that things were going that he dismissed porthas early when he returned to his rooms porthas had been responsible for setting up most of what melles had planned for his three enemies and he was looking a bit worn at least to melles critical eye i can take care of myself for once he told the man im going to work for a few more hours then go straight to bed i would argue with you bors porthas replied rubbing his hand across his eyes but im too tired i know my limits and ive just reached them melles uttered a short bark of laughter good i was beginning to think you had no limits and i was wondering when you were going to set yourself up as my rival he was only half joking about that it was something anyone in his position had to consider porthas snorted no fear of that my lord you are a target i am not to my mind my position is the better one please sleep lightly and put an extra guard on your door my lord and dont try to dress yourself until i arrive to select your robes for the day i do not want a repetition of the day you wore the sapphire tunic with the emerald trews i would not be able to live down the shame melles acknowledged the advice with a wave of his hand and porthas bowed himself out since he would be doing without his valets silent attendance melles set his desk up with everything he might need to work before he ever sat down a servant would come in to mend the fire but otherwise he would be left alone at his own orders until he chose to go to bed he had been working steadily on followup orders for his agents in jacona involved with the freedom movement and similar but more general orders for similar agents in other cities of the empire he had noticed that the room seemed to be getting colder and had been about to ring for the servant when the servant finally came in bearing a metal hod of coal he started to turn his attention back to his work when something about the young mans posture sounded a mental alarm in his instincts he was already out of his chair and had slipped free of the cumbersome outer robe as he dove toward the floor when the first knife hit the back of the chair and stuck there quivering he rolled to his feet beside the fireplace and snatched up a fireplace poker as the youngster threw a second knife that he dropped down from a hidden sheath in his sleeve melles easily dodged that strike too and his lip curled with contempt arm sheathsthat was a trick for sophomores and sharpsters and against him what kind of fools were they sending after him anyway you might as well hold still old man the young one whispered pulling another knife from somewhere behind the back of his neck as he went into a lithe crouch youre going to die anyway so you might as well make it easier on both of us old man who did this young idiot think he was but the stupid speechso melodramatic and such a waste of breathtold him the kind of assassin he faced he had to deal with nuisances like this one at least once a year youngsters who thought they were better and faster than the old masters and would use any excuse to take them on he would have to kill this cretin he had no choice in the matter if he didnt make an example of the fool others like him would think hed gone soft and keep coming at him killing the boy would mean that the others would leave him alone for about another year but anger boiled up deep in his gut and not just because some young freelancer illtrained and without even a nodding acquaintance with discipline had decided to show that the master had lost his touch no this boy would never have come here if he had not been brought into the palace by someone who belonged here that meant hed been hired and that was an insult that was hardly to be borne how dared someone send a rank amateur against him did they think his reputation was inflated did they think he could no longer hold his own against even a boy like this one were they that contemptuous of him they were about to discover that it was not wise to tease the old basilisk they would learn that it was only pretending to sleep he rushed the boy startling him into skipping backward he was used to the flickering shadows cast by flames instead of magelights but the boy obviously was not as he passed his desk he feinted with the poker and picked up the tray of sand he used to dry the ink on his documents the boys attention was on the poker not on melles other hand before he could get out of reach melles flung the contents of the tray into his eyes then threw the tray itself at him the boy deflected the tray clumsily with one arm it hit him and clattered to the floor he could not deflect the sand so far neither of them had made enough noise to attract the attention of the guards at the door and melles had no intention of calling for help if the guards came theyd kill the fool before melles had a chance to find out who had sent him blinded and in pain the boy still had a few tricks left with his eyes watering he threw the dagger he held at the last place melles had been standing and rubbed at his face with one hand while groping behind his neck for another blade of course melles wasnt where the boy thought but had dropped down below the level of a thrown blade he lunged forward before the boy could register where he was and swept the poker out in a savage backhanded blow at kneeheight he shattered the boys left kneecap and the boy went down with a strangled cry who sent you he hissed angrily as he stood up slowly absently pleased that he was not at all winded the daily workouts with porthas had been more than worth the effort the boy responded with a curse about melless sexual preferences rolled out of the way of another blow and got his fourth knife into his hands at the same time no matter what youve heard i dont take any pleasure in that particular pastime melles said coldly by now his eyes had watered so much that the boy could see again although his eyes were bloodshot and swollen melles was in no mood to take chances even though he was facing a partially disabled foe so he watched the young fool warily the boy did not writhe or take his eyes off melles though the pain from his shattered knee must have been excruciating i suggest you tell me who hired you and save yourself a great deal of pain the boy inched away sliding over the slick floor while melles moved cautiously toward him this time the curse was a bit more colorful and less accurate melles sighed and shook his head as the boy got into a standing position with the help of a chair what did he expect to accomplish from there he couldnt walk his leg wouldnt hold him and if he couldnt walk his balance would be off didnt he know that was he so desperate hed try anything or did he really think he had a chance to escape melles backed up keeping his eyes on the boy at all times until he reached his desk without needing to look to see where it was he pulled the boys first knife out of the back of the chair weighed it in his hand for a moment to get the balance and threw it it hit precisely as he had intended in the boys gut with a wet thud the boy dropped to the ground again with a gurgle unable to twist out of the way in time as his own knife clattered to the floor perhaps the fool had thought he was going to try for the trickier hand shot that was stupid of him if he had a gut wound hurt more and wouldnt kill immediately melles walked over to the boy and stood looking down at him with the poker held loosely in one hand the boy had both hands on the hilt of the knife trying to pull it out his breath came in harsh pants and his eyes were glazing with agony who hired you he asked again the boy looked up and spat at him he sighed he was going to have to spend more time than he wanted on this squandering time that could have been better spent on his orders but there was no help for it youre going to tell me sooner or later he said without much hope for sense from this arrogant idiot who still didnt think he was going to die youll be better off with sooner this time the boy responded with a suggestion for an unpalatable dietary supplement melles brought the poker down on his other knee and proceeded dispassionately to inflict enough pain to extract the information he wanted in the end he managed to get what he wanted without too much of a mess and the answer made him even more disgusted than he had been at the beginning of the futile exercise duke jehan an idiot with just about as little sense as the cretin hed hired and it was not for any great ideological reason nor because jehan was avenging tremane or trying to put one of the other candidates in the heirs suite no it was because jehan had somehow gotten the impression that if he managed to assassinate enough candidates he would manage to be put on the throne because he was charliss second cousin apparently hed thought that if he used assassins to do his work for him no one would connect him with the deaths melles had no idea who jehan thought would get the blame if melles himself was gone but perhaps this wouldbe king of assassins had gotten his order of targets reversed and had gone after the last on the list first he finished off the mewling thing on the floor with a single thrust of the boys own knife threw the knife down next to the body and wiped his hands with a napkin contemplating his next move it wouldnt be enough to make an example of this boy or jehan would think hed gotten off undiscovered and try some other way of ridding himself of his rivals melles had acquired immunity to most of the common poisons but that didnt mean he wouldnt get sick if someone slipped a dose to him that would cost still more valuable time and might incapacitate him long enough for one of his real rivals to get in to the emperor no he was going to have to give jehan a real fright and make him into an example for anyone else at court idiotic enough to try something like this in the end it took all of his skill to pull the job offnot to get into jehans quarters without arousing anyone but to get past his own guards the nurse who was supposed to be watching in duke jehans nursery was easily incapacitated with a needle dipped in a poison that sent one into a deep sleep rather than death jehans oldest son slightly more than a year old sat up in his crib and looked with wide eyes at the stranger who came to lift him out and place him on the floor he didnt do anything more than babble though when the stranger gave him several pretty toys to play with melles dropped the body wrapped in a bloody sheet into the crib in place of the child and left the child himself sitting on the floor happily absorbed in the bladeless daggers that had been intended to kill melles that was a somewhat melodramatic gesture in and of itself but melles had the feeling that anything less wouldnt get jehans attention hed considered leaving the daggers whole rather than snapping the blades off but if the baby was as stupid as its sire it would probably have managed to kill itself with one of them while that would have been no loss for the court or the world jehan would have been so overwrought that the lesson would be completely lost on him and killing babies or allowing them to be killed was bad for ones public image melles slipped back across the palace and into his own rooms again feeling drained and no less disgusted he had lost most of the working hours of the nightand this late although he had easily gotten the blood off the stone floor with the sheet hed used up all the hot water in his suite to do so hed have to wash himself in cold water one more mark against jehan he put himself to bed chilled and angry but at least he was physically tired enough to sleep and hopefully his little present would prevent jehan and several others from sleeping for many nights to come it wasnt much in the way of revenge for him but for now it would do seven amazing silverfox shook his head and stepped away from the teleson crystal tossing his long black hair to one side if i had not seen this i would not believe it was possible i couldnt agree more karal said he had been watching over silverfoxs shoulder as the kestrachern spoke with treyvan the round crystal lens mounted on top of the teleson had held a perfect image of the head and shoulders of the fascinated gryphon and a thin but distinct echo of his voice emerged from the mattegray metal box that held the crystal cradled in a quartermoonshaped depression on its surface this was even more impressive than the time andesha had done longdistance scrying on grand duke tremane this was a distinct improvement over the original sets a little fiddling and the addition of the crystals on each set as well as the mirrorssimple polished lenticular lenses that any glassworker could makehad made it possible to have images and the audible voices of the two users all that had been in the notes that lyam and firesong had interpreted but the crystals had never been installed perhaps that was why the sets had been on the workbench karal gazed wistfully at the device which was now being used by sejanes and one of the new magegifted heralds this is quite amazing i wish you didnt have to have mindspeech to use it but you dont silverfox began or at least only one of you does karal only sighed very quietly silverfox looked at him askance with a question in his blue eyes but it was sejanes who guessed what lay behind karals comment youd like to use this to speak to that young lady of yours without any of us eavesdropping wouldnt you lad he said shrewdly karal blushed and didnt reply immediately trying to think of an answer that was noncommittal enough without being an actual lie well you need to use it to confer with the others back in haven he said nodding in the direction of sejanes firesong and master levy thats important and you arent is that what youre saying sejanes graced him with a skeptical look what you are talking about is important karal replied knowing that any declaration of how unimportant he was would only be met with a counterargument idle chatter with natoli isnt its not as if i really need to hear about what scrapes our friends are getting into or whos passed to the back room at the compass rose sejanes didnt counter that particular response instead he provided a different answer we wont be using this device all the time personally if there is a way i dont see any difficulty with you using it to catch up on news with the young lady he tilted his head at firesong andesha and master levy in unspoken inquiry all three of them nodded their heads completely in agreement with him we all know that you would give it up to one of us if we even looked as if we thought we might want to use it karal andesha told him if you could think of a way that you can make it work without an eavesdropper theres no reason why you cant use it too its not as if youre going to wear the thing out or use it up pish i can mindspeak and so can florian altra wrapped himself gracefully around karals legs and looked up into his face for that matter so can need we certainly wouldnt embarrass you would we the firecat says that he need or the companion could hold the connection for karal firesong told all of them karal started to protest then shut his mouth realizing that he was wrong on all counts and he might as well be quiet the others wouldnt need to use the teleson all the time altra and florian already shared most of his secret thoughts so why not these and there could not be any harm in talking a little to natoli now and then his cheeks and the back of his neck grew hot as long as you dont mind he said diffidently a snort from firesong was the only reply to that statement as a herald in the teleson watched and listened with polite interest shall i see if natoli can be found later the faroff herald asked if theres no one at the device one of the mindspeakers can project to you until need the firecat or the companion can come hold the connection i would think that would be quite satisfactory florian told karal and i think you ought to tell him that so that he can arrange for natoli to come as soon as the mages are finished ah florian thinks that would be a good idea karal said trying to control his blushes thank you he hurried away to find something to do before he got himself into any further embarrassing situations the most useful thing he could do was to serve in his proper place as a secretary and right at this very moment the only person who needed the skills of a secretary was tarrn the kyree was down in the workroom carefully describing everything before firesong and andesha took it all to pieces lyam had already made scale drawings of each workbench and now he was making notes while tarrn dictated he gratefully gave up his place to karal even though the notes would now be in valdemaran rather than kaledain tarrn didnt miss a beat changing his mindspeech from lyam to karal as soon as karal held the notepad and graphitestick karal rubbed his nose to keep from sneezing they had stirred up quite a bit of dust just in walking about it was amazing how much dust found its way down here once the hatchway was open why are you doing this sir karal asked when they completed one bench and moved on to another im just curious a number of reasons the kyree replied pleasantly later if we are trying to put together another device we will know what pieces were laid out on which bench in what order we will have a historical record of how the workshop looked if we ever wish to reconstruct it in this way if for some reason the contents of the workbenches are ever jumbled together we will know what tool goes with what project it is not always intuitively obvious karal nodded and made another note on the identity of an object all of that made perfect sense but it would never have occurred to him to make such detailed drawings or to measure the distance an object was from the edge of the bench in a case like this young scribe records are always important tarrn said the more the better once anything is moved it is changed forever perhaps that might not be important but at the moment we cant know that the thing is to make drawings and notes on everything and several exact copies of the documents we find karal laughed which seemed to surprise the kyree it is a good thing that urtho was a neat man or you would be copying foodstains i think along with diagrams the kyree opened his mouth in a wide grin it would not be the first time i am a mere historian how am i to know what is a diagram and what was a long ago spill of wine perhaps a semicircle of dark brown may not in fact be a ring from the bottom of a mug but rather a notation of where a teleson lens should go lyam now freed to go make more of those exact copies of the documents and notes they had discovered resting on the benches trotted up the stairs karal had been amazed to discover just how much he had in common with the little lizardcreature over the past several days lyam was goodnatured patient uncomplaining and about the same age as karal like karal when he had first arrived in valdemar lyam never expected to be anything more than a secretary lyam was probably right but if anything was to happen to tarrn it would be lyam who would apply the things he learned from the historian to complete a given task tarrn on the other hand was a little easier to work for than ulrich had been largely because what tarrn wanted and needed were simple things it was quite possible for karal to anticipate tarrns descriptions just by looking at the bench although tarrn often had a more succinct way of describing something than karal would have come up with and tarrn although he did have an air of quiet authority was not as intimidating as ulrich had been since he was physically much shorter than karal and since he looked like a friendly shaggy sheepherding dog it simply wasnt possible to be intimidated by him no matter how intelligent and knowledgeable he was on the other hand he seemed just a bit wary around karal which was not too surprising the karsites had a reputation for being extremely insular people and it would be logical to assume that karal harbored certain prejudices about fourlegged people tarrn could not have known about the firecats of course very few people outside of karse even knew such things existed the work went slowly but steadily tarrn had refused to allow anyone else to carry away anything after firesong had taken the telesons and their notes since there wasnt anything down here that was needed immediately the others had given in to his demands with goodnatured humor since then the meticulous description and drawing had been going on every day tarrn permitted people to remove articles from the benches only after he had finished with them but since it wasnt always obvious when he was done with a bench so far no one had moved much of anything now they were down to the final bench and tarrn seemed very pleased with all that had gone before this bench was virtually empty except for a few pots of driedout paint and ink and some brushes and pens a scribes bench i would guess tarrn speculated look at the height of the stoolhow close the inkwell and the pots are to the front of the bench urtho never sat here ill wager i doubt that any human did karal replied noting the distances down on the diagram this is a backless stool where all the other seats are tall chairs and to me that says that whoever used this bench might have had a tail the seat tilts slightly forward and has an angled rounded cutin toward the back so id say it was a hertasi that sat here probably urthos personal scribe or secretary impressive deduction i suspect you are correct tarrn replied and this is good since it means lyam can use this bench for his copying work instead of taking an awkward position on the floor well that is all we need from here do run up and tell the others that they can come loot to their hearts content would you please then if you would tell lyam about all of this and could you help him move his supplies down here tarrn gave the order carefully phrased as a very polite request as if trying to avoid giving insult karal would have obeyed him no matter what his attitude had been but tarrn probably wasnt taking any chances about hurting his feelings since they all had to live together in a very crowded environment lyam was very happy to transfer his work from the floor upstairs to the bench downstairs and karal helped him carry his effects as karal had thought the backless stool was at the perfect height for the little lizard this will be good lyam said hissing his sibilants a trifle as he tested the seat the stool is perfect the brushes proved to have failed to withstand the rigors of time lyam examined them pronounced them useless for scribing and added that nothing had changed much in the art of brushmaking over the centuries it did give karal a sense of awe to hold in his hand something that had last been held so long ago but lyam was right the brush could have been made last week except for the fact that the bristles were crumbling i admit to having a special regard for the tools of my trade lyam confided the paint and ink in the pots were useless as well and were consigned to part of another bench to await their fate lyam and karal cleared the top of the scribes bench and set it up to lyams satisfaction it did not escape karals notice that the graphitesticks silverpoint sticks ink pens and brushes that lyam arranged were in nearly the same places as those that had once served that longdead scribe together they swept and cleaned out the corner so that there would be no dust or dirt to smudge lyams newmade copies ah lyam finally said with satisfaction stretching his tail out and flexing his stubby handtalons this is good good light and a good position i can be very happy here i think thank you gesten youre very welcome really karal paused a moment as it struck him again in a moment of astonishment that he was chatting amiably with what could be loosely described as an intelligent dog and its lizard secretary in the ruins of a magicblasted tower once ruled by a legend his musings were interrupted as the lizard secretary held up an ancient brush so that the tarnished ferrule shone dully in the workshops light you know simply by virtue of where this brush has been found it could be worth enough in trade to feed my family for a season but its highest value is in what it makes us think of when we see it the kyree looked over at the hertasi with a look of pure pleasure saying nothing lyam held the old brush reverently in both hands and continued an artifact of urthos own workshop this is history itself karal as great as any carved monument or temple history is in the small items as much as the huge ones when we see an edifice we see what the ancients wanted us to see and that is important but we find out so much more from what was so familiar to them that they thought little of it and one day perhaps historians will look back at our clothes our brushes and our everyday things and learn who we were too now you know why i enjoy lyams company so much karal he is truly a brother in spirit tarrns mindlaugh was joyous oh iwell it is easy to be overcome by all of this it is wonder itself we are immersed in here lyam muttered embarrassed as he gingerly set aside the brush that had been the focus of his oratory karal and tarrn exchanged knowing looks with each other even across time species and cultures the enjoyment of historys wonder itself could be shared karal left lyam bent over yet another copy of the ancient notes this batch seemed to be the jewelry designs he would have offered to help but although his drafting ability was up to making sketches of benchtops and their contents it was not up to making copies of intricate jewelry patterns when he went back upstairs tarrn came with him and immediately engaged himself in conference with firesong and andesha over another copied set of notes firesong and andesha were chattering away with odd breaks in the conversation as they listened to tarrns mindspoken replies master levy had replaced sejanes at the teleson and was talking to someone karal did not recognize but who wore trainee grays instead of herald whites sejanes who was standing behind master levy simply watching the conversation turned at the sound of karals footsteps and waved him over i understand from firesong that you were the channel for the last effort here sejanes said when karal was within earshot the old mage looked at him expectantly motioning him to follow as he moved away from the teleson and master levys intensely technical conversation karal nodded wondering what sejanes wanted not that i have any idea of what a channel is or does sir he added im afraid i put my faith in what i was told that channeling is instinctive he felt very diffident telling such an experienced mage that he had no idea of what he had been doing he hoped that sejanes wasnt going to be annoyed at him for mucking about with things he didnt understand sejanes pulled on his lower lip thoughtfully thats true in a limited sense he finally replied you could perfectly well go on that way many channels prefer not to know anything about what causes what theyre doing but there are things that can be learned that would make the experience easier for you and perhaps less frightening i could teach you if you wanted to learn thats why i asked about it it could make an important difference in how you feel afterward karals mouth went dry and he swallowed as a tremor of fear passed through him how could he tell this old mage that the very last thing he wanted was to have anything to do with more magic on the other hand sejanes seemed to understand how horrible it had been for him and if there was a next time wouldnt it he better to undertake it fully prepared well sir if i had a choiceive done it twice and id really rather not ever do it again but if i have to anything that would make things easier would probably be a good idea so i guess i ought to take you up on your offer the old man chuckled at his lack of enthusiasm and patted his shoulder as if to reassure him theres no shame in that reaction he told karal ive never channeled myself but ive spoken to those who have and they would probably agree with you on both counts i cant blame you a bit yet if were going to start i suspect we ought to do so before you lose your nerve about it if you have some time to spare we could begin now karal shrugged with a nonchalance he in no way felt id rather not put it off and take a chance that i might need to channel power in the next few hours the way my luck runs i would need what you might have taught me if i hadnt delayed because he stopped himself before he admitted how frightened he was but sejanes saw it anyway he left his hand on karals shoulder a moment longer i told you it is no shame to be afraid young one he said in a low reassuring voice channels hold power as great as any adept and sometimes greater the only difference between them is that channels dont actually use what they carry and perhaps that is what makes it harder for them they are used by the power rather than using it what sane creature ever gives up control if he does not have to karal shuddered he wouldnt ever want to use all that power it would be more responsibility than he ever cared to handle under any circumstances no matter how dire thatsthats quite a thought sir wewe of the sunlord give up control to him as a matter of faith but we are still afraid sometimes and he only helps those who try hard to deal with difficulties themselves and im afraid i dont know much about magic at all if it comes right down to it good then you have little or nothing to unlearn and yes your faith will help you sejanes led the way to the chamber they were using for storage purloined a couple of empty buckets and a pair of folded blankets for cushions to sit on and took karal over to a quiet corner when they had made rough stools out of the upturned buckets and rested the cushions upon them he began karal experienced a disconcerting sense of familiarity and an equally disconcerting sense of disconnection sejanes sounded like every good teacher he had ever studied under but the surroundings were nothing like the classrooms of the sunpriests where he had done all that study and if he closed his eyes sejanes sounded so much like ulrich except for the accent that it was uncanny magepower as we know and understand it is an energy that is given off by living things in the same way that fire gives off heat and light in the act of consuming wood he said his manner easy and casual his tone exactly the same as if he were describing the weather and not a power that could wreck kingdoms it tends to want to gather together and tends to follow wellworn paths in that it is more like rainwater than fire and mages can see this power karal asked though his mouth was dry with nervousness thats what makes someone a mage sejanes replied i can see that power any time i make the effort toand someone like firesong has to make an effort not to see it karal glanced over at firesong who looked no different from any other absurdly handsome hawkbrother and shook his head seeing power all the time was it like seeing things with an extra color added was it like seeing particles and waves swirling all around you like swimming underwater and when the power got too strong did it blind you like looking into the sun now the power itself obeys rules sejanes continued when the threadlike paths or tiny streams merge together enough to make them of a different magnitude of strength we call them leylines these tend to be straight at least in the short term and that besides strength of power is what makes leylines different from the trickles that feed them is it the strength that makes them straight karal hazarded sejanes looked pleased we dont know for certain but that is the theory he said it makes sense a trickle of water will meander more than a powerful river we think that after a certain point the power can cut through the world taking the shortest distance which as master levy will tell you is always a straight line karal nodded no wonder sejanes and master levy got on so well now sooner or later since power is attracted by power these lines will meet the places where two or more leylines meet forms something called a node where power collects sejanes looked at him expectantly karal hazarded another question it cant collect indefinitely though can it sejanes looked very pleased no it cant and it will either be used up or drain away into the void and we honestly dont know what happens to it after that karal seemed to recall andesha telling him something about a third option something that the hawkbrothers used called a heartstone but that was a complication he didnt need right now first learn the rules and worry about the exceptions later nowabout using power sejanes continued mages can use the power that they themselves produce mages can use the power given off by things in their immediate vicinity mages can also store power for later use in reservoirs those can be available only to a single mage or can be a group effort built by group contributions for as long as the group lasts everybody karal asked more than a bit alarmed by the notion of a barelytrained apprentice being able to use such power oh no sejanes chuckled no fortunately lack of training and practice provides some control the common titles for levels of ability refer to what power they can tap and not their absolute skill as with any venture some people are more skilled than others but i digress apprentices can only use their own power or what is immediately available around them below the level of a leyline journeymen can use leylines masters can use those reservoirs if a mage is part of a particular school he is given the key to the reservoir built by the mages of that school at the time he becomes a master at that point part of his duty every day is to feed the reservoir as much power as he has time to gather eventually over the years with these reservoirs being filled more often than they are drained they are ready for anything the masters might need but that power is tame like water in a still pond because it isnt flowing anywhere karal asked and was rewarded by sejaness nod but what about nodes that sejanes said with a shading of pride is what only adepts can do adepts dont need to bother with the reservoirs though they sometimes do simply because they are so stillfor very delicate work for example such as healings adepts can tap into and use the raw power of the nodes the stronger the adept the larger the node he can control leyline power is harder to control than reservoir power or ambient power because as you guessed it is moving so to speak but node power fights the user because it is moving swiftly sometimes in more than one direction and is wild and unconfined have you understood me so far karal nodded so far this all seemed very straightforward perhaps altra would also be able to help him with this since the firecat seemed something of a mage last of all of those who handle magepower come the channels sejanes nodded at karal as i said when i began the one thing that all lifepath mages have in common is that they have what the valdemarans call the magegift and that ability enables them to actually see magic power channels however usually do not have magegift or if they do it isnt very strong why karal asked sejanes rubbed the side of his nose i dont know if there is a reason there is some speculation that this is partly a protection for them and partly a protection against them the ability to sense magic power might be blinded the first time a channel was used by very powerful magic and if you can sense something you can use it so it might be better for all of us that anyone who can handle power stronger than any adept would even dream of touching cannot actually use that power himself again karal nodded if you went on the basic assumption that any karsite wouldwhich was that it was vkandis who granted such abilitiessuch a system of checks and balances made complete sense vkandis would not have placed extraordinary power within the capacity of mere mortals without some curbs on the system the explanation might also simply be that the act of attempting to actually use that much power rather than just direct it could be fatal if mages who were also channels died before they could wed and bring forth children with the gift such a combination wouldnt last for long look what happened to those with mindmagic in karse theyd been gathered up and given to the fires for generations and as a result just before solaris took power there were so few such witches and demons that there hadnt been more than four or five fires a year with a single victim apiece sejanes looked down at his hands for a moment gathering his thoughts think of a funnel the wide end catches scattered drops of water or small pieces of matter and focuses it down into a small directed stream thats what a channel does and roughly how a channel does it and because a channel actually forces the power going through him to flow through a smaller space he increases the force of that flow and its speed if you will so what a channel needs to work perfectly is someone to guide the power in however wild it may be and someone to direct it as it goes out again remember that directing somethingmuch like shunting a stream a few degreesis much easier than using it karal nodded numbly as sejanes continued magic is much like water karal but it is far more versatile it can be manipulated by force of will by natural aptitude by specialized devices and by other ways water essentially can only get things wet if i may use a crude analogy magic however can get things wet turn things to dust set them ablaze make them into stone give them life put them somewhere else and so on but magic in its wild forms works in very gradual and subtle ways it is not until magic is manipulated by someone that it has quick effects without mages magic takes its natural course like a river karal offered and mages make water wheels and dams and bridges sejanes leaned back apparently impressed that he said slowly is essentially it yes that is what we do karal bit at his lower lip and offered and what happened here is that long ago there was an explosion in the magic thatscooped a hole out and the wateri mean the magicis rushing back to fill the hole close sejanes nodded very close you are a bright young man karal now back to just what you are a channel for whatever reason a channel collects power that is brought to him and directs it in a more purely directed less stormy fashion thats all there is to it karal exclaimed i am a funnel sejanes smiled thats all the theory he chided gently but now comes the practice that will help you keep parts of yourself from interfering with or even fighting that stream of power and it will be all the harder because you will be dealing with something you yourself can only sense dimly like playing blindmans bluff with an unruly stallion and to continue that analogy im not going to show you how to catch and ride the beast because it will kill you if you try instead im going to try to teach you how to keep yourself out of its way at the end of the lesson karal was quite certain that sejanes analogy of a game with an angry horse was the correct one the inside of his head felt bruised somehow though certainly not as bad as he had felt after the first time hed acted as a channel the lesson was over when sejanes clapped him on the back and told him that he had done very well for his first attempt you arent the worst channel ive ever seen and we tend to use them more than you westerners do the old mage said cheerfully i dont know if the ability occurs more often in the empire or if we imperial mages are so lazy that wed rather use channels than focus power ourselves and so we make an active effort to look for the ability but you arent the worst thats for certain and youve come to the lessons late in your life so thats encouraging faint praise but better than none i suppose altra observed wrapping himself around karals legs natoli is waiting to talk to you im going to assume that since my lord altra is here that your young lady is ready to speak to you sejanes observed go on off with you by the by youll toughen up as you practice this should be the worst training session youll ever endure youll notice he said training session altra observed as karal got up from his stool and followed the firecat that doesnt say anything about the real thing that hadnt escaped karals attention but he really didnt want to dwell on it not when he was finally going to get to see and talk to natoli karal took his place on the empty stool in front of the teleson altra draped himself over karals feet and the herald in the crystal winked and stepped away a moment later natoli moved into the place he had vacated she looked as if she had recovered from the boiler explosion her hair was a little longer than it had been when he left and she looked at him as if she had forgotten why she was there suddenly he felt very shy hello natoli he said awkwardly you look in good health he winced as he listened to himself was that any way to speak to a girl he really wanted to be able to kiss you dont she said bluntly peering at him youre too pale and too thin what have you been doing to yourself that was so very typical of her that he had to laugh and relaxed immediately as to the first weve been living underground and we mostly dont get to see the sun and as to the secondhave you ever tasted firesongs cooking he shuddered melodramatically and she laughed in return seriously were mostly eating as the shinain do its not that bad just a little odd and you dont often see a fat shinain she said shrewdly things were quiet until altra showed up with this contraption we artificers all wanted to take it apart of course but when we were told that the first person to try would be skinned we gave up on the idea she grinned well have to make do with trying to duplicate it from those manuscripts if we can well send one by fast heraldcourier to solaris and then youll get to talk to her on a regular basis must i he asked weakly he was not ready to face solaris just yet he wasnt sure he would be for quite a while actually her radiance was not a comfortable person to speak to facetoface for that matter she wasnt a comfortable person to communicate with letter to letter he always had the feeling that he was reading something intended for an audience rather than a personal letter first we have to duplicate it she pointed out and smiled you know im very glad to see you again sometimes in the middle of the night id wake up and id wonder if you werequite real oddly enough he knew exactly what she meant its hard to imagine someone being real whos that far away he agreed its as if they never existed except in your mind she flushed a little and looked away for a moment anyway she continued awkwardly weve been busy though it doesnt have anything to do with the important things she sounded wistful theres just nothing we can do right now to help with what youre doing so were back to the old projects like bridges and steam boilers theres nothing wrong with that he countered dont these things have to be done no matter what disaster might be looming he managed a crooked grin if everything else falls apart your bridges will be there to get people across rivers that cant be ferried or forded surely thats worth something she shrugged but looked pleased at least what were doing is useful she admitted its odd though the folk around and about haven have the funniest attitude you can tell them and tell them that the protection weve given them from the magestorms is only temporary but they act as if its permanent they arent doing anything to prepare themselves for the worst they arent even thinking about it now she sounded and looked very frustrated when you ask them why they just shrug and cant give you an answer or they say something stupid fatalistic or both i think he said slowly that ordinary folk just cant imagine anything awful happening to them it always happens to someone else well youd think after years of war and bandits and all they should know better she replied acidly at any rate now that things have settled down they arent at all interested in asking us about things they can do when the storms come again they just want to know how long it is going to take before a bridge will be up or if the steam boiler is likely to explode again i hope youre on bridges he said trying not to show alarm and not steam boilers actually im on metal stress she replied running her hand through her hair absently i get to make some very interesting and loud noises were trying to make tougher alloys but i dont want to bore you with what were doing i spend some time in the forge because at the moment work on steam boilers is stalled until we can find a better way to make the boiler itself he sighed resting his chin on his hands it wouldnt bore me but id be lost he admitted sejanes is trying to teach me some specific kind of exercises for working with magic and those would probably mean about as much to you probably the conversation died for a moment still i hope you arenti mean i dont want you to think that her face twisted with frustration just if youre doing something dangerous dont take more on yourself than you can carry all right he smiled as long as you promise to do the same he replied and she laughed grain for the gander is good for the goose hmm well ill promise to try but my judgment is sometimes faulty so is mine so dont hold it against me his smile took on an ironic edge we cant all be infallible sons of the sun oh even solaris admits to fallibility she chuckled believe it or not solaris he chuckled that would be an entry in the annals especially if she admitted that she was fallible to you polytheistic barbarians but she did natoli protested and as he continued to regard her askance she looked surprised oh ill bet no one told you any of you you will not believe what has happened with grand duke tremane as she outlined the astonishing developments in hardorn since the arrival of elspeth and darkwind karal felt his eyes growing larger and larger no one had seemed to think that any of this was significant enough to pass on to any of the other members of his party which is probably because they all have their own preoccupations and not a one of them thinks anything is important outside those preoccupations but youd think someone would have said something to sejanes we have a herald and a companion stationed down in karse in solariscourt i suppose you call it she added conclave he corrected conclave then we sent him down so that we could get information to her by way of his companion and talias rolan she laughed actually its not just a herald its my father and he seems to be enjoying himself anyway we sent her word about this and the reply she sent back was since he has voluntarily placed himself in the hands of a higher judge of character than myself i feel impelled to point out that natoli andesha and karal were correct in their assessment of his basic character and i was at least in part swayed by nothing more substantial than emotion what do you think of that she grinned as if she had somehow won a great prize then again winning a concession like that from solaris would have been a great prize particularly as it was her father who had sent the message on to haven its a small thing but she just proved to her father that she doesnt have to be a herald to accomplish something important he realized and maybe she just proved it to herself as well i think she didnt use the ecclesiastic plural which means that she was speaking for solaris and not for the son of the sun he told her but he felt very pleased nevertheless for the sake of his own people historically it was a tremendous temptation for the son of the sun to always think of himself as speaking for vkandis until even the most minor personal opinions were incorporated as doctrine solaris appeared to have overcome that particular temptation which is not a bad thing no its not she appeared to have run out of things to say and another awkward moment of silence descended i suppose youll want to go tell all this to sejanes he did but he also didnt want to go even though he didnt really have anything to say the silence lengthened and became more strained she glanced to the side and her expression lightened a little with relief even while it darkened with disappointment oh heres someone for master levy if altra will hold the teleson open while you get him of course he said feeling both emotions himself natoli take care of yourself and ii miss all of you he didnt dare say that he missed only her but he hoped she got that impression from his hesitation iwe miss you too she replied with a smile more shy than usual and vanished from the crystal karal ran to get master levy who nodded and hurried to the device carrying a sheaf of notes as if he had been expecting to be summoned back karal glanced around and couldnt find sejanes in the upper rooms he listened carefully and heard the old mages voice coming thinly from the workshops below he hurried down the stairs to find sejanes chatting away comfortably with lyam though tarrn was nowhere in sight sir he called ive got the most amazing news about duke tremane well sejanes said chuckling softly well well well he was inordinately pleased with karals news and karal could not help but wonder why thats an odd way to react considering that tremane has acted quite unlike a proper imperial officer i thought you might be upset sir he ventured tilting his head to one side arent you upset no this is rather good news all things considered sejanes replied and chuckled again it seems that my former pupil has learned at long last that there are things that do not always answer to his logic i am quite glad to hear this truth be told this is going to be a very good thing for everyone concerned karal kept his inquisitive expression hoping to prompt more information from the mage and sejanes enlarged on his statement i am pleased for hardorn for that sad maltreated land could not have found a better caretaker he blinked and his eyes fixed on some distant point beyond karal i am pleased because tremane could not have found a better trust than hardorn he was wasted on the empire he has the misfortune to be that rarest of imperial creatures a man of high rank who still maintains a shred or two of integrity and compassion that is not to say at all that the military is composed of heartless men far from that in fact he might have done well had he remained within the military but as emperor he would have been a victim of one of three unpleasant fateseaten alive by those conspiring to use him murdered or corrupted that much i can see karal replied its quite logical but he faltered unsure how to ask what he wanted to know without being rude imperials were notquiteirreligious but they were hardly as devout as even the average valdemaran and when compared with the average karsite they were positively atheistic sejanes seemed to understand what he wanted to know not all citizens of the empire are so immersed in practicality as you think his gaze softened and turned inward for a moment those most likely to become cynical believers in nothing that they cannot see are the career courtiers those least likelyprobably the folk who live nearest the land and those who live by magic my young protege was poised between the cynic and the believer and he could have taken either path he may be the rarest of all one who can see the truth in both karal wanted badly to ask just what sejanes believed in but he sensed that sejanes would not tell him now he might never that was his right of course and it would be horribly impolite of karal to ask him if he ever wanted to tell karal he would it is my own opinion that whatever else has happened tremane has discovered that there are those other paths perhaps that will open his mind to those other possibilities he rubbed his eyes for a moment as if they were tired and i am pleased that he has an outside governor in this earthbinding something toshall we saykeep him from succumbing to other temptations he is that weak then asked lyam with the careless tone of one to whom duke tremane and his men were no more real than the folk in the chronicles of a thousand years ago they might not be the kaledain are so different from the imperials that they must seem equally unreal to each other not weak sejanes amended and his wrinkled brow knitted as he searched for words hes trying to explain tremane to a couple of youngsters for whom the empire is only a name who cannot even imagine the levels of intrigue that someone like tremane must negotiate every day karal waited for the aged mage to find the right words and he cant know that the temple of vkandis isor was anywayas much a hotbed of conspiracy as any court i dont think lyam could ever understand the stresses that tremane must have been under but i do i wonder if tremane ever got tired of it all and wished for things to be simpler no hes not weak sejanes repeated the trouble is that certain habits certain ways of reacting become ingrained it would be all too simple to revert to the ways in which business is conducted in the empire without thought for what was good for hardorn that more than anything would be the temptation to take the way that is easiest rather than the one that is best for the people and the land and doubly so when resources are low lyam looked baffled but shrugged accepting what sejanes said for the moment karal nodded trying to do things the way he was used to would probably get him in great difficulties in hardorn wouldnt it he asked it might even break up the peace and he might not know why that had happened now he hasnt a choice you see hell know what is best and hell have to do it or he knows how hell suffer for it and you know he continued feeling a certain amount of surprise at the insight the thing is since people will know he cant do anything selfishly or maliciously theyre likely to be easier on his mistakes if you take my meaning theyll be more likely to forgive and explain sejanes flashed a mildly surprised but appreciative look at him exactly so and i am very fond of tremane i should like to see him as happy as anyone burdened with power and the ability to wield it can be he has a strong sense of responsibility and this may be the one opportunity of his lifetime to exercise that responsibility with people who are likely to appreciate the care he will take once again sejanes gaze turned inward he had his estate of course but those on it were used to being ruled gently the folk of hardorn were subjected to every ill imaginable that will make them grateful to a gentler hand lyam uttered the breathy equivalent of a laugh showing very sharp pointed teeth he will be finding himself burdened with more than power i think earthsense is as jealous a mistress as responsibility but the earthsense and his own responsibility will work in harness amicably rather than pulling him to pieces between them sejanes countered had he risen to power in the empire he would have spent every day being torn among fear duty responsibility expediency and the right i think it might have driven him mad i know it would have changed him into something i would no longer recognize the hertasi shrugged again good then we take what small victories we can i hope that all this gives him aid if we cannot stop the storms he shall need every help he can muster to protect these people who are now depending on him it might karal knew something about earthsense though few sunpriests had it the ability was much valued among the farmers of the karsite hills where the soil was poor and the weather chancy if you knew that it would be a bad decision to plant corn this year in a particular field and a good one to plant clover you might prosper when your neighbors failed and if you shared your expertise with your neighbors you might all be able to pay the tithe in goods instead of your own fleshandblood come harvest time it wasnt exactly a witchpower and it wasnt exactly one of the things that would get you sent to the fires but it also wasnt the sort of thing that you spoke about to the sunpriests the sunpriests in their turn were careful not to ask about it and all was well another small victory then lyam nodded decisively and seemed to think that a change of subject was in order this natoli who gave you this wordis she kin to you or something else that was not the subject the young karsite would have chosen and karal felt himself blushing furiously as lyams quick eyes and quicker wit filled in the truth ah the little lizard said not without sympathy his head bobbing she is to you what jylen is to me i think he sighed gustily i do miss her company but i would not have her here she could not have endured the journey and i think she would have felt herself useless which is a bad thing for anyone to feel natoli would have felt the same karal admitted oh i feel useless about half the time and it makes me want to bite something id rather not think how she would react nor i jylen lyam laughed a trimmer tail there never was nor a more graceful snout but neither belong to a maid with an overabundance of patience he shared a glance of fellowfeeling with karal and the young karsite experienced a definite warming in the relationship between them well sejanes i will take my leave of you lyam told the mage and of you karal my stomach has an overlyintimate embrace with my spine and i think i shall venture firesongs cooking and see if it is as terrible as you claim surely he learned something from his hertasi its not firesong tonight its andesha karal assured him and he and the shinain have agreed to share that particular chore from now on thanks to the hundred little gods sejanes exclaimed with clear relief even enduring shinain buttertea is preferable to eating what firesong cooks in that case i will haste my steps the hertasi cried in case the other starvelings aloft decide to leave me with naught but scrapings he scrambled down from his stool and scampered up the stairs with a staccato click of toenails on stone sejanes cocked an eyebrow at karal what about you he asked i was under the impression that young men were never quite fully fed it was karals turn to shrug uncomfortably his stomach was still in something of a knot and he wondered if natoli was always going to affect him that way if so he was destined to grow much thinner lucky in love the old man asked softly and with a kindly and sympathetic manner or unlucky either one can be hazardous to the appetite iim not sure karal replied feeling his cheeks burning we dont know each other that well sejanes reached out and patted his knee uncertainty can be just as hazardous but i take it that she is a trusted friend oh yes absolutely karal said fervently there isnt anyone i would trust more humph karal glanced hastily down at his feet where altra lay coiled around the legs of his chair hitherto unnoticed how had the firecat gotten there the last karal had seen altra had been sprawled on the floor near the teleson there isnt a human i trust more i trust her as much as i trust altra and florian he amended hastily and for a great many of the same reasons better not perfect but better that is an excellent beginning then sejanes said his tone just as serious and his demeanor as sober as if he was discussing the next solution to the magestorm one should always begin with friendship rather than a more ardent emotion the former will last if the latter does not and one should also have enough in common with a young lady to be her friend unless of course it is a case of a prearranged attachment and in that case there is little that one can do besides hope that ones parents guardians or other adults involved have some notion of what might appeal to one in the way of a lifetime companion and attempt to find those things that one has in common with her karal had to chuckle at sejanes careful way of putting things he was delicately trying to learn if karal and natoli had been joined to one another by parental agreement or if they might be violating other such agreements with their own acquaintance its not prearranged and i also dont think her father rubric will mind that wereah friendssince hes the one who introduced us in the first place hes the herald whos been sent into karse as the liaison with solaris i think that natoli doesnt make friends easily sejanes brightened this sounds more promising with every word you add he said with real enthusiasm and your feelings at the moment attracted but confused very much so karal was as amused as he was embarrassed sejanes was certainly taking a very active interest in this situation and if karal had not known him it would be very tempting to dismiss his interest as that of an interfering oldmaidish busybody but sejanes had never interfered in anyones private life as far as karal knew he was hardly oldmaidish and gave no evidence of being a busybody although he had intervened to offer to teach karal something of magic no this concern seemed to arise out of some genuine interest in karal in the manner of a master with a protege just like ulrich his former master you remind me in some ways of some former students of mine sejanes said quietly echoing his own thoughts and you can tell me to go to the dogs if you think im prying where i have no right but i hope perhaps i can give you useful advice about natoli he grinned conspiratorily i have had a number of lady friends over the years and most of them were as highly intelligent as she seems to be i believe i can remember what it was like to be young karal stared at him in mingled surprise and gratitude for hed had no one to ask for such advice andesha was mostly concerned with loisha and the other shinain when he wasnt working as they all were with the dangerous magics here florian and altra werent human and although lyam apparently had a lady friend neither was he firesongwell his advice would hardly apply to karals situation even if he wasnt already wary of asking the tayledras anything personal he didnt know silverfox well enough he was not going to ask romantic advice of natolis teacher master levy and the shinain were none of them approachable enough the idea of coming to sejanes would never have occurred to him but ulrich would have helped me ulrich would have given him the same advice his father would have given him or an older brother if hed had one vkandis did not require that his priests be celibate only chaste outside of marriage ulrich had told his pupil more than once that he had been romantically attached twice and that only outside circumstances had prevented him from making either of those women his wife karal knew a bit more than just that though it was still bare bones in the case of the second lady in his life ulrich and his intended had an extreme difference of opinion over the internal politics of the priesthood and had not spoken again not even after solaris became son of the sun the first time early in his life the lady had suffered a short but fatal illness leaving him brokenhearted for many years ulrich himself had never told karal the stories hed learned of both from some of the redrobe priests who were longtime friends and colleagues of his mentor they had meant to compassionately keep him from inadvertently touching salt to ulrichs open wounds and warned him of the things he must not press unless ulrich himself broached the subject but that had not prevented ulrich from giving him some preliminary advice about girls and the possible pursuit thereof though at the time he had not been at all interested even in the idea perhaps ulrich had a premonition that one day he would need that advice but it was far more likely that ulrich had simply been offering what he would give any lively young person who was his protege the suggestion that he himself had enough experience in matters of romance to offer advice that set the scene for what was inevitable and would have prevented him from going to his lessexperienced peers for advice that had as much chance of being harmful as helpful now sejanes was offering the same thing and karal was only too happy to accept the offer thank you sir he said simply do you have any ideas about what i should say to her he smiled sheepishly dont think that im ungrateful but talking with her is all i can do right now given our current distance that may be just as well sejanes replied mildly but with a twinkle and yes i have a few suggestions that was precisely what he wanted to hear karal and lyam scribbled on identical sheets of foolscap seated side by side on a pallet bed both of them taking full notes of this meeting the entire group sat on pallets in a rough threesided square around the teleson which was situated in front of firesong this was a new version of the old council sessions that they had held in the council room of the palace at haven and he wondered how many of the councillors on the other side were gazing at the teleson with bafflement surely the device must seem to them as strange as any of the stormchanged beasts that had been displayed for their edification a tiny image of queen selenay gazed solemnly at them from the crystal lens she had just asked master levy if he had any more information on when the magestorms would begin again i cant speak for magic but i can for mathematical probability and that has given us the ability to predict what is going to happen up to a point the mathematics is relatively clear on this master levy said gravely the cancellation effect of the power burst that was released from here is gradually eroding well be seeing the resumption of stormlets in four days but i dont think that even the most sensitive mage will detect them unless he is looking for them thats all we know right now and treyvan will be in charge of the mages who will be looking for the stormlets and attempting to measure their relative strength once we have the resumption of stormlets that actually affect the physical world we can measure how much they increase in strength and decrease in interval well be able to calculate then how long it will take before the storms have major physical effects again and how long until they are dangerous once they are dangerous however they will build up to a repetition of the one released at the original cataclysm i have absolutely no doubt of that in the crystal of the teleson selenay nodded gravely although she alone was visible the haven teleson sat in the middle of the council chamber surrounded by a full council at their horseshoeshaped table all of them were able to hear what master levy said although they only saw firesong now we come to the question of the last storm and the effect here where all of the force will be concentrated here is where need andesha sejanes and i have performed our own calculations and were not optimistic firesong said with uncharacteristic restraint it is not good majesty although the shields of this place survived the initial outward release we do not believe they will survive the impact of the energies converging on this place we think the shields will go down and all the weapons that have not been rendered harmless will go then and that will be bad by go just what is it that you are saying asked one of the councillors around the haven teleson and just what precisely does bad mean karal restrained a nervous titter how would you explain bad to someone whose idea of a catastrophe was a major forest fire a great flood or a landslide how do you get him to believe that it was possible to release forces that melted rock towers and dug craters the size of some countries i wish i knew firesong admitted we dont know what most of them were intended to do only that they were weapons deemed too dangerous to use it would be supremely ironic to discover that they cancel one another out but i gravely doubt that we can count on that certainly the area of destruction will cover the plains and since we have enough warning this time the shinain are evacuating the shinain are evacuating the shinain who never ever left the plains would that tell the inquisitive councillor just how grave the situation was karal didnt know whether the effect will carry as far as valdemar i couldnt say although if i were in your place id count on it firesong held up a hand in warning and dont ask what effect because i dont know that either were trying to find out but were dealing with weapons created in secret by a secretive mage and the only notes are in a language that was current two millennia ago were doing the best that we can and having more people here would only slow things down but what we do may not be enough or in time karal noted the grumbling on the other side but no one said anything out loud probably because as natoli said they just dont believe it can happen sheer stupidity on their part but there it is in a way he couldnt blame them they were new to truemagic relatively speaking for most of them the terrible things that ancars mages had done were only stories and the first time they had seen anything like magic was when the magestorms began nor could they imagine a force that could turn a flourishing country into a smoking glassfloored crater he noted that down in a sidebar tarrn had told him that his observations could be important so long as they werent of a personal nature and to note them down most people dont believe that a disaster is coming or that it can affect them even when theyre told repeatedly he was tremendously grateful that he no longer had to represent karse at the council one of the sunpriests who had fought with the valdemarans against ancar had come north at the same time that natolis father had gone south he had never been comfortable in such a position had never felt particularly capable of handling it no matter what solaris herself said and certainly about half the other members of the council had doubts now and again about his competence and even his integrity but that sunpriest had certainly seen magic and believed in it with his whole heart perhaps he could help convince the doubters what about the weapons themselves someone else asked intelligently if we can get rid of them harmlessly wed be able to lessen the danger by that much is there any way of dismantling them when urrrtho sssaid he could not that was treyvan his voice indignant when he left a warrrning to that effect arrre you mad ah the things a gryphon can get away with saying just because hes larger than anything or anyone else karal was glad that treyvan and hydona were there to say all the rude things that needed saying we are proceeding very slowly in our understanding of these devices firesong said smoothly if there is a way to dismantle them we will we may be very lucky at least one of them simply disintegrated with age and time might have done what mortal hands could not it was interesting to karal how firesong had taken on the role of spokesman for the group not that anyone else had rushed to volunteer but firesong was by nature a bit lazy and not apt to take on any more responsibility than he had to then again if florian or altra had held the teleson link open the councillors would have seen only karal the companion or the firecat none of which were good choices for inspiring respect sejanes had no mindmagic nor did master levy andesha did but he was no better choice than karal although thanks to his magicwhitened hair he looked a bit older than karal need could have gotten respect but if need had held the link theyd all be seeing firesong anyway at least people respected firesong even feared him a little one good thing his acidic wit made a fine weapon to wield against intransigent or argumentative councillors then again it is a chance for firesong to be seen appreciated and admired and who else has he had as an audience lately first we have to discover what exactly they are supposed to do then how they do it then we might be able to judge if we have the ability to disarm them firesong explained patiently if you think of them as enormously complicated traps with a weapon in the middle this will make more sense to you but someone began and stopped fortunately sejanes picked up smoothly this study does not at all interfere with our studies of the magestorms because that is taking place up there among you here we are still operating on the assumption that we may have to trigger one of these weapons to counteract the final storm we already know which are the best choices and together with the notes we found in the workshop below we are studying them to see if the same solution we found the last time is viable this time and what if you cant find an answer that voice sounded strained and somewhat panicked so there was at least one person on the council who was taking this threat seriously karal only hoped it was not someone who was inclined to take a panicked view of everything getting people to organize their own defense would be easier if they did not think of the person goading them to it as a chronic overreactor you really ought to be operating on the assumption that we wont and that all we have done is to buy you time to prepare master levy replied truculently he was very impatient with the council and had said as much before this meeting began we told you that in the beginning when i left the artificers were devising a formula to predict the pattern of the circles of damage were still working on it said another voice the model isnt perfect but we expect to have an answer before the stormlets start and well check its accuracy with measurements as the stormlets increase in strength by the time theres real damage the formula will be tested and ready for use so theres your answer if we cant come up with a simple solution you simply keep people and livestock out of those dangerous areas drain as much power as you can out of that stone under the palace and shield it with everything you have and wait for the final storm to pass master levys tone said the rest that any idiot should have been able to sit quietly and figure that much out for himself while you all sit there safe and sound in the tower someone else accused angrily that was a mistake karal braced himself for the riposte firesong was not in a good mood and there was going to be blood on the council table in a moment even if it was metaphorical blood safe sound firesong asked dangerously where did you come by that incredible notion would someone please remove that man for incompetence and put him in the kitchen washing pans where he belongs if i were the lot of you id throw him off the council i do believe in encouraging those of lesser ability but i think that appointing a congenital idiot to a council seat is going too far there was an indignant spluttering on the other side then a certain amount of commotion selenay continued to look serene but her attention was not on the teleson it was maddening not to be able to see what was going on well firesong asked when the noise had ended we will take your recommendation under advisement selenay replied urbanely and clearly as much for the benefit of her side of the gathering as for firesongs you are correct in one thing if a little less than tactful this council can no longer afford to seat members whose attention is so concentrated on minor details within their own sphere that they are paying no attention to the greater dangers that threaten us all here here said another voice one that karal recognized after a moment as kerowyns oh my that was unexpected and karal could think of three or four council members who matched that particular statement too it seemed that after treachery and invasion and war and alliance and more war and magestorms even selenays patience had begun to run short and about time too it was all very well to say that those three or four had been loyal during the worst troubles and that loyalty deserved reward but there was a limit it was not wise to let the shortsighted continue to have authority in a situation like this one better to find them some position with rank and privileges and no authority if selenay still felt impelled to reward them right now being too shortsighted could very well cost lives she might not see any reason to continue to reward these people and that wouldnt be all that bad either sometimes the hand of censure needed to be used in order to make people believe it would be used even against those who thought themselves above censure in the words of the shinain use the whip to get the horses out of the burning stable he was tempted to add that to the notes but those were the kinds of purely personal observations that tarrn had warned him against and he kept them to himself there are two councillors that ought to be given the sack right here and now altra observed with irritation one of them is not entirely certain he believes in the intelligence of companions how can we expect him to plan for a magicfed disaster and the other is so wrapped up in why his district needs protection more than any other that hell waste valuable time and probably try to divert resources hes not entitled to altra didnt have to describe the offending members karal knew them well enough from that notation of their personalities its selenays kingdom and selenays council he reminded the firecat if youd like to make a recommendation as a karsite representative id do so privately to her im sure that she would have no difficulty speaking with you after this is over im not such a fool as to make one publicly altra snapped and shook his head until his ears flapped now im more than ever pleased that youre out of there you dont need to have to deal with these idiots theyd probably start blaming you for the cataclysm and i dont need to be there either id be tempted to wind around their ankles as they started descending a staircase and be certain of getting them replaced by someone with a bit more reasoning ability than a brick of cheese he managed to send a mental image of himself coiling around the legs of the stupidest of the two councillors and of the man pitching down the staircase in a very comical fashion bloodyminded today arent we karal observed vkandis help any rodent within a league of here altra replied when this session is over and after ive spoken to selenay im going hunting you wont have to go far karal told him the shinain were complaining about mice in the horse grain think you can lower your dignity for a bit of mousing altra just snorted the council session proceeded with admirable dispatch after that particular outburst for his part karal admitted to himself that he was acting in some ways precisely like those unfortunate councillors who could not or would not believe in the disaster threatening just below the horizon he was conducting some parts of his lifeas in pursuing his interest with natolias if nothing whatsoever was going to happen to change that life and he was not going about in a state of barelysuppressed panic either but the truth was that what he and natoli did or did not do was not going to make a bit of difference to the storms or the resolution of the problem assuming there could be one neither was going about in a cloud of fear going to help resolve their difficulties fear wasnt an emotion you could sustain for weeks at a time either so why try to keep himself in a continual state of nearpanic but what he could do he was doing and at least one of his observations might turn out useful it had occurred to him that the workshops had remained pristine and intactmore so even than the stored weaponsand that there might be even more shielding on them or perhaps there was a natural property of the stone as there was of silk that insulated everything inside from the effects of magic since they had always kept the hatchway open there was no way to tell and no one really wanted to volunteer to be shut inside just now natural or not it would have made sense to have the workshops protected from the possible effects of the weapons stored abovethe more so as the workshops could serve as a shelter in case something up here went wrong or alternatively if something went wrong down there the weapons stored up here would be unaffected but the workshops would make the safest place for those who were not involved to wait out the last stormand perhaps for all of them to do so if it turned out that there was nothing they could do there was room enough for all of them their supplies and their attendant shinain friends to wait in a fair imitation of comfort it would be difficult for florian and the shinain horses to get down the staircase but not impossible the one drawback the place had was that it was at a level lower than the tunnel inand if the stored weapons were affectedthey might find themselves literally sealed inside as the rock melted and ran or the remains of the building shook itself apart but if they waited in the tunnel or on the plain outside there would be no escape hed already discussed using the workshops in this way with the shinain and they had agreed with him going so far as to carry half of the supplies down there and store them and making plans to evacuate the camp above into the workshops when the time came and as for the folk of the surrounding land well for the first time since the sundering of the clans shinain and tayledras were living together more than threequarters of the clans were off the plains and distributed among the nearest vales some others had chosen to go to tradecities and the like where they had contacts or relatives those remaining were heading south rather than north or west taking with them all of the breeding horses and other herds for only the baggage beasts and personal strings could be accommodated in the vales they were under the escort of the fighters of kerowyns old mercenary company the skyboltsthose few who had retired or elected not to remain in valdemar they had returned to bolthaven and formed a smaller company with the sole duty of guarding the bolthaven mageschool run by quenten the town of bolthaven and the annual shinain horse faire the herds would be safe in the wide and gentle rethwellan valley below the fortified mageschool as they would be safe in the hands of those who had benefited from the generosity of kerowyns shinain relatives in the matter of most excellent shinainbred mounts before too many more days had passed the plains would be empty of almost everyone but the little group here in the heart of the crater that was the dhorisha plains a stranger would for the very first time be able to cross from one side to the other without hindrance not that anyone would be stupid enough to try the weather alone ought to prevent such an idiotic course only the shinain knew where game lurked in the winter only the shinain had fuel sources and tents made to withstand the killing blizzards the storms had brought and in a landscape of endlessly rolling white hills with no landmarks it would be suicide for most to try to navigate across the bowl of the plains besides the kalenedral who were left were not your normal borderguards it was not too bloody likely that anything would move into the plains that they didnt know about the moment the breachofborder occurred and under the current circumstances it would not be wise for anyone to assume that the stareyed was not personally watching the borders she would not even have to intervene directly in the event of an intruder simply dumping a foot of ice on the cliffs ringing the plains would prevent anyone but a skilled ice climber from getting down into the plains proper and dumping another foot or two of ice and snow on him while he was climbing or arranging for an avalanche along the cliff would see to it that not even an expert ice climber set a single living toe on the plains below good heavens im as bloodyminded as altra karal realized as he serenely contemplated the notion of intruders turned into ice sculptures but then again they couldnt really afford to be anything less than ruthless now the escort of kalenedral who remained to care for them had put their lives in the hands of their goddess to do so and knew it not only was there a good chance that the tower would not survive the final storm but they were defending an indefensible position the kalenedral had defended the tower in the past by keeping people far away from it if there was a lowest geographic point to the crater that was the dhorisha plains this tower was probably cradled in the bottom of it most of the swordsworn had remained with the clans and rightly to protect them during the evacuation what if someone deliberately chose this moment to come looking for the tower with a mind to stealing one or more of the weapons still in it there would not be much that anyone could do to stop him if he came with sufficient force it would have to be someone who was completely mad but as the existence of ancar and falconsbane proved there were people who were that mad that powercrazed to take such a chance but given all that this little group of seekers represented the stareyed would probably take care of such an expedition herselfand if she didnt it was just possible that vkandis would just as he thought that a lull appeared in the discussion and karal decided to do more than add an observation to his notes it has occurred to me just now he said slowly that there is a source of possible protection at least for those of you outside the tower whats that someone asked warily his ears burned for he might be stating the obvious but it seemed stupid not to mention this ah prayer he said diffidently divine intervention i mean have you had people really concentrating on asking for help from other sources that is no bad answer loisha interjected before anyone else could say anything if our stareyed is like your gods that could be a fat hare to pursue you see she only responds to peril quite impossible for mortals to deal with and only if asked otherwise she allows us to handle it ourselves your gods may only be waiting to be properly asked vkandis has traditionally been the same way karal confirmed i dont know what the gods do in valdemar but what is the harm in finding out none of course selenay said gently and in our own pride and insistent selfreliance we often forget that option we would not be asking for aid for ourselves against other peoples after all we would be asking for aid for all peoples against an implacable force we dont completely understand thank you karal for not being afraid to state what should have been obvious i will have the various notables draft up notices to their temples to that effect now karal blushed but with pleasure and altras deep purr vibrating his feet was all he needed to gauge the depth of the firecats approval he glanced sideways at loisha to find the shinain gazing at him with a thoughtful smile that broadened when their eyes met well lets see if theyre still pleased with me after this please queen selenay he added dont exclude the empire in those prayers the people of the empire havent done anything to hurt us and by now they must be in terrible straits theyve been suffering the magestorms all this time and from all sejanes has told us they need magic they use it everywhere for you it would be as if fire suddenly stopped giving off heat she nodded very slowly with just a touch of reluctance i will remember to phrase it that way she promised and to remember that we have no quarrel with all of the people of the empire only with those who harmed us he stole a second glance at loisha then one at sejanes loisha still seemed pleased with him and the old mage positively beamed and what about altra vkandis own representative what of me i think you have done a very good thing altras purr did not let up at all you manage to keep in mind that a nation is made up of people most of whom have little or no control over what their leaders do that is twice now that you have urged mercy and that is very good even for vkandis notorious for being a vengeful god especially for vkandis please remember that religions are made up of people most of whom have very little control over what their priests decree is doctrine keep in mind that given that the priests and the people have free will and the means to exercise it gods may not always be able to control their priests either so what the priests say and the people believe is not always the whole truth karal blinked at that altra evidently decided karal was ready for a little more doctrine smashing time for a parable think of a very wealthy very reclusive man with a dangerous reputation say a former mercenary assume he lives in a town but seldom leaves his home neverthelessand not wanting people to think he is trying to buy good opinionhe sends his servants out secretly day after day to help the worthy poor the sick the helpless then one day while he is coming in his front gate a woman with a baby is attacked by ruffians and he reacts as he was trained draws his sword and cuts them all down in the blink of an eye say that later in the inquiry it was learned that those same ruffians were old enemies of his looking for his new home now what are the townsfolk going to say about him karal knew very well what they would say they would know nothing about the countless acts of mercy and charity that defined the man they would know only the single moment of public bloodshed at the least they would call him vengeful they would fear his temper and might avoid his company if there were those who envied him it might even be whispered that he arranged for the attack on the woman in order to have an excuse for killing the gang and although there would be a shred of truth in the stories of vengeance it would by no means be the entire truth vkandisany godis far more than his people make him altra continued it is the responsibility of the priest to lead them to that understanding so that they do not attempt to limit him to what they know that was what he had been groping for these past several weeks all the pieces for understanding had been there but he just hadnt put them together in so elegant and simple a whole and just at the moment the meeting is going on without your notetaking altra added bending to clean a paw with fastidious attention to detail life is attention to both the large and the small little brother pay heed to the sun but watch your feet or youll fall ingloriously on your nose he bent hastily to his paper with a soft chuckle inaudible to anyone else the meeting went on for far too long but firesong managed to annoy enough useless councillors to guarantee that the next meeting would be much shorter it would have to be firesong had also cut short any attempt by the councillors to turn the meeting into an accusationandblame session with most of both being aimed at the group in the tower that karal found difficult to believe the first time one of them started they seemed to be cherishing a variety of bizarre ideas about what was going on here not the least of which was that they would be safe when the final storm hit and those outside the tower would be the ones in the most danger what was wrong with those people he asked lyam in amazement as the members of their own group broke up and went off on their interrupted studies where did they get those ideas the young hertasi shrugged his tail beating softly against the floor where they both sat organizing their notes and putting up their writing supplies they think we wallow in luxury here that we spend all our time in idle pursuits and speculations that have no bearing on work or reality they half dont believe in the storms they think weve got a fabulous life here and were prolonging our stay here to continue to enjoy this glorious place and our freedom from work and responsibility karal glanced around at their luxurious surroundings taking in the elegant appointments well the inlaid stone floors were certainly beautiful and there wasnt a ceiling like this one in all of karse and valdemar combined but in between true the shinain pallets were colorful and comfortable but they werent the equivalent of anything in the guest quarters at the palace at haven and as for the rest he didnt think that a single one of those councillors had ever eaten slept or lived like this and he didnt think any of them would ever want to it wasnt as bad as the poorest karsite inn workers endured and in some ways it was a little more comfortable than the conditions of vkandis novices but those highborn councillors would probably think theyd been exiled to hard living at the end of the world and what theyd make of buttertea i dont know they might consider it a form of penance i dont know lyam he said finally is this some sort of delusionary illness theyre under the lizard did not have many facial expressions but he could and did cock up a brow ridge actually its distance a fair number of our people back in white gryphon assumed that because we had been given ksheyna vale that we must be living in the midst of incredible luxury anything thats far off must be better than anything at home you see he snorted actually if you want luxury id recommend the courts of the black kings ive been there so i know silk sheets private gardens food worth dying fornow that is what i would call luxury he smacked his lips or what passed for lips karal sighed and shook his head and lyam patted his back cheer up the ones who think were shirking are all idiots and firesong is going to get them to go away if that queen of theirs doesnt find them something harmless to do to keep them occupied that is i know his kind hell keep chipping at them until they quit karal chuckled at lyams all too accurate assessment he can be diplomatic when he wants to be he felt impelled to point out of course he can but diplomacy is for when youve got time and thats the one thing were short of lyam shook his head as his expression turned grave karal im going to get serious for a moment i want you to tell me something and be honest youve worked with these peoplefiresong andesha sejanes and allfor a long time can they do this can they really find an answer to the last storm or should i look for a deep dark den to hide in and hope it doesnt get melted shut behind me karal closed his eyes for a moment taken by surprise by the sudden question perhaps that was why lyam had asked it so that he wouldnt have a chance to prevaricate if anyone can they can he said at last andesha holds the actual memories of urthos enemy maar who was the secondmostpowerful mage of the time of the cataclysm i just dont know if its possible for mortal creatures to save this situation lyam sighed i was afraid you were going to say that he slumped abruptly and looked up at karal with an unreadable expression lets talk about our girls he suggested you and i cant do a blazing thing to help them so lets talk about our girls eh in a mercurial change of mood he grinned showing a fine set of pointed teeth nothing like girls to get your mind off your troubles or give you a different set of troubles to think about karal laughed only too happy to oblige tarrn found them both commiserating over the way that females had to approach any difficulty sideways like a crab instead of meeting it headon a trait it seemed both hertasi and human females shared he stood within earshot for some time simply listening with his pointed ears pricked sharply upward evidently waiting for a natural break in the conversation before interrupting lyam have you any notion where the shinain stored the gray bag of books we brought with us he asked i find i need a reference its easier for me to find it than tell you where it is the hertasi said leaping to his feet stay right here ill bring the whole bag he scampered down the stairs to the workroom and tarrn turned his attention to karal you and my apprentice seem to be getting on well he observed mildly we have a great deal in common sir karal replied politely as you probably noticed tarrns mouth dropped open in a lupine grin young women for one thing alas i fear i could never give you reasonable advice on that subject my kind are neuters but by birth rather than by oath as our shinain friends are that left karal more confused than enlightened all kyree are neuters and where do the kalenedral come into it it took tarrn a few moments to explain that no all kyree were not neuters but that the neuters tended to be the scholars talespinners poets and historians then it took him a bit longer to explain the oaths of the sworn and how the goddess herself rendered them literally sexless which was why it was so very difficult for anyone to be accepted by her into her service karal was not precisely appalled but he was certainly baffled i cant imagine why anyone would want to be sworn he said to the kyree i mean i beg your pardon but dont apologize i dont regret being neuter and over the years ive often considered myself fortunate not to have to put up with what you do tarrn replied thoughtfully as for the sworn whether swordsworn or goddesssworn i can well imagine any number of circumstances where a human would find the burden of sexuality intolerable such tales that brought them to that condition may be sad even horrible but at least among the shinain they have a refuge and for somewell if their life has been spent entirely in the sphere of the intellectual then there is no sacrifice karal took a moment to look for andesha and finally found him deep in conference withloisha and another blackclad shinain i suppose i can think of at least one case where memories might be intolerable he said slowly tarrn followed his gaze the thought had occurred to me as well if we live if there was that word again the one he thought about all the time but did his best not to mention are we likely not to he asked soberly as if called by his gaze andesha left the other shinain and walked over to them just in time to catch tarrns reply i dont know tarrn was quite sober i came here knowing that there was a good chance we would not and so did lyam it is possible that what we record will serve to help others cope with the next cataclysm in another millennia or two or it may help the survivors of this one it seems that the only way we can be assured of survival is through the mechanism you yourself suggested divine intervention he said dryly ah but theres a catch we cant count on it if we do we certainly wont get it andesha nodded as he sat down beside karal that is the way of things with the stareyed at least and this is the heart of her land if we were to call upon anyone it should be kalenel but loisha says that she has been silent of late as if she is no more certain of what is to come than we are so what are we to do tarrn asked when the gods themselves are silent what is a mortal to do i dont know andesha admitted you might try calling on old friends suggested a helpful voice from above their heads as brilliant golden light flooded down upon them tarrn jumped straight up in the air and came down with his eyes wide and his hackles up lyam whose head was just poking up out of the hatchway leading to the stair to the workroom had to grab for the edge of the hatch to keep from falling even karal who had seen this phenomenon before and andesha to whom it was familiar gaped with astonishment as they rose to their feet swooping down from the ceiling in a spiraling dance that involved firesongs ecstatic firebird aya were a pair of mansized hawks with feathers of flame they landed with the grace of a dancer and the weightlessness of a puff of down and the moment they touched the ground they transformed into a man and a woman who still had a suggestion of bird about them the man was dressed as a shinain shaman but the woman was all hawkbrother the shinain present all reacted the same way they did not drop to their knees or grovel but went rigid with the profoundest respect and with naked worship in their eyes whatisthis tarrn managed every hair on his body standing straight out i am dawnfire and this is trevalen the woman said looking down at tarrn with a smile her eyes were open wide as were his and they were perhaps the strangest thing of all about the two for those eyes were the brightspangled black of a starfilled night sky were old friends of andesha altra and florian appeared from one of the farther rooms and made their way across the floor to the little gathering and it seemed that they were the only creatures in the building capable of moving they paused a few paces away from the bright creatures and both made little bows of greeting in unison trevalen and dawnfire are avatars of kalenel tarrn andesha said very quietly and although i would not have claimed the privilege of saying they were my friends they have been very good to me trevalen laughed well claim it or not we are your friends little brother and more than that were here to help you as much as we can that astonishing statement broke the spell holding everyone frozen in silence and everyone in the tower converged on the pair except for karal who sat abruptly down we have altra for vkandis florian for the gods of valdemarand now this what is that shinain saying be careful what you ask for well he had asked for divine aid whether it would be enough remained to be seen eight all i know is this king tremane said rubbing his temple in a gesture of nervous habit i havent even tried to light a candle magically for weeks but my mageenergy is going somewhere if you can tell me where ill feel a great deal better darkwind nodded squinting a little against the brilliant sunlight streaming in through the windows of the kings tower that was what everyone called it nowthe kings tower as shonar had become by default the new capital of hardorn it was a small and slightly shabby residence for a king but hardorn itself had seen better days it would do tremane no harm to be seen putting the welfare of his new country above his own comforts after a frenzy of makedo preparations there had been a tiny coronation ceremony wherein duke tremane had become king tremane and had been presented with a crown that like the country was rather the worse for wear it even appeared to have been flattened before someone managed to wrestle it back into shape still it wasat least nowthe authentic crown of hardorn and there was something to be said for that tremane had accepted it graciously worn it for the coronation then immediately went to his private possessions and had a few things melted down and made into a very slim gold band with minimal ornamentation that bore a remarkable resemblance to his ducal coronet that in turn had borne a remarkable resemblance to the slender coronet that selenay wore but darkwind didnt see any reason to mention that frankly the thin band looked dignified on tremanes balding head as opposed to the heavy crown even if it hadnt been battered the original crown still looked rather silly at least to darkwinds eyes crowns this conference isnt about crowns he turned his attention instead to tremanes statement i think he said slowly that your energy is going into the landat least in making queries of where and what problems there areand that where it goes tells you what places are most damaged i suspect that those places producing monstrosities are the most heavily damaged which is how you have been managing to pinpoint their lairs you can probably stop the drainage if you choose tremane considered that for a moment then shrugged on the whole i dont see why i should bother it isnt a critical drain and it isnt paining me or making me physically weaker the only things i might want to do magically are things the earthsense is giving me anyway i just wanted to know where my energies were going it could have been due to something more sinister that was astute of him and a reflection on the changes in his thinking that he did not immediately assume it was something sinister and begin looking for an enemy tayledras healing adepts can send their energies out to damaged land deliberately darkwind told him and they can redirect energy from elsewhere using themselves as a conduit you seem to have many of the same abilities given to you by the earthsense rather than by accident of birth or because of training interesting tremane replied his brows knitting slightly with thought he leaned toward darkwind as something occurred to him you know theres another thing i had assumed that id have earthsense for all of hardorn from border to border but every time one of those groups comes in to give me theirtheir pledgeit seems as if i can sense more than i could before its difficult to explain its as if i knew the place was there but it was blank or shadowed to me its analogous to seeing into a room that was darkened and is now illuminated that may be precisely what is happening darkwind admitted when someone has an affinity for a given areausually a homeland or at least the village they grew up ina magical link naturally forms between them and the place location and divination spells work just a little easier when they involve that persons home area as a target for example over places the person may have been to only once when these people open themselves up to your rule they may also very well be opening up their homeaffinity connection to you too or well it could also be that the earth you take from them in the seisin ceremony links you to that place its fairly obvious to me that the seisin ceremony itself is a primitive piece of contaminationmagic as for details of how you can use that to advantage i dont know youd have to ask someone who already has the sense he hadnt missed the hesitation before tremane picked the word pledge poor tremane was enduring a great deal of personal embarrassment for the sake of these people if only they knew it little groups were trickling in all the time to swear fealty to their new king and they were using an ancient ritual they referred to as seisin a ritual probably as old as the earthtaking ritual there was no doubt in darkwinds mind that it was just as potent as the earthtaking and just as primitive and it profoundly embarrassed the urbane and efficient tremane as most primitive rituals would embarrass him nevertheless it was effective and he didnt think he needed to point out to tremane that the reason he could sense another new area every time his new liegemen swore to him was that he literally was adding to the area he had taken it was entirely possible that the pinch of earth he had ingested at the ceremony that gave him this new power had been carefully made of a bit of every soil the priests could get their hands on for that very reason thus adding in the extra power gain from contagion speaking of your new subjects tremane theres another group coming in at the gate now said elspeth who happened to be standing by the window theyre pretty heavily armed and i see someone with a pennon at the front she frowned and shaded her eyes with one hand looking down into the courtyard is thatyes it is four sets of strawberryleaves its a baronial coronet on the pennonhead congratulations youve hooked one of the few big fish remaining in hardorn darkwind barely suppressed a smirk for the first time since ive been with you kechara ive just seen a herald act as a herald elspeth just made a short choking sound while gwena tittered in their heads tremane sighed but it was with visible relief id better go right down and greet them properly then he said can we resume our meeting later no reason why not elspeth said for both of them well meet you down there with gwena and the full panoply if youve gotten a baron wed better confirm your treaty and association with the alliance darkwind smiled this was not by any means the first time that gwena he and elspeth had dressed up and assembled to impress the new liegemen it had rather startled some of them to see a horse indoors until they saw elspeths white uniform and realized that it wasnt a horse at all but a companion tremane laughed unexpectedly it seemed to darkwind that the new king laughed quite a bit more than he would have expected perhaps because he had a strong sense of humor about himself you should hear the things my housekeeping staff has to say about hoofprints in the wood floors do you have the same problem in valdemar sadly all the time elspeth told him weve never found a way to prevent them and weve tried everything she moved away from the window with her arms crossed over her chest and a twinkle of amusement in her eye a silver piece says this one will be more impressed by darkwind and vree than by gwena and me ill take that bet tremane responded easily darkwind stood up smiling mostly to himself tremane had become much more relaxed around them since the earthtaking ceremony treating them more often as colleagues and equals than as foreign ambassadors darkwind thought he knew why although he doubted if tremane himself was aware of the reason the land knows elspeth and gwena the valdemarans have always been good stewards of the land and good friends to hardorn since vanyels time it also knows me since serving and healing the land are what the tayledras were born and bred for because the land knows and trusts us it is making tremane feel comfortable around us and inclining him to trust us as well tremanes new link with hardorn was going to affect him in any number of ways that he was not always going to be conscious of but darkwind didnt see anything but good in that prospect very occasionally tremane grew momentarily disoriented by some new information the earthsense threw at him but for the most part he was coping well eventually as hardorn recovered from the damage that had been done to it tremane would find that the land sustained him in moments of stress rather than the reverse there was a knock on the door and elspeth joined darkwind as tremanes aidenow styled his seneschal though he still acted and probably thought of himself as a military aidedecampentered diffidently siri mean your majestythere is a party below who i know ill be there directly tremane interrupted you know the drill by now go see to the arrangements and as soon as i look appropriate ill be down blasted crown he muttered as the aide saluted recollected again that tremane was a king now and not a military commander and bowed himself out where did i put it this time where you always put it tremane elspeth laughed locked up in the chest right with the robes that are too damned heavy to wear and not warm enough to make any difference in the great hall tremane swore with annoyance under his breath and darkwind wondered how he would ever have survived being made emperor if he disliked the panoply of rank so much i wont miss winter one tiny bit thank you ill see you in the hall and we can get this nonsense over with again oh this time it looks as if it will be more than worth the effort elspeth assured him as she preceded darkwind into the hallway will it he asked her as they descended the staircase to their own quarters i think hell be pleasantly surprised she said i dont know much about hardorn heraldry but i think this new fellow may be the highestranking native to survive ancar and that means hell be bringing a fair piece of the country with him not to mention his escort and they looked as if they probably represent some major armed forces so how old is this baron darkwind asked he had a good reason for asking the surviving nobles of hardorn tended to be mostly very old or very young the former had survived by being no threat to ancar and the latter by being hidden by their relatives usually with reliable farmers or other family retainers id say early teens fourteen fifteen at the most elspeth replied hence the reason hell be more impressed by a hawkbrother than a herald he may not even know what a herald is until someone tells him darkwind shook a finger at her youre stealing tremanes silver you little cheat then he shouldnt bet with me he ought to know by now that i never propose a bet unless im certain of the outcome she nodded at the guards on either side of their door and opened it herself their own guards from valdemar stationed inside the door brought their weapons up until they saw who was entering then they grinned sheepishly and returned to a deceptively relaxed posture is that any way to treat a monarch darkwind asked her and sighed as he began climbing the stair to their private quarters never mind forget i asked i suppose it wont hurt him i never treat tremane casually in front of anyone else elspeth reminded him taking the narrow staircase a little behind him this is calculated behavior it shows him that i consider him my equal and will treat him as such and as mother often reminds me the fact that i abdicated in favor of the twins does not make me any less a princess its not a bad thing in this case to have one of the blood royal acting as ambassador true all of it the next floor was the purview of their guards and staff who were currently lounging about engaged in various offduty occupations in the main room of their circular suite elspeth and darkwind both waved at the rest of their entourage as they passed through but did not stop on that floor he continued the conversation well i take it you think this latest delegation is worth bringing out the full formal gear every feather bead bell and bauble elspeth said firmly full whites for me and the circlet with badges and medals and dont pretend you dont like to dress up my love i wouldnt dream of it the scent of the balsam incense he used both to perfume the air of their private quarters and to discourage pests met them as they reached their own floor unlike you socalled civilized peoples we tayledras know how to create clothing that is impressive functional and comfortable dont put me in that civilized category she protested we valdemarans feel precisely the same way well we heralds do anyway and that category includes the ruling family impressive he raised an eyebrow even as he went to the chest containing his clothing and raised the lid ill grant you the functional and comfortable but you valdemarans have no sense of style or at least you heralds dont you horrified my poor hertasi with your uniform you know they thought you were wearing the sacks your clothes were supposed to be carried in they argued about clothing style and decoration happily all the time they were changing into their formal clothing she into the whites that he had redesigned with the additions of rank and he into the most elaborate outfit he owned although by the standards set by firesong he was rather drab his draped clothing of scarlet gold and warm brown was augmented by a sculpted leather tunic with a padded shoulder and when he was dressed vree left his perch by the window and lofted straight to him to land on the shoulder with a fraction of the impact he would have used in making a landing on a perch having vree on his shoulder instead of his wrist served a double function first no falconer would ever have let one of his birds sit on his shoulder that was a tacit invitation to facial scarring or losing an eye if something startled the bird or if it suddenly decided that this was a good time to strike out for freedom this marked him to the knowledgeable as a hawkbrother with no doubt only a bondbird could be trusted to sit this way with no jesses no hood and no means of control over him and second if the exotic clothing would not set him apart from the rest then vree who was much larger than any forestgyre or other gyrfalcon these people had ever seen certainly would elspeth who had a lifetime of rapid changesofoutfit to fall back on waited with an exaggerated expression of boredom for him to finish his belt adjustments bring your head over here elspeth commanded the feathered and beaded ornaments meant to be braided into his hair dangling from one hand she already wore the beaded feather he had given her as a token of love one of vrees own primaries braided into her own should i leave the rest of me here he suggested she made an exasperated tsking sound and pushed him down into a chair vree flared his wings to stay balanced she wove the feathered cords deftly into his long hair as cleverly as if she had been born in an ekele rather than a palace there she said bending to kiss him then rapping him lightly on the top of his head with her knuckles now youre presentable so i am and so are you he rose and headed for the door this time taking the lead down the stairs the entire procedure from the time they entered the room to this moment had taken a fraction of the time it would take tremane to get ready but then again they were not going to have to be laced into ceremonial armor either their own entourage was so used to this by now that there had been no need for elspeth to ask anyone to go get gwena drape her with her ceremonial barding and bells and bring her to the great hall the companion was already waiting for them when they arrived at the side entrance they would use to get in place before either tremane arrived or the delegation was allowed to enter the members of tremanes staff were quite used to seeing a horse wandering about the halls now and let her go her own way when they saw her waiting with her were all of the dignitaries that could be hurried into formal clothing or uniforms on short notice though there was always a chance that not all of them were what they were dressed up to be once after most of tremanes staff had gone to a meeting with the town council darkwind recalled someone had actually borrowed an imperial officers tunic and a handful of medals and coerced the cook into it for one of these ceremonies since the folk coming to pledge their loyalty were likely never to set eyes on shonar again it did no harm to anyone to have impersonators fill in the ranks of tremanes court if it was necessary to give the impression that every petty lordling with a handful of men was being given the highest of honors this time the reverse was true for not only were all the real officials present but the mayor of shonar sandar giles had been on his way for a meeting with one of tremanes underlings when he saw the procession of armed men heading for tremanes manor hed sent a nowexhausted runner hastily back to the town for his mayoral finery and now stood waiting with the rest while the servants did what they could to make the great hall bearable one of tremanes mages is in there warming the place up sandar was saying to tremanes aide who was looking distinctly uncomfortable in his nonregulation heavily embroidered tabard it looked likeand probably wassomething that had been found in an attic and been pressed into service as the official clothing of his majestys seneschal a great deal of the court garments had been made out of salvaged material or dredged out of attics for that matter sandar giles outfit showed a touch of the moths tooth around the squirrelfur trim and the woolen hood as if he had gone to storage for his grandfathers mayoral outfit small wonder tremane has difficulty taking all this seriously his court is hardly up to the standards of even his old ducal household i should imagine elspeth and i are the only ones who are not threadbare and muchmended but none of the various delegations that had come riding or walking in to shonar had looked any better and most had looked much worse by the current standards of the country tremanes court probably looked remarkably prosperous before this is all over we may look back on these times fondly as the days when we were all doing well it was a grim thought but one which he and elspeth often shared if the magestorms could not be held back well there was nothing to be gained by dwelling on that now under tremanes direction people were readying themselves for worse to come and hardornens unlike valdemarans were perfectly willing to believe in worse to come once the ceremony was over but just before the delegation left for home tremane would give this new lot their directions on surviving the final storm as he had every other delegation so far that those directions were mainly guesses hardly mattered they would have direction and confidence that he had the situation on the way to being under control the door opened and a thin gawky man came through it a fellow with thinning hair who squinted at them from behind a pair of glass lenses set in a lead frame that rested on his nose its warm in there now and it should last through your ceremony the mage said and made shooing motions as if they were a bunch of hens he wanted to drive before him in with you now the sooner you get the ceremony over with less likely that the spell will wear off before its over none of them needed a second invitation the hallway was freezing and the promise of warmth was all the encouragement they required to move quickly elspeth and gwena hung back until the others were inside and darkwind remained with them gwena was quite careful whenever she came inside the manor and despite the complaints from tremanes household staff she left very little sign of her presence after these ceremonies some of the hardornen warriors who forgot to remove spurs or came striding in wearing heavy hobnailed boots did worse damage than gwena who picked up each hoof neatly and set it down again with the greatest of care gwena was arrayed in the riderless version of companion full dress no saddle but with a blue and silver blanket cut like her barding decorated at all the points with silver bells a bluedyed leather hackamore with silver tassels at the cheekpieces and reins bedecked with more silver bells had there been more time to ready her the decorations included even bells and blue ribbons to braid into her mane and tail but she had to be content with her mane and tail flowing freely you look lovely as always darkwind told her thank you she replied coyly and gave her head a tiny toss so that the bells chimed im afraid we four are making a more impressive show than tremanes own court but that cant be helped at least we are making our support unmistakable he pointed out as they took their appointed places among the rest there was some shuffling as the dignitaries of tremanes court sorted themselves out then the young seneschal nodded his head and the main doors were flung open to admit the latest delegation at the head of the procession was a youngsterno boy but young too young to need a razorof about fourteen under his scarlet cloak and tabard he wore full armor that had seen hard use and his eyes were far too old to belong to that young face the dented and slightly tarnished baronial circlet about his brow did not detract from the painful dignity with which he carried himself and by his build and the muscles beneath the armor he was clearly no stranger to real fighting behind him more men in full armor followed in pairs ranging in age from powerful graybeards to men only a little older than the boybaron one of the two immediately behind the boy carried a small wooden box they paraded in slowly surveying every person there with suspicion and darkwind smothered a smile as the boys eyes lit on the alliance envoys widened and flitted from elspeth to darkwind and back finally remaining on darkwind i won she mindspoke unnecessarily the entire delegation came to a halt at the foot of the low dais by now several of the shonar artisans were at work on a real throne for tremane since the original throne of hardorn had been lost in looting and fires but it would not be finished for another week or two in place of a real throne was a prop throne made for an imperial theatrical production and modified by those same artisans they had sanded off the gilt paint which had probably looked fine at a distance but only looked cheap and shoddy up close and had removed all of the glasspaste jewels set into the back what had been carved wolves adorning the back were now hounds the hardornen symbol of fidelity the swords making up the legs and arms and interlaced on the back below the hounds had become tree branches and the wood had been rubbed with oils and polished until it shone the shabby cushions had been replaced with brown velvet purloined from drapes taken from storage however in the course of all the recarving the wood had been pared down in some places to a precarious extent and tremane had been warned to be very careful when sitting on it everyone was going to breathe a sigh of relief when the new throne took the place of the old it could be taken for a terrible omen if tremanes throne collapsed beneath him in the middle of one of these ceremonies tremane had goodnaturedly commented that having a fake imperial throne recarved into a fragile hardornen throne was entirely appropriate tremane kept the delegation waiting just long enough for them to get a good look at the rest of his court and to take in the banners on the wall behind his throne which represented those who had already come in and brought him their pledges most of those who had sworn their oaths had taken their banners from the arms of the former nobles of the region although more often than not there had been no one who actually qualified to take those arms tremane had solved that quickly enough by confirming the delegates in their places as the new lords and bestowing the old titles upon them as soon as their pledges were confirmed sadly besides a number of ancient titles going begging there was plenty of empty land lying fallow and abandoned but tremane had plans for that too once summer arrived it would be settled and former imperial officers who were ready to retire would be ennobled and put in place as overlords they would be allowed to take with them as many imperial soldiers as wished to retire to farming and had found brides among the hardornens these would be given freeholdgrants on reclaimed farms thus the newly ennobled would have garrison and work force in one and the newly wed couples would have more of a base for their start than most after that particular announcement the number of engagements and handfastings had skyrocketed and if some of the good farmers and fathers of shonar had been a bit reluctant to welcome imperial sonsinlaw at first their reluctance had evaporated when they learned of the royal brideprice the foreign sonsinlaw would bring thanks to the foresight of their new king darkwind hid a smile as the young baron kept taking covert glances at him as if the youngster had never seen anything so outlandish in his life darkwind had been told that rumors of his presence and powers were circulating out beyond shonars walls rumors which got more and more fantastic with every league distant from the city he wondered what the boy had heard to make him look so wideeyed there was a bit of a stir at the door just off the dais and tremanes majordomo stepped inside the majordomo rapped three times on the floor with the butt of his staff his majesty king tremane of hardorn the man announced in ringing tones his clear commanding voice showing precisely why he had been plucked out of the ranks to fill this position and his majestys chief advisers tremane and his four chief advisers filed in with ponderous dignity of course his chief advisers were also members of his bodyguard but their weapons were not carried in an obvious fashion and there was nothing about them to advertise that fact tremane wore his ceremonial armor the hardornen crown a tapestry tabard with his own arms requisitioned from his former squire and was draped in a fine cloak of silk edged in heavily embroidered silk trim purloined from the same curtains that had provided him with material for the seat cushions of his throne the cloak was also part of the props for some unknown play it was ridiculously long and required the services of two small boys recruited as pages to carry the trailing end both pages were from the group of five children that tremane and his men had rescued from the grip of the first killing blizzard tobe and racky were their names and they took their duty as tremanes pages very seriously they had been nicely outfitted in page costumes cut down from imperial officers uniforms by their mothers who nearly burst with pride at the notion that their boys were serving the new king tremane took his seat gingerly which translated into a ponderous sort of dignity to outside eyes the pages arranged his royal mantle out before his feet like a peacocks tail just on sanitys side of preposterous and retired to their positions behind the throne the young baron tensed as tremane nodded to him baron peregryn i understand that you are from adair he said quietly you are a very welcome addition to the court darkwind watched the boy and his entourage to see if they noticed the relative informality of tremanes address after much consideration he had decided to completely do away with the royal plural because ancar had been so rabid in its use darkwind saw two of the older men exchange brief nods and it seemed to him that they wore expressions of satisfaction the young baron took two steps to the foot of the throne and went immediately to one knee and the rest of his entourage followed his example in dropping to theirs i have come to offer you my pledge king tremane the youngster said in a high tenor that trembled only a little and in token of this pledge i bring you seisin of my lands and those of the men pledged in their turn to my service young baron peregryn reached behind him without looking and the man carrying the small wooden casket placed it in his outstretched hand darkwind watched their movements carefully analyzing everything they did and making some guesses about the relationship the baron had with his men he is the acknowledged leader no matter how young he appears to be and he and the older men have worked and fought together a great deal they trust himand he trusts them he has youth enthusiasm and charisma and they have experience and they all work to weave these things together this one will be worth watching for stories and songs of noble deeds the boy opened the casket and held it out to tremane who took a double handful of soil from within and held it for a moment thus do i tremane king of hardorn take seisin of the lands of peregryn baron of adair and of those who are pledged to him he proclaimed in a voice suitable for a battlefield oration he dropped the soil back into the casket and held out his hand to tobe the older of his two pages tobe handed him a small dagger and with his face completely unflinching he slashed his palm shallowly held his hand over the casket and allowed his blood to run into it and mix with the earth inside thus do i tremane king of hardorn by acknowledgment of the soil of hardorn itself give the pledge of my body to the lands of peregryn baron of adair and of those who are vowed to his service the other page racky took the dagger and handed him a linen cloth which he used to bind the wound across his palm meanwhile tobe took the casket from peregryn mixed the soil and blood thoroughly with a miniature spade and then used the spade to divide the moistened soil between the original casket and a small box tobe handed the casket back to peregryn who received it with the same reverence as he would a holy relic tobe gave the box to the seneschal who would take it to the cellars of the manor and add it to the urn of soil already there all of this mixing and dividing gave tremane a chance to recover from the shock of adding yet another stretch of land to his senses darkwind knew that by the time he reached his own quarters again the slash would be completely healedand now was the moment when he would confirm his right to be king by telling peregryn what if anything was wrong with his lands if anything no there will be a great deal wrong there adair is supposed to be in the north and there would have been reflections off the iftel border before firesong and the rest instigated the counterstorm tremanes eyes had the glazed look that meant he felt something very strong which probably meant very bad your lands baron peregryn include a small river valley bounded by a lake a hill shaped like a sleeping cat and a forest of pines he said slowly as if he were talking in his sleep peregryns eyes widened and several of the men behind him began whispering urgently together beneath that hill there is a cave and within that cave there is a place where magic is pooling and stagnating living there is a beast changed by magic into a monster you cannot kill it directly it will cost too many lives you cannot poison it to kill it you must feed it a cow which has been fed on daturaflower for three days it will gorge itself and the action of the flower will make it sleepy and it will go to the cave to hide you must then collapse the cave or brick it up sealing it inside tremane went on reciting the locations of several more pockets of trouble together with suggested solutions for eliminating the problems peregryn wouldnt be able to implement all or even most of those solutions until summer but at least now he and his men knew where all the trouble spots were and would be able to deal with them one at a time as tremane spoke more and more of peregryns men began whispering together their expressions taking on the slightly stunned look of men who were hearing something they could not believe and yet could verify evidently several of tremanes revelations matched problems they already knew aboutand knew that tremane could not have learned by any normal means finally tremane fell silent then blinked shook his head a little and his eyes cleared of their daze i trust that will help he said dryly he would remember everything he had said of course this was not a true trance more of a state of intense concentration and behind him one of his clerks had been taking down every word and would give peregryn a copy before he left if peregryn was unable to deal with any of the problems tremane had identified for him there would be a record of what the problem was and where and eventually tremanes own men would move in to take care of it more than simply help your majesty peregryn replied shakily he would have said more but one of the men of his group overcome with fervor and enthusiasm leaped to his feet brandishing his sword over his head long life to king tremane he shouted his voice actually cracking with excitement all gods bless king tremane that goaded everyone else in the entourage and eventually peregryn as well to get to their feet in an eruption of cheers tremane remained sitting on his thronein part darkwind knew because he couldnt stand just yetand bent his head to them in gracious acknowledgment of their accolade some of the oldest men were openly weeping these were the ones who eventually thrust themselves forward flung themselves at tremanes feet and kissed his hand with tears streaming down their faces it was a moment of extreme and powerful emotion and tremane himself was not unmoved by it the king took great care to clasp every mans hand using both hands listening to him babble until he was ready to rise again and let another take his place it was quite obvious to darkwind that tremane recognized these old warriors for what they were and knew how difficult it was to get any sort of accolade from them much less this kind of emotional outburst these older men always proved to be those who had survived the purges and who had expected to die without ever seeing hardorn return to peace and prosperity darkwind knew very well why they wept and so did tremane i have given them back their dreams and their hope he had said a little in awe himself after the first time this had happened they see a future now where their grandchildren can expect to grow up without fear of being murdered on a royal whim and he was right that was precisely what those old men saw a future where before had been only darkness and doubt it took some time before the young baron and his men managed to calm themselves down and more before all of the appropriate ceremonies had been fulfilled tremane apologized for having to house them in a barracks they hastened to assure him that they would have been perfectly willing to camp in the snow tremane directed his supply sergeantwho now bore the impressive title of procurement adviserto bestow upon his new liegemen the usual gifts and they made a token protest the usual gifts were all surplus items so much in surplus that their value in the town would be seriously depreciated if any more came on the market surplus imperial clothing surplus hand tools surplus weapons some of tremanes people had argued against that last pointing out that he would be arming those who had lately been his enemies but tremane felt and darkwind agreed with him that giving them weapons demonstrated his trust in them it was a gesture worthy of a king besides these new liegemen needed the weaponry that tremane gave them their own supplies had been depleted in their war against the imperial forces if they were going to rid themselves of their lands boggles they needed weapons this wasnt at all altruistic practically speaking tremane would rather that they went after their boggles instead of turning to imperial soldiers for help they knew the lay of their own land where a boggle might lair where it could run his men wouldnt couldnt better to let the local experts handle it if there was any chance they could by the time the presentation was over baron peregryn and his men were however so happy they were beside themselves they never even noticed that tremane had gone pale and was sweating his hands clenching the arms of his throne so hard that the knuckles were white he isnt getting up because he cant elspeth said her mindvoice sharp with alarm its more than simple disorientation this time its really striking him hard whats wrong he asked hoping shed know i cant tell and neither can gwena there was frustration there as well as alarm all i can tell for certain is that hes in nearly the same state as he was when his earthsense was first awakened this has something to do with the earthsense itself and something to do with this new area hes taken seisin of neither of them dared move to help him not while the baron and his people were still present tremane was clearly attempting to conceal his weakness and it was their responsibility to follow his wishes he reached for her hand as she reached for his their hands closed on each other and they stood waiting tensely while the last of the amenities were played out finally the baron and all of his men trooped out to be accommodated overnight in one of the barracks in the morning tremane would meet with them again and give them warning and instructions concerning what everyone here was now calling the final storm and what to do to weather it then when everything had been organized for their return they would go back home with a small caravan of supply sledges only after the doors closed behind them could tremane fold his body over his knees and his own people rush to help him but he waved them away before they could do more than ask him what was wrong ill be all right he said and darkwind let out the breath he had been holding for he sounded normal just a bit shaken its nothing physical and i dont believe its anything to worry about justsomething unexpected just happened let me sit here for a moment or two more while i get over it he looked over at darkwind and smiled ruefully quite frankly it feels as if someone just dropped me off a very high cliff and i stopped just short of the ground elspeth knelt at his side and darkwind joined her its the new barony isnt it she asked its something there is it the storms starting again as if her questions gave him a focus for his own sensations he seized on them yes no yes its adair and no its not the storms i dont know what it is but its notno wait his eyes took on that faroff gaze again its the border the northern border adair is on the northern border and something has happened up there something important something that changes everything what one of tremanes generals began but tremane just shook his head dumbly i dont know he repeated i just knowits something completely new whats on the northern border someone else asked and looked at elspeth for the answer she had one for that question but she had turned as pale as tremane iftel she said and her hand clenched tight on darkwinds iftel the one place in this part of the world that no one knows anything about so thats the message tremane said his eyebrows rising just that nothing more with his recovery the meeting among darkwind elspeth and tremane that had been interrupted had been moved back to the office in his quarters but by now they had all forgotten whatever it was they had been talking about for a message had come by way of signaltowers from the north unfortunately it only confirmed that something had happened and gave them very little other information thats all there was siryour majesty the aide recovered from his mistake just that the border with iftel suddenly opened and a new delegation of something friendly was coming down here to meet with you im afraid he continued apologetically that the signal language is not very specific the signal did say they were friendly though youre sure youre not misreading that if tremanes voice was sharp with anxiety darkwind couldnt blame him no sir that much is quite clear the aide said with certainty the old man at the signal did say that the term used was one that he hadnt seen very often but that it was definitely noted as being friendly thank the gods for small favors tremane muttered and sighed running a hand over his chin well now i know what itahfeels like to have the iftel border open up thats useful information but how whatever is coming expects to travel in this winter weather i cant begin to imagine peregryn and his men did darkwind pointed out theres no reason to suppose others cant but it will take time for them to arrive perhaps weeks on foot ten days by horse by then i might even have a throne i can sit on without worrying if its going to break and drop me on my rump tremane sighed then laughed listen to me complaining about a flimsy throne as if that was the worst thing we have to face a delegation from iftel elspeth mused twisting one of the rings she wore around and around theyve always allowed a single envoy from valdemar inside their land so long as it was a member of the merchants guildbut never anyone from the mercenarys guild and they would never permit heralds inside she shook her head the envoy never would tell us much only that they preferred peace but werent particularly interested in any exchanges with us very insular darkwind commented quite well aware that this was a case of the goose complaining that the swan had a long neck one can hardly call the tayledras anything but insular they could have good reason for being insular tremane pointed out when was the first time people of valdemar encountered them quite some time after the founding elspeth admitted their barrier was already in place then at least according to the chronicles it was a merchant who was first allowed inside and it has mostly been merchants who crossed it since she smiled deprecatingly they may be insular but like the rest of us they enjoy buying things darkwind hid his own smile for that last shot had been meant for herself she had been unable to resist spending some of her own money on a few odd trifles that had turned up in the loot of the imperial storehouse so they could have encountered someone or something extremely dangerous before they ever saw you tremane pointed out his eyes speculative as he probably tried to envision what could have been so terrible that it caused an entire country to erect a magical barrier to keep out intruders that it was a barrier that had survived centuries and baffled the magic powers of ancar falconsbane and the empire alike made it all the more intriguing they probably did darkwind put in in those early days there were terrible things that far north there was at least one tayledras vale somewhere about there and our chronicles report that at some time while they lived there they encountered and defeated a dark mage much like ancars servant falconsbane but with a larger following he did not add that this mage probably had actually been falconsbane in one of his earlier incarnations tremane neither knew about falconsbane nor likely cared the only person still concerned with maarfalconsbane was andesha and only because andesha still held those criticallyimportant memories but as for the rest of them falconsbane is dead with the past and this time he will stay that way and about damned time but we have more important things to worry about the sober glance that elspeth cast his way said virtually the same thing for now the situation was grave enough that even isolated iftel was opening her borders and sending representatives to them there was no leisure to dwell on the past i dont know what if anything these representatives of iftel might offer you darkwind cautioned if nothing else tremane mused perhaps we can get them to part with the secret that makes up their border its shielded them from the worst of the storms so far it might be able to shield us as well provided these people arrive here before the question becomes academic gordun tremanes chief mage reminded him dryly its a long way to the northern border and the going is difficult by the time they get here the final storm could have left us in ruins here tremane nodded ruefully a good point though it was an entertaining thought while it lasted well that brings up the next decision what shall we tell our newest baron tomorrow about the final storm hide and finish your card games quickly one wag suggested there was a general strained laugh and then the discussion moved into the serious channel of what to do in the immediate future eventually late that night precisely what should be told to the baron and his entourage had been worked out enough to make him understand the gravity of the situation but not so much that he would panic panic would be bad for peregryn and his people as well over the course of the next couple of days the baron got his pick of surplused supplies was given a review of troopers interested in resettling up north and got his briefing and warnings about the final storm he and his own advisers were philosophical about that last there was nothing they could do to stop it and they could only hope that the physical effects were limited to places with no human populations during the first of the storms caught both by the initial storm waves and the reflected waves from the iftel border they had suffered more damage than anyone yet reporting in we have already had a halfdozen people unfortunate enough to be caught in one of the things we are calling changecircles and they were changed even as beasts are peregryn said with a shrug of deeply felt helplessness the fortunate died and the unfortunate lived added one of his advisers grimly though often that was not long when they made the mistake of approaching others for help it wasnt always their bodies that changed at least not outwardly tremane exchanged a significant look with darkwind this was something he and his people had thought of at about the same time the potential for trouble occurred to the allies but while those in valdemar had been concerned with prediction of where the changecircles would occur and thus preventing people or large animals from being caught in one the people in and around shonar had planned on what to do when a human became a monster until this moment that had been nothing more than a possibility now they knew that there were transformed humans somewhere out there in the north and it was time to put some of those plans into action in case the hapless victims trekked south tremane wrote something on a small slip of paper and passed it to a page to take to his clerks the orders already written out would go into the troops daily briefing in essence they were simple enough humans have been caught in the storms and changed if a boggle shows intelligence and no aggression be warybut leave it alone long enough for it to show its intentions there had been some debate on the subject with a minority objecting to the mere idea of giving a boggle the chance to attack first and a second minority wanting to make attempts to communicate with every boggle that even paused for a moment before attacking finally to end the debating tremane had exercised his royal prerogatives and decreed the language of the order which predictably did not entirely satisfy anyone not even tremane himself darkwind had noticed however that tremane had applied enough of the imperial manner not to care if anyone was satisfied including himself so long as his decree did the job for which it was intended neither of them could ever have guessed the immediate effect of that simple order not more than two days after sending baron peregryn and his entourage and gift sledges off during yet another ceremony of seisinthis time for the benefit of a very old squire who had sent his informal pledge some time earlier but who had not felt equal to taking the winter journey until nowthey learned exactly why the signaltowers had said that something was coming down from iftel no one there could have expected just what the somethings were tremane had just added his blood to the soil that old squire mariwell had brought with him when a great clamor arose up on the walls of the manor darkwind started and looked up automatically although he wouldnt be able to see a thing through the stone walls and ceiling with great presence of mind racky took the casket of earth from tremanes hands mixed the contents quickly divided them and handed the old man his own casket back while all about him his elders were behaving skittishly staring and muttering among themselves hands on empty scabbards before tremane could send to find out what the cause of all the ruckus was and right after racky pressed the casket of soil back into its owners shaking hands one of the kings bodyguards came bursting into the great hall his face as white as the snow outside boggles over the castle he cried oh by the gods great huge flying boggles so many they cover the sky oh gods help us elspeth held up her hand to shade her eyes and squinted up at the dark shapes hovering in the brilliant blue sky above the courtyard it was too soon yet to say just what these boggles looked like other than the fact that they were winged but there was something about those black v shapes and the way that they swooped and soared that looked tantalizingly familiar they remind me of treyvan and hydona but they dont fly exactly the same way could they be gryphons thereve been rumors of gryphons in the north for years now remember your orders men tremane called to the nervous sentries on the walls and towers above no shooting without provocation pray they dont take simple swooping as provocation therere exactly twentyone of them darkwind said absently from her right as he peered upward into a sky blindingly bright he bit his lip and she sensed that he was thinking hard for a moment then his eyes narrowed as if he had just made a decision he extended his gloved hand to vree who transferred his perch from the shoulder to the gauntlet with that intensity of gaze that told elspeth he was getting silent instructions from his bondmate a heartbeat later darkwind flung vree upward and the bondbird pumped his wings skyward heading straight for those twentyone mysterious vs ill know in a moment just he began his eyes half closed then unexpectedly he laughed the sound echoing across the otherwise silent courtyard and making just about everyone in tremanes escort jump and stare at him as if they suspected he had gone mad he brushed his snowwhite hair back from his forehead and pointed up at the boggles then at vree who had reversed his climb and was making a leisurely descent tell your men to put their weapons away king tremane darkwind called holding out his gloved fist for the returning forestgyre vree flared his wings ruffling darkwinds hair and landed as lightly as a bit of thistledown settling his talons gently around the leathercovered wrist i suspect thats your delegation from iftel up there and if they can see half as well as my old friends treyvan and hydona can they arent about to land until theres no chance that theyll wind up becoming feathered pincushions they are gryphons then elspeth asked feeling a strange thrill of excitement could these be more of the missing companies from the days of the mage wars could be even with the distortion of looking through vrees eyes these gryphons dont look quite like the ones weve seen millennia of separation from the parent stock would do that i suspect darkwind continued to peer upward as the imperial guards reluctantly put down their weapons at tremanes shouted orders its either that or some unbelievably clever adept managed to duplicate the gryphons we know and i doubt thats possible whatever was or was not possible it was soon obvious that darkwind was right about the gryphons eyesight as soon as the last spear was grounded and the last arrow put back in its quiver the hovering specks above descended with a speed that put vree to shame and made elspeth recall what her mothers falconer had once said if you want to know what the fastest bird in the world is ask the falconer whos just had his prize peregrine carried off by a stooping eagle not only did the gryphons descend with breathtaking speed they did so with artistry they dropped in a modified stoop that followed a tightly spiraling path down into the relatively small courtyard one after the other in a precise formation like beads on a string as the first of them backwinged hard kicking up a wind that drove debris all over the courtyard and made those who had not been prepared for the amount of air those huge wings could push shield their faces elspeth wanted to applaud the theatrical entrance the huge creature landed on the cobbles of the court as lightly as vree on darkwinds glove touching down with one outstretched hindclaw first then settling neatly an eyeblink later posed and poised with wings folded like a guardian statue in the middle of the expanse of stone the next followed a moment after and the next until the remaining twenty were ranged in a deliberate double halfcircle behind their leader all in the same precise regal posture as darkwind had indicated they did not look quite like the gryphons of kleshya these creatures were heavier of beak neck and chest like eagles rather than stocky and broadwinged like hawks or lean largeeyed and longwinged like falcons in color they were quite unlike the gryphons of kleshya who were as varied in color as the creatures they had been modeled after these gryphons were a uniform dark brown from beak to tail a color with some patterned shading in a lighter brown but nothing nearly like the malarstripes or masks of the falconiform gryphons or the variegations of the hawkgryphons with their bright yellow beaks and claws the effect was very impressive to someone who had never seen any two gryphons who looked precisely alike as if someone had deliberately made up a wing of gryphons that matched in every way like a matched set of horses in a parade group they looked every bit as intelligent as treyvan and hydona and their yellow eyes watched every move made by the humans before them with calculation and speculation the heavier beaks made their faces look oddly proportioned at least at first but elspeth found herself swiftly growing used to the new variation each of them wore a harness and pack very similar to the ones the kaledain gryphons often wore made of highly polished leather of a rich reddish brown with polished brass fittings the apparent leader also wore a neckcollar and chestpiece that looked as if it had been derived from armor some time in the far distant past now it served only to bear a device of three swords hilts down points up with a single heraldic sun above the middle elspeth glanced at darkwind who shook his head slightly whatever it signified he didnt recognize the symbology the gryphons waited motionless except for the rising and falling of their chests watching for someone among the humans to make the first move the imperials and hardornens one and all stared back at them faces pale and limbs rooted to the spot elspeth thought of her first sight of gryphons and couldnt blame them for not moving here were creatures twentyone of them with sickles on their front and hind claws and meat hooks twice the size of a mans head in the middle of their facesshe wouldnt have been eager to rush up and embrace them in the name of brotherhood either i suppose its up to us darkwind said a touch of amusement in his voice he stepped forward elspeth a scant pace behind him gwena following at elspeths side until he stood in comfortable speaking range of the leader who regarded him with the unwavering scarcely blinking gaze of the raptor welcome to shonar capital of leader tremane of hardorn in the name of the alliance he said in careful kaledain i am darkwind ksheyna representative of the clans of the tayledras of the pelagirs the shinain of the dhorisha plains and the kaledain of kleshya vale and white gryphon this is elspeth daughter of selenay ruler of valdemar and companion gwena representatives of the peoples of valdemar rethwellan and karse behind me are leader tremane of hardorn and his officials and advisers elspeth knew only enough kaledain to follow what darkwind was saying she could not have hoped to make the same speech herself kaledain was handicapped by not having a word for king the closest was leader or ruler and it gave no sense of the size of what was ruled darkwinds three peoples freely borrowed whatever local term applied but she suspected that he was afraid that the gryphons before him would have no idea what the hardornen titles meant the chief gryphon listened attentively and with great concentration and waited for a moment after darkwind had finished to see if he would add anything when darkwind said nothing more but made a slight bow the gryphon opened his beak he replied in a clear enough voice but his words were in a form of kaledain so drastically different from anything she knew that she could only recognize the origin and not what the envoy said now it was darkwinds turn to listen closely and with immense concentration brows knitted into an unconscious frown as he followed the carefully enunciated words she did not venture to break his concentration by mindspeaking to him i dont suppose youre picking up anything from them are you she asked gwena as darkwind made a reply of which she only understood half the words none of them in sequence she guessed that he was elaborating on who was what and to whom the gryphon needed to apply for reception of his delegation not a thing theyre shielded and shielded hard came the helpful reply it would be useful to have an empath with us at the moment but i dont think theres anything other than a fairly reasonable level of anxiety in them at this point in the gryphons reply elspeth caught the word hardorn and darkwinds face cleared it would be a great deal easier if you could speak in the language of hardorn sir he replied in that tongue i fear that time has changed the language you speak from the one taught to me a grrreat deal of time young brrrothertohawksss the gryphon rumbled with evident amusement a verrry grrreat deal of time by anyones measurrre i am tashiketh pral skylshaen envoy from the land you know as iftel to the court of king tremane who we have been told has been chosen for his office by the land as it was in the old days he waved a huge taloned hand in an expansive gesture at the twenty gryphons poised behind him this is my wing these are the representatives of the twenty hrradurr of iftel courageous and worthy of their offices who each won the right to fly in my wing in the bahathyrrr the hrradurr were evidently subdivisions of iftelthough what the bahathyrrr could be elspeth could not even begin to guess she made a quick handgesture behind her back hoping tremane would take the hint and come up to be presented but he was already moving before she gestured with quick wits he had already anticipated what was needed the moment that the gryphon began to speak in hardornen he walked forward with grace that could only be trained into someone who began learning the peculiar dance of court movement at a very early age when he reached darkwinds side he bowed his head in a slight acknowledgment to tashiketh the gryphon in his turn made a deep obeisance to the king then carefully extracted a packet of folded papers from a pouch at the side of his harness and handed them to darkwind who in turn gave them to tremane the land of iftel sends greetings to hardorns new ruler oh tremane once of the house imperial the gryphon said in his strangely accented hardornen we have been sent by the assembly of peoples and he who made the barrier to bear the greetings of our assembly and our peoples and to offer you our personal assistance in current and future difficulties we are he added with a lift of his head authorized to assist you in any way elspeth could guess at the thoughts running through tremanes head at the moment though he gave no sign of them as he gravely thanked ambassador for his greetings and his offer he cant take this offer seriously likeliest is either that tashiketh is not aware of what he is actually promising or that this is a polite custom of iftel a standard speech and the offer is not meant to be anything more than an expression of polite esteem that of course was only logical as welcome as the aid of a full wing of gryphons would be how could an ambassadorial delegation be expected to perform any services that did not directly benefit their own land and certainly there was no reason to believe that such a blank card had been given to king tremane to fill in as he cared to he could conceivably ask them to do something too dangerous for his own men to try if they were harmed he would have to face the consequences but it made no sense to think that iftel would be willing to put its citizens in danger of course darkwind and i and our entourage are perfectly willing to put ourselves in dangerand dobut thats because we arent really just envoys were representatives of the alliance and were performing as hardorns military allies as well as our other duties in a sense were a very small military unit as well as ambassadors the next thing that must be running through tremanes head as he surveyed the halfcircle of twentyone very large gryphons was where on earth was he going to put them he couldnt put them in the stable nor in one of the barracks surely he must see that the stable simply wasnt suitable even if her companion and darkwinds dyheli brytha were willing to put up with it and the earthsheltered barracks buildings would probably give creatures of the air great screaming fits of claustrophobia she considered the gryphons their size and their probable needs they would all fit in the great hall could that drafty barn of a room be made habitable as well as elegant each of the several towers of the manor would probably hold four or five gryphons in each of the topmost rooms which were mostly used as armories and weapon storage for the sentries that were posted there would the gryphons consent to being split up if they would there was at least access to the air from the trapdoors in each of the tower roofs fortunately thanks to the spacious barracks now available and the fact that a large number of staff persons mages healers and other auxiliaries now were housed in the city rather than in the manor itself the overcrowding that had been making life so difficult in the early days here had been overcome there was room in the manor for the gryphons at least on a temporary basis but from tashikeths speech this was intended to be a permanent delegation and they would need permanent housing tremane made a graceful rambling speech of welcome probably while he was trying to think of housing options there are still some unused buildings in shonar would the gryphons be willing to be housed in an embassy in the city but if they did what would they use for servants gryphons required a lot of tending there were any number of things that they couldnt do for themselves lighting fires for instance talons were not good at manipulating firestrikers and feathers were dismayingly flammable the gryphons of kleshya had specially trained trondiirn to see to their health and wellbeing treyvan and hydona had done without such help officially at least for several yearsbut the ksheyna hertasi had helped them unofficially what would these gryphons do did they even guess that the people of hardorn and the empire were unready to host them tremane finally ran out of things to say and so did tashiketh they stood on the cobblestones and looked politely at one another for a moment and it was tremane who finally broke the silence now i must confess that i and my people are simply not prepared for anything other than strictly human ambassadors he said in a burst of that unimperial frankness that was becoming a welcome characteristic of his we were somewhat thrown offbalance when the alliance sent two nonhumans the companion gwena here and her collegue the dyheli brytha who intends to present himself to you later we were completely unprepared for them but they were gracious and generous enough to accept the stable as perfectly adequate though it was scarcely that gwena bowed in graceful acknowledgement of the compliment and tashiketh glanced at her curiously then returned his attention to tremane to be honest ambassador tashiketh i do not know what we are going to do for the comfort of you and your entourage tremane confessed ruefully i can only think of three possibilities and none of them are ideal there are four tower rooms that might do if youd be willing to split up into groups of four or five at tashikeths headshake he went on doggedly then there is only the great hall or taking a building in the city itself but that was what we had intended to do take a building and make of it our permanent embassy tashiketh interrupted gravely we have brought with us the hire of the building of staff we knew that your resources are stretched and had no intention of straining them further if we could just spend a few days here somewhere that would be enough surely as soon as we have established our own place we will remove to it if tremane sighed with relief he was schooled enough not to show it we shall be happy to house you in the great hall for as long as it takes for you to establish your embassy he replied with commendable ease as out of the corner of her eye elspeth saw the young seneschal breaking away from the rest of the group and pounding at a dead run toward the nearest doorway to put tremanes intentions into effect she hid a smile that was one benefit of having a staff composed entirely of military people instead of arguing that something couldnt be done they ran off and made it happen if you would be so kind then i would ask you to send a messenger to some representative of your city that we might establish ourselves as quickly as possible tashiketh asked and she thought she caught a sly glint of humor as he added and in the meanwhile perhaps you have someone who would conduct us in a tour this is the first time i have seen a wholly human city the differences are apparent even at a distance elspeth tried not to choke for this was so clearly a diplomatic gesture to ensure that tremanes people had time to get suitable quarters for the gryphons ready tashiketh and his wing must be exhausted and were probably also ravenous to ask for a tour under those conditions bespoke a consummate diplomat volunteer to give him the tour yourself ill go help advise tremanes people on the care and feeding of gryphons she quickly told darkwind who smoothly volunteered his services as soon as she made the suggestion the iftel delegation and their reception committee quickly broke into three groups one of humans one of mixed humans and gryphons and one of gryphons only tashiketh darkwind and an escort of amused valdemaran guards and two solemn and militant gryphons went off for a brief tour of the grounds as built and fortified by tremanes people the rest of the gryphons stationed themselves in the courtyard like a group of sober and businesslike young guardtrainees to wait for their leaders return gwena returned to the stable by herself as elspeth went with tremane and his people and volunteered her expertise as soon as they were out of gryphonic earshot within a relatively short period of time the great hall had been stripped of the trappings of power and refurbished as temporary housing for twentyone gryphons this turned out to be a great deal easier than she had thought it would remembering what treyvan and hydona had done elspeth and the supply sergeant went over the lists of surplus and stores until they found enough equipment to make the gryphons reasonably comfortable then she commanded a squad of sturdy fighters in carrying out every bit of furniture stage curtains and painted backdrops were sent for to help keep the chill of the stone walls at bay and a rainbow of rugs brought in to soften floors every featherbed that could be spared was brought in once the rugs were down and the draperies up until there were twentyone good nests covered with as many thick blankets and throws as a gryphon could want twenty of the nests were arranged along the walls with the twentyfirst up on the dais and hastilyrigged curtains put up that could partition off that part of the room to make an individual chamber as privacy it wasnt much but at least it was a good gesture in that direction and if tashiketh preferred to keep the curtains open he could the largest soup kettles available were brought and filled with fresh water for drinking with large deep soup bowls arranged on a table beside the kettles in case these gryphons preferred to drink from a small vessel rather than plunge their prodigious beaks into a larger one that took care of drink and elspeth advised the cook what kinds of raw meat fowl and fish best suited their new guests the room looked quite odd by the time they were done but strangely not at all shabby there was a curious sort of harmony in the painted canvas scenery backdrops separated by velvet stage curtains covering the walls and between the bewildering variety of rugs blankets and throws covering the floor and the nests the end effect was something like being inside an extremely luxurious tent were ready she told darkwind as the last of the carpenters cleared their ladders and equipment out and the first of the kitchen staff began arriving with whole sides of beef and baskets of fish thats good because im running out of things to show them and i doubt theyre going to be able to express even polite interest in warehouses and latrines darkwind sounded distinctly amused and elspeth had the feeling that tashiketh was proving to be quite good company she cleared out herself leaving the young seneschal to do the honors on behalf of tremane and decided that she had best report what she had so cavalierly ordered to the king himself but someone had already gone to fetch him for he met her at the door with his escort and hers in tow he surveyed the transformed room with some surprise and a great deal of relief bless you herald elspeth he said with feeling id have had my carpenters trying to cobble up gigantic cadges or floor perches or something of the sortwhich wouldnt have been a disaster but it would have delayed things while tashiketh explained what they really needed will this be warm enough though he added looking at the hangings with a slight frown of uncertainty this place is notoriously drafty it will do she replied their feathers keep them as warm as our winter cloaks do and they really only need to stay out of extreme cold and drafts the hangings will block the drafts well enough and they can wrap themselves in rugs and blankets to sleep add charcoal braziers carefully tended and they should be fine theyll need one of your healersa good brave person who will find them a challenge and not something to be afraid ofand about four servants to run errands watch the braziers and fetch things at all times a healer tremane asked with surprise signaling to one of his aides why a healer they look healthy enough to me gryphons have peculiar strengths and weaknesses the ones i know always try to have a specially trained helper around them to keep them healthy she explained a healer is the closest we have to that and i expect that tashiketh will be willing to explain their needs she coughed hiding her expression behind her hand the hardest part will be finding a healer and a handful of servants brave enough to come tend to boggles but it was tremanes turn to smile knowingly not as hard as you might think elspeth of valdemar he said lightly we of the empire are made of sterner stuff than that and so it proved tremane had not one but two healers eager to have access to the gryphons and there was no problem in getting volunteers from the ranks for the light duty of acting as servants to the ambassador and his entourage as soon as tashiketh and his corps had been installed pronounced themselves delighted and dined they had their healer and their servants waiting for orders tashiketh had displayed surprise when he saw the quarters if an onlooker knew what to look for he had shown more surprise and pleasure at the quality of the hospitality he dismissed the wouldbe trondiirn and three of the four servers as soon as he and the others had eaten with thanks and the information that they all needed to rest after their journey he asked the fourth server to stay to watch the braziers and in case any of them required something after they retired which the man was not at all loath to do the other three made themselves comfortable in a niche in the hall close by and got out the inevitable dice are they going to sleep really tremane asked darkwind as the king and his small entourage left the gryphons to their privacy probably so the hawkbrother replied even given that they flew here in order to reach us that was a tremendous distance they covered in a very short time judging by the amount they ate theyre going to sleep the sleep of the sated until well past sunrise tomorrow tremane ran his hand over the top of his balding head looking at the moment nothing like a king i thought that having earthsense dropped on me was confusing he said slowly looking honestly bewildered theyre huge and like nothing ive ever been near before now what do i do how do i treat them you have dinner with elspeth and me and you simply accept them as any other foreign ambassadors darkwind advised this is a great honor yes it is also the first time iftel has sent out representatives who were not human this cant be any easier for them than it is for you you may not be used to having gryphons as ambassadors but they arent used to being ambassadors in the first place tremane looked at him oddly for a moment then began to laugh and if there was a faint edge of hysteria to his laughter elspeth couldnt blame him tremanes men trampled their way purposefully through the snow hauling burdens readying sledges and animals shouldering packs and weapons darkwind guided tashiketh and his everpresent gryphonguards through the gates and toward the worst of the congestion stopping often to allow someone with a more urgent task get past them what is all this excitement concerning tashiketh asked watching the activity swirling around them with curiosity brimming over in his large golden eyes i was about to explain it to you darkwind replied quickly stepping out of the way of a man burdened with an entire bundle of spear shafts we had a very unexpected and unpleasant message last night ah now i regret vacating our palace quarters so soon the gryphon said brightly tashiketh and his own entourage had established themselves within two days of their arrival in an old inn very near the manor cheerfully vacated by the owner at the sight of the odd octagonal gold coins offered for its purchase by the treasurer for the gryphons they had chosen the inn because of its large rooms on the second floor each of which had its own balcony and several of the staff were quite willing to stay on and serve such relatively undemanding masters now tashiketh and his escort of two moved between the inn and the manor every day taking part in daily court and council sessions showing extreme interest in everything tremane did so far they had neither interfered in the business of hardorn nor done anything other than tender an opinion when asked for one it was darkwinds thought that they were acting in very similar fashion to the way that treyvan and hydona had behaved when they first came to kleshya valewilling to offer advice but making no move to push in where they might not be wanted but the cause of this particular uproar had occurred very near midnight long after the gryphons had retired for the night the gryphons darkwind knew did not find it necessary to be purely daylight creatures but tashiketh and his group had not been trained from their youth to be explorers and navigators of the unknown and their experiences here were probably wearing them down between the cold and their strange surroundings they felt much more comfortable taking to their own warm quarters after dark and not stirring out until daylight so when the messenger pounded in on an exhausted horse last night reporting that one of tremanes newlysworn liegemen was under attack by one of his neighbors the gryphons were blissfully asleep in the excitement no one had bothered to wake them or even send them a message and by the time anyone thought of doing so it was already daylight and darkwind was on his way to the gates to escort tashiketh inside there was nothing in the simple attack of one set of humans upon another that would have alerted tremane through the earthsense so the attack came as a complete surprise a substantial amount of last night had been devoted to planning a defense and with dawn the men in the chosen barracks were roused briefed and moving by the time tashiketh appeared at the gates darkwind who met the gryphons here every morning explained the situation to him tashiketh stopped just out of the way of traffic and stared at him in perplexity but it will be very difficult to fight in this season will it not he asked very slowly and with the possibility of the magestorms resuming soon that could make it more difficult yet darkwind nodded how could it not be he replied but if king tremane does not come to the aid of this liegeman then every other bandit who thinks to make himself king in place of tremane will think himself free to do what he wills but why did tremane not call upon us tashiketh asked with a surprised and even injured expression did we not offer to be of all assistance to him and would his enemies not find the sight of a gryphon wing descending upon them enough to terrify them into submission why look you how frightened his own people were when they knew that we were cominghow much more so must his enemies be now it was darkwinds turn to stop in his tracks and stare at tashiketh with shock and incredulity but you are ambassadors we are allies tashiketh replied firmly even as you brothertohawks i am not only the ambassador i am the leader of this force which members have drilled and trained together is it not preferable to quell disturbance with the application of a small force rather than to wait and meet war with a greater one he clicked his beak and then gryphgrinned in the way that darkwind was so familiar with in treyvan besides we are bored it will be good to show our fighting prowess it is what we are born bred and trained for i thought that there was no fighting in iftel darkwind blurted as activity swirled all around them i thought that your border prevented any such thing now tashiketh sobered simply because we do not make war on other nations nor permit those nations to make war upon us that does not mean that we do not prepare ourselves for war or for the day when the barrier might fail us i cannot tell you how long we have trained he shook his head all my life all the life of my father and his and his and so far back i cannot begin to count the years we have always trained and contested and will always train and contest and when the need is there we fight then he roused up his feathers and moved so quickly that darkwind was left behind completely unprepared come he shouted we go to this king and we tell him in a way that will make him believe as darkwind knew even when on the ground gryphons could move very quickly when they chose he was left behind as tashiketh and his escort charged into the manor bent on offering themselves as potential victims on tremanes altar and he was afraid terribly afraid that tremane would accept them but when he reached the council chamber he found that although tremane had accepted their offer it was with conditionsand reservations tell the men to stand down he was ordering as darkwind entered ill try tashikeths way butbut he said turning to the exultant gryphon and raising his voice you sir will obey the orders of your commander that is me and you will make the preparations that i tell you to and adhere to the conditions that i set darkwind could hardly believe the transformation that a few moments had made in the dignified gryphon tashiketh and his two escorts were wildly excited hackles and eartufts up eyes flashing as their pupils expanded and contracted rapidly their talons flexing against the wooden floor and leaving gouges that would be the despair of tremanes housekeepers these were no longer the strange ambassadors of an even stranger culture these were warriors and he wondered how they had kept their nature hidden beneath those serene exteriors we have the time if you and your wing are determined to fly a warning against these people to take the precaution that is needed to prepare you tremane said sternly every inch the commander and now darkwind wondered at the transformation in the king as well here and now there was no uncertainty no hesitation this was the imperial commander a man who knew both planned warfare and scrimmage fighting the man who had been entrusted with the conquest of hardorn there is time enough for you to see what maps we have of the area and speak with those of shonar who have relatives in the contested area i would have you see my armorer so that he can make you breast and sideplates to protect you from arrows and helmets to defend you from slung shot if there were time enough tashiketh opened his beak to protest and tremane swiftly overruled him not a word sir i am your commander i have been fighting these people as you have not i know what they can and cannot do and i will decree the terms under which you will fight i will not dictate your tactics sir for that is your purview but i can and will decree what i need for your safety he looked so black and angry that darkwind thought for a moment that tashiketh would take offense but one of the two escorting gryphons muttered something under his breath and tashiketh burst into laughter what did he say tremane asked his anger fading he said what a surprise to find after all these centuries a commander who is more concerned with saving our blood than spending it and he is right tashiketh bent his head in submission to tremanes will we will follow the wishes of the commander who does not waste anything ill send shyrestral to bring the rest and we will see your maps and plans rather than improvising solely upon what we find there in so short a time that darkwind was astonished the gryphons were lined up in three ranks for a nonetoohasty briefing only one somewhat bewildered man who had only visited the place once could be found to tell the gryphons about the lay of the land in that area he found himself overwhelmed by the gryphons relentless questioning over details of the regions wind currents on the fourth day after the messenger had arrived the gryphon wing flew off to confront the enemy and darkwind and everyone else watched them fly off with mingled hope and dread the gryphons seemed full of confidence and good humor they might have been going off on a pleasure jaunt except that their behavior showed darkwind very clearly that their hunting and killing instincts were roused when they were not moving they were intensely alert heads up eyes taking in everything bodies poised when they moved it was with bewildering swiftness and utter sureness as deadly and beautiful as the dance of warrior and sword they took no notice of the snow beneath their claws of the cold breeze their eyes were on the blinding blue sky and they could not wait to be up and out when they took to the air they leaped up catching the shivering wind in their talons and conquering it youre sure they will have a chance tremane asked as the wing vanished into the blue distance i keep feeling as if im sending them to their doom gryphons were originally created as fighters darkwind replied slowly very versatile ones its in their blood and a millennium or two isnt going to change that they may have been created as fighters but are they trained tremane said his voice sounding strained i know what my men can dobut these creatures granted their opponents arent as wellequipped or skilled as my men yet it only takes a single wellaimed arrow to kill someone and you tell me that iftel has kept war away from her borders for as long as the valdemarans have known them how can they be ready for this surely forgive me for interrupting you but has tashiketh told you how his twenty wingmen were chosen darkwind replied before tremane could voice much more in the way of anxiety the king shook his head i thought not lets go inside where its warm darkwind told him as the sharp wind cut through the seams of his coat and chilled him he shivered involuntarily and stamped his numbing feet to warm them i believe im about to surprise you the group retired to tremanes study several of his other staff members who had overheard the exchange had managed to tag along the gryphons had excited a great deal of interest among the imperials and hardornens alike and darkwind didnt at all mind assuaging some of their curiosity it was a close fit for all of them but tremane gave no hint that he wanted any of them to leave ive managed to learn a bit about the way things are done in iftel at least as far as the gryphons are concerned darkwind told the group once they were all settled in a circle of chairs tremanes only a little larger and more elaborate than the rest its not the peaceful paradise you and i might have imagined oh elspeth said but they wont even let the mercenarys guild establish a guildhall there darkwind could only shake his head i dont know of their origin but because of what i have learned from tayledras history and some kaledain information i have a few guesses tashiketh either doesnt know the answers or has been ordered to pretend that he doesnt so this is speculation tremane uttered a scornful little cough darkwind at times your insistence on hedging is maddening tell us dont keep saying its only your opinion darkwind chuckled not at all offended certainly i think that the citizens of iftel are descended from some of the forces that were cut off when the mage of silences stronghold was overrun there were gryphonwings with several of the armies and since female gryphons by and large are a bit larger and heavier than the males females always fought alongside males often their mates so there would have been a breeding population you mean some of these gryphons are female one of the generals blurted looking completely taken aback darkwind laughed you didnt even look between their haunches eh yes some are female probably half males also spend as much time tending the young as females since they feed their young the way young hawks are fed he raised an eyebrow at the generals stunned expression oh come nowyou didnt think anything with a beak like that could suckle milk did you i wouldnt want to see the result if one tried the general winced and tremane himself made an expression of sympathetic pain as for the concept of females being poor fighters i would not venture that opinion around herald captain kerowyn of the skybolts if i were you elspeth added crisply she is likely to invite you to have a practice session with a few of her ladiesor worse with her darkwind watched the general in question as he took a second and third glance at elspeth finally saw the calluses and muscles and realized that elspeth was not the pampered princess he had thought so much for physiology i am assuming that they must have come from urthos people because gryphons are created creatures and i cant imagine where else they could have originated we know from kaledain stories that some of urthos people were cut off from their own forcesthey knew what was going to happen when the enemy overran the last stronghold darkwind continued i guess that they threw up hasty gatesportals to youand just tried to get as far away as possible they succeeded and ended up in fairly hostile country and then the cataclysm happened and the storms began at some point something put up the barrier tashiketh isnt being very forthcoming about that either the problem with putting a wall around you though is that it walls you in as well as other people out so in order to keep from killing each other or losing such selfdefensive abilities altogether the peoples of iftel organized their aggressions tremane looked troubled organized how darkwind sighed for he was of two minds about what he had learned he understood why and sympathized but he wasnt happy about what they had chosen to do games but games that verge on being bloodsport if tashiketh is telling the truth no one has to participate but in the highest and most competitive levels there is real possibility of serious injury and even death serious wargames tashiketh says that in his part of iftel there are several deaths among participants in every round of competition that was how his wing was formed every single one of these gryphons is the winner of contests in his district that pitted him against opponents of his own and other races coming at him singly and in a group and using weapons that were merely blunted not rendered harmless tremane blinked oh he said thoughtfully interesting they arent as inexperienced as i assumed that isnt all of course darkwind went on each preliminary winner was required to participate in intellectual contests as well what those were i dont know for certain but they probably included memory tests and logic puzzles tashiketh was the overall winner of everything and the reason that the delegation is made up entirely of gryphons is that only gryphons would have been able to get here before the storms started again now you know the gist of everything that i have learned or guessed tremane and the others seemed somewhat taken aback by the fact that the right to be an ambassador had been determined by a series of oftendeathlyviolent contests but darkwind privately thought that was a more logical means of choosing someone for an important post than some other methods he had heard of from supposedly civilized lands picking someone to whom you owed a favor or someone whose family was important or worst of all giving the job to whoever paid the most for the honorall those were recipes for sheer disaster and whoever used such means probably got the disasters he deserved granted most ambassadors didnt have to compete in highly dangerous war games but then most ambassadors werent also authorized to participate in their allies real conflicts either he just wished that the contests werent so lethal are you confident in their ability as a fighting unit tremane asked him bluntly darkwind nodded i know my gryphons and i know that these are welltrained he replied i also know they arent stupid i dont think they would have been nearly so eager to volunteer if they thought your opponents had working magic ah tremane exclaimed and chuckled i see they dont expect to come within range of a normal distanceweapon is that it probably not they can stay out of range of arrows and drop large heavy objects down on the enemy another of the generals started to chuckle as if he found the idea vastly amusing or spears or firepots or any number of things that are inconvenient when crashing through ones roof elspeth interrupted before the good gentleman could wax eloquent but telling you that they were going to do that would not have sounded nearly as heroic as they wanted to appear so we will let them believe that we are still cherishing the illusion that they flew off to battle talontosword with our foes tremane said firmly if they choose to tell us what their tactics are we will then praise their cleverness otherwise we will be effusive in our praises of their bravery in either case they will succeed in making it clear to troublemakers that we have a formidable ally that they do not they will accomplish what they set out to do which is to win this single scrimmage and that may be all we need i would rather have a bloodless victory than any other kind ive taken the liberty of ordering a congratulatory feast of wild game sir the seneschal said diffidently i was afraid that if we left it too long we would never get the meat thawed in time tremane nodded his agreement absently which relieved the poor lad who was still afraid to order anything on his own that might have a serious impact later in this case ordering a feast might lead to a shortage later darkwind privately doubted that having seen the stores of frozen meat himself but it was a possibility perhaps more than a possibility when he recalled the sheer mass of food that treyvan and hydona could put away without hesitation but now that tremane had given his approval the young seneschal clearly felt much easier in his mind i do miss treyvan and hydona and their two little feathered fighters i miss tumbling and playing with the little ones and feeling hydona preen my hair and watching vree dive after treyvans crestfeathers and i miss their deep voices their affection and advice now gentlemen and ladies tremane said his tone turning somber let us consider what we must do if our allies fail it isnt likely i dont think darkwind offered a single gryphon halfasleep can defeat a squad of fighters with less effort than it takes to preen this is a group of twentyandone fully awake and eager several of the attendees laughed looking quite convinced of that by what they had seen of the creatures but youre correct of course preparations should be made for less than total victory the rest of the day was spent making plans for just that contingency but as sunset reddened the skies to the west the victors came winging home quite intact and with the foes leaders personal banner a letter of surrender and a pledge that he would come in person to swear his allegiance all clutched proudly in tashikeths talons the cheers that rose to greet them as they replicated their previous graceful landing in the courtyard were prompted as much by relief as by joy in the victory but they didnt need to know that darkwind assured one and all that a tired gryphon was a starving gryphon and tashikeths second in command nodded firmly at the feast to which the tired gryphons were immediately ushered tashiketh formally presented the surrender and pledge and then modestly revealed the secret of their victory first we dropped rocks through their roofs he said with a faintly cruel chuckle then we dropped one firepot on a thatched outbuilding and circled in three subwings of seven each after six passes we threatened to drop more that got their attention long enough for us to claim that we were a mere fraction of the winged army that king tremane could command if he chose and i hinted that we werent too particular about waiting for provisions to arrive in a case like that and were inclined to help ourselves the idea of hundreds of us descending out of the sky smashing big holes in every roof setting fire to things and snatching and carrying off whoknewwhat to eat had them in a panic if that idiot leading them hadnt surrendered on the spot i think they might killed him and served him to us on a platter with a good broth on the side several of the generals laughed heartily at this and even tremane smiled darkwind thought it best to interject a cautionary note it wont do to make them think youre going to carry off children for snacks he warned tashiketh under cover of the laughter how could they trust a king whod let his monsters feed on children no fear of that tashiketh soothed i made sure we were eying the sheep when i said that and added a bit about how tasty fresh fat mutton was and allowed as how we could decimate their every flock and herd in a matter of days and just feel stronger for being so well fed for a people on the edge of starvation accepting surrender in place of that sounds very appealing our rules of combat have always stressed that were not to intimate that we eat thinking beings we might not have done this in earnest before but weve had plenty of training good darkwind relaxed enough to chuckle i wish id seen their faces when you told them that you were only the vanguard and of course they would never know when you were bluffing it wasnt all bluff tashiketh said smugly then suddenly took an extreme interest in his food as if he realized that he had said too much well well darkwind took an interest in his own meal as if unaware that tashiketh had let fall something important so iftel has more interest in tremanes welfare than i thought enough that they would back him with a significant force it certainly sounds that way if they would send an army to help him what else would they be willing to offer the secret of the barrier other secrets and how much of that would be of any use against the coming storms especially the final storm or would so little be left after that last blow that none of this would matter you could not possibly have conceived of anything more likely to have turned you into the armys favorites elspeth told tashiketh as a roar went up from the watching crowd five of tashikeths subordinates climbed crawled flew leaped and contorted themselves across a torturous obstacle course under the bright noontime sun it was cold enough to numb feet encased in boots and several layers of stockings but that hadnt prevented the nowusual crowd from showing up as soon as the contest began typically the former imperial soldiers had gathered to watch cheerand then bet on the outcome this was probably the most exciting entertainment in the entire country about now there was not a great deal in the way of entertainment in shonar in spite of the presence of the king here every time the one and only bard in the town composed a new song the tavern where he played was crowded to capacity for days and the soldiers did their best to enliven otherwise dull days and nights with mixed results one of the highestpriced items to be had among the soldiery was a deck of cards but now there was a new and novel source of spectacle in their midst one with all the finest attributes of a fair a race and a real contest since tashiketh never participated except to practice alone the outcome of any given competition was always subject to the whims of chance which made it perfect for wagering that in turn made it more attractive yet if that was possible would it harm me in your esteem if i confessed that this was a deliberate choice making our contests public affairs tashiketh asked elspeth gravely hardly i would simply congratulate you on your intelligence she replied promptly the only question i have is why stage these obstacle things at all there are other ways of keeping you all in fighting trim because we must our hierarchy changes as the results of the contests change and as our own ranking changes so will the rankings of our various counties and that at years end will decree where discretionary tax funds are spent just as he made that surprising assertion tremane joined them relatively anonymous in a plain brown soldiers cloak with the hood pulled up against the bite of the cold wind tashiketh did not turn his head or appear to notice but a few moments later he addressed the king directly so king of hardorn i am given to understand that you are exceedingly curious about my people i finally have leave to answer your questions for you have proven yourself to be an honorable ally and worthy to hear the full tale of our land now tashiketh moved his head to gaze into tremanes astonished face with mild eyes ask he said the time for secrets is past whatever tremanes faults an inability to think quickly was not one of them darkwind ksheyna believes that your people were descended from one part of the armies of the mage his people served specifically the one called urtho he said are you tashiketh laughed a deep rumble that came from somewhere down in the bottom of his chest and he roused his fathers with a shake yes the shortest version of the tale is this our several peoples were all serving the third army urtho made it his policy to group all the folk of a particular land into one army rather than dividing all of them amongst his armies however the humans of the third serving a god who decreed that those who had magic power should be his priests had no mages of their own they had no prejudice against working with those of other faiths and so had a group of mages assigned to them mages who had nothing whatsoever m common with them not even nationality also attached to the third were a wing of gryphons with their trondiirn a pack of kyree a surge of ratha a knot of tyrill and a charge of dyheli what am i hearing tyrill ratha how did they get into this story and these are your peoples of iftel tremane asked what is a ratha darkwind asked at the same moment tashiketh wasnt the least perturbed by being bombarded with questions these are our peoples yes ratha are from the far north and are to the mountain cats what kyree are to wolves tyrill i think you know already brothertohawks only by legend darkwind replied feeling a bit dazed they were one of urthos last creations a larger race of hertasi and there werent many of them but oh they breed with such enthusiasm tashiketh laughed tossing his head so that the freshening wind ruffled his feathers behind him another cheer rose together with some groans as one of the other gryphons did something clever they learned it from us gryphons there are plenty of them now well to make this as brief as possible the third whose emblem i wear was cut off from kavenusho at the time of retreat they chose to gate to the remotest place the mages could think of hoping they would be beyond the reach of maar and the destruction that would ensue when urthos tower was destroyed by its master but there was a problem not enough power tremane guessed shrewdly nowhere safe to go asked elspeth no adepts hazarded darkwind a little of all three the ambassador explained their prieststhe humanshad remained behind in their own land to protect their people the only adept with them strong enough to raise a faraway gate was someone who at the time was thought to be a barbarian shaman from the far north they had to go to the remotest place he knew ofhis home not the gryphons home nor that of their human charges not anywhere near it there wasnt much choice they took the escape that was offered ending in the north of what is now iftel they thought to wait out the destruction then be reunited with the others but no sooner had they all gotten across then something terrible happened worse by far than anything they had expected the cataclysm darkwind said aloud the tower and maars stronghold destroyed and the interaction of the double release of terrible forces and needless to say they did not know the cause for many years they only knew that things were impossible that there would be no way to find their friends and fellows that there would be no way for the humans of the third to find their way home and almost as bad it soon became obvious that they had not gone far enough they ran into a fresh army of maars tashiketh shook his head it must have seemed as if they had come to the end of the world that everything evil had won against them and was about to annihilate them battered by the magestorms that followed on the verge of attack by superior forces and unable because of the high number of wounded to travel to someplace where they might escape the worst of the effects they did the only thing they had left to do the humans prayed to their god vykaendys that name struck darkwind like a blow to the head who darkwind blurted as elspeths eyes widened vykaendys the ambassador repeated the holy sun from whom all life elspeth interrupted ambassador tashiketh do the humans of your land use a different language from the gryphons the huge gryphon nodded the sacred language is different he replied the shared language is a combination of several tongues and old gryphon is very like that tongue you spoke to me when first we met do i take it you wish to hear something of the sacred tongue of vykaendys please said elspeth and darkwind together tashiketh rattled off a few sentences and darkwind looked to elspeth who had a better command of languages than he did she listened very closely as her eyes widened further until the whites showed all around im not a linguist she said when he has finished but i would say that this is to karsite what the iftel gryphon tongue is to kaledain darkwind whistled no wonder altra kept insisting that the border would only recognize himself karal ulrich or solaris the god of iftel and the god of karse are one and the same isnt that going to put a firecat among the pigeons gwena chose that moment to add her own observation oh this is interesting indeed solaris doesnt know this but altra does i wonder why and why he hadnt told her they prayed for protection right elspeth asked the ambassador and the god established the border to keep their enemies out precisely tashiketh agreed and of course vykaendys did exactly that answering their prayers he is the one who ordained that we send our representatives beyond the border to help as we could with the current crisis he sent us to hardorn once he knew that hardorn again had a king who had been bound to the land otherwise given the gravity of the current situation we would of course have been sent into valdemar all creatures must work together to survive the last storms but vykaendys is pleased to welcome the land that lies between the two that he governs as a brothercountry rather than an enemystate elspeth shook her head of course she replied i cant help wondering what solaris is going to make of this when she finds out about it elspeth added to darkwind although in retrospect its fascinating the ways in which gods answered the prayers of their followersthe stareyed creating the dhorisha plains for the shinain who had renounced magic and granting the tayledras the power to protect themselves with their magic while they healed the land a bit at a time and now the sun lord creating a barrier around iftel darkwind wondered if he had done something similar for karse just to hold through the cataclysm itself the karsites were certainly close enough to the source of the cataclysm to have needed such protection but wait the sunpriests are mages maybe the sunpriests are their equivalents of the tayledras and vkandis gave them access to great power to protect themselves the way the tayledras did the greatest dangers after the cataclysm lay in the monsters that had been created could that be where and why the sunpriests got the ability to summon and control demons so effectively now that was an intriguing thought there was no way of knowing without having karal to ask and even then it might not be canonical information but altra was obviously privy to noncanonical truths and if he was inclined to share them with nonbelievers if he is we might learn more than we ever wanted to know but elspeth had been thinking further ahead than he as tremane asked more detailed questions of tashiketh she drew darkwind and gwena into a close mindlink what are the odds that we can involve gods in all of this she wanted to know vkandis kalenel either or both the power of a god might save us or it might cause a whole lot more trouble than any mage storm however powerful darkwind warned we cant know but i can ask florian to ask altra gwena said and perhaps he can ask andesha as well darkwind shook his head doubtfully dont count on any real help he told them the stareyed is disinclined to interfere vkandis may be fundamentally the same they may be able to help us only after the disaster strikes and be unable to do anything to prevent it from comingbecause we have that power if only we make the correct choices and they will not take that right to choose from us gwena nodded mentally but elspeths mindvoice seethed with frustration but how can we make the right choices if we dont know what they are she fumed if we knew what to do then they wouldnt be choices they would be plans darkwind chided gently he didnt blame her and he didnt have the heart to tell her that the right choice from the point of view of a god might not be the one that prevented a second cataclysm gods tended to take a much longer view of things than mere mortals and what they considered to be good in the long run might be pretty horrible for those who had to live through it im sure that baron valdemars people heartily wished him to the bottom of the salten sea during that first winter in the wilderness he thought soberly and certainly it was terrible for the last heraldmages of vanyels time to be the last of their kind but in the long run those were good things for most of the people of valdemar this was probably not the time to point this out to her however all we can do is what weve always done he told her with utmost sincerity we must do our best then even if things turn out badly we will know it was not from any lack of trying on our part she sighed i do wish you werent right so often she said forlornly i rather enjoyed being able to rail against fate and the unfairness of it all but she pulled herself a bit straighter and nodded whatever happens well survive it and well build on whats left she glanced around and her mouth twisted wryly all our peoples do seem to be rather good at that he squeezed her hand in agreement and we will do it together ashke he could not help thinking about the group at center of dhorisha picking through the remains of the tower without experiencing a feeling of chill whatever happenedyes he elspeth and the others here would probably survive it but what of his friends in the tower would they as he turned his attention back to the conversation at hand his stomach gave a sudden lurch his eyes unfocused for a moment and he felt very much as if the ground had dropped out from underneath him then the world steadied again but as he looked from tremane to elspeth and back and saw the same startled look in both their eyes turn to sick recognition he knew what had just hit him the magestorms had begun again hints of their building power were beginning to overcome the counterstorm they were not strong enough yet to cause any problems but it was only a matter of time darkwind understood this was the first sign of the coming final storm and their respite before it struck would be measured in at best weeks their survival was in doubt and even if they did survive whether they would prosper afterward was in deep question there were hundreds of variables and just as many major decisions there were key uses of power and defense solving of mysteries and understanding of connections like each segment in a spiderweb the failure of any of those elements could collapse it all and cost every one involvedeverything nine what is wrong with your friend firesong lyam asked karal in a whisper as firesong went off to a remote corner of the tower to broodor as he called it meditatefor the second time that day the others are all working together over the notes for the cubemaze but he keeps going off by himself he says to think is that usual for him is he ill do you think or have the frustrations begun to weigh upon his soul im not sure karal replied although this behavior of firesongs wasnt particularly news to him living together as closely as they all were it wasnt possible for any of them to deviate from normal behavior without the others noticing and firesong was certainly acting oddlythough not with that selfish oddness that made him so dangerous before there were several signs that this bout of solitary brooding was far different than the last for one thing aya kept cuddling close to him tucking his head up under firesongs chin while firesong held him and scratched gently under his wings and it had been ayas avoidance of his bondmate that had been one sign that his temper and thoughts were tending in dangerous directions he wasnt tinkering with odd magics either he was sitting in outoftheway corners staring into space as if firesong sought the privacy in his mind that he could not get in the tower but those bursts of meditation always seemed to end in a sharp and thoughtful glance at karal and given some of the past difficulties between them that didnt make karal feel entirely easy about his possible thoughts huh lyam said and scratched the top of his head with a stubby inkstained talon well he doesnt seem to be getting much done an hes giving me collywobbles with the way he just sits and stares if hes gotten into a blue funk maybe one of you ought to shake him out of it karal made a face im not sure any of us want to shake firesong out of anything but i suppose it cant hurt if i talk to him if theres a problem maybe silverfox could help him with it or something or maybe its a problem he doesnt want to get silverfox involved with and maybe i could help him he made a face after all im supposed to be a priest and thats the sort of thing that priests are supposed to do right having said that he knew he had talked himself into the position where he was going to have to do something about the situation lyam nodded encouragingly to him at that last statement so before he could find a reason to put it off he got to his feet and trailed off after firesong altra invited himself along sauntering casually at karals heels as karal glanced inquisitively down at him altra blinked guileless blue eyes at him i thought id come along too just in case you needed me the firecat said idly karal did not ask for what since he knew the answer already there wasnt a great deal that altra couldnt shield him against if firesong turned angry or dangerous or both he found the adept in the chamber containing one of the mysterious contrivances one made of wire odd plates of some sparkling material and gemstones that looked far too delicate to warrant the label of weapon aya was with him cuddling inside his jacket ayas long tail trailed comically down from beneath the hem as if the cascade of feathers belonged to firesong the adept stared at the softly glowing stones with an intense look on his face he turned to face the entrance when he heard karals deliberate footstep but he did not seem particularly surprised to see the karsite karal approached him gingerly but there was nothing in firesongs slight smile to indicate anything other than welcome as he edged around the wiresculpture weapon karal tried to think of a lateral approach to the subject and failed to come up with a good one so he decided to go straight to the heart of the matter and make no attempt at being clever youve been wandering off by yourself for the last couple of days and were a little concerned about you he said bluntly it didnt seem right to go behind your back and pester silverfox to see if you were all right so i decided to ask you directly is there anything wrong other than everything firesong asked archly we are in a very precarious position here you know well yes but karal fumbled i mean theres nothing wrong or rather nothing wrong with me karal firesong interrupted with a smile for his bondbird as aya stuck his head out of the front of the adepts jacket saw who it was that firesong was talking to and tucked himself back inside but im glad you came to find out because i have a few questions that really concern only you here sit he patted the floor beside him and karal lowered himself down warily karal karse and valdemar fought a generationslong war and i can understand that anyone from karse might feel very negative about certain figures of valdemaran history but you are bright enough to reason things through for yourself and not just take everything you are told in without ever examining it so given that heres a history question what do you know and what do you think about heraldmage vanyel ashkevron karal stared at him a bit confused by the abrupt change of subject for the initial question karal had asked about firesong had nothing whatsoever to do with a figure of ancient history like vanyel ashkevron but it was a very interesting question given all of the changes karals own life and thoughts had been going through it might on the surface seem like the question had no relevance in any way to the situation in the tower but he knew firesong better than that and firesong had to have an ultimate purpose in asking it im going to have to think aloud so bear with me karal said finally as you probably guessed according to our history vanyel demonrider was absolutely the epitome of everything that was terrible about valdemar every child in karse used to be told that if he was bad vanyel would come and carry him off he was a herald a rider of a demonhorse and the implacable enemy of all karse stood for he was a mage which was anathema of course and he had the audacity to be a very powerful mage one who could turn back the demons that the most highly skilled priestmages could raise which made him even worse and if that wasnt bad enough it is said by some chroniclers of the time that he could break the compulsions that the priests put on their demons and send them back against their own summoners which made him the king of the demons so far as our people were concerned thats your history firesong replied watching karal with peculiar intensity how do you feel about it im getting to that karal rubbed the back of his own neck trying to sort out his thoughts as he loosened tight muscles i do think its supremely ironic that the worst accusations about vanyel have to do with him riding a demonhorse and being a mage when our own priests were mages who summoned demons and controlled them firesongs sardonic smile had a note of approval in it no one has ever dared to claim that the causes of warfare and the sources of prejudice are ever rational he scratched aya under the chin and was rewarded by a particularly adorable chirrup and religious fervor is often used as an excuse for a great many socially unacceptable behaviors thats religion as an excuse sometimes it seems to me that when religious fervor enters the mind the wits pack up entirely and fly out the ear karal replied a bit sourly but worst of all is when powerful ruthless people use the religious fervor of others to further their own greed aya poked his head out of the jacket again as if he found what karal was saying very interesting altra settled himself at karals feet and there was nothing in the firecats demeanor to make karal think his own religious guide disapproved of anything he had said so far all that is true in my experience firesong replied with one of his brilliant perfect smiles though im not that much older than you so what do you think vanyel was really like karal shrugged of course i am sure that he must be a very great hero to the valdemarans the fact that my people considered him to be such an evil enemy would make that a simple conclusion to come to given that he was fighting what i now know to have been very powerhungry and entirely amoral men most notably one of the worst sons of the sun we ever had in all our history i suppose that he was only doing his duty to protect his people against the rapacious land grabbing of mine icannot say that i like that thought it fills me with shame in fact he paused and a final thought floated to the surface one that seemed to define the situation i can only say that not even his enemies in karse ever tried to claim that he led any armies over the border into our land and the same cannot be said of the karsite commanders now i cant pretend to tell who was right and who was wrong in those areas where both sides claimed to have been attacked first or were provoked into attacking or where magic sabotage and assassination were allegedly employed but i can tell that the valdemarans never took armies into karse but my people certainly waged war up into valdemar very evenhanded firesong replied approvingly no side is always in the right now well change the subject again i need a religious opinion from you what do the sunpriests have to say about ghosts as in what he asked unquiet dead haunts spirits who return to guide all of those firesong said making a general gesture some religions deny that any such manifestations exist and some religions are written around them as a form of ancestor worship what does the writ of vkandis say the writ says very little he frowned trying to think of what it did say now that i come to think of it what it does say is rather interesting according to the writ no one who is of the faith whether the purest soul or the blackest could possibly become a ghost anyone born or brought into the faith will be taken before vkandis and judgedsorted is the word used in the writ and the good shall be sorted from the evil no spirit shall escape the sorting the evil will be cast into darkness and great despair into fear and pain to repeat their errors until they have learned to love and serve the light of vkandis and the good shall be gathered up into the rich meadows of heaven to sing his praises in the everlasting rays to drink the sweet waters and bask forevermore in the glory of the sun thats the actual quote theres a great deal more about who shall become what rank of angelic spirit and what each kind does but i have a suspicion that all of that is a clerkly conceit ive got an earlier version of the writ that doesnt have any of those lists in it some people even have to have their afterlife ranked arranged and organized firesong chuckled i hate to say this but being gathered up to lie in a meadow sunbathing and singing for all eternity is not my idea of a perfect afterlife i should be screamingly bored within the first afternoon karal laughed maybe not for you but think about the poor shepherds who were the first prophets living in the cold damp hills of karse with rain and fog and damn poor grazing most of the time i suppose for them rich meadows and sun forever would be paradise wouldnt it firesong raised his eyebrows all right so karsites cant become ghostsbut what about other people well thats not in the writ but there is a tradition that the unblessed dead become the hungry vengeful ghosts who roam the night thats why most karsites wont venture out after dark without a priest to secure their safety but firesongs question had asked about more than mere karsite tradition it had been about what karal himself thought as a priest i can exorcise ghosts in theory im supposed to be able to send any unblessed spirit to the sorting even if they arent of the faith if they want to go the writ is kind of vague about what happens to heathen who have the misfortune to worship someone besides vkandis most people assume that theyll be sent to eternal punishment even if they are good people but the writ really doesnt say that it just says that they will be sorted and sent to their places it doesnt say what those places are for all i know those places could be right here on earth trevalen and dawnfire are ghosts of a kind and if what loisha and andesha have been saying is true then some of the kalenedral are ghosts too or if they arent ghosts they certainly arent physically alive the way florian and altra are so theres no reason why kalenel couldnt have sorted them herself and decreed that their place was here well what about the avatars firesong asked echoing his thoughts do they count as ghosts if they arent i wouldnt know what else to call them karal admitted and even if they arent blessed in the karsite sense they are anything but evil or hungry they certainly arent vengeful either so theres no reason for me to interfere with whatever they are doing he thought a bit harder the thing about exorcism is that if you want to be exact about it there are two kinds one kind just throws the ghost out of whatever its possessing and bars it from coming backit can still go possess something else somewhere else the other kind blesses the ghost opens a path for it so it can see where its supposed to be going and gives it some help to break the last bonds with the world and send it on its way if its ready but it has to be ready most priests combine both kinds hoping that once the spirit is cast out it will see the light and realize it shouldnt be here but ive also seen reports about spirits that just seemed confused about the fact that they were dead and in that case the priest only used the second kind of exorcism all very well but suppose you were to see something that you knew was a ghostnot an avatar or anything obviously under the direction of anyones god what would you do about that firesong asked would you feel that you had to do something about it it was a good question according to some priests he would have to try exorcising anything that looked or acted like a ghost but that would include the kalenedral and the avatars and he dashed well knew that he wasnt going to even breathe the word exorcism around them personally i suppose i would try to exorcise anything that was harmful send on anything that was ready and leave everything else alone he still didnt see what relevance any of this had to their current situation but presumably firesong had some idea where he was going with all of this firesong appeared to make up his mind about something for his expression became a bit more animated and less contemplative look he said ive been asking you all these questions because i need your help yours and altras and there are some religious problems involved i made theacquaintanceof some real ghosts and you wouldnt mistake them for anything else one of them is an ancestor of mine physically theyre bound to a place up north right up at the northern border of valdemar oh no he must be afraid that when the final storm hits these ghosts of his are going to be destroyed or hurt in some way karal interrupted him firesong i hope you werent planning on asking me to exorcise them i mean im sorry that one of your ancestors is physically bound to the earth and if i could i would be glad to help him but i dont think its possible i told you all i would be able to do without the spirits being ready is to force them out of the place they were bound to even so i doubt i could do anything for them at such a great distance now it was firesongs turn to interrupt him no karal that was not what i had in mind he exclaimed but he seemed more amused at the conclusion that karal had leaped to than annoyed hear me out andesha sejanes and i all agree that we simply need more mages here at the tower powerful mages and were just not going to get them here to us in time we need adepts at the least and every adept within physical range of the tower is needed right where he is we cant build gates to bring in human or nonhuman adepts from farther away and altra cant bring in anyone mortalbut what about ghosts ghosts one of firesongs ancestors north of valdemar and an adept the trend of the questions suddenly formed into a pattern and karal stared at him in mingled horror and fascination this ghostthis ancestorit wouldnt be vanyel ashkevron would it he asked his voice trembling in spite of his effort to control it he felt the hair on the back of his neck rise discussing vanyel demonrider in abstract was one thing seriously discussing bringing him here was another he wanted to beg firesong to tell him that it was not vanyel ashkevron he was talking about but one look in firesongs face told him differently i think it would be a very good idea karal florian said diffidently vanyel is an adept if it is possible i think it should be done i wont ask how this came about karal said flatly i wont ask how you discovered that vanyel demonrider was still in existence he closed his eyes and shook his head i cannot believe i am hearing this boy if you require more votes on this you have mine said the sword need ive met the man though i doubt hell recall it he and stefen would be a tremendous asset to the group here they might even give us that edge we need to beat this thing firesong smirked the sword is saying that we need an edge how appropriate in any case the avatars actually suggested it there are some things in the cubemaze notes that suggest were going to needwell more skilled people than the last time the only way we can think of to get the spirits down here is to send altra firesong said we think that vanyel his companion and his friend can link themselves to something small enough for altra to transport we karal asked weakly how many of you discussed this all of the mages firesong told him that included need and the avatars and we all agreed we think were about to find our answer on the cubemaze device which is our first choice but we need more help to make it work karal looked down at altra who gazed back up at him with interest and what do you have to say about this he asked the firecat seriously i think it might work but i dont know for certain im not a mage as you think of one but the others seem convinced there is only one consideration and that is why they wanted to talk to you so you were already a party to this karal sighed i might have known whats the consideration a very practical one this borders on interference if i were to just do as you ask i would be exceeding my own authority in order for me to do this we would need permission from a higher authority and i cannot be the one to ask for permission i have the feeling that you are not referring to solaris when you speak of needing permission from a higher authority karal bit his lip you are correct and you are the only sunpriest here altra said calmly so you are the one who must make the petition i cannot and i cannot do such a thing without that permission i may advise guide and run limited errands up to a point but this is past that point i hate to sound like a coppercounting clerk making a fuss about a technicality but if these spirits were karsite and not valdemaran there would be less of a problem because of the old enmity karal asked surprised but it was the sunlord himself who ordered truce with valdemar in the first place no because these spirits were bound where they are for a reason and i dont know that this reason has been fulfilled they may not even know that now even if their purpose not yet fulfilled they could choose to come here anyway disobeying the one who offered them the task but without first receiving permission of vkandis i cannot choose to help them come without the risk that i would be disobeying as well and i do not choose to take that risk i wouldnt ask you to karal replied i suppose that means i dont have much choice in the matter judging by the way your friends are staring at you i would say not karal looked up already feeling pressured and guilty to meet three sets of eyes well need didnt have eyes as such but he sensed her looking through firesongs and florian stood in the doorway gazing at him with a completely heartrending expression in his huge blue eyes the combined weight was too much to bear ill have to go outside he gulped and managed not to stagger as he passed florian he remembered somehow to find his coat heavy boots and gloves and pull them all on but the trip up the tunnel was a complete blank in his mind he knew very well what he had to do hed witnessed many petitions offered up by solaris and her most trusted priests and had studied the form as part of his own education in the priesthood like many of the core portions of the sunlords faith a petition to vkandis was deceptively simple the only requirement was that a petition must be made in the full light of day in the great temple this was accomplished of course by virtue of the many windows cut in the upper dome here of course karal had only to walk outside as befitting a religion founded by poor shepherds who had little but what they could carry on their backs or perhaps the back of a single donkey there were no special vestments or vessels no trappings of any kind the only vessel needed was the priest and the only vestment a pure and singlehearted belief that the prayer would be heard it might not receive a yes but it would be heard karal more than many had every reason to hold that faith in his heart he knew that vkandis would hear him did he not have altra with him to prove that his only question was if he was ready was worthy to be answered in any way even with a no he walked a little distance off into the snow putting a tall drift between himself and the shinain camp until there was no sign of activity but his own footprints trailing behind him beside him was the tower looming over everything as it loomed over their lives all around him was the dazzling whiteness of the snow no less than kneedeep in some places and deeper than that in most this was a thicker snowpack than he had ever seen before it was also thicker than the shinain had ever seen it before or so hed been told this was a terrible winter and it could so easily get worseassuming that the plains themselves survived the final storm and what might happen to those ancient weapons still in the tower even if im not worthy the cause is he finally decided and turned his face up to the sun spreading his arms wide some took great care with each word when they made prayers for a particular purpose but karal and his mentor ulrich had never seen the sense in that they are like courtiers trying to find the most unctuous phrase in hopes that their prince will throw them a bauble ulrich had said in disgust there is nothing in the writ about making fine speeches for vkandis ear vkandis understands us far better than we could ever find words for so karal simply stood with every bit of him open to the light of the sun the light that stood for the greater light and let that light become all that he was he kept his petition to the bare facts this is how we stand this is what we have been doing this is what we need to do we know that this will not guarantee our success but we think it is necessary will you grant your permission for your servants to do this this was the first time he had ever made such a prayer alone and he trembled all over at his own audacity he made of himself nothing but the question and waited like an empty bowl for the answer the sun burned on in the endless blue of heaven as he struggled to lose himself in the light and in the moment that he actually did so vkandis showed his face the sun blazed up doubling tripling in size he felt the light burning his face even as he held his gaze steady and unflinching you can bear the light but can you bear the place where there are no sheltering shadows the sun split into two three a dozen suns surrounding him in a circle of suns creating a place where there could be no hint of darkness and nowhere to hide the suns settled upon the earth around him dancing upon the face of the snow but neither melting nor consuming it still he waited all fear burned out of him empty of everything but faith and the waiting and he breathed steadily and deeply once for every dozen heartbeats you can bear being without shadow but can you bear being only in light the dozen suns blazed up again and began circling around him faster and faster until they blurred into a solid ring of white light then the ring flared and he had to cover his eyes for a moment and when he looked again he stood not in the snow of the plains but in the heart of the sun with light above and below and all about him in the heart of the light and the light became part of him but this he realized was not a completely new experience although he had not had the memory until this moment this was what had happened when he acted as a channel for the release of the great energies of the first weapon they had triggered the light had taken away his fears then and it did so again then illuminated every corner of his heart yes there were faulty places poorlymended places even spots of faint shadowkaral saw and acknowledged those as he renewed a pledge to see them made good but he said silently to that great light what i am does not matter this thing that i ask is not for me nor even for these few who are here with me this is for all our peoples and for peoples we do not even know the light answered him with a question of its own is this also for those of the empire he replied immediately and simply yes had he not already pointed out that most of the people living in the empire had nothing to do with the terrible things their leaders had done why should they not be protected even your enemies came the second question he answered it as he had the other yes if protecting his enemies was the cost of protecting the innocent then so be it fanatics said kill them all and let god sort them out he would rather say save them all and let god sort them out for we have not the right to judge there was a timeless moment of waiting and the light flooded him with approval then that is my answer came the reply yes the light vanished he found himself standing in the snow his feet numb his eyes watering with his entire being filled with the answer he was a scintillating bowl full of yes and he carried that answer back to the tower as carefully as an acolyte carried a bowl of holy water you dont remember anything lyam asked alive with curiosity as he helped karal carry a new set of notes up to the storage chamber karal shook his head regretfully and watched where he was putting his feet the last few steps out of the workroom were worn enough to be tricky all i remember is going out into the snow after thatnothing until i woke up again with the answer he made an apologetic face sorry i know youd love to note all of this down and its not a priestly secret or anything but i just cant remember what happened the hertasi lashed his tail perhaps with impatience you could have just gone out come back and pretended to have the answer lyam began not that you would have but that wouldnt be as easy as you think i might have fooled anyone but florian and altra but never either of them karal replied firmly and im not sure it would have fooled need i think she was a priestess before she was a sword and if she was shell have ways of knowing when people make up answers they say are from their gods if you say so lyam said though his tone was dubious and it wouldnt ever have fooled the avatars he continued forcefully how could it how could you ever fool them about something like that lyam conceded defeat at that although he might not be completely convinced of the supernatural nature of florian altra or need he was entirely convinced that the avatars were something altogether out of his experience he regarded them with a mixture of his usual intense curiosity mingled with awe and a little uncertainty karal found that mildly amusing he had the distinct feeling that right up until the moment the hertasi first met the avatars little lyam had been something of an agnosticwilling to admit in the reality of something beyond himself but not at all willing to concede that it had anything to do with him and his everyday world like many another historian before him lyam was only convinced by verifiable facts that was what would make him a good historian rather than someone who was content to repeat all the same old erroneous gossip the hertasi and his mentor tarrn believed passionately in the truth would do anything to find out the truth and would probably do anything to defend the truth they might find exonerating reasons for a friend who robbed another of property but if that friend falsified historical documents or concealed relevant facts they would show him no leniency karal and lyam arranged the notes in order with the last batch and sealed up the nowfull box and put it with those holding tarrns precious chronicles if youve got a moment could you give me a hand he asked lyam youre better at handling hot rocks than i am thats because you humans are poorly designed the hertasi replied with a toothy grin you should have nice thick skin on your hands preferably with a toughened outer hide or scales so you can pick up things without hurting yourselves remind me to ask for that option the next time i order a new body karal countered as lyam followed him into the bedchamber then again isnt that why you were created to make up for your human shortcomings lyam laughed why yes someone besides divine beings needed to and just try getting some ghost or avatar to cook a good meal or mend clothing were indispensable karal laughed with lyam and had decided given the sad condition that altra had been in when hed come back from delivering the teleson to haven that he would be prepared for a similar situation when altra returned from the forest of sorrows he would find food good water and a warm bed waiting for him already prepared and standing ready the guess was that altra could return at any time after two days had passed so in the afternoon of the second day karal had arranged for all those things the moment altra returned he could eat and sleep without even having to ask for food or a warm bed karal kept heated stones tucked into the bed hed made up and as the warm meatladen broth he prepared got a little thick and past its prime flavor he was usually able to find someone willing to eat the old while he prepared a new batch lyam had been the latest beneficiary of karals cooking and so he wasnt at all averse to helping karal place more heated stones into the bedding so what do you think of all this the hertasi asked doesnt it seem kind of strange to be bringing in ghosts ive never even met anyone whod ever seen a ghost before this had you its no stranger than the avatars and theyre ghosts i suppose karal replied honestly ive never seen a ghost either before i got here but it really doesnt bother me lyam rolled his eyes with disbelief how can you be so calm about this firesong is planning on bringing a spirit here and an ancient hero at that why that would be likelike calling up skandranon oror baron valdemar oror the first son of the sun arent you excited or scared logically karal knew he should be both those things and yet he couldnt manage to dredge up any real feelings about the situation it just didnt seem real enough to him or perhaps it was only as real as hed gotten used to it was not that he was precisely numb about these sorts of events it was just that long ago he had crossed over his threshold of amazement and now things were only a matter of degree vanyel ashkevron lived a long time ago lyam he said after a long moment of thought i know that youre quite passionate about history and to you things that happened hundreds of years ago are as vital as things that happened last year but honestly i cant get very emotional about this especially not after having met living people who were considered to be very serious enemies of karse before the alliance and discovering that they were really quite like people i knew at home you know ill believe these spirits are going to be here when they arrive and until then i dont see any reason to get excited what do you mean you discovered enemies of karse were like people you knew lyam wanted to know as he tried unsuccessfully to juggle three recentlysmoking stones they thudded one by one onto the ground and he scuttled after one that was rolling away then tucked the last of the hot rocks into altras bedding he flicked his tail as his only comment i actually know people who lost family members to captain kerowyns mercenaries and then she turned into one of my teachers when i got to haven karal told him i found out that she didnt actually eat babies and she wasnt any more of a monster than any good military commander and another one of my teachers was a gentleman called alberich who actually deserted karse and his position as a captain in the army he was chosen by a companion who smuggled himself right into karse they called him the great traitor before the alliance and yet i found out later than he was instrumental in bringing the alliance about if you believed everything you heard he was half demon and half witch and was perfectly capable of any atrocity you could name he turned out to be a great deal like kerowyn except maybe his sense of humor is darker than hers interesting lyam said his eyes lighting up i dont suppose youd be willing to tell me about all that he reached into the pouch that never left his side and took out a silverpoint and paper as he asked that and karal didnt have the heart to refuse him he told the story of his own journey into valdemar which seemed to have occurred a hundred years ago and to some other person entirely he answered lyams questions as best he could and as honestly as he could even when the answers made him look rather stupid since lyam was very interested in the details of his thoughts as his opinion of valdemar and its inhabitants changed he was as open as possible in many ways he was a bit surprised at the change in himself as he tried to explain himself to lyam the talking and questioning helped to fill the time and allay his anxieties too and for that reason alone he would have been glad of lyams company there was always the possibility that all of this would be for nothing altra could go and request help even present firesongs personal petition to his ancestor vanyel but that didnt mean that the spirits were going to cooperate for one thing they might not be who they claimed they were for another they might not be very interested in helping old enemies after all altra was a representative of vanyels old nemesisand for vanyel what was ancient history to karal was very much a part of his personal memory this could all be a plot they could be constructing a trap to hold the spirits here far from valdemar and the border they were supposed to be guarding the spirits might also be unwilling or unable to leave what had been their home they hadnt in all this time so why would they now they might simply not be able to help and why make the long and dangerous journey to the tower just to sit and do nothing they might not be willing to take the chance that this might start out to be a need for their services but turn into a situation where karal could eliminate them entirely after all once they were here and in his power karal might change his mind about them and take it into his head to try an exorcism then shortly after dawn on the third day altra returned and all the doubts were resolved karal was in his bed and lyam shook him out of a dark deep and dreamless slumber it took him a moment to understand what the hertasi was trying to tell him he scrambled out of his bedroll and pulled on his cloths from the night before as soon as it penetrated into his sleepfuddled mind that altra was back he filled a bowl with the hot rich meat broth he had waiting on a little charcoal brazier and followed lyam out into the main room not only was every member of their own party gathered around the firecat but a goodly number of the kalenedral as well and if altra had looked worn out when he brought sejanes and master levy in he looked positively flattened now he lay on the floor panting and disheveled surrounded by people who all seemed to be talking at once without paying any attention to anything else karal pushed in among the others and placed the bowl of hot broth under altras nose the firecat cast him a look of undying gratitude and plunged his face into it taking great gulps of the liquid rather than lapping it up daintily as he usually did they need a physical link to the real world he said as if he was continuing an earlier statement karal reflected that being able to mindspeak was a great advantage in mealtime conversation you could go right on talking and no one would ever accuse you of bad table manners it was also fascinating to him that tarrn altra and florian could all make their thoughts heard even by those like sejanes and master levy who did not have the gift of mindspeech themselves so there it is and i do wish there had been an easier way to transport that bit of wood here than by having me fetch it it will take them a bit of time to use it to bring themselves here so be patient if id had to bring them as well i would have run the risk of losing them in the void besides vanyel doesnt particularly care for gates and jumping is a lot like gating especially now why wouldnt an adept care for gates sejanes wondered aloud when the firecats mindspeech had been related to him lets just say that i had some unpleasant experiences involving gates in the past replied a new voice a pleasant and musical tenor that had the peculiar quality of sounding as if it came from the bottom of a well a quality that it shared with some of the kalenedrals voices karal looked where everyone else was looking but saw no new person there only an old decrepit weatherbeaten wreck of a musical instrument it might at one time have been a lute or a gittern or some such thing there was no trace at all of its original finish nor its strings or tuning pegs and it had probably not been playable for centuries if this was the physical link that altra had brought with him it was certainly a peculiar choice on the whole i would just rather not have to deal with gates at all if i have any choice in the matter the voice continued and the air above the old instrument began to shiver youll have to give us a few moments here as my new friend altra said none of us are used to drawing our energy from leylines and nodes anymore and were rather out of practice were in no hurry ancestor and we have had some interesting experiences involving you and gates ourselves firesong replied calmly as the hair on the back of karals neck began to crawl of its own accord it had been all very well to tell lyam that he was neither excited nor afraid when the arrival of these spirits had been an abstract concept but now now there was an atavistic chill running down his spine a cold lump in his stomach and the knowledge that he would really rather be anywhere but here as the shimmering air developed three glowing forms which took on substance even as he watched first there were only two vaguely human shapes and another larger one that might have resembled a horse then the shapes became more defined and detailed although they never actually attained the solidity of the kalenedral or the fiery substance of the avatars maybe that was why he was suddenly afraid the leshya kalenedral looked just like any of the others and the avatars were so exotic as to fit in the same categories as firecats and other manifestations of the gods but there was nothing solid about these nor so alien that he could bear them because they were so new to him the first to become really clear was a strikingly handsome man and if this was firesongs ancestor vanyel it was obvious where he got his beauty there was no color to any of these spirits so karal could not have told if the clothing this spirit had chosen to wear happened to be antique heralds whites or not but the cut was like nothing he had seen in his lifetime the spirit had long hair though not as long as firesongs or silverfoxs and wore no jewelry of any kind he searched the group gathered around him and his gaze lit on karal and remained there in spite of the ghosts smile karal was not reassured so this is our young sunpriest the spirit said as karal froze if i ever have the opportunity remind me to tell you of another young servant of vkandis that i met who proved to me that not all of the folk who used vkandis name to justify their actions should be lumped together into a single category the spirits smile widenedquite as winsome a smile as anything firesong had ever producedand some of karals chill melted away but not by any means all of it for some reasonperhaps simply that these beings looked acted and sounded exactly like what they were supposed to bekaral found vanyel entirely unnerving as the second spirit manifested karal didnt find him any easier on the nerves perhaps because he couldnt seem to make up his mind whether to look like a muscular squarejawed fellow who was a bit taller than vanyel or a slight triangularfaced largeeyed lad who was shorter and more slender than the heraldmage just looking at him made karal feel dizzy and when the third shape came into focus it didnt help any for it wavered between the form of a companion and that of a determined woman with a firm chin and the look of a hunter about her if you all dont mind id like to see that bed karal has been keeping warm for me altra said firmly and when karal looked down he saw that the firecat had polished off every drop of the broth and was on his feet swaying a little you go ahead my friend vanyel said genially we three need to have our first consultation with the mages and having too many people trying to explain things at once is not going to get us anywhere we will try to keep the noise down so you may rest better since altra did not look at all steady karal picked him up bodily and carried him to that waiting bed with florian pacing alongside him offering a shoulder for support lyam cleared the way ahead of them quite authoritative for such a short fellow altra was quite limp with exhaustion and karal wondered if he should say anything forbidding altra to make any more jumping expeditions did he have the right to demand such things thats the last that is absolutely the last altra said weakly as karal laid the firecat in his warmed bed i know you arent seeing any physical manifestations of the storms right now but believe me where i have to go theyre there it was like trying to swim a river in flood and cats are not particularly suited to swimming let me tell you i do not have the strength to try that a second time good because i was going to ask you not to karal replied i dont think i could stand losing you well you wont thats that advantage of having a cat instead of a horse as a partner we dont go running off to sacrifice ourselves at the sound of the first trumpet call altra said feebly winking at karal on the side opposite of florian were sensible and right now my sensible side demands some cosseting i want sleep oh do go right ahead and sleep florian said with mockindignation dont mind us we just want to gather worshipfully around your slumbering form and tell stories about your bravery and virtue fine you do that and about time the firecat replied in the same spirit just dont wake me up and with that he closed his eyes his even breathing seeming to indicate that he had fallen straight asleep well what do you think karal asked the companion certain he was about to get a litany of praise thinly disguised as a lesson in valdemaran history i think that im hoping our latest visitors remain unmanifest most of the time florian replied promptly his uneasiness quite apparent in his mindvoice yfandes gives me thewhats lyams term for itthe collywobbles thats it theyre all three dreadfully intimidating really karal arched an eyebrow at him i didnt think you could be intimidated by anything i can and shes it florian was quite serious and it was karals turn to put a steadying hand on his shoulder not even a groveborn gives me the urge to kneel and knock my head on the ground the way she does well dont do that karal advised for one thing youll hurt your head for another im sure you have nothing to feel inferior about he knew how florian felt though and he sympathized hopefully these newcomers would stay invisible if he couldnt see them maybe he wouldnt keep having the urge to do some bowing and scraping of his own ghosts and spiritswords avatars and leshya kalenedralwe have more notmortal things around here than we have mortal ones he complained and when you add in bondbirds and hertasi and kyree and companions the weird creatures outnumber ordinary humans to the point where were a minority it could be worse florian pointed out pensively this could be a vale or kleshya vale then youd have dyhell and tervardi and gryphons and i dont know what all else only the gods know what weird pets the kleshya brought up out of the south with them karal just sighed and sat beside altra with his chin on his hand the worst part of it is that a mindtalking horse is the most normal of all the folk around here florian only whickered and mindlaughed weakly fortunately for karals peace of mind and florians sense of profound inferiority the three newcomers mostly remained unmanifest to save energy and simply tendered advice to firesong by means of mindspeech karal had the feeling that vanyel was a little hurt that the karsite was so nervous in vanyels presence but there was no help for it karal himself wasnt entirely sure why vanyel made him so edgy it might simply have been that the heraldmage was everything that karal was not but without the somewhat inflated selfesteem of his descendant firesong it might have been unconscious residue from all the demon vanyel stories hed been told as a child and it might only have been that vanyel was so obviously everything that a karsite feared about the night and although karal had been working with stranger beings vanyels presence was simply the one bit of strangeness that was too much he had his own problems that were similar to floriansthe fact that of all of them he was really the most ordinary and aside from his ability as a channel apparently the least necessary he was not brilliant like master levy nor a mage like sejanes or firesong he could not translate the ancient texts as tarrn and lyam could nor had he the knack of amusing everyone and helping them see solutions to their problems as silverfox did it was silverfox however who made him realize that the things about him that were the most commonplace were the ones that made him the most valuable in this group of those who were out of the ordinary im glad we have you here karal silverfox said to him the next day as he shared stew that altra had not been awake to eat with the kestrachern me he said with surprise why because your strength is that you are forced to handle wildly extraordinary events and peopleand you just do it without complaint you set the rest of us an example after all if you can handle all this we should certainly be able to karal made a face i think im being damned with faint praise he replied ironically it isnt meant to be faint praise silverfox said earnestly what i mean is that you are finding great strength and grace inside yourself and you prove to the rest of us that we should be able to do the same he gazed into karals eyes with intense concentration you keep us centered reminding us that there is a world out there beyond these walls you give us perspective in this rather rarefied company and help keep us all sane his smile was just as charming as anything firesong could conjure in your own way my dear young friend you are a constant reminder of everything normal and good about the world that we are trying to protect karal blushed that was all he could do in the face of words like that hes right you know altra seconded it isnt the great mystics and saints who do the real daytoday work of keeping peoples faith firm its the ordinary priestthe good man who goes on being good no matter what he has to face ordinary people know in their hearts that they could never withstand the trials that a saint undergoes but if they see a person who is just like they are and watch him bearing up under those trials they know that they can do it too and as for the great ones when they see an ordinary man bearing extraordinary burdens they are inspired to take on far more than they might otherwise do now he was blushing so hotly his skin felt sunburned meanwhile we are having to face a crisis silverfox continued his smile fading as he sobered and it is coming on us swiftly firesong wanted me to tell you that theyre going to use the cubemaze after all that cooled his blushes in a hurry and he nodded silverfox reached for his chin and tilted it up looking deeply into his eyes then nodded as if satisfied by what he saw there you know that this is the best choice of all of them he stated firesong says that of all the weapons this offers the most gain he said nothing about risk but he didnt have to for karal already knew that the risk of using any of those weapons was great and they really could not know how great until they triggered one karal nodded and i knew that it was quite likely i would have to work as a channel again its all right im not afraid this time strangely enough he wasnt he wanted me to tell you so that you would know he doesnt intend you to have to bear any more than any of the rest of them silverfoxs ironic expression filled in the restthings best left unsaid karal knew though that firesong would not be able to lie successfully to the kestrachern and silverfox would not allow him to put karal in for more than an equal share of peril in a sense silverfox was vouching for the adept karal shrugged awkwardly the cubemaze was their first choice the last time they just couldnt come up with enough information to make it work id rather be channeling for something that is their first choice rather than their third or fourth he didnt pretend to understand half of what the mages were talking about but the device they called a cubemaze which resembled a pile of hollow castmetal cubes stacked rather randomly atop one another was supposed to have had a nonliving core to do the channeling either urtho could never get the thing to work correctly in the first place or else the core was no longer functioning in either case there was no one here that was capable of making a device to act as the channel that meant karal was the only hope of making this thing work it might work better with a living channel that might have been one of the reasons it had failed in the first place a living channel could make decisions a nonliving channel couldnt like the other devices here the cubemaze didnt look anything like a weapon it was rather pretty in fact there was an odd sheen or patina to the blue metal surface that refracted rainbows like oil on water one of the truly strange things about all of these weapons was that none of them looked alike it was difficult to imagine how the same mind could have come up with so many dissimilar devices karal master levy hailed him from the main room the teleson is free and natoli is on it silverfox cut short karals attempt at excusing himself politely go off with you the kestrachern said you can talk to me anytime and im not half so pretty as natoli is that last comment made him blush all over again but this time he didnt care his longdistance romancing of natoli appeared to charm everyone they all stayed discreetly out of the way when he spoke to her and they all seemed to go out of their way to give him occasions to talk to her on the teleson altra followed on his heels to act as the facilitator for the conversation it was amazing that altra didnt ever tease him about anything that passed between himself and natoli but even altra apparently regarded the growing relationship as a private matter between the two of them and not for any outsider not even a firecat to intrude upon no matter what either of the two said to each other altra never commented on it either during the conversation or afterward in fact karal was able to completely forget about altras presence most of the time but natoli had disturbing news for him that had nothing whatsoever to do with their personal matters elspeth and darkwind reported that they are already getting storms in hardorn she said gravely they arent dangerous yet but its only a matter of time before things degenerate we have already started preparations here to handle whatever comes up thats probably why the mages and all finally made up their minds which device to use he told her i suppose master levy must have agreed on their choice since he is the one doing the mathematical modeling for the solution he hesitated and looked down at his hands a moment then looked back up and told her the truth im going to have to be a channel again she didnt say anything but her face grew pale and she bit her lip well she finally managed thats what youre there for you have to do your job just as i have to do mine she rallied a bit speaking of my job im in charge of some of the emergency plans were going to have to evacuate the palace at the very least and maybe even parts of haven just in case that node under the palace goes unstable all the highborn have gone home and as of today theyve dismissed the collegia and sent the trainees home as well even the healers have dispersed the trainees that dont have homes to go to are supposed to go off with their masters if theyre bards off to one of the houses of healing as healertrainees or riding circuit with full heralds if theyre still in grays its a little crazy around here since things still have to get done and its getting to be that whoever has a pair of hands free just does whatever it takes they say that the gryphons will stay until the last moment and set spells to keep out looters then theyll fly away itll be a relief when everyone is actually gone he didnt have to ask why she was still there she could not sit back while others were in danger any more than he could she would probably remain there until the very end because that was what her father would do herald rubrik was in karse so perhaps she felt it was up to her to take on the familial duties well he replied you do what you have to right if your job is to be there then you need to do it clumsy words but he hoped they told her what he wanted to saythat he still would never ask her to stop doing what she considered to be her job just to be safe if there even was any place safe anymore i want you to know that i really dont think any of us here are in any more or less danger than you are he continued trying to give her reassurance the one thing i am concerned about is that after the last time the others here are all so fiercely determined to protect me that im more afraid for them than i am for myself she smiled tremulously you would be anyway just promise me that youll let them take care of you not at the expense of getting the job done but let them protect you from what they can if youll do the same he demanded before you go flinging yourself into exploding boilers wait and see if someone more suited to that particular job is already doing it you know it just might be that capable as you are someone else would manage that particular rescue a little better than you you drive a hard bargain she retorted and shook her head a little of her old humor returning to her eyes all right i promise and so do i he pledged softly and basked in her smile the wind of a fullscale blizzard howled and whined outside the windows of his suite and icy drafts forced their way past windows and thick curtains but baron melles didnt care enveloped in one of the heavy woolen tunics that had become fashion out of necessity with a second layer of knitted winter silk beneath that he brooded pleasantly over the reports of his network of spies within the households of the members of the court virtually every one of those pieces of paper reported a new attitude toward him on the part of anyone of any importance fear he was delighted at their reaction they might hate him they might envy him they might rarely even admire him for his ruthlessnessbut they all feared him now and feared to have even the appearance of opposing him he shifted his weight in his chair and repositioned his feet on the warming pan beneath his desk his last object lesson was more effective than he had thought it would be and had spread far beyond the immediate household and friends of his target clearly it was much wiser and more expedient to show that the children of his wouldbe enemies were vulnerable than it was to threaten the enemies themselves and as for those who had no children well there wasnt a single one of them who didnt have some other person for whom they cherished tender feelings anyone who would threaten a child obviously would have no difficulty with targeting an aged and infirm parent or a sibling or a lover even tremane had dependents he would have been very upset at losingthat old mage sejanes for one it was ironic in many ways for it would have been very easy for any of them to make him or herself invulnerable there had not been another person besides himself here at court who had read and understood the lesson old charliss had given to them in the course of his own life trust no one care for no one depend on no one they had all persisted even in the face of obvious disadvantages to fall in love make friendships rather than alliances and allow themselves the cracks in their armor that relationships made tremane never knew that he made me what i am today even as he made me his enemy when we were cadets he betrayed me to the colonel and ruined my career in the army and for what because i was doing what everyone else wanted to do but didnt have the intelligence or the audacity to try i trusted him because he said he was my friend and he betrayed me without that if i had remained in the cadet corps as he did i would not have seen charliss example for what it was he had stopped being a sheep that day and had become one of the wolvesas any of them could have well that was all their own fault and their stupidity and that was why he was the emperors heir and not one of them not even the memory of that longago humiliation of being cast out of the corps could spoil this triumph he had finally achieved the goal he had set for himself that dayto make anyone of any importance look at him and fear it was in this mood of unusual good humor that general thayer found him and destroyed his mood with a single sentence his valet bors showed the general in thayer wore a regulation army cloak over his uniform tunic and fingerless gloves to keep his hands warm melles greeted him with pleasure although he did not rise but thayer had not come to make a social call melles were in trouble he rumbled and as usual the general came straight to the point without even waiting to take the chair that melles offered him where had that come from how can we be in trouble melles asked with more than a bit of surprise weve got order in the smaller cities and the larger ones are coming around food is getting in and youre even making a small profit rioting has stopped in most places and the subversives are beginning to be regarded as lunatics we might have lost the lands charliss brought under the imperial banner and some of the provinces but but the army doesnt want you in charge thayer replied bluntly that last little trick you played was one too many the word from the field is that they dont intend to establish order just to put a baby killer on the iron throne word of your power play has been traveling farther and faster than either of us thought it would i dont know how but in spite of everything virtually everyone ive contacted already knows all about it and knows that you were the one who put the body in the crib he scowled that was a stupid ploy melles your average soldier may be a hard man but the one thing he wont put up with is threatening a baby melles frowned but there was nothing to link me with that incident he objected thayer snorted with utter contempt as the wind rattled the windowpanes and a draft made the candle flames flicker please not everyone is an inbred idiot especially not in the army youre an assassin however much you pretend not to be everyone knows it and everyone knows youre the only one who not only could have done what you did but who is coldblooded enough to follow up on the threat if you had to and i repeat to you the army wont support a baby killer and theres an end to it a cold anger burned in the back of melles throat as cold as the howling winds outside thats fine sentiment from people who kill for a living he said with equal contempt im sure they ask the age of every peasant with a boarspear who opposes them in the field and make certain to leave insurgent villages untouched in case they might kill a few children thayers face flushed with anger but somehow he kept his temper even in the face of melles provocative words i could point out that the army operates under certain laws and that when a soldier kills someone he does it openly under conditions where his opponent has an equal chance of killing him but that would be specious and we both know itand its not the point oh melles asked sardonically and just what is the point the point is that the average soldier believes all those things thayer said pounding the desk for emphasis whether or not they are true truth has no bearing on this and you damned well know it the average soldier thinks he is going to defend the honor of the empire against adult enemies and that makes him feel superior to any assassin and vastly superior to someone who not only threatens the safety of a child but threatens a child of his own people never mind that this same noble soldier would skewer the children of a rebellious village without a second thought or a moment of hesitation melles grumbled although he saw the logic in thayers argument thayer was right the truth didnt matter here and he who was a practiced hand in manipulating perception should have known that very well whats to be done thayer sighed and finally sank into the chair melles had offered i dont know he admitted its not only the commanders that are talking rebellion its the generals and the rank and file and they arent amenable to the kinds of coercion you can use on the nobles of the court unless we can do something about this were going to loose them and the moment charliss becomes a little god theyre going to put someone of their choice on the iron throne and you and me in the ground melles ground his teeth in frustration for thayer was right although unlike tremane he had never gotten out of the cadets to serve in the military forces of the empire he knew the structure and makeup the generals were mostly men who had made a career of the military as had their fathers before them their wives were the daughters of similar men their families all related to other military families they employed former military men as guards and servants employed the wives of such men as maids and housekeepers their positions were embedded in multiple layers of protection and they could not be dismissed or demoted out of hand the high commanders could be eliminated for they were mostly nobles like grand duke tremane but there was no getting rid of the generals they were like a wolf pack you couldnt separate a victim for none of them stood alone and if you made a move against one the whole pack would consolidate long enough to tear your throat out before going back to their own internal jockeying for power you cant touch them melles thayer warned in an echo of his own thoughts if you try theyll destroy you they wont put up with that kind of threat and theyll close ranks against you press it too far and theyll call a coup against you not even your personal guard can protect you against an entire company coming to kill you its gone right down to the rank and file you say he asked his thoughts swirling as wildly as the snow outside thayer nodded and melles cursed them all in his mind he couldnt even order every general within reach of the capital to come to a meeting seal the room and kill them all at once if he tried the entire army itself would rise up in revolt it was only when the generals were corrupt and hated by their men that you could get away with a tactic like that were only in trouble we arent defeated yet he said at last as a few ideas began to form out of the chaos they might have good communications but i have better ones i have a few more throws of the dice coming and i can pick the dice he began to smile as he saw how he could completely subvert the entire problem thayer regarded him curiously and with a certain grudging admiration have you got something up your sleeve that you havent told me about he nodded im not even going to try to deny their rumor instead im going to give them something else entirely to think about i always have more up my sleeve that i havent told anyone about he replied smugly and you should never underestimate the power of the clerical pen what you cant find you can manufacture hmm thayer hazarded just what exactly do you have in mind are you going to give them a different enemy to concentrate on melles just laughed i wont have to manufacture anything with enough records to search i can find just about anything i need and you know yourself that this empire creates enough paperwork to fill entire warehouses give me a few days and i can find all the right evidence to convince the army that im the one they should be supporting show them that having a socalled baby killer on the throne is the least of the things they should be worrying about and in the meantime i can woo them woo them like reluctant girls thayer made a rude and suggestive noise but melles wasnt offended now that he had the bit in his teeth wait and see he responded plans already growing in the back of his mind that would probably astonish the older man just wait and see thayer was not convinced but was certain enough of melles competence to be willing to buy him some time to work on the schemes that he promised thayer stood up saying so in as many words just remember that i cant give you too much more time he warned and its going to take a great deal to overcome the way they feel about the baby incident im still not certain youre taking that seriously enough just remember what i told you about the common man and what he needs and wants melles replied then remember that the army is composed of those same common menjust with a little more training and a bit of discipline hmm thayer looked thoughtful at that and took his leave as soon as he was gone melles called in all five of his private secretaries they were all men like his valet of varied talents and some interesting training all five of them were so nondescript that no one would ever notice them in a crowd and all of them were adept at getting into even the most carefully guarded records simply by knowing how to impersonate virtually any type of clerk in the empire and how to forge anything but the imperial seal when a clerk arrived with appropriate documentation and a request to see something or even to carry it away it took a hardier and more independent soul than existed in the imperial civil service to challenge him you he said pointing to the first in line i want you to go over the military pay records find out all the units with pay in arrears and who is in charge of their pay he pointed to the next two you and yougo through the records of the units sent to take hardorn i want you to match up the requests for supplies and reinforcements with the orders issued to fill those requests i also want the record of every request that was denied and on whose authority he pointed to the last two you two get access to emperor charliss private papers or at least the ones that are in the archives i want all the correspondence between tremane and charliss from the time he left for hardorn to his last known message go the five clerks departed scattering like quail before the hunter he didnt need to give them any further orders about how to get access to those papers one of the reason that these men were no longer in the civil service was that they had initiative neither initiative nor creativity were rewarded in the imperial civil service and those with both often grew frustrated and looked for employment elsewhere melles next called in his private treasurer you get down to the imperial exchequer i want to know how much out of the military budget can be spared in hard coin and how much in goods tell the exchequer that i suspect the armys pay has been bollixed up and we may have to make good in a hurry if we dont want trouble on our hands he thought for a moment and dredged up the relevant fact from his memory if he balks at telling you just say something about the road budget it doesnt matter what just work it quickly into the conversation the man nodded grinning every imperial exchequer skimmed a certain amount off the top it was expected so long as they were clever enough not to get caught at it but if they were caught the penalties were severe melles knew precisely where the current exchequer was skimming and even had a rough idea of how much he had made it his business to know planning to use the information at the right moment there could be no better moment than now a good card was no better than a bad one if you never played it the treasurer left and melles called in his final choice in this campaign of seduction one of his odder employees this rather elegant specimen was ostensibly melles personal poet and playwright but although the man was mediocre creatively he was an absolute genius at propaganda melles didnt use him often but he was like the valet the appropriate scalpel for certain types of surgery melles was doubly fortunate in that the man enjoyed the writing of manipulative propaganda almost as much as poetry he had told his patron once that when he wrote the former he considered that he was writing a different kind of drama one in which the words manipulated the actors instead of the other way around he enjoyed seeing how his works played out on the larger stage of the real world and as a peculiar kind of reward melles regularly financed the production of poetry readings in opulent surroundings seeing to it that the right critics were flattered fed and given enough strong and exotic drink to make even the worst drivel seem inspired i hope you arent in the throes of creation melles said cautiously for this was one individual who could not be coerced only persuaded but his loyalty to melles was based on firm selfinterest and was utterly trustworthy when bought he stayed boughtand no one aside from melles himself knew that he was anything other than a peculiar affectation it was expected that someone of melles status patronize the arts in some way and a poet was the cheapest and least intrusive sort of artist to have on ones staff i have a rather extensive job for you he continued i hope you arent preoccupied the man smiled urbanely and crossed his legs with conscious elegance he was something of a dandy and rather fancied himself as a popular man with the ladies his salary from melles enabled him to cut quite a figure of sartorial splendor among not only his peers but also his superiors what do you need my skills for as a repairer of reputation ive been planning what to do for you since the moment the rumors began to fly he shook his head and then waggled his finger in mockadmonition my dear patron you have been very injudicious this could ruin you yet if it isnt carefully handled melles did not make the retort he felt hovering on his tongue the man was worth his weight in gold and was arrogant enough to be quite aware of it instead he got right to the point it isnt the court im worried about theyre ineffectual enough and like sheep theyll follow anyone with the right bell around his neck no its the army thats giving me trouble he leaned forward over his desk to emphasize how serious he felt the situation was theyve decided they dont care for the idea of someone with my ethics on the iron throne the poet pursed his lips that could be troublesome i dont know quite how to handle the armyunless you already know what you want to say i do believe it or not i want you to report the exact truth melles smiled thinly at the poets surprise were going to concentrate on the plight of my old rival tremane he continued lightly i want you to spread the story of how he and his command were abandoned out beyond the farthest reach of the empire be creative go on about the horror of being sent off to die in utterly unknown lands find the right words to convince people that i had nothing to do with the abandonment of tremane and his men in hardorn then convince them that i had no idea that i would be charliss next choice for his successor say that i feel that the times are so radically changed that i have changed with them say i personally am so busy trying to keep the empire together that i have no interest in pursuing my old vendetta against tremane himself that last could get him in a certain amount of difficulty with the emperor if charliss got wind of it but he was willing to take that particular chance the poet pursed his lips in thought its a novel approach he admitted and it just might distract soldiers from the stories of dead bodies in baby cribs after all you didnt actually kill the baby you only dumped the body of an assassin there whereas tremane and his men were abandoned in hardorn thats without a doubt and with no particular reason to leave them out there thats exactly what im looking for melles encouraged and soldiers have more in common with other soldiers than with brats in cribs they will have empathy for tremanes forces why werent they called back while it was still possible to construct portals that worked between the storms dont place any blame yet but raise as many questions in peoples minds as you can particularly in the army i can do that the poet said decisively losing a great deal of his languid pose as his own imagination set to work im very good at questions what about answers ill give you more to work on when i have facts melles promised for right now this will be enough get people talking get their minds on something else besides my little jokes he signaled that the man could go gossip and rumor opiates of the dull can for the clever be the stuff that dream are made of the poet said sardonically as he smiled standing up as gracefully as he had sat down my dreams at any rate melles chuckled watching the mans elegant way of walkingelegant but not at all effeminate it was rather like a wolf at the stalk and he made up his mind to copy it the first of his seekers came back within hours with an accurate account of the army pay records as he had suspected since every district governor was individually responsible for seeing to it that the units within his jurisdiction actually were paid even though the pay actually came out of the military budget there were several instances where pay was in arrears sometimes significantly as he went over the figures with his own accountant the secretary he had sent to interview the imperial exchequer also returned that gave him his first move in the new game he waited until the next day then descended on the major figures of the imperial civil service trailing a string of clerks all bearing stacks of paper with great fanfare and a fine speech written by his pet poet he revealed the terrible injustice that had been done to the loyal soldiers of the empire but it is not your fault he continued before anyone could get angry at having yet more work heaped on him you are doing the best you can in terrible circumstances he went on at some length praising the overworked clerks for sticking at their jobs even when they had to wade through blizzards to get to their desks shiver in the drafts when they arrived and fight worse weather to go to a cold home with short rations once they returned at the end of a long days work i have brought you the help of my own clerks to see you through this crisis he said as his men took over empty desks or any other flat space with a chair i am sure you do not want our brave soldiers to suffer but i do not want you to suffer either with that he set off a frenzy of paper pushing to get every soldiers records and pay up to date some of the pay had to be made in goods rather than coin but he made certain that the clerks arranged it so the goods in question were more valuable on the gray market than the actual pay they were substituting for it was all taken care of in a single morning not too difficult when he doubled the existing workforce and had all of them concentrate on the one task putting all other work temporarily aside he then formally went to the commanders and promised to personally make up for the other deficiencies that had cropped up usually in the way of resupply he made a great show of embarrassment as if he had only now discovered these problems he didnt know if anyone believed him but he made a point of assigning his own people to make certain that existing problems were corrected and further ones reported to him so that he could see that they were dealt with as he had hoped although there was some suspicion that he was trying to buy the armys favor he began to get some grudging acceptance this was especially true once the stories began to circulate of how he had uncovered all these problems personally then his poet went to work sending out his insidious little stories and questions making the ordinary imperial soldier wonder just what supposed mistake could have left tremanes people out in the cold so to speak an added bonus came when he got word back that the rankandfile had a few other unanticipated questions such asa question of whether the late pay was really just bureaucratic bungling or if certain parties had ordered the pay held back as a form of punishment after all if grand duke tremane and all his men could be abandoned what was a little delay in paying out wages but the crowning touch to the entire plan finally went into effect when melles clerks found that correspondence between charliss and tremane and he could not have manufactured a better final letter than the one that arrived for the emperors personal perusal just before the portals went down and stayed down it was bad enough that tremane had begged over and over again for critical supplies that were never sent for more men and especially for more mages but it was the final letter that made melles positively gleeful both from the standpoint of seeing his old enemy brought low and for the strength of the ammunition it gave him for in that letter which was accompanied by strategic maps tremane begged the emperor to allow his men to retreat vowing that he himself would remain behind and attempt to hold what had been taken with a corps of volunteers he pleaded with the emperor not to visit punishment upon men who had done nothing to deserve it and to permit them to escape while it was still possible to hold portals to the empire open long enough for them to pass through and although melles himself was no strategist it was painfully obvious from the maps that tremanes position was utterly untenable no one not even a military genius could have saved the situation in a handwritten directive the emperor ordered his secretaries to make no response to this desperate plea on the grounds that tremane would have to solve the situation in order to prove his worth thus condemning tremanes forces with him at that point the best outcome for them was exileand the worst was massacre he took that letter with the note in the margin to general thayer who in turn leaked the information to his own commanders who sent it on down the line he managed to conceal his triumph in a show of distress so perfect he even fooled thayer by this time the army was outraged the emperor had betrayed them betrayed the sacred bond that was supposed to bind the emperor and the men who served him the rumors of melles the baby killer were forgotten in this new and far more personal outrage and even the lowest private began to recall how it was melles who saw that the pay was put right and melles who made sure the supply wagons got through melles and not the emperor and in that moment he had them that was the point where he got an odd invitation from general thayer an invitation to dinner but not in the palace this was to be a private dinner in an upper room of a very wellknown and luxurious inn usually frequented by wealthy bachelors who didnt care to keep staff or cooks there were just a few things wrong with this invitationthe most obvious being that melles was not and had never been part of the social circle that made use of this particular facility the inn itself was suffering some of the privations of every other eatery the fare now was far from the former standards and in fact was inferior to anything he could get in crag castle and it was halfway across the city the magestorms struck twice a day now with the result that the weather was utterly unpredictable and there were often things prowling the streets animals and even humans changed by the storms into misshapen creatures that bore little resemblance to what they had been the oncerats were bad enough but the other creatures required that one travel with an escort of heavilyarmed men after dark he turned the invitation over and over in his hands considering it it could be a trap of course designed to get him where he would be vulnerable and eliminate him but somehow he didnt think so to meet in a public tavern in so remote a place suggested a need for secrecy the private salons of these large inns had separate outside entrances so that people could come and go without being seen this had the earmarks of a conspiracy i had better go if anyone is going to make an attempt on the emperorassuming that is why they want mei had better be in a position to advise them it wasnt the best plan but it was better than allowing them to make an attempt that would fail and would alarm charliss the emperor was already unstable and it wouldnt take a great deal to set him off on a campaign to purge the court and if necessary i can always turn them in myself proving my loyalty to charliss that would be the court of last resort however if he could not persuade them to hold off until he was ready betraying them to charliss would cost him so much difficulty once he was emperor that such a move was not advisable unless there was no other possible course of action there was the possibility that this invitation was the setup for an assassination attempt on him but he didnt think that they would be that stupid an assassin himself as they well knew he would be a very difficult man to take down granted a large number of men could overpower him but as he had already proved he was despite all appearances still perfectly capable of defending himself and killing or maiming several of them before they managed to kill him such an affair would be noisy and leave many witnesses who would have to be silenced or eliminated he would have his own men with him who would also have to be silenced or eliminated and those men would have the superiors they reported to and families of their own who would miss them it would turn into a nightmare of murder and be impossible to cover up they had to be aware of all of that with great reluctance he called his valet and ordered clothing for the cold arranged an armed imperial escort to take care of the hobgoblins alerted his personal bodyguard and ordered a carriageonrunners nothing else could handle the icy streets now people had to step up from their doorsteps to the street instead of down for there was rockhard packed snow to the depth of the knee on most of the streets snow that would not be gone until spring he was just glad that he had invested every bit of his magecraft in shielding mages who had not done so were in a state of nearcollapse every time a storm passed through he barely noticed he got a headache just before each storm a bit of disorientation during it and a touch of nausea afterward nothing was bad enough to even interrupt his reading but another storm was due about the time he expected to be on the street and anyone who was likely to be severely affected by the storms could find himself in deadly danger in a situation of that nature a person walking alone could collapse and freeze to death he could be set upon and robbed and a person riding in a conveyance could still freeze to death without his escort noticing he wondered how many marginally talented mages had been caught and hurt or killed that way if so that simply cuts down on the number of idiots with magepower he reflected as he pulled on a second set of gloves over his first set and worked his feet into heavy sheepskinlined boots it was difficult to be both dressed for warmth and for elegance and he opted at least in his outermost garments for the first the journey to the inn was something of an unpleasant ordeal and he wondered at the number of people who still continued to make their daily trips from home to place of employment went out shopping or indeed did anything that took them out of doors the weather was hideous as it was more often than not now there was the usual blizzard blowing driving snow deep into the fabric of ones clothing making it impossible to see the linkmen bearing lanterns who lit the way for the driver if they got more than a few paces ahead of the carriage and yet there were other people out on the street including some women which amazed him his escort changed places regularly so that some rode while others walked when they were about a third of the way to his destination a pack of hobgoblins attackedhairy things that scrabbled through the snow on all fours drooling and howling with hunger their ribs clearly prominent even through their heavy brindled coats of fur this time it appeared that they were changedogs rather than changechildren which made it a bit easier on the escort the men had a difficult time killing things that cried like babies and had human eyes or faces it wasnt too difficult to beat the pack back leaving a few bleeding furcovered bodies in the snow so far changed creatures were routinely less intelligent than the creatures they had been changed from and changedogs were probably the most stupid of them all they kept charging straight ahead even when that tactic clearly did not work the exception was changerats which were more cunning and vicious and swarmed in packs of several hundred there were laws about changed animals and people now if your pet or relative was changed the only way to keep it or him was to take it to an imperial examiner who would verify that it was no danger to humans or livestock there were few changechildren being kept and sheltered by relatives most were actually killed by their own families the moment they changed for the horror stories circulating about the bloodbaths some of the changed had wrought in their own households did not encourage compassion a few who found themselves changed had killed themselves most of the changechildren who roamed the streets as hobgoblins had come from the streetswere beggars thieves and other street people who had no relatives to eliminate them and no interest in anything other than survival the rest of the journey was spent nervously watching for another pack of attackers when they finally did arrive at the inn it was fully dark and in the interest of keeping his employees satisfied enough to keep their mouths shut he distributed a generous purse among them so that they could entertain themselves in fine style in the common room while he met with thayer and thayers guests in the private room above his men entered the common room at the side entrance he entered the main entrance stepping out of the screaming wind and snow into a sheltering foyer softly lit and blessedly warm and attended by a discreet footman music played faintly somewhere a full consort of wind and string instruments the footman directed him up a staircase to the right to another foyer this time attended by one of thayers personal servants who took his snowcaked outer clothing and directed him inside the door behind him he was not at all surprised to see that besides thayer virtually every other important military leader in the area of the capital was there already waiting with an excellent supper as yet untouched set up on a sideboard all eyes were on him as he entered and the murmur of talk that had been going on stopped for a moment then resumed he took his place beside thayer was introduced to those he did not know personally and thayers servants proceeded to serve all of the guests he watched them carefully and noted that they only served him food from dishes that everyone shared and only after stirring up the contents within his sight so that there could be no special little spot that had been prepared for him with poison he kept his approving smile to himself and pretended not to notice dinner conversation was not precisely light since a great deal of it had to do with the roving packs of hobgoblins and suggested means of eradicating them but it had nothing whatsoever to do with politics there was another peculiarity of thayers servants they never handled knives themselves deferring to thayer for carving of meat and they were unarmed as for thayers guests they were conspicuously unarmed everything that could have been done to reassure a professional killer that he was safe among them had been done so it wasnt to be an assassination attempt after all that meant it was a conspiracy and the moment that the meal was over the dishes cleared away the wine poured and more left in decanters on the table and the servants sent off the conspiracy was revealed they wanted to be rid of charliss before he did any more damage and they were perfectly willing to send him on to godhood a little sooner he listened to them with great patience making no comments only nodding occasionally when they seemed to require it they were understandably angry at many of the things that had been going on and his revelations concerning tremane had essentially been the trigger for all their pentup frustrations they were quite prepared to eliminate the emperor themselves and had a good solid plan for doing so he told them as much and commended them for having a plan that took care of almost every aspect of the situation almost he repeated with emphasis but i would be remiss if i did not point out the major flaw in your plan and i do not blame you gentlemen for not considering the aspect i have in mind which is what exactly asked general thayer who was acting as the primary spokesman magic he held up a hand to forestall any objections i know that given how your own mages are acting with the increasing severity and frequency of the magestorms that mages seem an insignificant aspect to you please believe me they are not you have determined that the spells binding the imperial guard to charliss are broken and have not been replaced that is good news but those are not the only magics you need to worry about charliss himself is a powerful mage and his power is augmented by an entire corps of lesser mages whose minds have been his for many years they spend themselves to ensure his continued prosperity and that is what you are not seeing in dealing with your own mages who would do no such thing surely you gentlemen recall seeing charliss mages beforethat group of rather blankeyed individuals who trail about after him like so many adoring mindless maidens trailing about after a handsome warrior he looked around the table and saw to his satisfaction that although there was disappointment in their faces there was reluctant agreement there as well and nods all around at the moment charliss is only moderately inconvenienced by the storms as opposed to the vast majority of mages who are prostrated by them he steepled his fingers together thoughtfully and considered his next words as a mage myself let me explain to you if i may the true effect the storms are having on magesand that is primarily in our choice of actions the choice for a mage at the moment is simple preserve all of your own power for shields or work other magics and have each storm that passes send you to your bed for hours recovering he saw more nods as the generals recognized the effects he had just described because charliss is using the power from his corps of mages he can shield and work other magics and not suffer that is what makes him dangerous still you might well get past his guards even past his personal bodyguards you might get past the protections put in by his personal mages but by then he will be alerted and you will never get an assassin past his own defenses there were still a few of the generals who were not convinced melles saw it in their closed expressions there is one more factor to be considered here and that is what would happen afterward he continued the old man still retains the loyalty of too many peopleincluding most of the truly powerful mages of the empirewho consider me to be an upstart as it happens most of them favored tremane who was a personal favorite of the mages who taught him many of whom are now quite influential i do not know if the truth of what happened to poor tremane would turn their opinion against the emperor but if you remove him now you will not give that truth a chance to work in their minds now he had all of them the last of the skeptical looks was gone replaced with resignation please wait he said at his most persuasive the emperor has made no attempt to say or do anything about the truths that are spreading about his treatment of tremane i suspect this is because he is living in a very narrow world of reasoning at the moment he wants revenge on tremane for betraying the empire and he may believe that people assume he cut tremane off after that betrayal rather than before the hundred little gods know that by now he may even believe that himself a couple of the oldest of the generals pursed their lips and looked just a touch regretful some of the youngest only looked smug both expressions were probably prompted by the same thoughthow far the emperor has fallen the old were thinking that charliss mental deterioration could easily be something they would experience if they were unlucky the young were thinking only that it was terrible for someone that old in that state to still be in power melles continued seeing that he was bringing them to the line of thought he wanted them to follow charliss looks physically worse with every day that passes he may die soon on his own his life is sustained by magic and that is eroding no matter how desperately he shores it up let things take their natural course he allowed himself a small modest smile after all i am the one who is really holding the reins now charliss is too busy concentrating on survival waiting will harm nothing in the long run with time i may be able to persuade those same mages that charliss is using them with no regard for the cost to them and no regard for the real enemy we facethe storms thayer looked around the table and seemed to take some kind of unspoken consensus from his colleagues very well he said we will hold our hands we agree that the real danger to the empire is the magestorms and the continuing refusal of the emperor to adequately deal with them you must see what you can do to convince the mages that charliss is no longer capable of dealing with the true priorities of this situation he sat back in his chair and nodded this was exactly how he wanted everything to fall out and he relished the moment even as he relished a single sip of wine if he were to prosper as emperor the empire itself must survive and prosper in order for that to happen he must redirect the energies and attention of the empire on the storms and their effects just now the energies and attentions of the empire were seriously divided between one selfish old man who had outlived his usefulness and the struggles to survive through worsening conditions either charliss must go or the empire for only one would survive through the storms i will deal with the mages and believe me we must have them he said remember tremane is our key even as the army realized that charliss had betrayed and abandoned one of their own i believe that with time i can persuade the mages of the same good thayer held out his hand strange times make for strange allies but sometimes those are the best the army is with you and i melles pledged with no sense of irony am with you as well it is a pity that poor tremane did not have as many firm allies elspeth had just finished describing the latest results from the group in the tower as relayed from rolan to gwena when tremanes face suddenly went white gods tremane said through gritted teeth here comes another one he meant another magestorm he felt them first as they traveled over the face of hardorn they made him tremble all over churned his stomach and muddled his head but that gave elspeth darkwind and tashiketh time to brace themselves before the onset of the storm hit them as well at the moment the effects were still not too bad although every mage endured some unpleasant physical symptoms in direct proportion to how powerful he or she was but the circles of changed soil had already begun to appear again and it could not be too much longer before the weather shifted back to the terrible blizzards that had ravaged the countryside and before more boggles appeared as living creatures were changed by wild magic they were just glad they had the formula to predict where those circles would appear elspeth grasped the arms of her chair and clenched her own jaw it didnt help it never did but at least it gave her something to do while the storm rolled over her meanwhile father janas watched them all with worried wondering eyes for he was no mage and felt nothing when the storms came this was a short intense storm when it was over she let out the breath she had been holding let go of the arms of the chair and put her head down on her folded arms on the table oh i do not like that tashiketh sighed i do not know how you bear it you bear what you must darkwind replied philosophically and there are worse things to contemplate than having ones lunch jump about in ones stomach and that brings us back to the topic we were discussing tremane said his clenched hands slowly loosening as color returned to his face i do not wish to cast aspersions upon the ability of your friends lady elspeth but i feel we must assume that the party in the tower will not find a solution to the final storm my concern is and must be for this land and these people how am i to protect them is there any way that i can take in the damage myself instead of having it come upon the land can i use earthmagic and the earthbinding to instruct the land to heal itself and to prevent the creatures here from being twisted out of all recognition have you any ideas at all father janas shook his head you could take the ills of the land upon yourself my son but not for long before it killed you you cannot bear what the land could and live we dont have any ideas yet but we have several kinds of magic that we can incorporate elspeth mused aloud tremane i dont think the damage to the land is going to be that terrible but what i am afraid of is that the nodes are going togo to a critical point where they cannot be controlled that they are going to become rogue im very much afraid that the final storm is going to turn them into something like the rogue heartstone that darkwind and i dealt with that is my concern also tashiketh agreed i fear that is precisely what may occur and such a thing would be very like having a continual storm in one place as power fed into it it would continue to grow this would be a very bad thing shelters shields darkwind muttered frowning and glaring at nothing the trouble with such things is that they are going to fail i dont know how we could possibly make them strong enough to survive what is coming elspeth got up and paced restlessly beside the windows the weather in hardorn had deteriorated again but it was not yet as foul as it had been before the last protection went into place they were currently between snowstorms and the sun shone down with empty benevolence on the dazzling fresh snow elspeth was not looking forward to the resumption of blizzards but at least the increase in the number of snowstorms was keeping the number of curiosity seekers down virtually everyone who could come in himself to pledge to tremane had and a few days ago their old friend father janas appeared with another casket of earth collected from all of those who wished to pledge themselves and their land to their new king and could not come in person now tremane felt virtually every part of his realm which was both an advantage and a disadvantage he knew where every trouble spot was and when a storm began its march across the face of hardorn elspeth was personally quite glad that it was tremane who experienced the sickness of his land and not her but now the system of signaltowers was fully functional again and at least warning could be sent out when something did go wrong out in the hinterlands the precise locations of where the circles of altered land would fall were sent out well in advance of the storms by means of the towers if things were not precisely under control at least they were in a better state than they had been there was one authority in hardorn again and resources were not being wasted on warfare a few skirmishes with tashikeths gryphons had put an end to further fighting there was still the pressing problem of how to protect the nodes and the tayledras heartstones she was all too conscious of the heartstone right under the palace at haven if that went rogue it could very well destroy the palace all the collegia and perhaps a good section of haven as well the loss of life would be horrendous the palace complex had been partially evacuated but with mixed results and quite a bit of ongoing confusion she had seen enough magical destruction in the capital of hardorn she had no trouble envisioning the same level of destruction visited on her own home she started to shake just thinking about it and turned her gaze to look out the window for a moment so that no one in the room would see her face and the expression she wore as so often happened these days her timing was just right she was the first to see and recognize the latest arrival to tremanes court the procession was just entering the courtyard as she glanced down at the gates and the glitter of the sun on shining metal and blinding gold and white trappings caught her eye first then she saw the standard and who rode beneath it and she gasped catching the attention of everyone else oh gods she said feeling as if she had just been struck a numbing blow to the head and had not yet felt the pain she wondered wildly for a moment if she was hallucinating there was no way that she should be seeing what she saw out the window oh ye gods this cannot be happening this is too strange even for me elspeth darkwind said catching the timbre of her voice without knowing what caused it ashke whats wrong the chair legs grated on the wooden floor as he hastily shoved his seat back he got up and hurried to her side unable to speak she simply pointed out the window his eyes widened and he choked completely unable to get even a word of exclamation out king tremane elspeth managed to say as darkwind was struck dumb you have a very important visitor and i think you had better get down to the courtyard now why he asked a little resentfully for he had gotten rather tired of meeting so many delegations in the cold over the past several weeks you should justdo what she says darkwind managed to croak tremane looked skeptical his tone took on an edge of sarcasm whos here the emperor no elspeth replied solaris high priest of vkandis and son of the sun and her entourage she glanced down again and the firecat hansa she added behind her there was a muffled curse and the sound of a chair clattering against the floor as it fell over and by the time she had turned to see what tremane was doing he was already gone wed better go down there too darkwind finally managed to get out we should be there to welcome her she nodded and gestured to the fascinated gryphon to accompany them by the time they reached the courtyard however tremane had already given solaris as respectful a welcome as anyone could have wished even the son of the sun and the mouth of vkandis given that she had arrived with no warning and she in her turn had remained polite which was all that elspeth could have hoped for given the circumstances i have been traveling for many days at the express orders of sunlord vkandis solaris was saying as elspeth got within earshot it was i believe at precisely the moment when you were bound to the land of hardorn that then she caught sight of tashikethwho had reared up on his hind legs and was holding his foreclaws extended in a peculiar manner that was obviously a ritual salute and solaris stared at the gryphon with a look of shock and complete disbelief on her face her hands automatically moving to form a similar salute thats odd shes seen gryphons before so why is she looking at tashiketh as if he were some new kind of creature as she stared at him in complete disbelief tashiketh intoned something in that odd gabble that elspeth thought sounded like karsite evidently so did solaris who blinked and stammered something back it was the very first time that elspeth had ever seen the son of the sun taken aback by anything evidently vkandis has a streak of the practical joker in him after all darkwind commented with a touch of amusement otherwise he would have warned her perhaps this is meant to be an object lesson that just because she is the mouth of vkandis she doesnt necessarily know everything about the sunlord elspeth answered tashiketh replied and solaris responded evidently they were going through a set series of greetings and responses finally the little ritual came to a close tashiketh dropped back down to all fours again and made a very courtly bow she looked from tremane to tashiketh and back again how long sir have you had this gentleman at your court she asked very carefully since a few days after i was bound to the earth tremane replied tashiketh informed us that he and his entourage were sent because of that particular event as was i solaris murmured still staring at tashiketh and now i know why i was sent here rather than being told to send representatives as i did to valdemar i have the feeling that it wasnt just to consult with tremane darkwind said wryly now she knows that her god has been sharing his attentions this could be rather amusing the firecat hansa who was sitting very patiently on the front of solaris saddle reached out and patted her on the shoulder with his paw we are about to have a blizzard descend sunborn he said politely if you would all be so kind good people it would be best if we could move inside as with his compatriot altra hansa could apparently make himself heard in mindspeech even to those who did not share that gift elspeth saw startled looks all over the courtyard as even tremanes guards experienced someone talking inside their minds for the first time in their lives i beg your pardon sir hansa of course we can tremane said instantly and with commendable aplomb allow me to conduct you to appropriate quarters myself at that moment to confirm hansas prediction the warning horns blew from the walls signaling that a physical storm was moving in quickly from the west and tremane did escort them probably thanking his hundred little gods that he had set up one of the towers as guest quarters for important folk and their followers the last set of guests had just vacated the premises the tower was clean and waiting for the next set it was a matter of moments to take them there turning over the entire tower to solaris and her relatively small entourage although darkwind excused himself elspeth went along as the official representative of selenay and because she was anxious to talk to solaris if she could solaris escort consisted of a few very professional and toughlooking guards and several sunpriests just as the last of their baggage came up from below the blizzard hansa had warned was coming did indeed descend and tremane took his leave of them to see that the usual precautions were in place the moment he left solaris dropped some of her detached and official manner looking at elspeth and tashiketh she raised an eyebrow in an inquiring manner would you care to remain while my people get us settled in i should be glad of the company it has been a stressful trip i think we would both be pleased to remain holiness elspeth said carefully and solaris laughed tossing her cloak aside and removing the heavy gold collar she was wearing a robed attendant took both and carried them away just solaris little sister the high priest replied there are few enough who can call me by that name and you are certainly one who has that right she removed a few more pieces of regalia and set them aside then sank down in the chair nearest the fire while the wind shook the walls hansa immediately leaped into her lap and settled there do take a seat elspeth solaris continued sunborn tashiketh i am not certain what to offer you the floor will do most holy the gryphon said with careful courtesy and settled himself there as elspeth chose another chair i hope you will forgive me but how is it that you did not know that vykaendys was was watching over both our lands i suspect it is partly because that knowledge was lost while corrupt priests held the sun throne as to why vkandis did not choose to reveal this fact to me until now she spread her hands wide the god moves in his own way and in his own time presumably he had a reason for sending me here to be hit over the head with this revelation i suspect that he sent you here for more than that reason most holy tashiketh replied respectfully if you are here who is holding the sun throne elspeth blurted unable to restrain her curiosity i thought you couldnt leave for any length of time that there were still those you did not entirely trust oh that is a tale in itself and some day i will tell you all of it but in short i am here because vkandis himself sits on the sun throne at this very moment solaris said as elspeth started with surprise solaris nodded i mean that quite literally it is the second great miracle of my reign the great statue of vkandis came to life again during a holy service over which i was presiding then ordered us all to follow and walked out of the temple shrinking as he moved until he reached the throne room where he took the throne solaris spoke so matteroffactly that she might have been discussing the terrible blizzard outside rather than something that was quite clearly a miracle in every sense of the word elspeth was as fascinated by her attitude as by what had happened she saw no reason to doubt anything that solaris told her for solaris would not have left karse without a compelling reason and an unshakable guarantee that her throne would be waiting for her when she returned when he had seated himself he let it be known that i was traveling into hardorn on a lifeordeath mission at his behest and that in token of the fact that i was his trueborn son he would be holding the sun throne until i returned she continued he swore his protection to karse against the storms at that point the statue became a statue again except of course it was literally rooted to the sun throne it wasnt an illusion either the great statue is quite gone from the pedestal and the smaller version in place on the throne and in addition there is a peculiar barrier around karse itself people can come and go through it but it is quite visible and it seems to resemble the barrier around iftel that karal described to me she smiled a bit wryly now it seems clear why it resembles that barrier the sunlord has had practice solaris might seem to be matteroffact but as elspeth listened and watched she realized that solaris was profoundly moved and awed elspeth found this a great deal easier to understand how could anyone not feel awe at such an occurrence i doubt that anyone will have the temerity to claim your place given that particular demonstration tashiketh said dryly and so vykaendys directed you here precisely and it was not the easiest journey i have ever undertaken though not the worst either our robes earned us respect and safe passage though no one really recognized us as sunpriests one corner of her mouth twitched i will admit it came as something of a shock to learn that tremane had been bound to hardorn that puts him on an equal basis with me in some ways and it was not what i would have expected to see happen still it is probably good for hardorn she laughed softly i also have a confession that i might as well make to you both i am taking a certain amount of sadistic pleasure in this he is going to suffer physical discomfort even terrible pain from time to time he agreed to this he even volunteered for it and i think that between this and his geas of truthspeaking he just might be able to atone for his actions in the past he spoke to me in private of what he had done sending the assassin tashiketh admitted i believe he regrets his actions more with every passing day well he should solaris said firmly i cannot even begin to describe the anguish he caused not only to myself and karal but to those who knew and cared for all of his victims but although i am not prepared to forgive him yet i am willing and ready to work with him i am an adept of a peculiar bent as i suspect you have guessed i think we may be able yet to find ways to protect ourselves through this crisis i hope so elspeth said fervently i hope so with vykaendys help tashiketh replied with absolute certainty we shall ten firecats had a real cats ability to make a person feel as if she was a particularly stupid student and the cat was a teacher fast losing patience vkandis protection is temporary hansa said firmly looking for all the world precisely like the cat statue at the feet of henricht the first son of the sun poor henricht even as a statue looked singularly unprepossessing the cat however looked as if he should have been sitting on the sun throne it cannot last through the final storm the nodes in karse are as vulnerable as any the protection is only meant to prevent people and beasts from changing and to prevent the greater part of the priesthood from falling ill twice and thrice a day he bent his head then and washed a paw with great daintiness you and your priests will have to do your share like everyone else if nodes go rogue you will be dealing with the unfortunate results solaris sighed but not with disappointment elspeth thought that her sigh sounded more like someone who had just heard unpleasant news she had nevertheless expected shields darkwind muttered pacing as vree followed his movements with interest from his perch in the corner that has to be the key but how do we create a shield that will hold through even the storms we have now elspeth pummeled her mind for something she remembered out ofa chronicle no it was a story that kerowyn had told about one of the mages her grandmother had trained why only one shield she asked why not layered shields shields within shields kerowyn told me about something like that the mage layered lots of weaker shields instead of one strong one and kept replacing them from the inside as they were taken down from the outside if you could do that keep replacing the innermost shield every time the outermost was destroyed interesting and yes it has been done before and quite successfully darkwind said knitting his brows in thought multiple shields are more effective than one strong shield but we cant put a mage beside every node and if we dont how could we keep replacing shields as they came down you cant shield from the outside once the initial shield is up and how would we do it from the inside that is the problem of course and a spellor series of spellswould have to be crafted for that if we could how would we continue to supply the energy to create the shields in the first place tremane objected solaris gave him a withering look you would be sealing the perfect energy source within the shield she replied with an unspoken fool hanging off the end of the sentence that would be the least of our problems and if the energy were to be exhausted and all the shields fail well an exhausted node would be no more dangerous than no node if theres no power to act upon there will be nothing to go rogue apologies but things work somewhat differently where i am from and we did not handle magic wells that way tremane offered tremane did not take offense at her manner perhaps because she was at least participating in these experimental sessions and demonstrating that she was not going to take out her animosity toward him on hardorn and its people in general he grimaced as if he was getting a headache then if we could simply find a way to keep a node spawning its own shields until the energy ran out this is all very nice in theory elspeth pointed out impatiently but even if we could do that we havent the time or the resources to run about the countryside slapping a shieldspell over every node well actually we wouldnt have to do that at least not here began tremane there are priests enough in karse to shield every node there said solaris at the same time and that works for hardorn and karse elspeth frowned but what about valdemar and the pelagirs and elsewhere hmm tashiketh rumbled moving his gaze from solaris to tremane and back again there is an answer to that question already in our hands hansa and father janas switched their gazes between the two rulers also as solaris and tremane exchanged a very peculiar look there was something rather odd going on there and elspeth hadnt a clue to what it was all about but the tension between those two suddenly increased a hundredfold i do not like you solaris burst out as she abruptly got to her feet and stood glaring at tremane i do not like you at all ever since you and your heathen army came here you have stood for everything i find detestableexpediency above honor craft above wisdom guile above truth selfreliance above faith i do not like you and with that she gathered her robes about her and swirled out hansa padding in her wake the heavy silence that followed her outburst made even their breathing seem loud what in hell was that all about elspeth asked bewildered she had never seen solaris lose control like that before tremane looked at the door that solaris had closednot slammedbehind herself im not sure he replied but it might have to do with a solution that involves a personal compromise on the part of the son of the sun he appeared to make up his mind about something and stood up if you four can work on the problem of a selfrenewing shieldspell that can take power from a nodesource without the intervention of an adept i will go and speak with solaris and see if my guess mirrors actuality rather than just an outburst of frustration he nodded at all of them and left as well darkwind snorted a selfrenewing shieldspell that takes power from a node without an adept at least he was only asking the impossible but elspeth wasnt so certain dont tayledras heartstones do selfrenewing spells like the veil and they dont need an adept around to make them work darkwind started to object then got a thoughtful look on his face tashiketh rested his beak on his foreclaws looking expectant they do darkwind replied slowly and i was about to say that nodes arent heartstones but heartstones are a kind of node let me think about this one for a moment father janas simply shrugged i havent the least idea of what youre all talking about he said cheerfully tremane asked me to sit through this because i know how the earthbinding and earthmagic works other than that my friends im fairly useless but it does seem to me that for your controlling factor you could use earthenergy the very slow and subtle energies that underlie everything the ones even hedgewizards and earthwitches use those are fundamentally unaffected by the storms tashiketh raised his head and nodded eagerly darkwind looked at father janas as if he had unwittingly uttered something profound elspeth had come late to magic and thus undergone a forcedgrowth process like a hothouse plant she had never actually worked with such primitive energies as janas described but the theory seemed reasonable to her and both tashiketh and father janas obviously were familiar in detail with how those magics operated well why dont we just pursue that particular hare until we either catch it or it goes to cover she asked decisively it is these energies with which vykaendys created the shieldwall tashiketh said thoughtfully this is why there is less magical energy to spare within iftel itself than there is in other lands it is constantly going to renew the shieldwall if this works there will be little energy to spare in any of the lands when the final storm has passed and the alternative elspeth replied i dont think any of us want to contemplate that most of us have been doing without a great deal of magic ever since the storms started and i doubt that it is going to be too much of a hardship except for the vales darkwind sighed but as you said the alternative is a great deal less pleasant he regarded the three of them with an expression so mournful that it almost made elspeth want to laugh i will need your help in asking me very stupid questions for we will somehow have to unravel the processes by which tayledras make heartstones and link them into spells like the veil i am so used to being able to do such things that i cannot tell you how i do them this he concluded with resignation is going to be a very great deal of difficult work all of it mental he was right it was they were still only in the earliest stages when solaris and tremane returned and darkwind remarked via mindspeech to elspeth that since there were neither knife wounds nor signs of violence on either of them the talk must have gone well neither of them said anything and both of them acted as if they did not particularly wish to discuss what had occurred the group was not able to get beyond the most basic of understandings that day nor for several more days although they all worked feverishly to put together their solution only tremane did not spend every waking hour of the day deep in research and testing solaris remarked cryptically that he didnt need to since his presence was only necessary when they had a solution ready to try whatever had passed between them had cleared the air considerably for solaris had stopped making her acidic comments and was even distantly friendly to him at times perhaps not so ironically it was the discipline and methodology they had learned from master levy and the other master artificers that enabled them to dissect magic logically apply the laws they had learned and find the fundamentals that allowed the magic to work in the first place finally they had all the pieces of a solution thanks to darkwind they all knew how to make a node behave like a very weak heartstone and how to tie one into a selfsustaining spell unlike a tayledras heartstone nodes could only support one such spell but one was all they would need they knew how to use earthenergy to power the second spell that would control the first triggering the spawning of a new shield when the outermost collapsed now came the question to which they had no answer unless solaris and tremane already knew ithow to reach every node at the same time then at last tremane rejoined the group earthbinding he said succinctly every tayledras vale will be able to control the nodes in the territory of that vale solaris will be able to reach the nodes in karse the king in rethwellan the nodes in his land and so forth those leaders will have to undergo the ritual but the gods know its simple enough and once they do they can immediately protect their nodes elspeth looked askance at him but father janas nodded i thought so he said with satisfaction this is one of those few times when the king can affect the land rather than vice versa i am not looking forward to this tremane added bitterly when we take this to the next level and involve the entire country it is going to be extremely unpleasant but it isnt going to kill me and i would rather spend a week recovering from the aftereffects of this than have my people face a single node gone rogue so let us test our theory on the nearest node to shonar and if it works we will then make all of hardorn into our second test something about his tone made elspeth think that the effects of the fullcountry test were going to be something worse than merely extremely unpleasant she had the feeling that this was going to require every bit of courage tremane possessed but there was nothing she could do about it and she knew very well that her mother would have willingly sacrificed herself in the same cause as would solaris or any other good ruler the test on the single node was far less difficult than elspeth had envisioned first the controllingspell was set in place then the node itself was altered to allow for the linkage of a shieldspell directly to it this was the part that only an adept could do so it was up to darkwind as the most practiced of all of them in this particular kind of magic while solaris watched with singleminded intensity then when everything was in readiness darkwind triggered the spell just before the next storm came through if elspeth had not been watching at the time she would never have believed that it was possible for between one moment and the next the node disappeared and in its place was a shielded spot into which leylines fed but nothing came out then the storm swept in and they all waited out the effects when they had recovered and were able to look again the node was exactly as it had been before the storm shielded and safe tremane looked very much like a man who has received both incredibly good news and incredibly bad news at the same time well he said we know it works how soon do you want to try protecting all of hardorn father janas asked him gently now he said decisively we have until late tonight before the next storm comes in and i dont want to be able to sit and brood on this solaris sat straight up and looked him in the eyes tremane gyfarr pendleson of lynnai dont you dare sit there and pretend to be a martyr what you are about to endure i will also have to and prince daren of valdemar and faramentha of rethwellan and whoever it is in iftel vykaendysfirst bryron hess tashiketh said helpfully the son of the sun in iftel and a halfdozen hawkbrothers and at least one shinain solaris concluded not to mention as many other leaders we can reach as we think will have lands in jeopardy hansa added helpfully there will be a great many leaders with dreadful headaches before this is all over exactly you will not be alone in this and although you may feel fear because of the justifiable guilt you bear for your other actions in the past i can assure you that the land will not let you die she rose to her feet full of anger and some other emotion that elspeth could not put a name to if you are afraid then be a man and admit it and let us help you through it you should know that if you are too afraid the land will resist what we are about to do we may not be able to overcome that resistance for the land takes its cues from you thats solaris talking but its also something else darkwind said in mindspeech tightly focused and tense i wonder if tremane realizes it vkandis elspeth asked but even as she said it she knew that it was the wrong answer since when does a male use all of someones names to scold him darkwind asked a little of the tension ebbing no solaris is acting as a mouth for a different power and i suspect that if you asked father janas hed be very familiar with it probably her annoyance with tremane and her familiarity with being a mouth opened her up to acting as an inadvertent channel for it elspeth sent silent agreement after casting a quick glance at the priest who was watching the little scene with a faint smile on his lips darkwind was right only a womana motherwould scold someone using every one of his names and wasnt the earth often referred to as mother looked at in that light there were some subtle physical changes in solaris that gave more clues for one thing she looked morefemininethan elspeth had ever seen her the scolding did what it was supposed to do which was annoy him enough to make him willing to admit to a weakness and in a way elspeth could feel very sorry for poor tremane who hadnt asked for any of this and had borne up very well under it all he stiffened his back looked up into solaris eyes and said with quiet dignity you are right solaris i am terrified i am accustomed to using power not having it use me and the prospect of giving up control over myself to anything gives me the horrors doing it with the lives of thousands of innocents in the balance is terrible beyond my ability to articulate whatever had solaris let her go and the anger faded as she sat down it isnt so bad being used by this kind of power she said softly you will be exhausted when it is over perhaps a little ill though i dont think it will be very bad i think the power will use you gently if you dont resist it sometimes giving up control in a greater cause is the noblest thing one can do in ones life she hesitated a moment longer then it looked as if some wall inside her gave way her expression changed completely perhaps you are rightfully afraid that some of us who have grievances with you may not protect you with a whole heart you would have been correct in fearing that not very long ago i might not have moved to help you if i saw that you were in danger she took a deep breath and plunged on that is no longer true i forgive you tremane of hardorn and if it is any more comfort to you young karal who has greater cause to hate you than i forgave you before i did the man who loosed the assassin that murdered our friend was an imperial commander subject to the orders and whims of an emperor with no morals and no scruples and you are no longer that man now she looked shamefaced for a moment the sunlord himself told me that i must forgive you if we were to succeed but until this moment i could not tremane looked at her with astonishment and offered her his hand she took it in a firm handclasp that said far more than words could have thank you for that i know what it cost you was all he said then he released her hand and looked at the others well shall we begin as far as elspeth was concerned there was very little for her to see or do other than to feed magepower to darkwind who in his turn did things with it that she could neither see nor follow although she knew in theory what he was doing she was what they all called the anchor and she brought in the power directed and refined it tremane searched for the node and held them all there when he found one darkwind built the node into a matrix that would permit a single spell to be linked into it father janas constructed the controlling spell that triggered the main spell using the loss of a shield as the guide for activation solaris built the main spell which created the nine nested shields using power from the node and darkwind linked it in then once that node disappeared because it was now shielded tremane moved their viewpoint on to the next node in the end by the time they were done tremane was so completely exhausted that he could not even move but as solaris had promised he was neither ill nor in pain they had worked through him to reach every node in hardorn and replicate the same shields and spells they had tried on the first node this was the only way they could have reached all of the nodes without going to them physically in a sense since tremane was bound to all of hardorn in a very physical fashion because of the blood and soil he had ingested they actually were working there physically they completed their work just as the next storm came through and had the satisfaction of seeing their work hold and tremane got a small reward out of it after all since the nodes were no longer being battered by the energies of the storm he was suffering only about half of the physical effects he had been enduring with every stormwave this made him feel half again better that in and of itself made this all worth while he said weakly but with a smile and then they sent him off to bed he feels as though he will sleep for a week but it wont be more than a day or so father janas said with weary satisfaction hell be back on his feet and hard at work shortly now do you need anything to alert the peoples in your homes i will send two of my fastest flyersmages bothback with the exact instructions in the morning tashiketh rumbled his eyes alight with pleasure at their success and if you will permit me most holy more will convey you and hansa back to your own land to save you as much time as possible as many of your escort as care to remain here can i suppose and the rest can follow you at their own pace solaris gave him a puzzled look i would appreciate it no end but how do you intend to do this she asked i assume you mean me to fly with them but i cant imagine how that could work properly a basket suspended between them it is perfectly safe tashiketh assured her there are some minor spells on the basket to make it and the contents light you can renew these easily enough and the only thing you will need to take care with is that you go to ground during storms our gryphons use the same means darkwind seconded its safer than youd think youll be able to cross into karse within a few days even with having to land twice or three times a day as a storm passes then i thank you for i will have to seal off the temple as well as our nodes and whether or not tremane will believe that it will be a harder task than this her words were still a little sardonic but she smiled and elspeth sensed that solaris would no longer be able to say in truth that she hated tremane of hardorn and you father janas asked elspeth and darkwind darkwind answered for both of them it is already accomplished darkwind said his voice heavy with tired content gwena has sent the word to rolan rolan has sent it on to skifs cymry who will detail it to the kaledain of kleshya vale they will see to it that tayledras and shinain alike have the information and our nodes and heartstones will be protected within days messages will go from valdemar to every white winds mage in every land and from therewherever the word needs to go your companions are useful friends father janas said with envy perhaps there will be room for them in hardorn in the future he looked shyly at solaris and there should be room for temples to the sunlord as well i should think when it all comes down to it what is done for the cause of good is done in the name of every power of the light she smiled the first open unshadowed smile that elspeth had seen on her face since she arrived here and on that very optimistic note i shall thank you and beg leave to go to bed myself she said getting to her feet hansa and i have a long journey in the morning room for everyone darkwind echoed as he and elspeth walked slowly to their own quarters that is not so bad a way to conduct ones land i know she replied saucily weve been doing it that way in valdemar for some time now and now at least we have some assurance we will continue to be able to she thought and now we can spare some prayers and energy for karal and the rest where they are may all our gods help them for we cannot emperor charliss sat in not on the wooden throne in his private quarters and plotted revenge for revenge was all he had left to hold him to life his mind was clear despite the hellish mix of drugs his apothecary had concocted on his orders to dull his pain and sustain his failing body that was because the mix included drugs to keep his mind from becoming clouded outside his quarters a physical blizzard raged as it had raged for the past three weeks the magestorms too passed through crag castle several times every day leaving most mages shuddering with the aftereffects he wasnt suffering from that difficulty though or if he was it was insignificant in the light of the degeneration of his body although he did not appear to take any notice of what was going on outside this suite such was not the case he knew very well what melles was up to discrediting the emperor even with the imperial army spreading truths halftruths and lies to make it appear that only baron melles had the welfare of the empire in his heart he was also quite well aware that melles was doing a fine job of holding the empire together even if it was with devious and dubious means he knew that melles was using the emperors treatment of tremane as a weapon to bring the feuding political factions of the empire together under melles control it was a ploy that would not have occurred to charliss but in retrospect given that melles was detested by at least a quarter of the great players in the game of empire and feared by another quarter the only way he could have united them was to find a common enemy they could hate worse than him none of that mattered for he no longer cared what melles or any other living man did his priorities were different and much more personal the spells that kept his wornout body going that reinforced failing organs were themselves failing each time a storm came through he lost more of them and was unable to replace all the spells that were lost he saw no way of being able to save himself he was dying and he knew it he could no longer move under his own power anymore his servants carried him from bed to throne and back again all within the confines of his private quarters the long slow decline he had anticipated had accelerated out of all recognition he was not afraid but he was angry with the kind of calculating allconsuming anger only a man who had lived two centuries could muster he had been cheated of the last precious years of his life and he knew precisely where to lay the blame for it valdemar he had sent his scholars on a search for that benighted land and its origin and had learned things that gave him all the more reason to assume that it was valdemar that had unleashed these storms across the face of the land valdemar had been founded centuries ago by rebellious subjects of the empire who had escaped into the wilderness too deeply to follow but time and distance were no barriers to revenge as he himself very well knew the rulers of valdemar had probably been plotting this attack against the empire ever since their land was founded a plot such as this one would have taken centuries to mature centuries to gather the power for these storms could not have been generated by anything less than the most powerful of adepts working together in concert such a weapon was fiendishly clever diabolically complicated in the end it might have been his own actions in reaching for the land of hardorn that triggered the long plots of valdemar and gave them the opportunity to destroy those who had driven them out of their homes so long ago he should have read the return of his envoy from hardorn dead with the blade belonging to princess elspeth between his shoulders for the serious warning it really was youre too close and well finish you that had been the real message like a nest of bees he had ventured too near and now the insects would swarm him and destroy him it didnt really matter what the cause for their actions was nor did it matter whether he could have done anything to prevent this the storms had been unleashed he was dying it was all the fault of valdemar and he was going to see to it that valdemar didnt outlive himat least not in any form that the valdemarans themselves would recognize like a wild bear making a final charge in his death throes he would destroy those who were destroying him he had everything he needed all of the magic of the local nodes plus all that of his coterie of mages plus a great deal he had hoarded in carefullyshielded artifacts every emperor created magical artifacts or caused them to be created he could drain every one of them every mage he had ever worked with whether he was one of charliss private group or not had a magical hook in him one that tied him back to charliss the moment charliss cared to he could pull every bit of that mages personal power and use it as if the mage was one of his personal troupe the smartest of the mages had of course discovered and removed that hookbut most of them hadnt and charliss could use them up any time he cared to but his own time was rapidly running out the shields protecting those hoarded objects werent going to last through too many more storms nor were the resources of his magetroupe nor of the mages he had hooks in if he was going to use this power it would have to be soon he sat supported by the tall back and heavy arms of his mock throne and contemplated the methods of vengeance what could he do to finish them these upstart valdemarans what form should his attack take he wanted it to be appropriate suitableand he wanted it to do the most damage possible what would the best allocation of his resources be its obvious release all the power at once he decided release it as the wavefront of the storm passes and use it to augment what the storm does make it the worst storm that the face of this old world has ever seen the results of that should be highly entertaining and since he would release it as the storm passed from east to west most of the empire would be safe but valdemarah valdemar would have no idea that the blow was coming the results of such an enormous release of power would be devastatingand amusing if he lived to watch it and to collect his information everything from hardorn to far beyond valdemar and from the mountains in the north to the south of karse would erupt with nature driven mad the weather was already hideous this would make it unbelievably worse earthquakethere would be earthquakes in regions that had never known so much as a trembler as the stresses in the earth built to beyond the breaking point firevolcanoes would erupt out of nowhere pouring down rivers of molten rock on unsuspecting cities physical storms would spawn lightning that in turn would ignite huge forest fires and grass fires blizzards would bury some areas in snow past the rooftops while floods would wash away the country elsewhere and mudslides make a ruin of oncefertile hills mountains would fling themselves skyward and the earth would gape as huge fissures opened underfoot processes that normally took millennia would occur in a single day or less there would be no place that was safe no place to hide and when the wrath of nature was over the changed creatures would descend on the demoralized and disorganized survivors it would be everything he could have wished for he just wished he was going to live long enough to properly gloat over it once the energy was released charliss would have no more magic to sustain him and he would die but so would most of his enemies anyone and anything that lived through it all would probably wish for death before too very long tremane would be caught in all of this of course which would give him revenge on the faithless traitorrevenge that melles had been too cowardly or too lazy to take lazy probably melles never had been one to pursue targets that were out of his immediate reach he could always manufacture excuses to obviate any need to do so well he would take matters into his own hands then it was possible that the extra energy released wouldnt just wipe valdemar off the worldit might rip through the empire and its allies as well the chaos he was about to unleash could have farreaching effects he didnt care he was long since over caring about things that meant no immediate improvement in his wellbeing why should my empire outlive me he asked himself seething with resentment over the fact that the empire as a whole was not willing to make the sacrifices to sustain him i gave them my life and my attentionmy entire life was i appreciated beloved for being stern with them no not at all they took and took now they pay for their greed they should have thought ahead and appeased me and there was no reason to make life any easier for melles either let him patch something together from what was left if indeed there was anything left let melles see if he could actually do something with the crumbs and shards it would serve that effete bastard right he smiled slowly thinking of how melles would react the baron had been progressing so well in imposing order on the chaos left in the wake of the storms he must feel so proud of himself and be so certain that he had everything under control now it would be delicious to see how he crumbled as everything he had worked so hard for vanished before his eyes revenge on valdemar on tremane even on melles for daring to succeedthat was all charliss had left and he would take it by the time he was finished the known world would be driven down to the level of cavedwelling nomadhunter survival if melles reclaimed anything at all as an empire it would be an empire no bigger than this city i will destroy it all his hands clutched the arms of his chair and he felt his dry lips cracking as his smile widened when he set off the final cataclysm when he ignited nations to form his funeral pyre he would prove he had been the greatest and most powerful emperor to ever live no one would ever surpass him as he burned the world to light the way to his grave and the darkness that followed would be a fitting shroud karal felt peculiarly useless at this moment in time although in a little while he would be just as important as anyone else in the tower he watched the others making lastminute preparations and wished wistfully that he could use the teleson to talk to natoli it might have relieved his nerves he sat quietly where hed been told to sit immersed in a peculiar mixture of terror resignation and anticipation he knew he could do what they were going to ask of him but he couldnt think past that even when he tried he was unable to imagine a single moment after their task was done was that only because he was frightened or because once it was over it would be over for them forever he was still acting as the channel for this weapon but this time he would not be in the physical center of the group this time the main participantshimself firesong andesha and sejaneswould stand in square formation around it and it didnt seem to matter what direction each stood in so long as they were spaced equally around it there was another difference this time each of the mortal participants would be shielded by those who were not karal had florian and altra andesha would be protected by the avatars firesong by need and yfandes and sejanes by vanyel and stefen yfandes had attached herself to firesong without comment perhaps so that each of the participants would have two protectors aya was to be kept strictly out of the way in the care of silverfox with the rest of those who were not participating they would all be in the workroom below with the hatch closed firesong and sejanes had determined that the shields on the workroom were as much purely physical as magical there were properties in the stone that insulated from magical energy the workroom had been cleared of anything remotely magical in nature and stocked with tools food and water so that if the worst happened and the survivors were sealed inside they had a chance to dig themselves out the cubemaze was the exact opposite of whatever device was used to unleash the cataclysm in the first place and the adepts had surmised that it had been created as a failsafe as they now understood it all of urthos magic had been released at once when he dissipated the bonds of all of the spells on everything that was not inside the specially shielded areas of the tower at the same time a similar device had done the same to all of maars magic in his stronghold thus creating the cataclysm as the two reacted together in violent and sometimes unexpected ways they had partly replicated that when they set up the counterstorm this time if their research and planning paid off they were going to reverse that they were going to open up something that would swallow all of the magic energies converging on this spot and send it all out into the void at least they hoped that was what would happen they didnt know what was going to happen at the other original release point but maar had not been the tinkerer that urtho had been and had not been known for having workshops to experiment in there were probably not any of the dangerous devices there that there were hereand in any case the site was at the bottom of lake evendim whatever happened there would take place under furlongs of water and far from any populations of human or other beings no one knew what would follow when they closed the device as the last of the energies were swallowed up they all had some theories master levy insisted that since no energy could be destroyed it would all go elsewhere his suggestion was that it would become a kind of energypool in the void that mages could all tap into he also warned that resistance to energy flow usually manifested as heat and there was a very real possibility that despite their best efforts all here would be charred to death partway through this earned the mathematician a few sour looks which were returned with an apologetic smile both loisha and firesong were of the opinion that all the energy would come right back into the real world as if a flood was swallowed up and came back out of the sky as rain like the water in a fountain endlessly cycling from pond to air and back again whatever happened the only certainty was that all the old rules of magic would go flying right out the window no one even knew if all of this energy was ever going to be accessible anymore they might end up with a world that was fundamentally without magic though that was fairly unlikely as urtho had said in the placards that he had left this would have been a suicidal device to use as a weapon once it was opened it would have proceeded to swallow all the magic in its vicinityin fact it was quite likely to drain all the rest of the weaponry in here dryand it might even have swallowed up the mages who opened it but with the tremendous energies of this storm breaking over it the device would probably have all the energy it could possibly handle the plan was to take down the tower shields and open it as the final storm hit feed it all the energy of the storm until it couldnt take any more or melted down and close it again under control if it was still active storms were coming in all the time now and although the tower shields were still holding they had been forced to evacuate the remains of the shinain camp some days ago as a blizzard like none of their hosts had ever seen before raged across the plains similar weather ravaged valdemar karse hardorn the vales probably everywhere else too karal thought listening carefully and its supposed to be spring out there if he paid very close attention he could ignore all the sounds coming from inside the tower and was able to pick out very faintly the howling of the winds outside you couldnt even stand out there the wind would knock you to the ground in a heartbeat it was a good thing that they had evacuated the plains weeks ago tents wouldnt take this kind of pounding and no horse sheep or mule would survive exposed to a storm like this as for the valesfiresong said that the tayledras were incorporating the magic that shielded nodes with the one that formed the veil that protected each of their vales hopefully these would hold if not they would have to live as the scouts did from now on exposed to the elements without their little lands of artificial summer karal wished he knew what was going on in karse altra would only say that solaris had the situation well under control and that most of the people were being well cared for he hoped that his family was all right though since they were living in a fairly prosperous village they should be the ones in real danger would be the remote farmers and shepherds who isolated and alone out in the hills and mountains might not have gotten warning in time to get to adequate shelter he hadnt thought about his family in a long time the karal that had helped his father in the inns stables was another person entirely and he knew that if his mother or father were to pass him in the street they would not recognize him and he would have nothing whatsoever in common with them he had always expected to change as he grew upbut not this radically he tucked up his legs and rested his chin on his knees thinking wistfully about all he had left behindall he would leave behind if this effort failed when it came right down to it there were only a handful of people who would actually miss him if he didnt come out of this and most if not all of them would recover quickly enough natoli probably wouldnt exactly recover but she would manage and go on to make something good out of her life and meanwhile he would have done something important with his life and there werent too many people who could actually say that the thought though bleak was curiously liberating he had made his goodbyes to everyone except those who were still in the tower itself down in the workroom he still had time and this might be the moment to take care of that little detail he got to his feet and slipped down the stairs hoping to find tarrn and lyam alone he was lucky loisha master levy and silverfox were still up above with the handful of shinain who were still here wedging doors to other weapon rooms open and helping to drag the cubemaze out of its little room into the main one no matter what else happened here they were at least going to accomplish one thing urtho could not they were going to render every other weapon in the tower inactive their industry left the workroom mostly untenanted only aya sat nervously on a perch in the corner while lyam and tarrn puttered about storing things away more efficiently he stood uncertainly on the stairs and it was tarrn who noticed him first well young one it is nearly time the kyree said looking unusually solemn i know he replied sitting down on the bottom steps i came to tell you both that im very glad i knew you and i learned a lot from both of you they left what they had been working on to join him i am very pleased to have been your friend karal lyam said earnestly taking karals hand in his own dry and leatherskinned clawhand i hope we will be able to continue that friendship after tarrn and i have gone back to kleshya and you figure prominently in my chronicles young scholar tarrn said gravely with a slight bow of his graying head giving karal what the young karsite knew were the two most important accolades in the kyrees vocabularybeing called a scholar and being told he had a prominent place in the history tarrn was writing in days to come cubs will be astonished that i actually had the privilege of your friendship an awkward silence might have started then but at that very moment silverfox came trotting down the stairs followed by all the rest its time karal the kestrachern said and gave karal a completely unselfconscious hug theyre waiting for you good luck boy master levy called and cracked an unexpected smile dont disappoint natoli shes expecting you to take careful notes and tell her all your observations loisha only clasped his hand warmly and looked deeply and gravely into his eyes and the rest of the shinain paused long enough to give him the nod of respect they normally only accorded to loisha each of them in his own way was saying farewellgiving him what encouragement they couldwithout doing anything that might unnerve him or shake his confidence he knew that and knew that they knew it as well and he knew that he should be afraid but somehow all his fear had passed away as he made those farewells as if each of them was taking a little bit of it with them so that he could be freed to do his task he walked quickly up the stairs firesong and andesha waited up there to lower the hatch down into place once again sealing it behind shields both magical and physical the cubemaze was the first thing he saw as his head came up out of the hatchway placed in the center of the room it was curiously dwarfed by the sheer size of the place it looked very pretty a piece of abstract art gleaming with blue and purple reflections in the light from overhead sejanes was already in his place flanked by the two wisps that were vanyel and stefen dawnfire and trevalen looking far more solid waited on either side of andeshas position and another white wraith stood beside the place where firesong would stand firesong already had need in a sheath on his back and as he took his stand he drew the magesword and held her andesha moved to his place between the two avatars a closedin expression on his face as if already concentrating on what he was going to do sejanes had his eyes closed and his hands cupped in front of him as karal took his own place flanked by florian and altra firesong made a little movement that caught his attention and as he glanced at the hawkbrother firesong gave him a wry grin and a onehanded sign for encouragement somehow that made him feel better than he had all day and he set his feet with more confidence as the terrible energies broke over them firesong was to open the device and hold it open next to being the channel his was the most dangerous task andesha and sejanes were to act as funnels and control the energies as they converged on karal keeping a steady flow surges would be particularly dangerous if a surge of power overwhelmed karal he might block the flow if that happened it would feed back on all of them it was also the job of sejanes and andesha to homogenize the incoming energies by mixing them for a flood of only one kind might do the same thing karal would actually transmute them before feeding them into the device are we ready firesong asked looking around the circle at all of them each of them nodded and karal saw for a moment in each of their faces the same resignation that he himself felt they all think in their hearts that they are going to die theyre putting on a brave face for the rest of us and he did the same despite all their care and planning this could go horribly wrong and if it did it wouldnt just be one of them that would take the brunt of the punishment it would be all of them here it comes warned altra and then there was no time to think of anything else charliss waited tense with anticipation as he had not been in decades this would be perhaps the most powerful spell that had ever been cast in the history of the world since the cataclysm it would certainly be the most powerful spell ever cast in the history of the empire and for all that it was such a deceptively simple thingjust a spell that released all of the energy of every magical object and person within crag castle that charliss had any control over this would probably kill all of his mages if it didnt it would certainly leave them disabled for many weeks and might well destroy their minds that had a certain piquant pleasure to it for this spell would definitely kill its caster and charliss was not at all averse to taking an escort with him when he died the only emotion within his breast now was rage it left no room for anything else it really left no room for any thought but revenge he might well be the last emperor and that thought had the sweetness of revenge more so since no one would ever know that he was the one who had done thisthose few who knew he was spellcasting thought it was of the usual sort that he was trying to extend his life a little longer they would probably blame melles for this since the mages who would die would all be mages closely allied with charliss that was even sweeter melles would have all the blame as the man who had destroyed the empire and charliss would acquire the virtues that melles did not have in contrast melles would be the terrible villain and charliss the saint that he destroyed what a subtle revenge the only thing that would make it better would be to know for certain that he was taking tremane down with him but never mind one couldnt have everythingand if tremane didnt actually die in the catastrophe that charliss unleashed he might well be among those who wished he had charliss gathered the threads of his power in his hands and waited for the storm to break it was a strange little gathering here in the great hall of tremanes manor tashiketh and the four gryphons that were left with him part of solaris escort of sunpriests that had remained behind to help elspeth and gwena darkwind and vree brytha the dyheli all of tremanes mages the two old weatherwizards from shonar itself and father janas all arranged in concentric circles around tremane anyone with even the tiniest bit of magegift was here and they would all be working on a single task to create and hold a shield if they could hold it over shonar they wouldif that proved impossible they would try to hold it over the castle and if that failed just over themselves the scene looked and felt unreal and dreamlike but elspeth was doing her best to control a fear that was as deep and allpervasive as the fear in a nightmare for once the menace looming over elspeth was invisible implacable and faceless there was no villain no ancar no falconsbane only a terrible thing that had been loosed millennia ago and was now coming home too ancient impersonal and powerful to grasp yet too real not to terrify nevertheless the danger was real enough and it would be worse if the group in the tower failed there had been a blizzard howling across the face of hardorn for the past three days the strangest such storm that elspeth had ever seen greenish lightning somewhere up above the solid curtains of snow illuminated the entire sky in flashes yet revealed nothing but white there were reports of whirlwinds and of spirits riding the wind strange creatures blowing before it none of these reports had been verified but elspeth would not discount any of them every time that storms came through the effect was worsealthough every one of the nodeshields held with no apparent problems but this storm was going to be worse much worse than any of the previous lot this was the return of the initial blast that had caused all of the storms so long ago as for what would happen if the group at the tower failedno one could predict that except that it would be terrible nature already raged out of control could they deal with years of this never mind it was out of her hands and that was what felt the most unreal of all she had never been in a position where she was utterly helpless to do something about her own peril before never been in a case where she had no control over what was going to happen she felt demoralized and impotent and she didnt like it one bit darkwind squeezed her hand and gwena rubbed her soft nose against elspeths shoulder well at least she wasnt facing this alone no one else in this room had any more control over the situation than she did its time tremane said hoarsely its coming and now it was too late to think about anything but joining mind heart and power with the others disparate as they were and shield and hold with grim determination now firesong said between his clenched teeth as the storm broke over them around them the stone of the tower rumbled and groaned like a carriagespring being twisted beyond its ability to return to normal this time was unlike all the previous experiences with the energy of the storm in that it had a distinct sounda hollow screaming roar accompanied by a steady increase in air pressure firesong held need up between himself and the cubemaze spoke some apparently private words to the sword and did something to the taut fabric of magic that karal halfsaw halffelt then the cubemaze scattered motes of light along its surfaces toward the apex of the topmost cube and a ring spread outward to the farthest edges of the deviceand all inside that ring vanished and in its place was what could only be described as a great darkness the void the pit karal sensed it pulling on him and let it florian and altra held him anchored as he let some inner part of himself meld with that awful darkness in the center of their circle then there was nothing but light and dark the pit in the center and a coruscating scintillating rainbowhued play of light and power all about it karal felt part of himself opening to it sensed that he had become the conduit to send that power down into the pit which swallowed it hungrily but did not yet demand more than he could feed it all of his attention was on the pit before him he sensed explosions of energy behind and to all sides and the energies around him oscillated furiously he tried to contain them and shove them into the dark maw but the pit had reached the limit at which it could accept them he heard shouting it sounded like andeshas voice but he couldnt make out what the shinain was trying to tell him off to his right a shining shape emerged from the chaos of swirling flashing light growing brighter with every moment it was firesong with need glowing whitehot in his hands he trembled in agony but refused to give in to the obvious pain of his blistering flesh melles paused outside the emperors doorwayfor once unguarded thanks to the complicity of the emperors personal guard with the geas binding them in loyalty to the emperor now quite gone they were all of them able to think for themselves including commander ethen who had replaced the now nerveshattered commander peleun in the past several weeks they too had seen and heard enoughnot quite enough to take things into their own hands but enough to make them willing to leave their posts for a carefully staged emergency there was no sound in the whitemarble corridor except for the everpresent screaming of the wind even sheltered inside their glass chimneys the candle flames that had taken the place of magelights flickered in icy drafts strong enough to have earned the name of breeze but these gusts were no zephyrs and the blizzard out there wasnt half as powerful as the storm now breaking over them was likely to make it the emperor was going to be utterly engrossed in his spellcasting over the past several days melles had made a point of going in and out of the emperors chambers and the throne room on one pretext or another during a storm and he knew that charliss was completely oblivious to everything around him when he was spellcasting if the emperor had put half the effort on holding his crumbling empire together that he was spending on maintaining his crumbling body melles would not have felt so impelled to remove him now if he had done so melles would not have half the allies he now had either he walked boldly into the emperors quarters as he had any number of times over the past few days as if in search of an official paper or something of the sort he ignored the unconscious mages sprawled over the furniture in the outer room taken down either by the storm itself or the emperors ruthless plundering of their energies the emperor would not be here or in his bedroom melles already knew that charliss had ordered his servants to carry him into the empty cavernous throne room and placed him in the iron throne itself he made a tiny handsign to the two bodyguards standing on either side of the door a pair of bodyguards from his own retinue inserted into the emperors personnel with the collusion of the guard commander they acknowledged his presence with a slight nod and stood aside he opened the door to the throne room carefully a fraction at a time as he sensed the storm building to an unheardof fury and a new and oddlyflavored spell building inside the room in concert with it he wasnt certain why the emperor had taken to casting his magics while in the embrace of the iron throne wearing the wolf crown but it made his own task easier there would be no witnesses and a dozen entrances through which a murderer could have made his escape assuming that there were even any murmurs of foul play he frankly doubted that would be the case people were far more likely to point to all of the loyal bodyguards on duty each within eye and earshot of the next pair and believe the report of suicide despite the roaring fires and a halfdozen charcoal braziers around charliss feet the room was icy but not still charliss could already have been a wizened corpse hunched over in the cold embrace of the throne eyes closed white withered hands clenched on the arms only the yellow gemeyes of the wolves in the crown watched him and he fancied that there was a look of life in those eyes as they waited to see what he would do but wolves protected only cubs and territory and they had no interest in protecting individuals once those individuals were detrimental to the welfare of the pack they would not hinder melles in what he intended to do there was a tightlywoven furiously rotating spell building up around the emperor a spell somehow akin to the storm outside did charliss think to tap the power of the storm now to bolster his failing magics if so he was mad the spell neared its peak after years of watching charliss spellcast melles knew the emperors rhythms and patterns if he was going to strike he had better do so now he slipped a sharp dagger pommel ornamented with the imperial seal out of the hem of his heavy furtrimmed tunic he had purloined this very dagger out of the emperors personal quarters two days ago it was well known to be one of charliss favorite trophypieces and virtually every member of the court would readily identify it as his and no one elses now before charliss woke from his selfimposed trance realized his danger and turned all that terrible energy on him as only a trained assassin could melles flipped the dagger in his hand until he held only the point between his thumb and forefinger aimed and threw the dagger flew straight and true with all the power of melles arm and anger behind it with a wet thud it buried itself to the hilt in charliss left eye the emperor was killed instantly left with a slackjawed version of his selfabsorbed expression but the spell he had been about to unleash did not die with him for one instant melles felt the chill hand of horrified fear clutch his throat as it had not in decades and he waited to be pounded to the earth as the rogue spell lashed out at him the gathered energies with no direction and no controls whirled in a vortex of light around the emperors body for a moment obscuring him rays of light shot upward punching holes through the darkness leaving scorched spots in the ceiling other sparks jumped and careened arcing back to the sword points arrayed in ominous fans behind and around the iron throne the crackling sparks disappeared with a flash and a soft sizzle then suddenly the vortex stilled and a moment later the gathered energy invested itself in the iron throne leaving it glowing for a moment before returningapparentlyto its original state melles let out his breath in a hiss walked tentatively over to charliss and reached for the wolf crown he touched it for just a moment and he could have sworn that the packleader on the front of the crown grinned at him then he removed the dagger from the dead mans eye a thin trickle of blood followed the removal of the blade but it took less force to pull it out of the skull than melles had feared the corpse of the former emperor was already falling to pieces he examined the wound it could be made to look less serious he made a few more facial wounds with quick stabs as if charliss had cut himself about the face in a mad frenzy then he placed the dagger in charlisss hands clenched both the flaccid hands around the hilt pressed the point to the emperors breast and shoved piercing the heart he checked to make certain that he had not gotten any blood on himself more as a reflex than anything else he had been a professional for too long to have made so foolish a mistake then he strolled casually out the door nodding to the guards as he passed in a few more moments they would go in find charliss and report that the emperor distraught and deranged by his failing magic and crumbling health had committed suicide and long live the new emperor may he reign a hundred years karal was on his knees altra was beside him a glowing catimage under his groping hand florian stood braced between him and the pit a horseshape of fire against the darkness to his right looming out of the swirling fluctuating energies firesong still stood like a blinding statue of a warrior with upraised sworda high keening sound that somehow penetrated the roar in karals ears came from need as if the sword had somehow acquired a voice to his left there was no sign of andesha but two birdhuman shapes with feathers of flame wove a restless web all about a shadowed core he couldnt see sejanes at all across the pit he sensed the energies around them were winning they couldnt feed the pit fast enough and their protectors were burning out and yet he was no longer afraid even if they didnt survive they had fed enough of the terrible power into the pit to prevent a second cataclysm as he gazed on the burning image of florian great peace descended on his heart and he faced the terrible glorious mystical fire without flinching once again he stood in the heart of the sun and knew he was welcome there he opened himself up to it fully and lost himself there past fear past pain past everything but the light and then his awareness of self evaporated and there was nothing more the light was gone the light was gone there was nothing but darkness yet florians image still continued to bum against that dark he was lying on his back his groping hands encountered rough blankets over him then warm fur i think hes awake said loisha in a low voice he coughed cleared his throat and replied i am awake how is everyone did the light fail his question was answered with the kind of heavy silence that only occurs when someone has unwittingly asked a question that has an answer that will make him very unhappy firesong has been hurt silverfox said gently andesha and sejanes are quite all right only tired he tried to sit up and felt hands on his chest holding him down how badly hurt is firesong he asked urgently can i see him wheres florian havent you got any lights going yet again that awkward silence and then the answer came to him to his last question at least as loisha asked very softly what can you see nothing he whispered stunned onlyflorian it seems that those whose guardians were entirely spirit fared the best said lyam in that dry way of his the fur draped over his legs moved florian is gone karal altra said in the gentlest tones that karal had ever heard him use i am the only one of the protectors to survive the experience i am sorry karal moved his head and still saw nothing but darkness and the fiery image of florian in reverse silhouette against it he swallowed as the full impact of realization hit him and felt hot tears burning their way down his face floriangone protecting him he blinked but nothing changed in what he sawor rather what he didnt see you see nothing karal loisha persisted he shook his head dumbly what about firesong he asked around a cold lump in his gut and a second lump in his throat is helike me no butthe sword needshe exploded in a mist of molten metal in his hands his face and hands are badly burned that was lyam i just sent silverfox back to him although tears of mourning continued to trickle down karals face he nodded good he managed i dont really need a healer he let his voice trail off making a kind of question out of it no karal loisha said with a comforting hand on his shoulder im afraid a healer wont do you any good right now then just leave me with altra for a bit would you he asked and after a while he heard them get up and move away he felt altra settle on his chest and legs and began gently scratching the firecats ears tears slid down his cheeks and altra continued to rasp them away karal altra asked after a long silence he answered the firecat with a fierce hug just stay with me he whispered ill never leave you karal altra promised never not for as long as you live firesong remembered the exact moment when need lost her battle to shield him which was right after yfandes had evaporated into motes of energy she had screameda warning he thoughtand he had let her go and flung one arm over his eyes to protect them all he remembered after that was pain he hadnt ever lost consciousness and right now loss of all awareness would have been a blessing silverfox had given him something that turned the terrible agony into bearable agony but he still hurt almost as bad was the knowledge of what had happened to him he knew what he looked likeand worse he knew what he was going to look like no healer would be able to keep scar tissue from forming and his face he struggled to keep back tears tears of pain tears of loss yes he had been vain and why not his face had won him all the lovers he had ever wanted and now no one would ever give him a second glance a touch on his arm made him start and open his tightlyclosed eyes ashke i am here said silverfox his face full of concern are you in pain better to ask what doesnt hurt he replied trying to make a feeble joke of it i am trying not to scream it is very impolite and would frighten andesha we have sent the kalenedral out for stronger pain drugs silverfox told him tenderly resting one hand on the part of his arm that was not burned they should be back soon the blizzard stopped and the snow is melting and in a little we will have gryphons or horses here to take you to kleshya kaledain healers are very good he hesitated then added it is a pity they are not good enough to help karal that snapped him out of the slough of selfpity he was wallowing in what about karal he asked sharply i thinkhe has lost his sight silverfox looked away for a moment lost his sight for one bitter moment firesong actually envied him better to lose his sight than to go through life scorned and pitied to have people look away from you because they could not bear the sight of you but even as he thought that he rejected the thought with anger at himself you fool he told himself scornfully you vain selfimportant fool you are alive with all your senses you are neither crippled nor incapacitated and you still have aya as if to underscore that last the firebird trilled a little from his perch beside firesongs pallet poor karal came the thought at last poor lad he sighed florian and this then involuntarily whimpered as the movement sent pain lacing through the burns on his face he felt tears start up and soak into his bandages silverfox cupped his hands at firesongs temples and started into his eyes with fierce concentration as firesong looked into his eyes some of the pain began to recede and he almost wept again this time with relief i will be glad he gasped when those pain drugs arrive they cannot arrive soon enough for me silverfox muttered then managed something of a wan smile you are being much braver than i would i cannot bear pain it is not too bad except when i am alone firesong said still gazing into those warmly compassionate eyes and somehow those eyes softened further in that case ashke i will never leave you the handsome kestrachern said softly if you think you can bear to have me here and for a moment firesong forgot any pain at all andesha lay curled up with his face to the wall and karal could tell by his shaking shoulders that he was weeping silently the view through altras eyes was rather disconcerting given that altras head was about at kneeheight and he had to look up to see peoples faces when they stood but at least now with altra glued to his leg and lending him the view he wasnt bumping into things nor tripping over them karal knelt down beside andeshas pallet and put a hand on his shoulder if you keep this up much longer he said trying not to dissolve into tears himself and make things worse youre going to be sick andesha only shook his head violently and karal tried to remember exactly what it was that loisha had told him andesha blames himself for the loss of the others especially the avatars the kaledain had said you must persuade him to walk the moonpaths oror it will be bad for his soul his heart i have not been able to persuade him the older man had left it at that but there was no doubt in karals mind that he knew how andesha had managed to help him through his own crisis of conscience altra had seconded the shinains request as soon as loisha was off tending to some other urgent problem after that how could karal have possibly refused there wasnt anything you did or didnt do that would have made a difference for the better karal persisted how could there have been we tried to do more than urtho could and it still came out better than we had any reason to expect i should have known about those other weapons andesha said his voice muffled by his sleeve i should have known what theyd do when they started to fail how karal asked acerbically those were urthos weapons not maars how could you have known what they were going to do foresight when not even the foreseers were able to give us decent advice one red eye emerged from the shelter of andeshas sleeve but he began but nothing karal said with great firmness you arent a foreseer and you dont have urthos memories you have maars and if youd go walk the moonpaths youd find out from the leshya that im right andesha winced blanching which looked quite interesting though altras eyes i cant he began karal fixed him with what he hoped was a stem gaze even though he couldnt feel his eyes responding the way they should that sounds exactly like what someone whos been thrown says he replied what do you do when a horse throws you you get back on andesha said faintly but youve already used but too many times karal patted his elbow try saying all right instead all right andesha replied obediently then realized hed been tricked karal wasnt about to let him off go he said and got unsteadily to his feet again instead of looking down he sensed that his head was in a position of looking out echoing altras headposture go walk the moonpaths i want you to loisha wants you to that ought to be reason enough right there having finished what he had to say and having partly tricked andesha into agreement he left and returned to his own pallet far from the others where he sank down onto it exhausted by holding back his own emotions and cried himself to sleep karal he looked around startled he wasnt in his bed in the tower anymore he was standing in the middle ofof nowhere he recognized there was opalescent mist all around him and a path of softly glowing silver sand beneath his feet not only that but it was his own eyes that he was looking out of not altras where was he this wasnt like any dream he had ever had before in fact it was rather like the descriptions that andesha had given him of the moonpaths but that was a place that only shinain could reach wasnt it wasnt it of course not said that voice again teasingly familiar anyone can come here they just see it differently but altra thought that after all youve been through you probably wouldnt want to visit sunheart for a little this time when he turned around there was someone thereor rather four someones two male and two female two of them the ones standing handinhand with vague birdforms swirling about them he recognized immediately trevalen he exclaimed dawnfire but oh heavens you didnt think wed burned up or some such nonsense did you dawnfire laughed it takes more than a storm of mageenergy to destroy a spirit we just lost the parts of ourselves that held us in your world thats all you did said someone else incredulously thats all karal found without any surprise at all that andesha had somehow come to stand beside him but why didnt you come back when i called you then becausewellwe cant trevalen actually looked shamefaced im afraid that we overstepped the bounds of what we were actually permitted to do to help you the stareyed wasnt precisely put out but dawnfire interrupted him youll have to come here to meet us from now on she said ruefully but if youre going to be a shaman you ought to get all the practice you can in walking the moonpaths anyway all i can think of is how glad i am that i didnt andesha began but it was the strange young man that interrupted him this time he looked very familiar but karal could not imagine why thin and not particularly muscular but with a build that suggested agility he had sandy brown hair that kept flopping into his blue eyes and a friendly cheerful manner nothing you did or didnt do made any difference in what happened to us andesha the young man said part of it was purest chance and the rest was that we took on more than we had any right to think we could handle and we managed to carry it off anyway we dared right karal at this point karal had an idea that he knew who the young man was and he gave voice to it rightflorian he replied and was rewarded by a wink a flash of a grin and a nod but if this is where all of you cameafterwhere are vanyel stefen and yfandes free of the forest for one thing and high time too if you ask me florian replied and probably if you ask them i suppose it seemed like a good idea at the time but i suspect they were stuck there a lot longer than they thought they would be karal hadnt the faintest idea what florian was talking about and some of his bewilderment must have shown on his face florian chuckled never mind he said basically theyve made decisions about their destinations and they didnt have a lot of time to make sure they got properly placed so theyve already gone on i cant tell you what they decided but its going to be fine as for me he continued with a wink ive made mine too but i wasnt so picky it should be obvious if you think about it but dont tell any heralds all right karal nodded solemnly florians decision was obvious though he doubted that his friend was going to look anything like he did at the moment when he returned to the world then again maybe he would karal branded that face into his memory if in fifteen or twenty years time karalor rather altrasaw a herald who looked like this they would both know who it was id better remember that he wont remember though and not go rushing up to him and greet him as my longlost friend even though that would be precisely what he was florian he faltered and continued ive never had a friend like you well youll have one again in time the irrepressible florian interrupted evidently he was in no mood for sorrowful goodbyes or recriminations he cut short any other attempts at speech by embracing his friends now you go back to valdemar and get into as much mischief as possible with natoli and ill go take care of my business and eventually well meet again its not goodbye karal its see you later all right what else could he do but agree and return the hearty embrace with a cheery wave florian faded into the mist and was gone leaving karal behind with tears in his eyes and a smile on his lips now he was alone with andesha and the old woman this must be need he realized listening to her give andesha some tart and intelligent pieces of advice and as for you young man she said at last turning her clever gaze on him i heartily agree with that young scamp florian youre too sober by half and just because you cant see things for yourself thats no reason to go back to that gloomy country of yours and sit in a corner and mope go get into mischief with that young lady of yours i had plenty of apprentices like her in my time and i suspect shell keep you hopping and she wont let you feel sorry for yourself probably not my lady he replied politely thinking that her assessment of natoli was remarkably accurate for someone who didnt actually know her now since you asked earlier as for me im taking a longdelayed rest maybe youll see me and maybe you wont but ill be damned if i ever go sticking myself into a piece of steel again she gave both of them a brief hug now you both stop ruining good pillows with salt water and go and get some living done and with that she turned and stalked off into the mist leaving him and andesha alone trevalen and dawnfire had already vanished while their attention was on need now what he asked he looked at his friend who shrugged but with some of his old spirit back i suppose wed better do as she says andesha said you know her if we dont shes likely to turn around and kick us out he toed the soft silver sand for a moment then added im glad you made me come here im glad you let me karal replied and smiled feeling more peace in his heart than he had ever expected to have again now lets go home karal looked back through altras eyes over the tail of his shinain riding horse a lovely and graceful palfrey it felt very strange not to be riding florian but he supposed that he would get used to it after a while firesong rode behind him supported by a saddle that the shinain used for riders who were ill or disabled watching everything around him with his eyes shining behind the eyeholes of the mask covering his halfhealed face firesongs mask was a wonder not only because it was as extravagant and beautiful as one of his elaborate robes but because he and lyam had made it of materials they had scavenged from things in the tower during the fortnight they had waited with a base of leather and adorned with bits of crystal wire and feathers that aya himself had carefully pulled from his tail and brought to firesong while he still lay halfhealed in his bed it probably would have fetched a small fortune from a collector of such things but firesong was dissatisfied with it and was already designing new ones all around them the plains were blooming in a way that the shinain said they had not seen since the stareyed herself walked there one could hardly see the grass for the flowers which painted the landscape in wide swathes of color the land had gone from deepest winter to the heart of spring all in the space of a fortnight through altras eyes karal took in the incredible beauty with a sense of awe and wonder according to the messages that altra had brought from solaris in karse all their friends in haven and elspeth in hardorn the phenomenon was not confined to the plains all the world was in blossom as if to make up for the ravages of the storms sejanes and andesha had been working to discover just how magic operated and as soon as he was able firesong had joined them it had not been long before they discovered that there were no leylines anymore no nodes no huge reserves of magepower magical energy had been dispersed fairly evenly across the landscape and there wouldnt be any large magics for a very long time that meant no gates of course but it was no hardship to ride through a countryside where the sun shone down with kindly benevolence where birds serenaded every step of the way and there was such an allpervasive perfume of flowers both nightand dayblooming that it even permeated their dreams at night and once the clever kaledain found the means to make the carrybaskets light using the small magics that still worked they would make the rest of their journey by air karal had been given the choice of going home to karsea shorter journey by faror back to valdemar but when all was said and done it had not been a difficult choice one of the first messages from solaris had been strictly for him commending his actions and asking him if he would as a personal favor to her resume his work in valdemar both as the karsite envoy and as the head of the temple outside karse with the visible evidence of your sacrifice she had written no one in valdemar will question your authority additionally you will be dealing with the representatives of iftelcreatures i confess i find somewhat unnerving the sunlord has decreed some odd things in iftel and i frankly do not think that outside of you there is a single priest in the entire temple who could treat these peoples as anything other than heretics i do not want to offend these new brothers and sisters in any way but i fear that if i assigned anyone else to valdemar and iftel there would be blood spilled before long however if you want to come home i will understand and find a way to cope the message had come on the day when they were all deciding whether to go to their homes or back to haven tarrn and lyam had elected to return to kleshya which was no surprise at all silverfox and firesong however were going with them karal had half expected firesong at least to want to return to his own people but the adept had smiled behind his mask and simply shaken his head the crystals and bits of metal dangling from the mask tinkling softly no one remembers what i looked like before in kleshya he said quietly andbesides silverfox wants to be there and it is a familiar vale it was plain in his voice burned lips or not that being with silverfox was the primary reason andesha rode with them but he would not be leaving the plains he had elected to remain and study with loisha taking the vows of the shaman karal had been surprised at that as well especially as he had been earnestly practicing magic alongside sejanes and firesong during the time that they waited for their hosts to put a caravan together for them there is no prohibition on magic among the shinain now andesha explained with a chuckle there is no reason for one i suspect that loisha has it in mind for me to be the teacher to the new mages among us in time i should like that he finished softly with a tone of contentment in his voice that karal had never heard before maar in all of his incarnations gave nothing of himself i shall perhaps be able to balance that eventually so loisha and andesha would leave them at the edge of the plains and silverfox firesong tarrn and lyam at kleshya vale master levy and sejanes were going on of course and they would be joined by the heralds who had carried the messages from haven telling the mages and rulers of other lands how to keep their nodes from going rogue and karal would be going with them after all the advice from the spirits on the moonpaths he was hardly surprised when natoli sent him a message of her own asking him to come back to valdemar i can be your eyes too she had written and you can be my good sense which i seem to have a distinct lack of i think i need you confused grammar but not confused thoughts he had been afraid for a little that despite the surety of others she might not want to see him as less than he had been he knew now that he should have given her more credit than that so he would be going on with master levy and sejanes back to duty back to love but most of all back to a place he was already thinking of as home altra would stay with him to provide him with eyes but he had the love of friends awareness of himself and hope for the future to give him vision vision without sight perhaps but as true and clear as anyone could imagine the end
