sounded from the barracks within the city and the cantonments surrounding it most of the city was already awake these did not need to rise from the straw mattresses and thin pallet beds of their hivedense tenements because few of them save the children had ever lain down instead they had huddled all night in one vast tongueless brotherhood of dread and anxiety about the thin fires of braziers and meagre hearths until the night wore at last away and a new day of anxiety and dread had begun because the original regiment had been raised in this district raised in person in fact by one of the glorious blackguards who later became napoleons marshals who delivered the regiment into the emperors own hand and along with it became one of the fiercest stars in that constellation which filled half the sky with its portent and blasted half the earth with its lightning and most of its subsequent replacements had been drawn from this same district so that most of these old men were not only veterans of it in their time and these male children already dedicated to it when their time should come but all these people were parents and kin not only the actual old parents and kin of the doomed men but fathers and mothers and sisters and wives and sweethearts whose sons and brothers and husbands and fathers and lovers might have been among the doomed men except for sheer blind chance and luck even before the bugles echoes died away the warrened purlieus were already disgorging them a french or british or american aviator or a german either for that matter if he had had the temerity and the luck could have watched it best hovel and tenement voiding into lane and alley and nameless culdesac and lane and alley and culdesac compounding into streets as the trickles became streams and the streams became rivers until the whole city seemed to be pouring down the broad boulevards converging like wheelspokes into the place de ville filling the place and then pressed on by the weight of its own converging mass flowing like an unrecoiling wave up to the blank gates of the hôtel where the three sentries of the three coembattled nations flanked the three empty flagstaffs awaiting the three concordant flags they met the first troops here it was a body of garrison cavalry drawn up across the mouth of the wide main boulevard leading from the place to the old gate in what had once been the citys ancient eastern wall already in position and waiting as though the murmur of the floods beginning had preceded it right into the bedroom of the townmajor himself but the crowd paid no attention to the cavalry it just continued to press on into the place slowing and stopping now because of its own massy congested weight merely stirring and shifting constantly and faintly within its own mass while it stared mazed and patient in the rising light at the hôtel door then the sunrise gun crashed from the old citadel above the city the three flags broke simultaneously from nowhere and climbed the three staffs what they broke and climbed and peaked in was still dawn hanging motionless for a moment but when they streamed on the first morning breeze they streamed into sunlight flinging into sunlight the three mutual colorsthe red for courage and pride the white for purity and constancy the blue for honor and truth then the empty boulevard behind the cavalry filled suddenly with sunlight which flung suddenly the tall shadows of the men and the horses outward upon the crowd as though the cavalry were charging it only it was the people advancing on the cavalry the mass made no sound it was almost orderly merely irresistible in the concord of its frail components like a wave in its drops for an instant the cavalrythere was an officer present though a sergeantmajor seemed to be in chargedid nothing then the sergeantmajor shouted it was not a command because the troop did not stir it sounded like nothing whatever in fact unintelligible a thin forlorn cry hanging for a fading instant in the air like one of the faint sourceless musical cries of the high invisible larks now filling the sky above the city his next shout though was a command but it was already too late the crowd had already underswept the military irresistible in that passive and invincible humility carrying its fragile bones and flesh into the iron orbit of the hooves and sabres with an almost inattentive a humbly and passively contemptuous disregard like martyrs entering an arena of lions for another instant the cavalry held and even then it did not break it just began to move in retrograde while still facing forward as though it had been picked up bodilythe whiterolled eyes of the shortheld horses the high small faces of the riders gaped with puny shouting beneath the raised sabres all moving backward like the martial effigies out of a gutted palace or mansion or museum being swept along on the flood which had obliterated to instantaneous rubble the stone crypts of their glorious privacy then the mounted officer freed himself for a moment he alone seemed to be moving because he alone was stationary above the crowd which was now parting and flowing on either side of him then he actually was moving forward breasting the still shortbitted horse ironheld into and through the moving crowd a voice cried once somewhere beneath the horsea child a woman possibly a mans voice eunuchkeened by fear or painas he forced the horse on feinting and dodging the animal through the human river which made no effort to avoid him which accepted the horse as water accepts a thrusting prow then he was gone accelerating now the crowd poured into the boulevard it flung the cavalry aside and poured on blotting the intersecting streets as it passed them as a river in flood blots up its tributary creeks until at last that boulevard too was one dense seething voiceless lake but before that the infantry had already arrived debouching from the place de ville on the crowds rear long before the cavalry officer could have reported to the officer of the day who would have dispatched the orderly who would have summonsed the batman who would have interrupted at his ablutions and shaving the adjutant who would have waked the townmajor in his nightcap who would have telephoned or sent a runner to the infantry commander in the citadel it was a whole battalion armed except for packs emerging from the place de ville in close route column led by a light tank with its visor closed for action which as it advanced parted the crowd like a snowplow thrusting the divided parting back from either curb like the snowplows jumbled masses the infantry deploying into two parallel files behind the advancing tank until at last the whole boulevard from the place to the old gate was clear and empty again between the two thin lines of interlocked bayonetted rifles a slight commotion rose at one point behind the dyke of bayonets but its area was not ten feet and it did not spread and only those near it knew that anything was happening or had happened and when a platoon sergeant stooped under the interlocked rifles and shouldered his way in there was not much to see either only a young woman a girl thin and poorly dressed who had fainted she lay as she had fallen a thin huddle of shabby travelstained garments as if she had come a long distance and mostly on foot or in farm carts lying in the narrow graveshaped space they had made for her to fall in and if such had been her intention die in while those who apparently had made no room for her to stand erect and breathe in stood looking quietly down at her as people will until someone makes the first move the sergeant made it at least pick her up he said savagely get her up out of the street where she wont be trampled a man moved then but as he and the sergeant stooped the woman opened her eyes she even tried to help as the sergeant hauled her to her feet not roughly just impatient at the stupidly complicating ineptitude of civilians at all times particularly at this one now which kept him from his abandoned post who does she belong to he said there was no answer only the quiet attentive faces apparently he had expected none he was already glancing about though he had probably already seen that it would be impossible to get her out of the crowd even if anyone had offered to take charge of her he looked at her again he started to speak again to her this time but stopped himself furious and containeda thick man of forty moustached like a sicilian brigand and wearing the service and campaign ribbons of three continents and two hemispheres on his tunic whose racial stature napoleon had shortened two or three inches a hundred years ago as caesar had shortened that of the italians and hannibal that of the nameless pedimentpieces of his glorya husband and father who should perhaps even could and would have been a custodian of winecasks in the paris halles if he and the paris halles had been cast on some other stage than this he glanced again at the patient faces doesnt anybody shes hungry a voice said all right the sergeant said has anybody but the hand had already extended the bread it was the heel of a loaf soiled and even a little warm from the pocket it had been carried in the sergeant took it but when he offered it to her she refused it quickly glancing quickly about with something like fright in her face her eyes as if she were looking for an avenue of escape the sergeant thrust the bread into her hands here he said harshly with that roughness which was not unkindness but just impatience eat it youll have to stay and look at him too whether you want to or not but she refused again repudiating the bread not the gift of it but the bread itself and not to whoever had offered it but to herself it was as if she were trying to keep her eyes from looking at the bread and knew that she could not even while they watched her she surrendered her eyes her whole body denied her mouths refusal her eyes already devouring the bread before her hand reached to take it snatching it from the sergeant and holding it to her face between both hands as though to hide either the bread from a ravisher or her voracity from those who watched her gnawing at the bread like a species of rodent her eyes darting constantly above the concealing hands not quite furtive not quite secret just anxious watchful and terrifieda quality which glowed and faded and then glowed again like a coal she breathed on but she was all right now and the sergeant had begun to turn away when the same voice spoke again without doubt it belonged to the hand which had tendered the bread though if the sergeant remarked it now he gave no sign but without doubt he did remark now that the face did not belong here at all not now at this time this placenot just in france but in forty kilometres of the western front on this or any wednesday in late may in a man not so young actually but rather simply youthfullooking and this not merely in contrast to the other men among or above rather he was that tall that unblemished whom he stood sound and erect and standing easily in a faded smock and rough trousers and stained shoes like a roadmender or perhaps a plasterer who to be here on this day on this place on the earth must have been a soldier invalided safely and securely and forever out since the fifth day of august almost four years ago now yet who if this was so didnt show it and if the sergeant remarked it or thought it there was only the flicker of his glance to reveal that he had the first time the man spoke he had addressed the sergeant this time the sergeant had no doubt of it but now she has eaten bread the man said with that morsel she should have bought immunity from her anguish not in fact the sergeant had turned away already in motion when the voice the murmur stopped himthe murmur not so much gentle as just quiet not so much tentative as bland and possessing for last of all the qualities innocence so that in the second the instant of pause before he even began to turn back he could see feel all the quiet attentive faces watching not him nor the speaker either but as though looking at something intangible which the mans voice had created in the very air between them then the sergeant saw it too it was the cloth he wore turning and looking back not only at the man who had spoken but at all the faces surrounding him it seemed to him that he was looking out of a sort of weary prolonged omniscient grief and sorrow so long borne and accustomed that now when he happened to remember it it was no longer even regret at the whole human race across the insuperable barrier of the vocation and livelihood to which twenty years ago he had not merely dedicated but relinquished too not just his life but his bones and flesh it seemed to him that the whole ring of quiet attentive faces was stained with a faint ineradicable reflected horizonblue it had always been so only the tint had changedthe drab and white of the desert and the tropics the sharp full redandblue of the old uniform and now the chameleonazure of this present one since three years ago he had expected that not only expected but accepted relinquishing volition and the fear of hunger and decision to the extent of even being paid a few sure sous a day for the privilege and right at no other cost than obedience and the exposure and risk of his tender and brittle bones and flesh of immunity forever for his natural appetites so for twenty years now he had looked at the anonymous denizens of the civilian world from the isolation insulation of that unchallengeable immunity with a sort of contempt as alien intruders rightless on simple sufferance himself and his interknit and interlocked kind in the impregnable fraternity of valor and endurance breasting through it behind the sharp and cleaving prow of their stripe and bars and stars and ribbons like an armored ship or since a year ago now a tank through a shoal of fish but now something had happened looking about at the waiting faces all except the young womans she alone was not watching him the end of the heel of bread still cupped against her chewing face between her slender dirtstained hands so that it was not he alone but the two of them himself and the kinless and nameless girl who seemed to stand in a narrow well of unbreathing it seemed to him with a kind of terror that it was himself who was the alien and not just alien but obsolete that on that day twenty years ago in return for the right and the chance to wear on the battlesoiled breast of his coat the battlegrimed symbolical candystripes of valor and endurance and fidelity and physical anguish and sacrifice he had sold his birthright in the race of man but he did not show it the candystripes themselves were the reason that he could not and his wearing of them the proof that he would not and so he said it was the whole regiment the tall man said dreamily in his murmurous masculine gentle almost musing baritone all of it at zero nobody left the trench except the officers and a few ncos thats right not and so the sergeant said again why didnt the boche attack the tall man said when they saw that we were not coming over that something had happened to the attack the drumfire was all right and the rolling barrage too only when it lifted and the moment came only the section leaders had climbed out of the trench but that the men themselves were not coming they must have seen that not when you have been facing another front only a thousand metres away for four years you can see an attack fail to start and probably why and you cant say it was because of the barrage thats why you get out of the trench in the first place and charge to get out from under somebodys shellingsometimes your own not the sergeant looked only at the tall man he needed to do no more since he could feel the othersthe quiet attentive quietlybreathing faces listening missing nothing a field marshal the sergeant said in a bitter contemptuous voice maybe its time somebody looked into that uniform you are wearing he held out his hand lets have a look at them the tall man looked calmly and peacefully down at him a moment longer then his hand went somewhere under the smock and reappeared and extended the papers folded once stained and soiled and dogeared at the crease the sergeant took and opened them yet even then he did not seem to be looking at the papers his glance instead now flicking rapidly again about the other motionless intent faces while the tall man still looked down at him serene and waiting and then speaking again remote calm almost absently conversational and at noon yesterday our whole front stopped except for token artillery one gun to a battery each ten thousand metres and at fifteen hours the british and the americans stopped too and when it got quiet you could hear the boche doing the same thing so that by sundown yesterday there was no more gunfire in france except the token ones since they had to leave them for a little longer yet since all that silence falling suddenly out of the sky on the human race after going on four years might have destroyed it rapidly and in one motion the sergeant refolded the papers and extended them back toward the man or apparently so since before the man could raise his hand to take them the sergeants hand had grasped the front of his smock gripping as one the crumple of the papers and the wadded mass of the rough cloth jerking though actually it was not the tall man but the sergeant who moved the sergeants brigands face nose to nose with the others his rotting discolored teeth gaped for speech though still empty of it because the other man was still talking in that calm unhurried murmur and now general of division gragnon is bringing the whole lot of them back here to ask the generalissimo to let him shoot them since that much peace and silence falling without warning on the human race not even a field marshal the sergeant said in his furious seething voice an advocate he said in that harsh furious murmur no louder than the other mans had been to which the static attentive faces ringing them about seemed not to listen or even hear anymore than they had listened to or heard the other man while he spoke anymore than the young woman herself did or was still gnawing and tearing steadily at the bread behind her huddled hands but only watching them intent and incurious as deaf people ask the bastards you have come here to look at if they think anybody has quit i know that too the other said i just said so you saw my papers so will the provostmarshals adjutant the sergeant said and flung not the other man but himself away and turned again still clutching the crumpled papers and using his elbows and hands both this time to open his path back to the boulevard then he stopped again suddenly and jerked his head up and as they watched he seemed to raise his whole body in order to look past and above the crowded heads and faces in the direction of the old city gate then they all heard it not only the sergeant already ducking back under the interlocked rifles but even the young woman who even stopped chewing behind her cupped hands to listen too when as one the heads and the packed bodies turned away from her and toward the boulevard not because so light on them had been the impact of her trouble and the spectacle of its alleviation but because of the sound now coming up the boulevard from the old city gate like a wind beginning except for the shouts of the section leaders of the deployed infantry aligning each curb the sound was not voices yet so much as a sigh an exhalation travelling from breast to breast up the boulevard it was as if the nights anxiety quiescent for a time beneath the simple weight of waiting now that the new day was about to reveal the actuality which in darkness had only been a dread was gathering itself to flow over them like the new day itself in one great blinding wave as the first car entered the city it contained the three generals it came fast so fast that the shouts of the section leaders and the clash of rifles as each section presented arms and then clashed back to at ease were not only continuous but overlapping so that the car seemed to progress on one prolonged crash of iron as on invisible wings with steel feathersa long dusty open car painted like a destroyer and flying the pennon of the supreme commander of all the allied armies the three generals sitting side by side in the tonneau amid a rigid glitter of aidesthe three old men who held individual command over each of the three individual armies and the one of that three who by mutual consent and accord held supreme command over all and by that token and right over everything beneath and on and above the distracted halfcontinentthe briton the american and between them the generalissimo the slight gray man with a face wise intelligent and unbelieving who no longer believed in anything but his disillusion and his intelligence and his limitless powerflashing across that terrified and aghast amazement and then gone as the section leaders shouted again and the boots and the rifles crashed back to simple alert the lorries were right behind it they were coming fast too in close order and seemingly without end since this was the whole regiment but still there was no concerted no definite human sound yet not even the crashing ejaculation of salute this time but only the stir the shift of movement in the crowd itself pacing the first lorry in that silence which was still aghast and not quite believing in which the anguish and terror seemed to rise to each lorry as it approached and enclose it as it passed and follow it as it sped on broken only now and then when someonea womancried out at one of the passing facesa face which because of the lorrys speed had already passed and vanished before recognition became a fact and the roar of the next lorry had already drowned it before the recognition became a cry so that the lorries seemed to be travelling even faster than the car as though the car with half a continent supine before its bonnet possessed the gift of leisure where the lorries whose destination could be computed in seconds now had only the spur of shame they were open with high slatted sides as though for the transportation of cattle packed like cattle with standing men bareheaded disarmed stained from the front lines with something desperate and defiant in the unshaven and sleepless faces which glared down at the crowd as if they had never seen human beings before or could not see these now or at least could not recognise them as human beings they were like the faces of sleepwalkers looking backward across nightmares recognising no one and no familiar things glaring down across the fleeing irrevocable instant as if they were being hurried to execution itself flashing on rapid and successive and curiously identical not despite the fact that each had an individuality and a name but because of it identical not because of an identical doom but because each carried into that mutual doom a name and an individuality and that most complete privacy of all the capacity for that solitude in which every man has to dieflashing on as if they had no part nor interest in and were not even aware of the violence and speed with which or in which they rigidly moved like phantoms or apparitions or perhaps figures cut without depth from tin or cardboard and snatched in violent repetition across a stage set for a pantomime of anguish and fatality and now there was a concerted sound a faint yelling beginning somewhere in the place de ville which the first lorry would be reaching about now it was high thin with distance prolonged not vindictive but defiant with at the same time a curiously impersonal quality as if the men it came from were not making producing it but merely passing through it as through a sudden noisy though harmless burst of spring rain it came in fact from the hôtel de ville which the first lorries were now passing where the three sentries now stood at attention beneath the three flags hanging windless now in the following stillness of the dawn breeze and where on the stone steps before the door the old generalissimo the other two generals having followed him out of the halted car had now stopped and turned the two lesser generals stopping and turning with him both on a step higher than his and so taller than he both as gray as he both slightly behind him though not behind each other while the first lorry passed and the hatless dishevelled somnambulistic men in it waked perhaps at sight of the three flags or perhaps by the simple isolation of the three old men after the crowded boulevard but waking anyway and in that same instant divining identifying the three gaudy panoplied old men not merely by their juxtaposition to the three flags but by their isolation like that of three plague carriers in the empty center of an aghast and fleeing city or perhaps the three survivors of a city swept by plague immune and impervious gaudy and panoplied and seemingly as harmless in time as a photograph posed and fading since these fifty or sixty yearsbutthe men in the lorriesanyway waking as one man and as one man yelling shaking their clenched hands down at the three impassive figures the yelling passing from lorry to lorry as each entered the yelling and sped on until the last one seemed to trail behind it a cloud of doomed and forlorn repudiation filled with gaped faces and threatening fists like the fading cloud of its own dust it was like dust still hanging in the air long after the objectthe motion the friction the body the momentum speedwhich had produced it was gone and vanished because the whole boulevard was filled with yelling now not defiant now but just amazed and incredulous the two backflung parallel banks of massed bodies and wan faces now gaped and frantic with adjuration because there was still one more lorry it came fast too although there were two hundred yards between it and the last one preceding it this one seemed to be travelling twice as fast as the others just as the others had seemed to be travelling twice as fast as the pennoned car containing the three generals yet it seemed to move in complete silence there was something almost furtive about it where the others had seemed to pass noisily violently almost in a kind of defiant valedictory of shame and despair this one came and was gone with a sort of noiseless celeritous effacement as if the men who drove it abhorred not its destination at all but rather its contents it was open like the others indistinguishable from the others except by its cargo because where the others had been packed with standing men this one carried only thirteen they were hatless and dirty and battlestained too but they were manacled chained to one another and to the lorry itself like wild beasts so that at first glance they looked not merely like foreigners but like creatures of another race another species alien bizarre and strange even though they wore on their collartabs the same regimental numerals to the rest of the regiment which had not only preceded them by that reduceless gap but which had even seemed to be fleeing from them not only by their chains and isolation but by their very expressions and attitudes too where the faces in the other fleeing lorries had been dazed and spent like those of men too long under ether the faces of these thirteen were merely grave attentive watchful then you saw that four of the thirteen were really foreigners alien not only by their gyves and isolation to the rest of the regiment but against the whole panorama of city and soil across which the lorry was rushing themthe faces of four mountain men in a country which had no mountains of peasants in a land which no longer had a peasantry alien even among the other nine among whom they were chained and shackled since where the other nine were grave and watchful and a littlenot too muchconcerned three of the four who were not frenchmen were merely a little puzzled alert too almost decorous curious and interested the mountain peasants whom they resembled entering for the first time a strange valley markettown say men overtaken suddenly by an uproar in a tongue which they had no hope of comprehending and indeed not much interest in and therefore no concern in its significancethree of the four who were not frenchmen that is because now the crowd itself had discerned that the fourth one was alien still somehow even to the other three if only in being the sole object of its vituperation and terror and fury because it was toagainstthis one man that the crowd was raising its voices and its clenched hands having barely glanced at the other twelve he stood near the front his hands resting quietly on the top rail so that the loop of chain between his wrists and the corporals stripes on his sleeve were both visible with an alien face like all the other twelve a mountain peasants face like the last three a little younger than several of them looking down at the fleeing sea of eyes and gaped mouths and fists with the same watchfulness as the other twelve but with neither the bafflement nor the concerna face merely interested attentive and calm with something else in it which none of the others had a comprehension understanding utterly free of compassion as if he had already anticipated without censure or pity the uproar which rose and paced and followed the lorry as it sped on it crossed in its turn the place de ville where the three generals still stood like a posed camera group on the steps of the hôtel perhaps this time it was the simple juxtaposition of the three flags which were just beginning to stir in the reversed day wind since certainly none of the other three who were not frenchmen and possibly none of the whole twelve seemed to remark the significance of the three dissimilar banners nor even to see the three starred and braided old men standing beneath them it was only the thirteenth man who seemed to notice see remark only the gaze of the corporal in passing as he and the old supreme general whom no man in any of the other lorries could say had ever looked definitely at any one of them stared full at one another across the moment which could not last because of the vehicles speedthe peasants face above the corporals chevrons and the shackled wrists in the speeding lorry and the gray inscrutable face above the stars of supreme rank and the bright ribbons of honor and glory on the hôtel steps looking at one another across the fleeing instant then the lorry was gone the old generalissimo turned his two confreres turning with him flanking him in rigid protocol the three sentries clashed and stamped to present arms as the limber and glittering young aide sprang and opened the door this time the commotion went almost unnoticed not only because of the yelling and uproar but because the crowd itself was moving now it was the young woman again the one who had fainted she was still gnawing at the bread when the last lorry came up then she ceased and those nearest remembered later that she moved cried out and tried to run to break through the crowd and into the street as if to intercept or overtake the lorry but by that time they were all moving toward the street even those at whose backs she was clawing and scrabbling and at whose faces she was trying to cry say something through the mass of chewed bread in her mouth so they stopped remembering her at all and there remained only the man who had given her the bread upon whose chest she was still hammering with the hand which still clutched the fragment of the morsel while she tried to cry something at him through the wet mass in her mouth then she began to spit the chewed bread at him not deliberately intentionally but because there was not time to turn her head aside and void her mouth for speech already screaming something at him through the spew and spray of mastication but the man was already running too wiping his face on his sleeve vanishing into the crowd as it burst at last through the interlocked rifles and poured into the street still clutching what remained of the bread she ran too for a while she even kept up with them running and darting between and among them with an urgency apparently even greater than theirs as the whole mass of them poured up the boulevard after the fleeing lorries but presently the ones she had passed began to overtake her in turn and pass her soon she was running in a fading remnant of dispersal panting and stumbling seeming to run now in spent and frantic retrograde to the whole citys motion the whole worlds so that when she reached the place de ville at last and stopped all mankind seemed to have drained away and vanished bequeathing relicting to her the broad oncemore empty boulevard and the place and even for that moment the city and the earth itselfa slight woman not much more than a girl who had been pretty once and could be again with sleep and something to eat and a little warm water and soap and a comb and whatever it was out of her eyes standing in the empty place wringing her hands monday monday night when the attack was first offered him the general commanding the division which contained the regiment said immediately of course thanks what is it because it seemed to him that here at last was the chance which he had needed and wanted for more years than he cared to remember so many years in fact that he had as he realised now given up hope of ever getting because at some moment in his past which even he could not specifically postulate something had happened to him or at least to his career it seemed to him that he had been intended by fate itself to be the perfect soldier pastless unhampered and complete his first recollection had been a pyrenean orphanage run by a catholic sisterhood where there was no record of his parentage whatever even to be concealed at seventeen he was an enlisted private at twentyfour he had been three years a sergeant and of such destined promise that his regimental commander himself a selfmade man who had risen from the ranks gave no one any rest until the protégé also had his chance for officers school by he had established a splendid record as a desert colonel of spahis and immediately in france itself the beginning of an unimpeachable one as a brigadier so that to those who believed in him and watched his career he had no influence either and no friends too save those like the obscure colonel of his sergeantcy whom he had made earned himself by his own efforts and record there seemed no limit to his destiny save the premature end of the war itself then something happened not to him he had not changed he was still competent still unhampered and complete he seemed merely to have lost or mislaid somewhere at some point the old habit or mantle or aura or affinity for of almost monotonous success in which he had seemed to move as in his garments as if not he but his destiny had slowed down not changed just slowed down for the time being which idea his superiors themselves seemed to hold since he got in due time in fact a little sooner than some the next star for his hat and not only the division which went with it but the opportunities too indicating that his superiors still believed that at any moment now he might recover or rediscover the secret of the old successfulness but that was two years ago now and for a year now even the opportunities had ceased as though at last even the superiors had come around to his own belief that the high tide of his hopes and aspirations had fluxed three years ago three years before the last backwash of his destiny finally ebbed from beneath him leaving him stranded a mere general of division still in a war already three years defunctive itthe warwould hang on a while yet of course it would take the americans the innocent newcomers another year probably to discover that you cannot really whip germans you can only exhaust them it might even last another ten years or even another twenty by which time france and britain would have vanished as military and even political integers and the war would have become a matter of a handful of americans who didnt even have ships to go back home in battling with limbs from shattered trees and the rafters from ruined houses and the stones from fences of weedchoked fields and the broken bayonets and stocks of rotted guns and rusted fragments wrenched from crashed aeroplanes and burned tanks against the skeletons of german companies stiffened by a few frenchmen and britons tough enough like himself to endure still to endure as he would always immune to nationality to exhaustion even to victoryby which time he hoped he himself would be dead because by ordinary he believed himself incapable of hoping only of daring without fear or qualm or regret within the iron and simple framework of the destiny which he believed would never betray him so long as he continued to dare without question or qualm or regret but which apparently had abandoned him leaving him only the capacity to dare until two days ago when his corps commander sent for him the corps commander was his only friend in france or anywhere else above earth for that matter they had been subalterns together in the same regiment into which he had been commissioned but lallemont though a poor man too had along with ability just enough of the sort of connections which not only made the difference between division and corps command at the same length of service but placed lallemont quite favorably for the next vacant army command though when lallemont said ive something for you if you want it he realised that what he had thought was the capacity to dare was still soiled just a little with the baseless hoping which is the diet of weaklings but that was all right too who even though apparently abandoned by destiny still had not been wrong in dedicating his life as he had even though abandoned he had never let his chosen vocation down and sure enough in his need the vocation had remembered him so he said thanks what lallemont told him whereupon for a moment he believed that he had not understood but this passed because in the next one he saw the whole picture the attack was already doomed in its embryo and whoever commanded it delivered it along with it it was not that his trained professional judgment told him that the affair as the corps commander presented it would be touchandgo and hence more than doubtful that would not have stopped him on the contrary that would have been a challenge as if the old destiny had not abandoned him at all it was because that same trained judgment saw at once that this particular attack was intended to fail a sacrifice already planned and doomed in some vaster scheme in which it would not matter either way whether the attack failed or not only that the attack must be made and more than that since here the whole long twentyodd years of training and dedication paid him off in clairvoyance he saw the thing not only from its front and public view but from behind it too the cheapest attack would be one which must fail harmlessly to all if delivered by a man who had neither friends nor influence to make people with five stars on the general staff or civilians with red rosettes in the quai dorsay squirm he didnt for even one second think of the old gray man in the hôtel de ville at chaulnesmont he thought for even less time than that lallemont is saving his own neck he thoughtand now he knew that he was indeed lostits mama bidet but he only said i cant afford a failure there will be a ribbon the corps commander said i dont have enough rank to get the one they give for failures yes the corps commander said this time so its that bad the division commander said that serious that urgent all between bidet and his baton is one infantry division and that one mine they stared at one another then the corps commander started to speak the division commander didnt permit him to stow it the division commander said that is thats what he conveyed what he spoke was a phrase pithy succinct and obscene out of his life as an nco in the african regiment recruited from the prison and guttersweepings of europe before he and the corps commander had ever seen one another he said so i have no choice you have no choice the corps commander said the division commander always watched his attacks from the nearest forward observers post it had been his habit always that was a part of his record too this time he had one especially prepared on an elevation revetted and sandbagged behind a steel plate with one telephone line direct to corps headquarters and another to the artillery commander here synchronised watch in hand while the preliminary barrage wailed and screeched overhead onto the german wire he looked down upon his own front line and on the opposite one which even those who had assigned him the attack didnt intend to breach as from a balcony seat at the opera or box seat and not just any box but the royal one the victim by regal dispensation watching in solitary splendor the preparations for his execution watching not the operas final scene but his own before he moved irrevocable and forever into some backarea job in that region whose function was to arm and equip the combat divisions who reaped the glorious death and the immortal renown from now on his to reap every hope save glory and every right save the chance to die for it he could desert of course but where to whom the only people who would accept a failed french general would be people so far free of the war the dutch who were off the normal course of german invasions and the spanish who were too poor even to make a twoday excursion to it like the portuguese did for excitement and change of scenein which casethe spanish onehe would not even be paid for risking his life and what remained of his reputation until he corrected that thinking how war and drink are the two things man is never too poor to buy his wife and children may be shoeless someone will always buy him drink or weapons thinking more than that the last person a man planning to set up in the wine trade would approach for a loan would be a rival winedealer a nation preparing for war can borrow from the very nation it aims to destroy then he didnt even have a failure he had a mutiny when the barrage lifted he was not even watching the scene beneath him but was already looking at his watchface he didnt need to watch after watching them from beneath his stars for three years now he had become an expert not merely in forecasting failure but in predicting almost exactly when where at what point in time and terrain they would become void and harmlessthis even when he was not familiar with the troops making the attack which in the present case he was having selected this particular regiment the day before because he knew on the one hand not only the condition of the regiment but its colonels belief in it and the record of his success with it and on the other its value as measured against each of the other three in the division he knew it would deliver the attack near enough to the maximum demanded of him yet if the foreordained failure meant its temporary wreckage or even permanent ruin this would weigh less in the strength and morale of the division than that of any of the other three he could never breathing have been convinced or even told that he had chosen the regiment out of his division exactly as the group commander had chosen the division out of his armies so he simply followed the jerking watchhand waiting for it to establish the point when all the men who were to get through the wire would be beyond it then he looked up and saw nothing nothing at all in the space beyond the wire which by now should have been filled with running and falling men he saw only a few figures crouching along his own parapet not advancing at all but apparently yelling screaming and gesticulating downward into the trenchthe officers and ncos the company and section leaders who obviously had been betrayed as he had been because he knew at once what had happened he was quite calm he thought without passion or even astonishment so this was reserved for me too as he dropped the binocular back into its case on his chest and snapped the cover down and spoke to the aide beside him indicating the line to corps headquarters say that the attack failed to leave the trench tell them to ratify me to artillery say im on my way out now and took the other telephone himself and spoke down it gragnon i want two barrages rerange one on the enemy wire range the other on the communication trenches behind the th regiment and continue until you have a remand from corps and put the telephone down and turned toward the exit sir the aide at the other telephone cried heres general lallemont himself but the division commander didnt even pause not until the tunnel broached at last into light and then only long enough to listen for a moment to the screeching crescendo of shells overhead listening with a sort of impersonal detached attentiveness as if he were a messenger a runner sent there to ascertain whether or not the guns were still firing and to return and report it had been twenty years now the first scrap of braid not even tarnished on his sleeve since he had accepted established as the first stone in the edifice of his career a commander must be so hated or at least feared by his troops that immunised by that fury they will attempt any odds any time anywhere he stood not stopped just paused his face lifted too like the runner taking that simple precaution against the possibility that those to whom he would report might demand the authority of his eyes too or order him to walk the whole distance back again to rectify the oversight thinking except that i didnt intend that they should hate me so much they would refuse to attack at all because i didnt think then that a commander could be hated that much apparently didnt know even this morning that soldiers could hate that much being soldiers thinking quietly of course countermand the barrage stop it let them come over the whole thing will be obliterated then effaced and i need only say that they were ready for me before my attack ever started with none to refute me since those who could will no longer be alive thinking with what he considered not even sardonicism nor even wittiness but just humor with a regiment which has already mutinied holding the line they will overrun and destroy the whole division in ten or fifteen minutes then even those who are giving him the baton will appreciate the value of their giftalready walking again on for another thousand metres almost to the end of the communication trench where his car would be waiting and this time he did stop utterly he didnt know how long it had been going on nor even how long he had been hearing it no puny concentration now of guns behind one single regimental front it seemed to him that he could hear the fury spreading battery to battery in both directions along the whole front until every piece in the entire sector must be in frantic action they did come over he thought they did the whole line has collapsed not just one mutinied regiment but the whole line of us already turned to run back up the trench before he could catch himself telling himself its too late you cant get back in time nowcatching himself back into sanity or at least into trained military logic and reason even if he did have to use what he thought was humor and this time called wittiness too the wit perhaps of despair in order to do it nonsense what reasoncould they have had for an assault at this moment how could the boche have known even before i did that one of my regiments was going to mutiny and even if they did know it how could they afford to give bidet his german marshalcy at the rate of just one regiment at a timewalking on again saying quietly aloud this time thats the clatter a falling general makes two field howitzers were firing almost over his waiting car they had not been there at dawn when he left it and his driver could not have heard him if he had spoken which he did not one peremptory gesture as he got in sitting rigid and calm and parallel now for a while to the pandemonium of guns stretching further than hearing did still quite calm when he got out of the car at corps headquarters not even seeing at first that the corps commander was already waiting for him at the door then reversing in midstride and returning to the car still striding rigidly on when the corps commander overtook him and put one hand on his arm and began to draw him aside toward where the corps car waited the corps commander spoke the army commanders name hes waiting for us he said and then bidet the division commander said i want authority from bidets own lips to shoot them in with you the corps commander said touching him again almost shoving him into the car then following closing the door himself the car already in motion so that the orderly had to leap for the running board soon they were running fast too beside beneath the horizons loud parallel the division commander rigid erect immobile staring ahead while the corps commander leaning back watched him or what was visible of the calm and invincible face and suppose he refuses the corps commander said i hope he does the division commander said all i ask is to be sent under arrest to chaulnesmont listen to me the corps commander said cant you see that it will not matter to bidet whether it failed or not or how it failed or even whether it was made or not that he will get his baton just the same anyway even if the boche destroys us destroys us the corps commander said listen he jerked his hand toward the east where fast though they were moving the division commander might have realised now that the uproar still reached further and faster than hearing moved the boche doesnt want to destroy us any more than we would want could afford to destroy him cant you understand either of us without the other couldnt exist that even if nobody was left in france to confer bidets baton some boche would be selected even if there remained only one private and elevated high enough in french rank to do it that bidet didnt choose you for this because you were charles gragnon but because you were general of division gragnon at this time this day this hour us the division commander repeated us the corps commander said so i failed not in a front line at six this morning but the day before yesterday in your headquartersor maybe ten years ago or maybe fortyseven years ago you did not fail at all the corps commander said i lost a whole regiment and not even by an attack by a provost marshals machinegun squad does it matter how they will die it does to me how it dies is the reason it died thats my record bah the corps commander said since what i lost was merely charles gragnon while what i saved was france you saved us the corps commander said us the division commander repeated again us the corps commander said in that voice harsh and strong with pride the lieutenants the captains the majors and colonels and sergeants all with the same privilege the opportunity to lie someday in the casket of a general or a marshal among the flags of our nations glory in the palace of the invalides except that the americans and british and germans dont call theirs invalides all right all right the corps commander said merely in return for fidelity and devotion and accepting a little risk gambling a petty stake which lacking glory was no better than any vegetables to begin with and deserved no less of obscurity for its fate failed he said failed charles gragnon from sergeant to general of division before he was fortyfive years oldthat is fortyseven and then lost so did the british lieutenant general who commanded that army in picardy two months ago and whatever boche it was who lost contact or mislaid his maps and compass in belgium three years ago the division commander said and the one who thought they could come through at verdun and the one who thought the chemin des dames would be vulnerable having a female name he said so its not we who conquer each other because we are not even fighting each other its simple nameless war which decimates our ranks all of us captains and colonels british and american and german and us shoulder to shoulder our backs to the long invincible wall of our glorious tradition giving and asking asking not even accepting quarter bah the corps commander said again it is man who is our enemy the vast seething moiling spiritless mass of him once to each period of his inglorious history one of us appears with the stature of a giant suddenly and without warning in the middle of a nation as a dairymaid enters a buttery and with his sword for paddle he heaps and pounds and stiffens the malleable mass and even holds it cohered and purposeful for a time but never for always nor even for very long sometimes before he can even turn his back it has relinquished discohered faster and faster flowing and seeking back to its own base anonymity like that out there this morning again the corps commander made the brief indicative gesture like what out there the division commander said whereupon the corps commander said almost exactly what the group commander would say within the next hour it cannot be that you dont even know what happened i lost charles gragnon bah the corps commander said we have lost nothing we were merely faced without warning by an occupational hazard we hauled them up out of their ignominious mud by their bootstraps in one more little instant they might have changed the worlds face but they never do they collapse as yours did this morning they always will but not us we will even drag them willynilly up again in time and they will collapse again but not us it wont be us the army commander was waiting too the car had barely to stop for him as soon as it was in motion again the division commander made for the second time his request in the flat calm almost dispassionate voice i shall shoot them of course the army commander didnt answer the division commander had not expected him to he would not have heard any answer because he was not even listening to the other two voices murmuring to one another in brief rapid halffinished phrases as the corps commander briefed reviewed to the army commander by number and designation the regiments in the other divisions on either flank of his own until the two voices had locked block into regimental block the long mosaic of the whole army front andnot only no sound of guns here but never at any timethey were challenged at the chateau gates and entered the park a guide on the running board now so that they didnt even pause at the carved rococo entrance but went on around to the side across a courtyard bustling with orderlies and couriers and popping motorcycles passingand the division commander neither noticed nor cared here eithertwo cars flying the pennons of two other army commanders and a third car which was british and a fourth one which had not even been manufactured on this side of the atlantic and on to a porte cochere at the back of the chateau and so directly into the shabby cluttered cubicle not much larger than a clothes press notched into the chateaus italianate bijou like a rusted spur in a brides cake from which the group commander conducted the affairs of his armies they were all there the commanders of the two other armies which composed the group of armies their heavy moustaches already shaped to noons spoon richly luxuriant from the daily ritual of soup the english chief of staff who could have looked no more indomitably and rigidly youthful if the corset had been laced in full view on the outside of his tunic with his bright ribbons and wisps of brass and scarlet tabs and his white hair and moustache and his blue eyes the color of icy war and the american colonel with the face of a boston shipping magnate which indeed he was or at least the entailed scion of oneor rather an eighteenth century face the face of that predecessor or forefather who at twentyfive had retired rich from the quarter deck of a middle passage slaver and at thirty had his name illuminated in colored glass above his beacon hill pew he was the guest the privileged since for three years it had not even been his nations war who had brought already into the conclave the privileged guests air of prim faintly spinsterish disapprovalan air quality appearance too almost victorian in fact from his comfortable old mans shoes and the simple leather putties of a northumberland drover bothshoes and puttiesbeautifully polished but obviously purchased at different times and places and so never to match in color and neither matching the ordnance belt which obviously had been acquired in two places also making four different tones of leather and the simple flareless breeches cut from the same bolt as the shorttailed jacket rising unblemished by any brass to the highboned throat with its prim piping of linen collar backside foremost like the dogcollar of a priest there was an anecdote about that uniform or rather about its wearer the colonel going the rounds of messes six months ago about how shortly after the american headquarters had been set up a junior officerno bostonian this a new yorkerhad appeared before the colonel one morning in the bedford cords of a british officer and a long skirted tunic cut by a london tailor though it did have the high closed throat the colonel would meet many duplicates of it later but not then because that was the youth appearing a little sheepishly probably a little fearfully wishing perhaps as many another pioneer has done that he had let someone else be first before the cold bankers eyes of his superior saying presently you think i shouldnt have done it its bad form taste aping then the colonel pleasant immediate why not they taught us the art of war in by losing one to us they should not object to lending us the clothes in to win one for them and cynosure of all the mama bidet the general cabinet the marshal daisance of the division commanders calm and icelike implacability not for justice for himself but for vindication of his military record whothe group commanderhad brought twentyfive years ago into the african sunglare not a bent for war that would reveal later and not even a simple normal thirst for glory and rank but a cold pitiless preoccupation with the mucous membrane buttoned inside his army breeches which accompanied even preceded him from troop to squadron to regiment to brigade division and corps and army and army group as he advanced and rose more immune to harm as his stars increased in number and his gift for war found field and scope but no more pitilessthe short healthy potbellied little man who looked like a green grocer retired happy and cheerful at fifty and then ten years later dressed not too willingly for a masquerade in the illfitting privates tunic without a single ribbon on it nor even any insigne of rank whose real name had been an authority for fifteen years among textbook soldiers on how to keep troops fit and a byword for four years among field commanders on how to fight them he didnt ask the division commander to sit down when the army and corpscommanders did as far as the division commander could have affirmed the group commander had not even remarked his presence leaving him to stand while that unbidden and uncaring part of his attention recorded the tedious recapitulation of regiments and divisions not merely by their positions in the front but by their past records and the districts of their derivation and their officers names and records the army commander talking rapid and succinct nothing still of alarm in the voice and not very much of concern just alertness precision care nor did it seem to the division commander watchingor not specifically watching the group commander because he was not really watching anything just looking steadily at or toward the group commander as he had been doing ever since he entered aware suddenly that he not only could not remember when he had blinked his eyes last but that he felt no need to blink themthat the group commander was listening either though he must have been quietly and courteously and inattentively until suddenly the division commander realised that the group commander had been looking at him for several seconds then the others seemed to become aware of it too the army commander stopped talking then said this is gragnon it was his division ah yes the group commander said he spoke directly to the division commander in the same tone pleasant and inflectionless many thanks you may return to your troops and turned again to the army commander yes then for another half minute the army commanders voice and now the division commander rigid and unblinking was looking at nothing at all rigid and unblinking still until the army commanders voice stopped again the division commander not even bothering to bring vision back behind his eyes even after the group commander spoke to him again yes standing not quite at attention looking not at anything but merely staring at rigid eyelevel above the group commanders head the division commander made his formal request for permission to have the whole regiment executed the group commander heard him through there was nothing whatever in the group commanders face endorsed as received he said return to your troops the division commander did not move he might not have heard even the group commander sat back in his chair and spoke to the army commander without even turning his head henri will you conduct these gentlemen to the little drawing room and have them bring wine whisky tea whatever they fancy he said to the american colonel in quite passable english i have heard of your united states coca cola my regrets and apologies that i do not have that for you yet but soon we hope eh thank you general the colonel said in better than passable french the only european terms we decline to accept are german ones then they were gone the door closed behind them the division commander had not moved the group commander looked at him his voice was still merely pleasant not even quizzical a general of division you have come a long way from africa sergeant gragnon so have you the division commander said mama bidetspeaking in his cold flat voice with no inflection nor emphasis either the name given not secretly so much as merely when he was out of earshot or perhaps not even that but simply from the inviolable security of their rankless state by the men in ranks to the group commander soon after he came out as a subaltern into the african regiment in which the division commander was already a sergeant a long way monsieur the general cabinet monsieur soontobe the marshal daisance and still nothing in the group commanders face his voice was still calm yet there now crept into it a shadow of something else something speculative and even a little astonished though the division commander would prove that he at least had not remarked it then the group commander said i seem to have been more right than even i knew or hoped when you came in i felt that perhaps i owed you an apology now i am sure of it you demean yourself the division commander said how could a man doubting his own infallibility get that many stars and how could a man with that many stars retain any doubts about anything the group commander looked at the division commander for another moment then he said it cant be possible that you dont even see that it has already ceased to matter whether these three thousand men or these four men die or not that there is already more to this than the execution of twice three thousand men could remedy or even change speak for yourself the division commander said i have seen ten times three thousand dead frenchmen he said you will say slain by other frenchmen he said repeated rotelike cold unemphasised almost telegraphic comité des forges de ferrovie spad the people at billancourt not to mention the english and americans since they are not french at least not until they have conquered us what will it matter to the three thousand or the ten times three thousand when they are dead nor matter to us who killed them if we are successful by successful you mean victorious the group commander said and by we of course you mean france in his flat cold voice the division commander repeated the simple explicit soldierly expletive of the cambronne legend a fact but not a rejoinder the group commander said the division commander said the word again for me a ribbon tomorrow for you a baton before you die since mine is worth only a regiment yours will certainly be cheap at that presently the group commander said what you are really asking me for is to endorse you for a courtmartial youre offering me the choice between sending you to the commanderinchief and compelling you to go yourself the division commander did not move he was not going to they both knew it return to your headquarters the group commander said you will be notified there when the marshal will see you at chaulnesmont he returned to corps headquarters with the corps commander and got his own car he would probably not even remember that the corps commander did not ask him to lunch he would not have cared he would have declined anyway the group commander had told him to return to his own headquarters an order he was probably not even aware that he was disobeying it getting into his car and saying briefly to the driver the line though it would be too late it was nearing two oclock the regiment would long since have been evacuated and disarmed and replaced it would be too late to watch it pass now and so see for himself that it was done just as he had paused in the communication trench to make sure that the artillery was still firing he was going back as a chef might return two or three hours afterward to the kitchen where a dish he had been preparing had burned or perhaps exploded not to help nor even advise in tidying up but merely to see what might remain with some of the litter removed not to regret it because that would be a waste of regret but just to see to check not even thinking about it not thinking about anything immobile and calm in the moving car carrying inside him like a liquid sealed in a vacuum bottle that cold inflexible undeviable determination for justice to his rank at any cost vindication of his record at all so at first he did not realise what had startled shocked him he said sharply stop and sat in the halted car in the ringing silence which he hadnt even heard yet because he had never heard anything here before but guns no longer a starred solitary man in a staff car behind a french battlefront but a solitary boy lying on his stomach on a stone wall outside the pyrenean village where for all any records stated or knowledge remembered he had been born an orphan listening now to the same cicada chirring and buzzing in a tangle of corditeblasted weeds beyond the escarpment landmarked since last winter by the skeleton tail of a crashed german aeroplane then he heard the lark too high and invisible almost liquid but not quite like four small gold coins dropped without haste into a cup of soft silver he and the driver staring at one another until he said loud and harsh drive onmoving on again and sure enough there was the lark again incredible and serene and then again the unbearable golden silence so that he wanted to clap his hands to his ears bury his head until at last the lark once more relieved it though the two batteries at the camouflaged corner were not firing now they were not only still there but a section of heavy howitzers was flanked on them the gunners watching him quietly as he approached chopstriding bullchested virile in appearance impervious and indestructible starred and exalted and within this particular eyerange of earth supreme and omnipotent still yet who because of those very stars didnt dare ask whoever was senior here when he had ceased to fire let alone where his orders to do so had come from thinking how he had heard all his military life about the ineradicable mark which war left on a mans face without ever having seen it himself but at least he had seen now what peace did to mens faces because he knew now that the silence extended much further than one divisional front or even than the two flanking ones knowing now what the corps commander and the group commander both had meant when they had said in almost the same words it cannot be that you dont even know what is happening thinking i am not even to have a courtmartial for incompetence now that the war is over they wont have to allow me a court because nobody will care any longer nobody compelled by simple military regulations to see that my record receives justice who commands here he said but before the captain could answer a major appeared from beyond the guns gragnon here the division commander said youre standing to of course yes general the major said that was the order which came up with the remand what is it general whats happeningsaying the last of it to the division commanders back because he had already turned striding on rigidly erect and only a little blind then a battery did fire two kilometres and perhaps more to the south a salvo a ragged thud and chopstriding unhurried burly and virile and indestructible there occurred inside him a burst a givingaway a flow of something which if he had still been the unfathered unmothered boy secure in the privacy of his abandoned pyrenean wall would have been tears no more visible then than now no more then than now of grief but of inflexibility then another battery fired one salvo less than a kilometre away this time the division commander not faltering merely altering direction in midstride and instead of entering the communication trench he rapidly climbed the escarpment into the pocked field beyond it not running still but walking so fast that he was a considerable distance away when the next battery fired this time one of those he had just left firing its salvo in its turn as if whoever had created the silence were underlining it calling mens attention to it with the measured meaningless slams saying with each burst of puny uproar hear it hear it his first brigades headquarters was the cellar of a ruined farm there were several people there but he was not inside long enough to have recognised any of them even if he had wanted to or tried almost immediately he was outside again wrenching his arm from the hand of the aide who had been with him in the observation post when the attack failed but he did take the flask the brandy insentient as stale water in his throat slightly warm from the aides bodyheat tasteless because here at last was one of the rare moments in the solitude and pride of command when he could be general gragnon without being general of division gragnon too what he said come the aide said rapidly but the division commander jerked his arm from the aides hand again not following but preceding the aide for a short distance into the farmyard then stopping and turning now he said they didnt even tell you the aide said he didnt answer immobile bulllike and indestructible and bulllike and indestructible quite calm the aide told him they are stopping it our whole fronti dont mean just our division and corps but the whole french frontremanded at noon except for air patrols and artillery like that yonder at the corner and the air people are not crossing just patrolling up and down our front and the orders to the artillery were to range not on the boche but between us and them on what the americans call nomans land and the boche is doing the same thing with his artillery and air and the order is out for the british and americans to remand at fifteen hours to see if the boche will do the same thing in front of them the division commander stared at him its not just our division its all of them us and the boche too then the aide saw that even now the division commander did not understand its the men the aide said the ranks not just that regiment nor even our division but all the private soldiers in our whole front the boche too since he remanded too as soon as our barrage lifted which would have been his chance to attack since he must have seen that our regiment had refused mutinied he went further than we have because he is not even using artillery only his air people not crossing either just patrolling up and down his front though of course they wont know for sure about the british and the americans and the boche in front of them until fifteen hours its the men not even the sergeants knew suspected anything had any warning and nobody knows if they just happened to set a date in advance which coincided with our attack or if they had a prearranged signal which our regiment put up when it knew for certain that it was going over this morning you lie the division commander said the men yes everybody in the line below sergeant you lie the division commander said he said with a vast a spent an indomitable patience cant you understand cant you see the difference between a single regiment getting the wind upa thing which can and might happen to any regiment at any time to the same regiment which took a trench yesterday and which tomorrow simply because it turned tail today will take a village or even a walled town and you try to tell me this using again the succinct soldierly noun the men he said officersmarshals and generalsdecreed that business this morning and decreed it as a preordained failure staff officers and experts made the plans for it within the specifications of failure i supplied the failure with a mutinying regiment and still more officers and generals and marshals will collect the cost of it out of my reputation but the men i have led them in battle all my life i was always under the same fire they were under i got them killed yes but i was there too leading them right up to the day when they gave me so many stars that they could forbid me to anymore but not the men they understand even if you cannot even that regiment would have understood they knew the risk they took when they refused to leave the trench risk certainty because i could have done nothing else not for my reputation not even for my own record or the record of the division i command but for the future safety of the men the rank and file of all the other regiments and divisions whose lives might be thrown away tomorrow or next year by another regiment shirking revolting refusing that i was going to have them executed thinking was im already saying was not is was while the aide stared at him in incredulous amazement is it possible the aide said do you really contend that they are stopping the war just to deprive you of your right as commander of the division to execute that regiment not my reputation the division commander said quickly not even my own record but the divisions record and good name what else could it be what other reason could they have blinking rapidly and painfully while the aide took the flask from his pocket and uncapped it and nudged it against the division commanders hand the men the division commander said here the aide said the division commander took the flask thanks he said he even started to raise the flask to his lips the men he said the troops all of them defying revolting not against the enemy but against us the officers who not only went where they went but led them went first in front who desired for them nothing but glory demanded of them nothing but courage drink general the aide said come now ah yes the division commander said he drank and returned the flask he said thanks and made a motion but before he could complete it the aide who had been in his military family since he got his first brigadiers star had already produced a handkerchief immaculate and laundered still folded as the iron pressed it thanks the division commander said again taking the handkerchief and wiping his moustache and then stood again the handerchief open now in his hand blinking rapidly and painfully then he said simply and distinctly enough of this general the aide said eh what the division commander said then he was blinking again steadily though not painfully now not really fast well he said he turned shall i come too the aide said no no the division commander said already walking on you stay here they may need you there might be something else his voice not fading but simply ceasing already chopstriding again virile and impregnable the gunners now standing along the crest of the opposite escarpment as he approached carrying the loose handkerchief in his hand as though bearing under orders a flag of truce of which he himself was inflexibly ashamed and grieved the major saluted him he returned it and got into the car it moved at once the driver had already turned it around the boche crash was not far soon they reached it stop here he said he got out drive on ill overtake you in a moment not even waiting for the car to move but already climbing the bank into the corditeblasted weeds still carrying the handkerchief this was the place he had marked it though naturally his sudden advent would have alarmed the tiny beast but it would still be here by squatting and hunting patiently enough parting the weedstems gently enough he could probably see it in the pyrenean grass crouching and unterrified merely waiting for him to become still resume the solitude which was his origin and his ancestry and his birthright the sistersthe father himself when he would arrive with his inconsolable dedicated eyes and his hands gentle enough but sonless which had never caressed nor struck in anger and love and fear and hope and pride boys flesh sprung from his flesh and bearing his immortality in the same intolerant love and hope and pride wiser perhaps than the sisters were less tender than they were tender but no less compassionate knowing nothing as the sisters knew nothing toosaying the mother of christ the mother of all is your mother not enough because he didnt want the mother of all nor the mother of christ either he wanted the mother of one only necessary to become still and wait until the tiny creature was accustomed to his sudden advent then the first sound would come tentative brief a rising almost an interrogative inflection almost a test as if to learn if he were really there and ready then he would whisper the one word against the noonfierce stone under his face and he had been right not the pyrenean cicada of course but certainly its northern sister the miniature sound insistent and impersonal and constant and unobtrusive steadfast somewhere among the jumble of rusted engine and guns and blackened wires and charred sticksa purring sound such as he imagined might be made by the sleeping untoothed mouth itself around the sleeping nipple his divisional headquarters was what its owner called his country house built by a man who had made several millions on the paris bourse and returned to the district of his birth to install an argentine mistress establishing not only the symbol and monument but bringing the proof of his success back to the scene of his childhood and youth his itoldyouso to the elders mayor and doctor and advocate and judge who had said he would never amount to anything and who was well served not only in his patriotism but in his devotion too when the military demanded the use of it since the argentine had quitted paris only under pressure in the first place the message from corps headquarters was waiting for him chaulnesmont tomorrow hours you are expected you will confine yourself to quarters until the motor car calls for you crumpling the message and the aides handkerchief into his tunic pocket and home again what home he had ever had since when at eighteen he had first donned the uniform which from then on would be his home as the turtles shell is its domicile there opened before him an attenuation an emptiness of the next five or six or seven hours until it would be dark he thought of drink he was not a drinking man he not only never thought of it until he saw it it was as though he had forgot it existed until someone actually put it into his hand as the aide had done the flask but he dismissed the idea as immediately and completely and for exactly the same reason as if he had been a drinking man although he had officially ceased to be general of division gragnon the moment he received the corps commanders order for him to put himself under arrest general of division gragnon would have to continue to exist for another five or six or seven hours perhaps even for another day or two yet then suddenly he knew what he would do quitting the official quarters for his private ones passing his own bedrooma small panelled closet called by the millionaire the gunroom and containing a shotgun which had never been fired and a mounted stags head not a very good one and a stuffed trout both bought in the same shop with the gunand went on to the room in which three of his aides sleptthe lovenest itself which seemed to retain even yet something of the argentine though none could have said what it was since nothing remained of her unless it was some inconsolable ghost perhaps of what northerners conceived believed to be antipodal libidinous frenzyand found the volume in the battered chest in which it was the duty of one of the aides to transport about with them the unofficial effects of the headquarters entourage and now the books dead owner was present again too a former member of his staff a thin overtall delicately and even languidlymade man regarding whose sexual proclivities the division commander had had his doubts very likely wrong without really caring one way or the other who had entered the then brigadiers military family shortly before he received his division who the general discovered was the nameless product of an orphanage toowhich fact not the book the reading itself the division commander would admit to himself with a sort of savage selfcontempt in his secret moments was what caused him to be so constantly aware of the other not quite sipping and not quite snatching and certainly not buried in the book because he was a satisfactory aide until at last it seemed to the division commander that the battered and dogeared volume was the aide and the man himself merely that aides orderly until one evening while they were waiting for a runner from the front lines with a return concerning some prisoners which a brigadier had neglected to sign the aide was his divisional jag he asked and then listened in cold inattentive amazement to the answer he got i was a couturier in paris a what the division commander said i made womens clothes i was good at it i was going to be better some day but that wasnt what i wanted i wanted to be brave be what the division commander said you know a hero instead i made womens clothes so i thought of becoming an actorhenry vtartuffe better than nothingeven cyrano but that would be just acting pretencesomebody else not me then i knew what to do write it write it yes the plays myself write the plays rather than just act out somebody elses idea of what is brave invent myself the glorious deeds and situations create myself the people brave enough to perform and face and endure them and that wouldnt have been makebelieve too the general said it would have been me that wrote them invented them created them nor did the general discern humility either a quality humble yet dogged too even if it was sheeplike i would at least have done that oh the general said and this is the book no no the aide said another man wrote this one i havent written mine yet havent written it yet you have had time here not even knowing that he had expressed the contempt nor even that he had tried to conceal it or that perhaps he might have tried and now the aide was not humble not even dogged certainly the general would not have recognised despair though he might indomitability i dont know enough yet i had to wait to stop the books to find out in books what in books about being brave about glory and how men got it and how they bore it after they got it and how other people managed to live with them after they got it and honor and sacrifice and the pity and compassion you have to have to be worthy of honor and sacrifice and the courage it takes to pity and the pride it takes to deserve the courage courage to pity the general said yes courage when you stop to pity the world runs over you it takes pride to be that brave pride in what the general said i dont know yet thats what im trying to find out nor did the general recognise serenity then since he probably called it something else and i will find it its in the books in this book the general said yes the aide said and he died or that is the general found him missing one morning or rather failed to find him at all one morning it was two hours before he found where the aide was and another three or four hours before he learned exactly what the aide had done and he never did learn why and how the aide had come to be there inside the lines where a general of divisions assistant judge advocate general had no right nor business whatever sittingthis was how the runner told itbeside a regimental runner behind a wall near a corner much used by staff cars on which so the runner claimed he had told the aide the enemy had registered a gun only that morning and everybody had been warned of it yet the car came on anyway still coming on even after the aide sprang to his feet and began to wave his arms to stop the car but it refused to stop still coming on even after the aide ran out into the open road still trying to wave the car off even after the runner said that he could hear the shell coming and that the aide himself must have heard it also and how the aide could not possibly have known that the car contained not only a wealthy american expatriate a widow whose only son was in a french air squadron a few kilometres away and who was supporting near paris an asylum for warorphaned children but a wellconnected paris staffmajor too and there had been nothing to pin the medal on when it came through and nothing to identify to bury it with either so that the medal also was still in the battered chest which the aides successors in their succession superintended from post to post and the division commander took the book out and read the title and then read it again in mounting exasperation reading it aloud saying aloud almost all right blas wrote it but whats the name of the book until he realised that the word he was looking at was the name of the book and therefore the book would have to be about a man thinking yes remembering scraps fragments echoes from that night two years ago saying the name aloud this time gil blas listening concentrated if perhaps there might come out of the closed pages through the cover itself and into the simple name something some echo of the thunder the clanging crash the ringing bugles and the horns thewhat was it he thought the glory the honor and the courage and the pride he returned to his bedroom carrying the book save for his field cot and chest and desk the furniture still belonged to the owner of the house and of the argentine it had the look of having been bought all in one shop too probably over the telephone he drew the single chair into the light from the window beside the stuffed fish and sat down and began to read slowly rigidly not moving his lips even inflexible in fortitude and suffering as if he were sitting fifty years ago for his portrait after a while it was dusk the door opened hesitated opened more and quietly and a batman entered and came to the table and prepared to light the lamp on it the division commander not even looking up to say yes even when the soft gout of light plopped and burst soundless and brilliant on the open page in his hands still reading when the batman went out still reading until the tray was on the table beside the lamp and the batman had gone again then he put the book carefully down and turned to the tray immobile again for a second facing somewhat as he had faced the book before opening it the tray bearing the covered dish and the loaf and plate and cutlery and glass and the bottle of wine and one of rum and one of cassis which he had been looking at on this tray for three years nowthe same bottles which he had never touched the same corks started each day and then driven home again and even dusted freshly over the same liquid level in each as when vintner and distiller had bottled them nor did he use the knife and fork when he ate alone from the tray like this eating not with voracity nothing at all really gross about the feeding simply putting the food rapidly and efficiently into himself with his fingers and sops of the bread then with only the slightest pause not of indecision but simply to remember which pocket he drew out the aides handkerchief and carefully wiped his moustache and fingers and tossed the handkerchief onto the tray and thrust the chair away from the table and took up the book and paused again immobile the book half raised though none could have said whether he was looking at the open page or out the open window which he now faced looking at or listening to the springfilled darkness the myriad peaceful silence which it framed then he raised the book further and entered strode into it as a patient enters a dentists office for the last petty adjustment before paying the bill and read again rigid and inflexible above the pages slow increment in which he missed skipped elided no single word with a cold incredulous respectful amazement not at the shadows of men and women because they were inventions and naturally he didnt believe thembesides being in another country and long ago and therefore even if they had been real they could never impinge affect the course of his life and its destructionbut at the capacity and industry and he admitted it the competence of the man who could remember all this and write it down he waked immediately completely prescient he even picked up the fallen book before looking at his watch no start of concern nor dismay as though he knew beforehand that he would be able to reach the chateau in plenty of time before dawn not that it would make any difference he had simply planned to see the group commander tonight and slept without intending to sleep and waked without needing to be waked in plenty of time to see the group commander while technically at least it was still tonight so it was not dawn yet when the sentry at the lodge passed him he was alone in the car driving himself through the gates and into the drive running straight and overarched now through the spring darkness loud with predawn nightingales up to the chateau a successful highwayman had established its site and the park it sat in a distant connection of a french queen had restored it in the italian style of his native land his marquis descendants had owned it then the republic then a marshal of napoleon then a levantine millionaire for the last four years now for all practical purposes it had been the property of the general commanding the circumambient group of french armies and the division commander had not noticed the nightingales until he was inside the park and it may have been at this moment that he realised that he himself would never own either army command or chateau or nightingales for doomed division commanders coming to resign their pasts and their futures both to listen to and still not dawn when he slammed the car to a stop before the dark pile less of louis than florentine and more of baroque than either jerking it up exactly as he would the overridden horse and getting out and flinging the door backward behind him against the nights silence as he would have flung the reins to a groom without even pausing to see if the animals head were secure or not then mounting the broad shallow steps to the stone terrace with its carved balustrade and urns garlanded in carven stone nor was even all the old gothic quite absent either a pile of horsedroppings two or three days old on the terrace beside the door as if the old princely highwayman himself had returned or perhaps had only left day before yesterday which the division commander glanced at in passing thinking how forage grown from this northern chalkloam soil merely gave a horse windy size distending the animal simply by its worthless passing bulk nothing of speed and bottom like the hard lean light desertbred ones bone and fleshbred to endure on almost nothing contemptuous even of that and not just horses man too thinking able was i ere i saw france again thinking how always a mans simple longevity outlives his life and we are all our own paupers derelict thinking as men had thought and said before him that no soldier should be permitted to survive his first engagement under fire and then not thinking at all chopstriding to the door and rapping on it deliberate peremptory and loud he saw the candle heard the feet the door opened no dishevelled faubourg saint germain aide this but a private soldier a middleaged man in unlaced infantry boots and dangling braces holding his trousers up with the other candleless hand over a soiled lavender civilian shirt whose collarless neckband was clasped by a tarnished brass button the size and shape of a wolfs fang even the man appeared no different certainly the shirt was not he the division commander might have been looking at both that day fifteen years ago when bidet got his captaincy at last and an instructorship at the école militaire and he and the wife who had followed him a subaltern to africa even though she herself got no further than a loft in the oran native town could sleep every night under the same roof again at last the same soldier but with a baize apron over the soiled violet shirt scrubbing the stoop or the staircase while the wife stood over him like a sergeant herself with a vast bunch of keys at her waist to jangle at each of his convulsive starts when she would murmur at him and in the same baize apron waiting on table at meals and apparently the same soldier or at least one as large but certainly the same shirt eight years later when bidet was a colonel with enough pay to keep a horse too waiting on table with a white apron now over the collarless shirt and the vast bunch of keys jangling against authentic satin now or even the true funereal silk at each of his convulsive starts the same heavy boots under the apron bringing amid the viands the smell of stable manure now the same giant thumb in the bowls of soup he followed the candle into the same bedroom at which the knightly highwayman along with the shade of the imperial marshal would have looked in contemptuous unbelief in which the marquis descendants of the florentine might or might not have slept but in which the levantine without doubt did and saw something else which he realised now he had not expected to find changed either though the man who wore them had standing at the foot of the bed he faced across the fretted garlanded painted footboard the group commander sitting against the piled pillows in the same flannel nightcap and nightshirt which he too had brought to africa that day twentyfive years ago when he had had to leave his wife under the broiling eaves of the oran native house because they had no money then he the only child of the widow livingor trying toon the pension of her husband a savoyard schoolmaster she one of the six daughters of a retired sergeantmajor of marines while the husband was absent for almost two years on his first subalterns tour of outpost dutyfacing the man who even now did not look like even a french soldier and who on that first day twentyfive years ago seemed to have been completely and even criminally miscast looking then himself like a consumptive school teacher condemned not just to simple failure but to destitution and suicide too who weighed then less than a hundred pounds he was stouter now almost plump in fact and somewhere in his career like that of a delayed rocket the glasses had vanished too and wearing spectacles of such fierce magnification that he was almost blind without them and even with them too since for a third of the time the lenses were sweated to opaqueness and he spent another third wiping them dry with the end of his burnous in order to see at all before sweating them blind again and who had brought into the field life of that regiment of desert cavalry something of the monastery something of the cold fierce blinkless intolerant glare which burns at midnight in the dedicated asepsis of clinical or research laboratories that pitiless preoccupation with man not as an imperial implement least of all as that gallant and puny creature bearing undismayed on his frail bones and flesh the vast burden of his long inexplicable incomprehensible tradition and journey not even in fact as a functioning animal but as a functioning machine in the same sense that the earthworm is alive purely and simply for the purpose of transporting without itself actually moving for the distance of its corporeal length the medium in which it lives which given time would shift the whole earth that infinitesimal inch leaving at last its own blind insatiate jaws chewing nothing above the spinning abyss that cold scathing contemptuous preoccupation with body vents and orifices and mucous membrane as though he himself owned neither who declared that no army was better than its anus since even without feet it could still crawl forward and fight and so earned his nickname because of his inflexible belief in his doctrinea nickname spoken at first in contempt and derision then in alarm and anger and then rage and then concerned and impotent fury since his inflexible efforts to prove his doctrine soon extended beyond his own platoon into troops and squadrons where still a simple junior lieutenant of cavalry and not even a medical officer he had no right nor business at all and then spoken no longer in ridicule nor even contumely and anger anywhere because presently the whole african establishment knew how sitting in a tent he had told his regimental commander how to recover two scouts captured one night by a band of mounted tribesmen who vanished afterward like antelope and it worked and later still sitting in a tent told the general himself how to avail to a hitherto dry outpost a constant supply of drinking water and that worked too and moved from the classroom colonelcy to the command of a field division in and three years later was the competent and successful commander of an army group and already unofficially next but one to a marshals baton while still less than fiftyfive years old sitting in his flannel nightshirt and cap in the gaudy bed in the rococo room lighted by the cheap candle in its tin candlestick which the batman had set on the bedside table like an exgrocer alderman surprised but neither alarmed nor even concerned in a sumptuous bordello you were right the division commander said i wont go to chaulnesmont you have wrestled all night the group commander said with what angel what the division commander said he blinked for only a second then he said firmly and calmly like a man stepping firmly forward into complete darkness drawing a folded paper from his tunic as he did so and dropping it onto the group commanders covered knees it didnt take that long the group commander didnt touch the paper he merely looked at it he said pleasantly yes its my resignation the division commander said you think its over then what the division commander said oh the war no its not over theyll have something i can do as a civilian i was even a fair veterinary in the old days farrier too or maybe i could even run a production line thats what they call it isnt it in a munitions plant and then the group commander said the division commander looked at him though only for a second oh when it is over you mean im leaving france then maybe to the south pacific an island like gauguin the group commander said gently who another man who one day discovered that he had had enough of france too and went to the south pacific and became a painter this is another place the division commander said immediately there wont be enough people on this one to need their houses painted the group commander reached his hand and took up the folded paper and turned and the paper still folded held the corner of it to the candleflame until it took fire and then burst blazing the group commander holding it for a second longer before he dropped it hissing into the chamberpot beside the bed and in the same motion slid himself down the pillows until he was reclining again already drawing the covers up chaulnesmont he said at three tomorrow bah its already tomorrow and then the division commander was aware of it too the alteration day the invincible oblivious tomorrow which follows always undeviable by man and to man immune no longer ago than yesterday saw him and his fury the first tomorrow will have forgotten both it was even a second or so before he realised that the group commander was still talking to him if the world thinks it wishes to stop fighting for twentyfive or thirty years let it but not this way not like a group of peasants in a halfmown field suddenly shouldering their scythes and lunchpails and walking off chaulnesmont this afternoon because there are rules the division commander said harshly our rules we shall enforce them or we shall diethe captains and the colonelsno matter what the cost it wasnt we who invented war the group commander said it was war which created us from the loins of mans furious ineradicable greed sprang the captains and the colonels to his necessity we are his responsibility he shall not shirk it but not me the division commander said you the group commander said we can permit even our own rank and file to let us down on occasion thats one of the prerequisites of their doom and fate as rank and file forever they may even stop the wars as they have done before and will again ours merely to guard them from the knowledge that it was actually they who accomplished that act let the whole vast moil and seethe of man confederate in stopping wars if they wish so long as we can prevent them learning that they have done so a moment ago you said that we must enforce our rules or die its no abrogation of a rule that will destroy us its less the simple effacement from mans memory of a single word will be enough but we are safe do you know what that word is the division commander looked at him for a moment he said yes fatherland the group commander said now he raised the top of the covers preparatory to drawing them back over his head and face yes let them believe they can stop it so long as they dont suspect that they have the covers were already moving now only the group commanders nose and eyes and the nightcap remained in sight let them believe that tomorrow they will end it then they wont begin to ponder if perhaps today they can tomorrow and still tomorrow and again tomorrow thats the hope you will vest them in the three stars that sergeant gragnon won by his own strength with help from man nor god neither have damned you general call yours martyrdom for the world you will have saved it chaulnesmont this afternoon and now the division commander was no longer a general still less the sergeant of twentyfive years ago whose inflexible pride it had been to accept odds from no man but to me he said what will happen to me and now even the nightcap had vanished and only the muffled voice came from beneath the covers i dont know it said it will be glorious tuesday night some time after midnight that tuesday it was wednesday now two british privates were resting on the firestep of a frontline trench below the bethune slagheap two months ago they were looking at it not only from another angle but from another direction until then the lines relation to it seemed fixed to a longer life than memorys but since the breakthrough there had been no fixed line at all the old corridor had still remained of course roofed over with the shriek and stink of cordite but attached to the earth only at the two ends the one somewhere on the channel and the other somewhere up the roof of france so that it seemed to belly before the teutonic gale like a clothesline about to carry away in a wind and since three oclock yesterday afternoon yesterday morning rather noon when the french quit it had merely hung in its spent bulge against the arrested weight of the germanic air even roofless now since with dark the last patrolling aircraft had gone to roost and there remained only the flares arching up from behind the flickerless wire with a faint hiss a prolonged whispered sniff to bloom and parachute and hang against the dark with the cold thick texture and color of the working lights in a police morgue then sliding silently down the black air like drops of grease on a windowpane and far away to the north the spaced blink and thump of a single gun a big one with no following burst at all as though it were firing at the channel the north sea itself fifty miles away or perhaps at some target even vaster and more immune than that at cosmos space infinity lifting its voice against the absolute the ultimate iam harmless the iron maw of dis toothless unwearyable incapable bellowing one of the privates was a sentry he stood on the firestep leaning slightly against the wall beside the sandbagged aperture in which his rifle lay loaded and cocked and with the safety off in civil life he had indubitably been a horsegroom because even in khaki and even after four years of infantrymans war he still moved stood in an aura effluvium of stalls and tackroomsa hardfaced jockeysized man who seemed to have brought on his warped legs even into the french and flemish mud something of hard light razoredge horses and bettingrings who even wore the steel helmet at the same vicious rake of the filthy heavychecked cap which would have been the badge of his old dead calling and dedication but this was only inference from his appearance and general air not from anything he ever told anyone even his mates in the battalion who had stayed alive long enough to have known him four years knew nothing about his past as if he did not have one had not even been born until the fourth of august a paradox who had no business in an infantry battalion at all and an enigma to the extent that six months after he entered the battalion this was about christmas the colonel commanding it had been summoned to whitehall to make a specific report on him because the authorities had discovered that eleven privates in the battalion had made the man beneficiary of their soldiers life assurance policies by the time the colonel reached the war ministry the number had increased to twenty and although the colonel had made an intensive twodays investigation of his own before leaving the battalion he knew little more than they in london did because the company officers knew nothing about it and from the ncos he got only rumor and hearsay and from the men themselves only a blank and respectful surprised innocence as to the mans very existence the sum of which was that the eleven when the war office got its first report and twenty by the time the colonel reached london andthe colonel had been absent from the battalion twelve hours nownobody knew how many more by this time men had approached the battalion sergeantmajor all decorously and regularly and apparently of their own free will and desire and made the request which since none of them had legal heirs was their right to make and the empires duty to acquiesce to as for the man himself yes the staffmajor who was doing the informal questioning said what did he say about it and then after a moment you didnt even question him this time the colonel did shrug why he said quite the major said though i should have been temptedif only to learn what he can be selling them i should rather know what the ones who have legal heirs and cant make over the insurance are paying him instead the colonel said their souls obviously the major said since their deaths are already pledged and that was all in the whole kings regulations through which had been winnowed and tested and proved every conceivable khaki or blue activity and posture and intention with a rule provided for it and a penalty provided for the rule there was nothing to cover it who the man had infringed no discipline trafficked with no enemy failed to shine no brass nor wrap properly any puttie nor salute any officer yet still the colonel sat there until the major a little more than curious now said what say it i cant the colonel said because the only word i can think of is loveexplaining that the stupid surly dirty unsocial really unpleasant man who apparently neither gambled nor drank during the last two months the battalion sergeantmajor and the colonels orderly sergeant had sacrificedunofficially of courseno little of their own free time and slumber too walking suddenly into dugouts and rest billets and estaminets ascertaining that who in the light of day seemed to have no friends at all yet each time the sergeantmajor or the orderly sergeant entered one of the dugouts or billets they would find it jammed with men and not the same men either but each time there would be a new set of faces so that in each period between two paydays the entire battalion roll could have been called by anyone detailed to sit beside the mans bunk indeed on payday itself or for a day or two days after it the line queue had been known to extend into the street as when people wait to enter a cinema while the dugout the room itself would be jammed to the door with men standing or sitting or squatting about the bunk or corner in which the man himself lay quite often asleep morose and resigned and not even talking like people waiting in a dentists anteroomwaiting that was it as both the sergeantmajor and the sergeant realised if for nothing else except for themthe sergeantmajor and the sergeantto leave why dont you give him a stripe the major said if its devotion why not employ it for the greater glory of english arms how the colonel said try to buy with one file the man who already owns the battalion perhaps you should assign your own insurance and paybook over to him yes the colonel said if he gives me time to and that was all the colonel spent fourteen hours with his wife at noon the next day he was in boulogne again at six that afternoon his car entered the village where the battalion was in rest billets stop here the colonel said and sat for a moment in the car looking at the queue of men which was moving infinitesimally toward and through the gate into one of those sweating stone courtyards which for a thousand years the french have been dotting about the picard and artois and flanders countryside apparently for the purpose of housing between battles the troops of the allied nations come to assist in preserving them no the colonel thought not a cinema the anticipation is not great enough although the urgency is twice as strong they are like the parade outside a latrine drive on he said the other private was a battalion runner he was sitting on the firestep his unslung rifle propped beside him himself halfpropped halfreclining against the trenchwall his boots and putties not caked with the drying mud of trenches but dusted with the recent powdery dust of roads even his attitude showed not so much indolence but fatigue physical exhaustion except that it was not spent exhaustion but the contrary with something tense behind it so that the exhaustion did not seem to possess him but rather he seemed to wear it as he did the dust sitting there for five or six minutes now all of which he had spent talking and with nothing of exhaustion in his voice either back in the old spanking time called peace he had been not only a successful architect but a good one even if in private life an aesthete and even a little precious at this hour of those old dead days he would have been sitting in a soho restaurant or studio or his luck good even in a mayfair drawing room or evenat least once or twice or perhaps three timesboudoir doing a little more than his share of the talking about art or politics or life or both or all three he had been among the first london volunteers a private at loos without even a lance corporals stripe on his sleeve he had extricated his platoon and got it back alive across the canal he commanded the platoon for five days at passchendaele and was confirmed in it posted from the battlefield to officers school and had carried his single pip for five months into on the night when he came off duty and entered the dugout where his company commander was shaving out of a maconochie tin i want to resign he said without stopping the razor nor even moving enough to see the others reflection in the mirror the company commander said dont we all then he stopped the razor you must be serious all right go up the trench and shoot yourself through the foot of course they never really get away with it but i see the other said no i dont want to get out he touched the pip on his left shoulder rapidly with his right finger tips and dropped the hand i just dont want this anymore you want to go back to ranks the company commander said you love man so well you must sleep in the same mud he sleeps in thats it the other said its just backward i hate man so hear him again the hand moved an outward motion gesture and dropped again smell him too that was already in the dugout also sixty steps down though it was not just the rumble and mutter but the stench too the smell the soilure the stink of simple usage not the dead bones and flesh rotting in the mud but because the live bones and flesh had used the same mud so long to sleep and eat in when i knowing what i have been and am now and will continue to beassuming of course that i shall continue among the chosen beneath the boon of breathing which i probably shall some of us apparently will have to dont ask me why of that either can by the simple coincidence of wearing this little badge on my coat have not only the power with a whole militarised government to back me up to tell vast herds of man what to do but the impunitive right to shoot him with my own hand when he doesnt do it then i realise how worthy of any fear and abhorrence and hatred he is not just your hatred and fear and abhorrence the company commander said right he said im merely the one who cant face it wont face it the company commander said cant face it he said wont face it the company commander said all right he said so i must get back into the muck with him then maybe ill be free free of what the company commander said all right he said i dont know either maybe of having to perform forever at inescapable intervals that sort of masturbation about the human race people call hoping that would be enough i had thought of going straight to brigade that would save time but then the colonel might get his back up for being overslaughed im looking for what kr and o would call channels i suppose only i dont seem to know anybody who ever read that book it was not that easy the battalion commander refused to endorse him he found himself in the presence of a brigadier twentyseven years old less than four years out of sandhurst today in a mons star mc and bar dso and a french croix de guerre and a thing from the belgian monarch and three wound stripes who could notnot would not could noteven believe what he was hearing let alone understand what his importuner was talking about who said i daresay youve already thought of shooting yourself in the foot raise the pistol about sixty inches first you might as well get out front of the parapet too what better still get past the wire while youre about it but it was quite simple when he finally thought of the method he waited until his leave came up he would have to do that desertion was exactly what he did not want in london he found a girl a young woman not a professional not really a goodstanding amateur yet two or three months pregnant from any one of three men two of whom had been killed inside the same fortnight and mile by nieppe forest and the other now in mesopotamia who didnt understand either and therefore so he thought at the time was willing to help him for a pricea price twice what she suggested and which represented his whole balance at coxsin a plot whose meretricity and shabbiness only american moving pictures were to match the two of them taken in delicto so outrageously flagrante and public so completely unequivocal and incapable of other than one interpretation that anyone even the fieldrank moralists in charge of the conduct of anglosaxonderived junior officers should have refused point blank to accept or even believe it it worked though the next morning in a knightsbridge barracks anteroom a staff officer spokesman offered as an alternative to preserve the regiments honor the privilege which he had requested of his company commander and then the battalion commander and finally of the brigadier himself in france three months ago and three nights later passing through victoria station to file into a coach full of private soldiers in the same returning train which had brought him by officers first class up from dover ten days ago he found he had been wrong about the girl whom at first he didnt even remember after she spoke to him it didnt work she said yes he said it worked but youre going back i thought you wanted to lose the commission so you wouldnt have to go back then she was clinging to him cursing him and crying too you were lying all the time then you wanted to go back you just wanted to be a poor bloody private again she was pulling at his arm come on the gates are still open no he said holding back its all right come on she said jerking at him i know these things theres a train you can take in the morning you wont be reported absent until tomorrow night in boulogne the line began to move he tried to move with it but she clung only the harder cant you see she cried i cant get the money to give back to you until tomorrow morning let go he said i must get aboard and find a corner to sleep in the train wont go for two hours yet how many of them do you think ive seen leave come on my room isnt ten minutes from here let go now he said moving on goodbye just two hours a sergeant shouted at him it had been so long since an nco had spoken to him this way that he did not realise at once himself was meant but he had already freed himself with a sudden sharp hard movement a carriage door was open behind him then he was in the compartment dropping his pack and rifle onto a jumble of others stumbling among a jumble of legs pulling the door behind him as she cried through the closing gap you havent told me where to send the money goodbye he said closing the door leaving her on the step clinging on somehow even after the train was moving her gaped urgent face moving parallel beyond the voiceless glass until an mp on the platform jerked her off her face not the train seeming to flee suddenly with motion in another instant gone he had gone out in with the londoners his commission was in them this time he was going out to a battalion of northumberland borderers his record had preceded him a corporal was waiting on the boulogne quai to take him to the rto anteroom the lieutenant had been with him at officers school so you put up a job on them the lieutenant said dont tell me i dont want to know why youre going out to the th i know james the lieutenant colonel commanding it cut my teeth with him in the salient last year you dont want to go in a platoon what about a telephonista sergeantmajors man let me be a runner he said so a runner he was the word from the rto lieutenant had been too good not just his record but his past had preceded him to the battalion also up to the lieutenant colonel himself before he had been a week in the battalion possibly because he the runner was entitled to wear he did not wear it since it was the officers branch of the decoration and among the men he would now mess and sleep with that ribbon up on his privates tunic would have required too much breath one of the same candystripes which the colonel he was not a professional soldier either did that and one other matter though he would never believe that the two were more than incidentally connected look here the colonel said you havent come here to stir up anything you ought to know that the only possible thing is to get on with it finish it and bloody well have done we already have one man who could be a troublemakerunless he oversteps in time for us to learn what he is up to he named the man hes in your company i couldnt the runner said they wont talk to me yet i probably couldnt persuade them to anything even if they would talk to me and i wanted to not even the colonel named the private again you dont know what hes up to either i dont think im an agitator the runner said i know im not a spy this is gone now remember he said touching his shoulder lightly with the opposite hand though i doubt if you can stop remembering that you once had it the colonel said its your own leg youre pulling you know if you really hate man all you need do is take your pistol back to the latrines and rid yourself of him yes sir the runner said completely wooden hate germans if you must hate someone yes sir the runner said well cant you answer all the germans with all their kith and kin are not enough to make up man they are for menow the colonel said and they had better be for you too now dont force me to compel you to remember that pip oh i know it too the men who in hopes of being recorded as victorious prime or cabinetministers furnish men for this the men who in order to become millionaires supply the guns and shells the men who hoping to be addressed someday as field marshal or viscount plugstreet or earl of loos invent the gambles they call plans the men who to win a war will go out and dig up if possible invent if necessary an enemy to fight against is that a promise yes the runner said right the colonel said carry on just remember which he did sometimes when on duty but mostly during the periods when the battalion was in rest billets carrying the unloaded rifle slung across his back which was his cognizance his badge of office with somewhere in his pocket someanyscrap of paper bearing the colonels or the adjutants signature in case of emergency at times he managed lifts from passing transportlorries empty ambulances an unoccupied sidecar at times while in rest areas he even wangled the use of a motorbike himself as if he actually were a dispatch rider he could be seen sitting on empty petrol tins in scout or fighter or bombersquadron hangars in the material sheds of artillery or transport parks at the back doors of field stations and hospitals and divisional chateaux in kitchens and canteens and at the toysized zinc bars of village estaminets as he had told the colonel not talking but listening so he learned about the thirteen french soldiers almost at onceor rather the thirteen men in french uniformswho had been known for a year now among all combat troops below the grade of sergeant in the british forces and obviously in the french too realising at the same moment that not only had he been the last man below sergeant in the whole allied front to hear about them but why who five months ago had been an officer too by the badges on his tunic also forever barred and interdict from the right and freedom to the simple passions and hopes and fearssickness for home worry about wives and allotment pay the weak beer and the shilling a day which wont even buy enough of that even the right to be afraid of deathall that confederation of fellowship which enables man to support the weight of war in fact the surprise was that having been an officer once he had been permitted to learn about the thirteen men at all his informant was an asc private more than sixty years old member of and lay preacher to a small nonconformist congregation in southwark he had been half porter and half confidential servant with an unblemished record to an inns of court law firm as his father had been before him and his son was to be after except that at the old bailey assizes in the spring of the son would have been sent up for breaking and burglary except that the presiding judge was not only a humanitarian but a member of the same philatelist society to which the head of the law firm belonged whereupon the son was permitted to enlist instead the next day and in august went to belgium and was reported missing at mons all in the same three weeks and was accepted so by all save his father who received leave of absence to enlist from the law firm for the single reason that his employers did not believe he could pass the doctors eight months later the father was in france too a year after that he was still trying to get first leave of absence then failing that transfer to some unit near enough to mons to look for his son although it had been a long time now since he had mentioned the son as if he had forgot the reason and remembered only the destination still a lay preacher still half nightwatchman and half nurse unimpeachable of record to the succession of to him children who ran a vast ammunition dump behind st omer where one afternoon he told the runner about the thirteen french soldiers go and listen to them the old porter said you can speak foreign you can understand them i thought you said that the nine who should have spoken french didnt and that the other four couldnt speak anything at all they dont need to talk the old porter said you dont need to understand just go and look at him him the runner said so its just one now wasnt it just one before the old porter said wasnt one enough then to tell us the same thing all them two thousand years ago that all we ever needed to do was just to say enough of thisus not even the sergeants and corporals but just us all of us germans and colonials and frenchmen and all the other foreigners in the mud here saying together enough let them thats already dead and maimed and missing be enough of thisa thing so easy and simple that even human man as full of evil and sin and folly as he is can understand and believe it this time go and look at him but he didnt see them not yet not that he couldnt have found them at any time they would be in the british zone against that khaki monotone that clump of thirteen men in horizon blue even battlestained would have stood out like a cluster of hyacinths in a scottish moat he didnt even try yet he didnt dare he had been an officer himself even though for only eight months and even though he had repudiated it something ineradicable of it still remained as the unfrocked priest or repentant murderer even though unfrocked at heart and reformed at heart carries forever about him like a catalyst the indelible effluvium of the old condition it seemed to him that he durst not be present even on the fringe of whatever surrounding crowd even to walk pass through let alone stop within the same air of that small blue clump of hope this even while telling himself that he did not believe it that it couldnt be true possible since if it were possible it would not need to be hidden from authority that it would not matter whether authority knew about it or not since even ruthless and allpowerful and unchallengeable authority would be impotent before that massed unresisting undemanding passivity he thought they could execute only so many of us before they will have worn out the last rifle and pistol and expended the last live shell visualising it first the anonymous fringe of subalterns and junior clerks to which he had once belonged relegated to the lathes and wheels to keep them in motion rifling barrels and filling shellcases then the frenzy and the terror mounting the next layer the captains and majors and secretaries and attachés with their martial harness and ribbons and striped trousers and briefcases among the oilcans and the flying shafts then the field officers colonels and senators and members then last and ultimate the ambassadors and ministers and lesser generals themselves frantic and inept among the slowing wheels and melting bearings while the old men the last handful of kings and presidents and field marshals and spoiledbeef and shoepeg barons their backs to the last crumbling rampart of their real their credible their believable world wearied spent not with bloodglut at all but with the eyestrain of aiming and the muscletension of pointing and the fingercramp of squeezing fired the last puny scattered and markless fusillade as into the face of the sea itself its not that i dont believe it he said its because it cant be true we cant be saved now even he doesnt want us anymore now so he believed that he was not even waiting just watching it was winter again now the long unbroken line from alps to sea lying almost quiescent in muds foul menopause this would be the time for them with even frontline troops free for a little while to remember when they were warm and dry and clean for him and the other twelvethinking almost impatiently all right all right they are thirteen tooa soil not only unfallow now but already tumescent even having a little space to think now to remember and to dread thinking the runner how it was not the dying but the indignity of the method even the condemned murderer is better off with an hour set and fixed far enough in the future to allow time to summon fortitude to face it well and privacy to hide the lack in case the fortitude failed not to receive both the sentence and its execution all in one unprepared flash not even at rest but running stumbling laden with jangling iron like a packmule in the midst of death which can take him from any angle front rear or above panting vermincovered stinking with his own reek without even privacy in which to drop the dung and water he carried he even knew what he was watching for for the moment in the stagnancy when authority would finally become aware of the clump of alien incongruous blue in its moat which would be at any time now what he was watching was a race winter was almost over theythe thirteenhad had time but it was running out it would be spring soon the jocund bright time beginning to be mobile and dry underfoot and even before that they in the whitehalls and quai dorsays and unter den somethings and gargleplatzes would have thought of something anew even if it had to be something which had already failed before and suddenly he knew why it would not matter to authority whether they knew about the thirteen men or not they didnt need to having not only authority but time too on their side no need for them to hunt down and hoick out and execute a mere thirteen men their very avocation was its own defender and emollient and it had run out it was already spring the americans now were in it now rushing frantically across the atlantic ocean before it was too late and the scraps were all gone and the breakthrough had come the old stale germanic tide washing again over the somme and picard towns which you might have thought had served their apprenticeship washing along the aisne a month later so that clerks in paris bureaus were once more snapping the locks on the worn and homeless attachécases may and even the marne again american troops counterattacking this time among the ruined towns which you would think might have had absolution too except that he was not thinking now he was too busy for two weeks now he and his heretofore unfired rifle had been in an actual platoon part of a rearguard too busy remembering how to walk backward to think using in place of the harassing ordeal of thought a fragment out of the old time before he had become incapable of believing out of oxford probably he could even see the page though now it seemed much younger than that too young to have endured this far at all lo i have committed fornication but that was in another country and besides the wench is dead so when it finally happened he had no warning the wave had stopped and he was a runner again he had got back from division headquarters at dawn and two hours later he was asleep in the bunk of a man on a fatigue party when an orderly summoned him to the office you can drive a motorbike the colonel said he thought you should know he said yes sir youre going to corps headquarters they want couriers a lorry will pick you up and the others at division he didnt even think other what he just thought they have killed the serpent and now they have got to get rid of the fragments and returned to division headquarters where eight more runners from the other battalions and a lorry waited the nine of them by that special transport to serve as special couriers out of corps headquarters which by ordinary bristled with couriers not warned still knowing no more yet not even wondering not even caring fixed behind a faint wry grimace which was almost smiling in the midst of what was not ruin at all because he had known it of old too long too long of old yes he thought a bigger snake than even they had anticipated having to destroy and efface nor did he learn anymore at corps headquarters nor during the next two hours while at top speed now he delivered and exchanged and received dispatches from and to people whom even his travels had never touched beforenot to orderly room ncos but in person to majors and colonels and sometimes even generals at transport and artillery parks with columns of transport and artillery camouflaged beside roads and waiting for darkness to move at batteries in position and flying corps wing offices and forward aerodromesno longer even wondering now behind that fixed thin grimace which might have been smiling who had not for nothing been a soldier in france for twentyone months and an officer for five of them and so knew what he was looking at when he saw it the vast cumbrous machinery of war grinding to its clumsy halt in order to reverse itself to grind and rumble in a new directionthe proprietorless wave of victory exhausted by its own ebb and returned by its own concomitant flux spent not by its own faded momentum but as though bogged down in the refuse of its own success afterward it seemed to him that he had been speeding along those backarea roads for days before he realised what he had been travelling through he would not even recall afterward at what moment where what anonymous voice from a passing lorry or another motorbike or perhaps in some orderly room where he lay one dispatch down in the act of taking up another which said the french quit this morning merely riding on speeding on into the full burst of sun before he realised what he had heard it was an hour after noon before he finally found a face that of a corporal standing before a cafe in a village streeta face which had been in the anteroom of the old battalion when he was an officer in it and slowed the machine in and stopped still straddling it it was the first time nah the corporal said it was just one regiment fact is theyre putting one of the biggest shoots yet in jerrys support and communications along the whole front right this minute been at it ever since dawn but one regiment quit the runner said one did now the corporal was not looking at him at all have a wet the corporal said besides the runner said gently youre wrong the whole french front quit at noon but not ours the corporal said not yet the runner said that may take a little time the corporal was not looking at him now the corporal said nothing whatever with a light rapid gesture the runner touched one shoulder with the opposite hand theres nothing up here now he said have a wet the corporal said not looking at him and an hour later he was close enough to the lines to see the smokeanddust pall as well as hear the frantic uproar of the concentrated guns along the horizon at three oclock though twelve miles away at another point he heard the barrage ravel away into the spaced orderly harmlessseeming poppings as of salutes or signals and it seemed to him that he could see the whole long line from the seabeaches up the long slant of france to old tired europes rooftree squatted and crouched with filthy and noisome men who had forgot four years ago how to stand erect anymore amazed and bewildered and unable to believe it either forewarned and filled with hope though he knew it now they must have been he thought said aloud almost yes thats it its not that we didnt believe its that we couldnt didnt know how anymore thats the most terrible thing they have done to us thats the most terrible that was all then for almost twentyfour hours in fact though he didnt know it then a sergeantmajor was waiting for them as they returned gathered again at corps headquarters that nightthe nine from his division and perhaps two dozen others from other units in the corps whos senior here the sergeantmajor said but he didnt even wait on himself he glanced rapidly about at them again and with the unerring instinct of his vocation chose a man in the middle thirties who looked exactly like what he probably wasa demoted lance corporal out of a northwest frontier garrison youre acting sergeant the sergeantmajor said you will indent for suppers and bedding here he looked at them again i suppose its no use to tell you not to talk talk about what one said what do we know to talk about talk about that then the sergeantmajor said you are relieved until reveille carry on and that was all then they slept on a stone floor in a corridor they were given breakfast a good one this was a corps headquarters before reveille went even what bugles theyhe the runnerheard were at other division and corps headquarters and parks and depots where the motorcycle took him during another day like yesterday in his minuscule walkingon ridingon part in bringing war to a pause a halt a stop morning noon and afternoon up and down back areas not beneath a pall of peace but a thrall of dreamlike bustling for a holiday the night again the same sergeantmajor was waiting for themthe nine from his division and the two dozen others thats all the sergeantmajor said lorries are waiting to take you back in thats all he thought all you have to do all you need to do all he ever asked and died for eighteen hundred and eightyfive years ago in the lorry now with his group of the thirtyodd others the afterglow of sunset fading out of the sky like the tideless shoreless sea of despair itself ebbing away leaving only the peaceful grief and the hope when the lorry stopped and presently he leaned out to see what was wronga road which it was unable to cross because of transport on it a road which he remembered as running southeast from up near boulogne somewhere now so dense with hooded and lightless lorries moving nose to tail like a line of elephants that their own lorry had to put them down here to find their ways home as best they might his companions dispersing leaving him standing there in the last of afterglow while the vans crawled endless past him until a head a voice called his name from one of them saying hurry get up quick something to show you so that he had to run to overtake it and had already begun to swing himself up before he recognised it the old watchman from the st omer ammunition dump who had come to france four years ago to search for his son and who had been the first to tell him about the thirteen french soldiers three hours after midnight he was sitting on the firestep where the sentry leaned at the aperture while the spaced starshells sniffed and plopped and whispered down the greasy dark and the remote gun winked and thudded and after a while winked and thudded again he was talking in a voice which whatever else it contained it was not exhaustiona voice dreamy and glib apparently not only inattentive to itself but seemingly incapable of compelling attention anywhere yet each time he spoke the sentry without even removing his face from the aperture would give a start a motion convulsive and intolerable like someone goaded almost beyond endurance one regiment the runner said one french regiment only a fool would look on war as a condition its too expensive war is an episode a crisis a fever the purpose of which is to rid the body of fever so the purpose of a war is to end the war weve known that for six thousand years the trouble was it took us six thousand years to learn how to do it for six thousand years we labored under the delusion that the only way to stop a war was to get together more regiments and battalions than the enemy could or vice versa and hurl them upon each other until one lot was destroyed and the one having nothing left to fight with the other could stop fighting we were wrong because yesterday morning by simply declining to make an attack one single french regiment stopped us all this time the sentry didnt move leaningbraced ratheragainst the trenchwall beneath the vicious rake of his motionless helmet peering apparently almost idly through the aperture save for that rigidity about his back and shouldersa kind of immobility on top of immobilityas though he were braced not against the dirt wall but rather against the quiet and empty air behind him nor had the runner moved either though from his speech it was almost as if he had turned his face to look directly at the back of the sentrys head what do you see he said no novelty you thinkthe same stinking strip of ownerless valueless frantic dirt between our wire and theirs which you have been peering at through a hole in a sandbag for four years now the same war which we had come to believe did not know how to end itself like the amateur orator searching desperately for a definitive preposition youre wrong you can go out there now at least during the next fifteen minutes say and not die probably yes that may be the novelty you can go out there now and stand erect and look about yougranted of course that any of us really ever can stand erect again but we will learn how who knows in four or five years we may even have got our neckmuscles supple enough simply to duck our heads again in place of merely bowing them to await the stroke as we have been doing for four years now in ten years certainly the sentry didnt move like a blind man suddenly within range of a threat the first warning of which he must translate through some remaining secondary sense already too late to fend with come the runner said youre a man of the world indeed you have been a man of this world since noon yesterday even if they didnt bother to tell you so until fifteen oclock in fact we are all men of this world now all of us who died on the fourth day of august four years ago the sentry moved again with that convulsive start he said in a harsh thick furious murmur for the last time i warned you all the fear and the doubt the agony and the grief and the licebecause its over isnt it over yes the sentry said of course its over you came out in fifteen wasnt it youve seen a lot of war too of course you know when one is over it is over the sentry said didnt you hear the ing guns stop right out there in front of you then why dont we go home can they draw the whole ing line out at once leave the whole ing front empty at one time why not the runner said isnt it over it was as if he had fixed the sentry as the matador does the bull leaving the animal capable only of watching him over finished done no more parades tomorrow we shall go home by this time tomorrow night we shall have hoicked from the beds of our wives and sweethearts the manufacturers of walkingout shoepegs and enfield primers he thought rapidly hes going to kick me he said all right sorry i didnt know you had a wife no more i have the sentry said in his shaking whisper so will you stow it now will you for bleeding christ of course you havent how wise you are a girl in a high street pub of course or perhaps a city girla greater city girl houndsditch or bermondsey towarding forty but not looking within five years of it ands had her troubles toowho hasntbut suppose she does who wouldnt choose her and lucky who can appreciate a man to one of these young tarts swapping cove for cove with each leave train the sentry began to curse in the same harsh spent furious monotone cursing the runner with obscene and dull unimagination out of the stalls and tackrooms and all the other hinder purlieus of what must have been his old vocation until at the same moment the runner sat quickly and lightly up and the sentry began to turn back to the aperture in a series of jerks like a mechanical toy running down murmuring again in his shaking furious voice remember i told you as two men came around the traverse and up the trench in single file indistinguishable in their privates uniforms save for the officers stick and the sergeants chevrons post the officer said twonine the sentry said the officer had lifted his foot to the firestep when he saw seemed to see the runner whos that he said the runner began to stand up promptly enough but without haste the sergeant pronounced his name he was in that special draft of runners corps drew out yesterday morning they were dismissed to dugouts as soon as they reported back tonight and told to stop there this man was anyway oh the officer said that was when the sergeant pronounced the name why arent you there yes sir the runner said picking up the rifle and turning quite smartly moving back down the trench until he had vanished beyond the traverse the officer completed his stride onto the firestep now both the helmets slanted motionless and twinlike between the sandbags while the two of them peered through the aperture then the sentry said murmured so quietly that it seemed impossible that the sergeant six feet away could have heard him nothing mores come up i suppose sir for another half minute the officer peered through the aperture then he turned and stepped down to the duckboards the sentry turning with him the sergeant moving again into file behind him the officer himself already beginning to move when he spoke when you are relieved go down your dugout and stay there then they were gone the sentry began to turn back toward the aperture then he stopped the runner was now standing on the duckboards below him while they looked at one another the starshell sniffed and traced its sneering arc and plopped into parachute the faint glare washing over the runners lifted face and then even after the light itself had died seeming to linger still on it as if the glow had not been refraction at all but water or perhaps grease he spoke in a tense furious murmur not much louder than a whisper do you see now not for us to ask what nor why but just go down a hole in the ground and stay there until they decide what to do no just how to do it because they already know what of course they wont tell us they wouldnt have told us anything at all if they hadnt had to hadnt had to tell us something tell the rest of you something before the ones of us who were drawn out yesterday for special couriers out of corps would get back in tonight and tell you what we had heard and even then they told you just enough to keep you in the proper frame of mind so that when they said go down the dugouts and stay there you would do it and even i wouldnt have known any more in time if on the way back in tonight i hadnt blundered onto that lorry train no thats wrong too just known in time that they are already up to something because all of us know by now that something is wrong dont you see something happened down there yesterday morning in the french front a regiment failedburkedmutinied we dont know what and are not going to know what because they arent going to tell us besides it doesnt matter what happened what matters is what happened afterward at dawn yesterday a french regiment did somethingdid or failed to do something which a regiment in a front line is not supposed to do or fail to do and as a result of it the entire war in western europe took a recess at three oclock yesterday afternoon dont you see when you are in battle and one of your units fails the last thing you do dare do is quit instead you snatch up everything else youve got and fling it in as quick and hard as you can because you know that thats exactly what the enemy is going to do as soon as he discovers or even suspects you have trouble on your side of course youre going to be one unit short of him when you meet your hope your only hope is that if you can only start first and be going the fastest momentum and surprise might make up a little of it but they didnt instead they took a recess remanded the french at noon us and the americans three hours later and not only us but jerry too dont you see how can you remand in war unless your enemy agrees too and why should jerry have agreed after squatting under the sort of barrage which four years had trained him to know meant that an attack was coming then no attack came or failed or whatever it was it did and four years had certainly trained him to the right assumption for that when the message signal requestwhatever it wascame over suggesting a remand why should he have agreed to it unless he had a reason as good as the one we had maybe the same reason we had the same reason those thirteen french soldiers apparently had no difficulty whatever going anywhere they liked in our backareas for three years why werent they across yonder in jerrys too since we all know that unless youve got the right properly signed paper in your hand its a good deal more difficult to go to paris from here than to berlin any time you want to go east from here all you need is a british or french or american uniform or perhaps they didnt even need to go themselves perhaps just wind moving air carried it or perhaps not even moving air but just air spreading by attrition from invisible and weightless molecule to molecule as disease smallpox spreads or fear or hopejust enough of us all of us in the mud here saying together enough of this lets have done with this because dont you see they cant have this they cant permit this to stop it at all yet let alone allow it to stop itself this waythe two shells in the river and the race already underway and both crews without warning simply unshipping the oars from the locks and saying in unison were not going to pull anymore they cant yet its not finished yet like an unfinished cricket or rugger match which started according to a set of mutually accepted rules formally and peaceably agreed on and must finish by them else the whole theory of arbitration the whole tried and proven stepbystep edifice of politics and economy on which the civilised concord of nations is based becomes so much wind more than that that thin and tensioned girder of steel and human blood which carries its national edifice soaring glorious and threatful among the stars in dedication to which young men are transported free of charge and even with pay to die violently in places that even the mapmakers and dividers never saw that a pilgrim stumbling on it a hundred or a thousand years afterward may still be able to say here is a spot that is anyway was once forever england or france or america and not only cant dare not they wont they have already started not to because listen on the way back up tonight i got a lift in a lorry it was carrying aa shells it was in a column almost three miles long all chock full of aa shells think of it three miles of aa shells think of having enough shells to measure it in miles which apparently they did not have in front of amiens two months ago but then naturally it takes more ammunition to recess a war for ten minutes than to stop a mere offensive the lorry was in charge of an old man i knew who had been waiting for three years at an ammo dump at st omer for his application to go through for leave and permission to go to mons and search for his son who hadnt or didnt or couldnt or didnt want toanyway failed tocome back that afternoon four years ago he showed me one of the shells it was blank not dud blank complete and intact except that there was no shrapnel in it it would fire and even burst harmless it looked all right on the outside i doubt if its father in his west end club or birmingham or leeds or manchester or wherever people live who make shells would have known the difference and only a dyedinthewool archie bloke could it was amazing really they must have worked like beaver all last night and today too there at the dump altering gelding three miles of shellsor maybe they had them all ready beforehand in advance maybe after four years even anglosaxons can learn to calculate ahead in war talking the voice not dreamy now just glib and rapid he the runner in the moving lorry now the three of them himself the old man and the driver crowded into the close and lightless cab so that he could feel the whole frail length of the old mans body tense and exultant against him remembering how at first his voice had sounded as cracked and amazed as the old mans but soon no more the two voices running along side by side as logical in unreason rational and inconsequent as those of two children perhaps youd better tell me again maybe i have forgot for the signal the old man cried the announcement to let the whole world know that he has risen a signal of aa shells three miles of aa shells wouldnt one gun be enough to herald him and if one gun why hold his resurrection up long enough to run three miles of shells through it or if one shell to each gun why only three miles of guns why not enough for every gun between switzerland and the channel arent the rest of us to be notified too to welcome him too why not just bugles horns he would recognise horns they wouldnt frighten him dont the book itself say he will return in thunder and lightning but not gunpowder the runner said then let man make the noise the cracked voice cried let man shout hallelujah and jubilee with the very things he has been killing withrational and fantastic like children and as cruel too and fetch your son along with him the runner said my son the old man said my son is dead yes the runner said thats what i meant isnt that what you mean too pah the old man said it sounded almost like spitting what does it matter whether or not he brings my son back with him my son or yours or any other mans my son even the whole million of them we have lost since that day four years ago the billion since that day eighteen hundred and eightyfive years ago the ones he will restore to life are the ones that would have died since eight oclock this morning my son my sonthen the runner out of the lorry again the column had stopped it was near the lines just under them in fact or what had been the front line until three oclock this afternoon the runner knew that at once although he had never been here before but he had not only been an infantryman going in and out of them for twentyodd months for seven months he had been a runner going in and out of them every night so he had no more doubt of where he was than would the old wolf or lynx when he was near a trapline walking up the column toward the halted head of it and stopped in shadow and watched mps and armed sentries splitting the column into sections with a guide for each leading lorry each section as it was detached turning from the road into the fields and woods beyond which lay the front and not long to watch this either because almost at once a corporal with his bayonet fixed came quickly around the lorry in whose shadow he stood get back to your lorry the corporal ordered he identified himself naming his battalion and its vector what the bleeding are you doing down here the corporal said trying to get a lift not here the corporal said hop it sharp nowand the corporal still watching him until darkness hid him again then he too left the road into a wood walking toward the lines now and telling it sprawled on the firestep beneath the rigid and furious sentry almost as though he drowsed his eyes halfclosed talking in the glib dreamy inconsequent voice how from the shadows again he watched the crew of an antiaircraft battery with hooded torches unload the blank shells from one of the lorries and tumble their own live ammunition back into it and went on until he saw the hooded lights again and watched the next lorry make its exchange and at midnight was in another woodor what had been a wood since all that remained now was a nightingale somewhere behind him not walking now but standing with his back against the blasted corpse of a tree hearing still above the birds idiot reiteration the lorries creeping secretly and steadily through the darkness not listening to them just hearing them because he was searching for something which he had lost mislaid for the moment though when he thought that he had put the digit of his recollection on it at last it was wrong flowing rapid and smooth through his mind but wrong in christ is death at end in adam that begantrue but the wrong one not the wrong truth but the wrong moment for it the wrong one needed and desired clearing his mind again and making the attempt again yet there it was again in christ is death at end in adam thatstill true still wrong still comfortless and then before he had thought his mind was clear again the right one was there smooth and intact and instantaneous seeming to have been there for a whole minute while he was still fretting its loss but that was in another countryand besides the wench is dead and this time the flare went up from their own trench not twenty yards away beyond the up traverse so near this time that after the green corpseglare died the sentry could have discerned that what washed over the runners face was neither the refraction assumed nor the grease it resembled but the water it was a solid corridor of harmless archie batteries beginning at our parapet and exactly the width of the range at which a battery in either wall would decide there wasnt any use in even firing at an aeroplane flying straight down the middle of it running back to the aerodrome at villeneuve blanche so that to anyone not a general it would look all rightand if there was just enough hurry and surprise about it maybe even to the men themselves carrying the shells running to the guns ramming them home and slamming the blocks and pulling the lanyards and blistering their hands snatching the hot cases out fast enough to get out of the way of the next one let alone the ones in front lines trying to cringe back out of mans sight in case the aeroplane flying down the corridor to villeneuve wasnt carrying ammunition loaded last night at whatever the hun calls his saint omer it would still look and sound all right even if the hun continued not falling all the way back to villeneuve because flying corps people say archie never hits anything anyway so you see what we must do before that german emissary or whatever he will be can reach paris or chaulnesmont or wherever he is to go and he and whoever he is to agree with have agreed not on what to do because that is no problem only on how and goes back home to report it we dont even need to start it the french that one french regiment has already taken up the load all we need is not to let it drop falter pause for even a second we must do it now tomorrowtomorrow its already tomorrow its already today nowdo as that french regiment did the whole battalion of us climb over this parapet tomorrow morning and get through the wire with no rifles nothing and walk toward jerrys wire until he can see us enough of him can see usa regiment of him or a battalion or maybe just a company or maybe even just one because even just one will be enough you can do it you own the whole battalion every man in it under corporal beneficiary of every mans insurance in it who hasnt got a wife and ious for their next months pay of all the rest of them in that belt around your waist all youll need is just to tell them to when you say follow me ill go along to the first ones as soon as you are relieved so they can see you vouch for me then others will see you vouch for me when i vouch for them so that by daylight or by sunup anyway when jerry can see us all the rest of europe can see us will have to see us cant help but see us he thought hes really going to kick me this time and in the face then the sentrys boot struck the side of his jaw snapping his head back even before his body toppled the thin flow of water which sheathed his face flying at the blow like a thin spray of spittle or perhaps of dew or rain from a snapped leaf the sentry kicking at him again as he went over backward onto the firestep and was still stamping his boot at the unconscious face when the officer and the sergeant ran back around the traverse still stamping at the prone face and panting at it will you for christs sake now will you will you when the sergeant jerked him bodily down to the duckboards the sentry didnt even pause whirling while the sergeant held him and slashing his reversed rifle blindly across the nearest face it was the officers but the sentry didnt even wait to see whirling again back toward the firestep though the sergeant still gripped him in one arm around his middle stillthe sentrystriking with the riflebutt at the runners bleeding head when the sergeant fumbled his pistol out with his free hand and thumbed the safety off as you were the officer said jerking the blood from his mouth onto his wrist and flinging it away hold him he spoke without turning his head toward the corner of the down traverse raising his voice a little twoeight pass the word for corporal the sentry was actually foaming now apparently not even conscious that the sergeant was holding him still jabbing the riflebutt at or at least toward the runners peaceful and bloody head until the sergeant spoke almost against his ear twoseven for corporal a voice beyond the down traverse said then fainter beyond that another twosix corporal use yer boot the sergeant muttered kick his ing teeth in monday tuesday wednesday he had already turned back toward the aerodrome when he saw the harry tate at first he just watched it merely alerting himself to overshoot it safely they looked so big and were travelling so slowly that you always made the mistake of overestimating them if you were not careful then he saw that the thing obviously not only hoped but actually believed that it could cut him offa harry tate which usually had two australians in it or one generalandpilot this one indubitably a general since only by some esoteric factor like extreme and even overwhelming rank could an re even hope to catch an se and send it to earth which was obviously what this one intended to do he throttling back now until the se was hanging on its airscrew just above stalling and it was a general the two aeroplanes broadside on for a second or so a hand in a neat walkingout glove from the observers seat gesturing him peremptorily downward until he waggled his wings in acknowledgment and put his nose down for home thinking why me whatve i done now besides how did they know where i washaving suddenly a sort of vision of the whole sky full of lumbering res each containing a general with a list compiled by frantic telephone of every absent unaccountedfor scout on the whole front hunting them down one by one out of backareas and harrying them to earth then he reached the aerodrome and saw the ground signalstrip laid out on it he hadnt seen one since ground school and for a goodish while he didnt even know what it was not until he saw the other aeroplanes on the ground or landing or coming in to land did he recognise it to be the peremptory emergency signal to all aircraft to come down landing in his turn faster and harder than people liked to land ses because of their unhappy ground habits taxiing in to the tarmac where even before he could switch off the mechanic was shouting at him the mess sir right away the major wants you at the mess right away what he said me everyone sir the mechanic said the whole squadron sir best hurry he jumped down to the tarmac already running so young in breathing that he wouldnt be nineteen for another year yet and so young in war that although the royal air force was only six weeks old his was not the universal tunic with rfc badges superposed on the remnants of old regimental insigne which veteran transfers wore and he didnt even own the old official flying corps tunic at all his was the new raf thing not only unmartial but even a little epicene with its cloth belt and no shoulderstraps like the coat of the adult leader of a neochristian boys club and the narrow pale blue ring around each cuff and the hatbadge like a field marshals until you saw remarked noticed the little modest dull gold pin on either side of it like lingerieclips or say the christenings giftchoice by godfathers whose good taste had had to match their pocketbooks a year ago he was still in school waiting not for his eighteenth birthday and legal age for joining up but for his seventeenth one and the expiration discharge of a promise to his widowed mother he was the only child to stick it out until then which he did even making good marks even while his mind his whole being was sleepless and athirst with the ringing heroic catalogue ball mccudden mannock bishop barker rhys davies and above all simply england three weeks ago he was still in england waiting in pilots pool for posting to the fronta certificated stationary engine scout pilot to whom the king had inscribed we reposing trust and confidence in our trusty and wellbeloved gerald david but already too late gazetted not into the rfc but into the raf because the rfc had ceased to exist on april fools day two days before his commission came through whereupon that march midnight had seemed to him a knell a door had closed on glory immortality itself had died in unprimered anticlimax not his to be the old commission in the old glorious corps the brotherhood of heroes to which he had dedicated himself even at the cost of that wrench to his mothers heart not his the old commission which albert ball had carried with him into immortality and which bishop and mannock and mccudden still bore in their matchless records his only the new thing not flesh nor fowl nor good red herring who had waited one whole year acquiescent to his mothers unrational frantic heart fiercely and irrevocably immune to glory and then another year in training working like a beaver like the very proverbial trojan to compensate for his own inability to say no to a womans tears it was too late those who had invented for him the lingerie pins and the official slacks in place of pink bedfords and long boots and ordnance belt had closed the door even to the anteroom of heroes in valhallas unnational halls the unnational shades frenchman and german and briton conqueror and conquered alikeimmelman and guynemer boelcke and ballidentical not in the vast freemasonry of death but in the closed select one of flying would clash their bottomless mugs but not for him their inheritorsbishop and mannock and voss and mccudden and fonck and barker and richthofen and nungesserwould still cleave the earthfoundationed air pacing their fleeing shadows on the scudding canyonwalls of cumulae furloughed and immune secure in immortality even while they still breathed but it would not be his glory and valor would still exist of course as long as men lived to reap them it would even be the same valor in fact but the glory would be another glory and that would be his some second form of elysium a cut above dead infantry perhaps but little more who was not the first to think what had i done for motherlands glory had motherland but matched me with her need and now apparently even what remained was to be denied him three weeks spent in practice mostly gunnery he was quite good at it astonishing even himself at the aerodrome one carefully chaperoned tripthe major bridesman his flight commander himself and one other new and unblooded tyroup to the lines to show them what they looked like and how to find the way back and yesterday he was in his hut after lunch trying to compose a letter to his mother when bridesman thrust his head in and gave him the official notice which he had been waiting for now ever since his seventeenth birthday levine jobs tomorrow eleven oclock before we take off ill try again to remind you to try to remember what we have been trying to tell you to remember then this morning he had gone up for what would be the last of his unchallenged airy privacy the farewell to his apprenticeship what might be called the valedictory of his maidenhood when the general in the harry tate sent him back to earth to spring down almost before the aeroplane stopped rolling and spurred again by the mechanic run to the mess already the last one since everyone else was there except the flight which was still out finding the major already talking one knee crooked easily across the corner of the table he the major had just got back from wing headquarters where he had met the general commanding who had come straight from poperinghe the french had asked for an armistice it would go into effect at noontwelve hours but it meant nothing they the squadron were to remember that the british hadnt asked for any armistice nor the americans either and having known the french fought beside them for almost four years now he the major didnt yet believe it meant anything with them however there would be a truce a remand for an hour or two hours or perhaps a whole day but it was a french truce it wasnt ourslooking about at them nonchalant and calm and even negligent speaking in that same casual negligent voice and manner with which he could carry the whole squadron through a binge night through exuberance and pandemonium and then with none realising it until afterward back into sufficient sobriety to cope with the morrows work which was not the least of the reasons why even though no hungetter he was one of the most popular and capable squadron commanders in france though he the child had not been there long enough to know that but he did know that here was the true authentic voice of that invincible island which with not merely the eighteen years he had but the rest of his promised span which he might very likely lose doing it he would in joy and pride defend and in gratitude preserve because we arent quitting not us nor the americans either its not over nobody declared it for us nobody but us shall make our peace flights will stand by as usual carry on he didnt think why yet he just thought what he had never heard of a recess in war but then he knew so little about war he realised now that he knew nothing about war he would ask bridesman glancing about the room where they were already beginning to disperse and in the first moment realising that bridesman was not there and in the next one that none of the flight commanders were there not only bridesman but witt and sibleigh too which in witts case obviously meant that he still had c flight out on the midmorning job and whichthe fact that c flight was still carrying on with the warratified the majors words c flight hadnt quit and if he knew bridesman and after three weeks he certainly should b hadnt either glancing at his watch now half after ten thirty minutes yet before b would go up he would have time to finish the letter to his mother which bridesman had interrupted yesterday he could evensince the war would officially begin for him in thirty minuteswrite the other one the succinct and restrained and modestly heroic one to be found among his gear afterward by whoever went through it and decided what should be sent back to his mother thinking how the patrol went up at eleven and the remand would begin at twelve which would leave him an hourno it would take them ten minutes to get to the lines which would leave fifty minutes if fifty minutes was long enough for him to at least make a start after bishops and mccuddens and mannocks records it would be long enough for him to get shot down in too already moving toward the door when he heard engines a flight taking off then running up to the hangars where he learned that it was not even b flight shouting at the sergeant incredulous and amazed do you mean that all three flight commanders and all the deputies have gone out in one patrol and then heard the guns begin not like any heavy firing he had ever heard before but furious and simultaneous and vast in extenta sound already in existence to the southeast before audibility began and still in existence to the northwest when audibility ceased theyre coming over he shouted the french have betrayed us they just got out of the way and let them through yes sir the flight sergeant said hadnt you better get along to the office they may be wanting you right he said already running back up the vacant aerodrome beneath the sky furious with the distant guns into the office which was worse than empty the corporal not only sitting as always behind the telephone but looking at him across the dogeared copy of punch which he had been looking at when he first saw him three weeks ago wheres the major he cried down at wing sir the corporal said down at wing he cried incredulous already running again through the opposite door into the mess and saw everyone of the squadrons new replacements like himself except himself all sitting quietly about as though the adjutant had not merely arrested them but was sitting guard over them and the adjutant himself sitting at the end of the mess table with his pipe and wound stripe and observers o and single wing above the mons star ribbon and the squadron chessboard and the folded sheet of last sundays times chess problem laid out before him and he the child shouting cant you hear them cant you so that he couldnt hear the adjutant at all for his own noise until the adjutant began to shout too where have you been hangars he said i was to go on the patrol didnt anyone tell you to report to me here report he said flight sergeant conventicleno he said youre levine levine youve been here three weeks not long enough to have learned that this squadron is run by people especially appointed and even qualified for it in fact when they gave you those badges they gave you a book of rules to go with them to prevent you needing ever to rack your brains like this perhaps you havent yet had time to glance through it yes he said what do you want with me to sit down somewhere and be quiet as far as this squadron is concerned the war stopped at noon therell be no more flying here until further notice as for those guns they began at twelve hours the major knew that beforehand they will stop at fifteen hours now you know that in advance too stop he said dont you see sit down the adjutant said if we stop now we are beat have lost sit down he stopped then then he said am i under arrest do you want to be right he said he sat down it was twentytwo minutes past twelve hours now it was not the nissen walls which trembled but the air they contained presently or in time that is it was thirteen hours then fourteen all that distant outside fury reduced now to a moiling diastole of motes where the sun slanted into the western windows getting on for fifteen hours now and the squadron itself reduced to a handful of tyros who barely knew in which direction the front lay under command of a man who had never been anything but a poor bloody observer to begin with and had even given that up now for a chessboard they still sat there he and the other new men who hadmust havebrought out from england with them the same gratitude and pride and thirst and hopethen he was on his feet hearing the silence still falling like a millstone into a well then they were all moving as one through the door and outside into that topless gape from which the walls and roof of distant gunfire had been ripped snatched as a cyclone rips the walls and roof from the rectangle of vacancy which a moment ago had been a hangar leaving audibility with nothing now to lean against outbursting into vacuum as the eardrums crack with altitude until at last even that shocking crash died away that seems to be it a voice said behind him seems to be what he said its not over didnt you hear what the major said the americans arent quitting either do you think monaghan monaghan was an american in b flight too although he had been out only ten weeks he already had a score of three and a fraction is quitting and even if they do and stopped finding them all watching him soberly and quietly as if he were a flight commander himself one said what do you think levine me he said about what ask collyer he thought hes running the nursery now bitterly too now ask collyerthe pipe the balding head the plump bland face which at this moment was englands sole regent over this whole square halfmile of french dirt custodian of her honor and pride who three years ago had probably brought out to france he collyer according to squadron folklore had been ridden down by a uhlan with a lance inside the wars first weeks and turned flying observer and came out again and within a week of that managed somehow to live through a fe crash after his pilot was dead and since then carrying the same single pip andthe legend saidthe same cold pipe had been a squadron adjutant the same feeling belief hungerwhatever you want to call itas intolerant and unappeasable as his own and then lost it or put it aside as he had put the war itself forever away secure and immune in his ground job where no thirst for victory nor tumescence of valor could trouble him more thinking oh yes ask collyer finishing the thought which the cessation of the guns had interrupted inside the mess he has quit too he gave up so long ago that he doesnt even remember now that he hasnt even lost anythingi heard the death of england he said quietly to himself then aloud think about what that noise nothing thats what it sounds like doesnt it at five oclock the major was delivered almost onto the office stoop by the general commanding the brigades harry tate just before sunset two lorries drove onto the aerodrome watching from his hut he saw infantry with rifles and tin hats get down and parade for a moment on the dusty grass behind the office and then disperse in squads and at sunset the patrol of flight commanders and deputies which had gone out at noon in the similitude of b flight had not returned three times longer than any patrol ever stayed out or than any se could stay up on its petrol and he dined with a mess the major was not present though a few of the older menincluding the infantry officerwere he didnt know where they had been nor when returned half of whom he knew knew nothing either and the other half he didnt know how much they knew or careda meal which was not long before the adjutant got up and stopped just long enough to say not speaking to the older people at all you arent confined to quarters just put it that almost any place you can think of is out of bounds even the village someone said even villeneuve blanche sink of iniquity though it be not you might all go home with levine and curl up with his book thats where he should be then he stopped again that means the hangars too why should we go to the hangars this time of night one said i dont know the adjutant said dont then the others dispersed but not he he was still sitting there after the orderlies had cleared the mess for the night and still there when the motor car came up not stopping at the mess but going on around to the office and through the thin partition he heard people enter the office and then the voices the major and bridesman and the other two flight commanders and no se had landed on this aerodrome after dark even if he hadnt heard the car but then that was all right aeroplanes were not even new replacements they were not only insentient and so couldnt ask questions and talk back you could even jettison them where they wouldnt even need to be watched by infantry and he couldnt have heard what the voices were saying even if he had tried just sitting there when the voices stopped short and a second later the door opened and the adjutant paused an instant then came on pulling the door after him saying get along to your hut right he said rising but the adjutant came on into the mess shutting the door behind him his voice was really kind now why dont you let it alone i am he said i dont know how to do anything else because i dont know how it can be over if its not over nor how it can be not over if its over go to your hut the adjutant said he went out into the darkness the silence walking on in the direction of the huts as long as anyone from the mess might still see him then giving himself another twenty steps for good measure before he turned away toward the hangars thinking how his trouble was probably very simple really he simply had never heard silence before he had been thirteen almost fourteen when the guns began but perhaps even at fourteen you still could not bear silence you denied it at once and immediately began to try to do something about it as children of six or ten do as a last resort when even noise failed fleeing into closets cupboards corners under beds or pianos lacking any other closeness and darkness in which to escape it walking around the corner of the hangar as the challenge came and saw the crack of light under the hangar doors which were not only closed but padlockeda thing never before seen by him or anyone else in this or any squadron himself standing quite still now with the point of the bayonet about six inches from his stomach all right he said what do i do now but the man didnt even answer corporal of the guard he shouted post number four then the corporal appeared second lieutenant levine he said my aeroplanes in this hangar not if youre general haig and your swords in there the corporal said right he said and turned and for a moment he even thought of conventicle the flight sergeant he had been a soldier long enough by now to have learned that there were few if any military situations which the simple cry of sergeant would not resolve it was mainly this of course yet there was a little of something else too the rapport not between himself and conventicle perhaps but between their two racesthe middleaged bogcomplected man out of that race all of whom he had ever known were named evans or morgan except the two or three named deuteronomy or tabernacle or conventicle out of the old testamentthat morose and musical people who knew dark things by simply breathing who seemed to be born without dread or concern into knowledge of and rapport with mans sunless and subterrene origins which had better never have seen light at all whose own misty and musiced names no other men could pronounce even so that when they emerged from their fens and fastnesses into the rational world where men still tried to forget their sombre beginnings they permitted themselves to be designated by the jealous and awesome nouns out of the old fierce hebraic annals in which they as no other people seemed at home as napoleon in austria had had his the childs people with their unpronounceable names fetched before him and said your name is wolf or hoff or fox or berg or schneider according to what they looked like or where they lived or what they did but he considered this only a moment there was only one sure source knowing now that even this one would not be too certain but nothing else remained bridesmans and cowries hut that was one of the dangled prerequisites for being brave enough to get to be a captain half a hut to yourself the major had a whole one cowrie looking at him from the pillow as bridesman sat up in the other cot and lit the candle and told him certainly its not over its so far from over that youre going on jobs tomorrow does that satisfy you all right he said but what happened what is it an armed sentry stopped me at the hangars thirty minutes ago and turned out the guard and the hangar doors were locked and a light inside and i could hear people doing something only i couldnt pass the bayonet and when they drove me away i heard a lorry and saw a torch moving about down at that archie battery this side the village and of course thats fresh ammo being hurried up since archie quit at noon today too and naturally theyll need a lot of ammo to quit with too if i tell you will you let be and go to your hut and go to bed right he said thats all i ever wanted just to know if theyve beat us i want to stand my share too beat us be blowed theres nobody in this war any longer capable of beating anyone unless the americans might in time and welcome cowrie said but bridesman was still talking a french regiment mutinied this morningrefused to go over when theythe frenchbegan to poke about to learn why it seems thatbut its all right how all right it was only their infantry disaffected only troops holding the line but the other regiments didnt do anything the others all seemed to know in advance that the one was going to refuse but all the others did seem to be just waiting about to see what was going to happen to it but theythe frenchtook no chances they pulled the regiment out and replaced it and moved up guns and put down a heavy barrage all along their front just like we did this afternoon to give ourselves time to see what was what thats all how thats all he said cowrie had put a cigarette into his mouth and raised onto one elbow was reaching for the candle when the hand stopped less than a fraction of a second before it moved on what was the hun doing all this time he said quietly so its over its not over bridesman said harshly didnt you just hear what the major said at noon today oh yes he said serenely its over all the poor bloody stinking infantry everywhere frenchmen americans germans us so thats what theyre hiding hiding bridesman said hiding what theres nothing to hide its not over i tell you didnt you just hear me say we have a job tomorrow all right he said its not over how can it be not over then because it isnt what do you think we put down that barrage for todaywe and the french and the americans toothe whole front from the channel inblasting away a half years supply of ammo for except to keep the hun off until we can know what to do know to do what what are they doing in our hangar tonight nothing bridesman said what are they doing in b flights hangar bridesman he said the cigarette pack lay on the packing case which served for a table between the two cots bridesman half turned and reached his hand but before he had touched the pack cowrie lying back on one arm beneath his head without looking around extended the cigarette already burning in his own hand bridesman took it thanks he said he said i dont know he said harsh and strong i dont want to know all i know is we have a job tomorrow and youre on it if youve a good reason for not going say it and ill take someone else no he said goodnight goodnight someone said but it wasnt tomorrow there was nothing tomorrow only dawn and then daylight and then morning no dawn patrol went out because he would have heard it being already and long since awake nor were there any aeroplanes on the tarmac when he crossed to the mess for breakfast and nothing on the blackboard where collyer occasionally saw fit to scrawl things in chalk which no one really ever read himself sitting long at the cleared table where bridesman would more or less have to see him sooner or later provided he wanted to from here he could see across the aerodrome to the blank and lifeless hangars and watch the twohourly relief of the pacing guards through the long comaed forenoon the morning reft of all progress beneath the bland sky and the silence then it was noon he watched the harry tate land and taxi up to the office and switch off and the trench coat get down from the observers seat and remove the helmet and goggles and toss them into the cockpit and draw out the stick and the red and brazen hat then all of them at lunch the general and his pilot and the infantry officer and the whole squadron the first lunch he could remember from which at least one flight and sometimes two were not absent the general saying it not quite as well as the major because it took him longer but saying the same thing its not over not that we needed the french we should simply have drawn back to the channel ports and let the hun have paris it wouldnt be the first time change would have got windy but it wouldnt have been their first time either but thats all past now we have not only kept the hun fooled the french have got their backs into it again call this a holiday since like all holidays it will be over soon and there are some of you i think wont be sorry eithernaming them off because he did keep up with records knew them all thorpe osgood de marchi monaghanwho are doing damned well and will do better because the french have had their lesson now and so next time it will be the long vac proper because when the guns stop next it will be on the other side of the rhine plenty of revs and carry on and no sound though maybe no one expected any everyone following outside to where the harry tates engine was already ticking over and the major helped put the stick and the red hat back into the cockpit and get the helmet out and get it on the general and the general back into the harry tate and the major said shun saluting and the general jerked his thumbed fist upward and the harry tate trundled away then afternoon and nothing either he still sat in the mess where bridesman could see or find him if he liked not waiting now any less than he had been waiting during the forenoon because he knew now that he had not been waiting then had not believed it then not to mention that bridesman had had to look at him at lunch because he had sat right across the table from him the whole squadron did in fact sat or idled about the messthat is the new ones the tyros the huns like himselfvilleneuve blanche even villeneuve which collyer called that sink still out of bounds which factthe out of boundswas probably the first time in all its history that anyone not born there had specifically wanted to go there he could have gone to his hut too there was a letter to his mother in it that he had not finished yet except that now he could not finish it because the cessation of the guns yesterday had not only deleted all meaning from the words but effaced the very foundation of their purpose and aim but he went to the hut and got a book out and lay down on his cot with it perhaps it was simply to show prove to the old flesh the bones and the meat that he was not waiting for anything or perhaps to teach them to relinquish abnegate or perhaps it was not the bones and meat so much as the nerves muscles which had been trained by a government in a serious even though temporary crisis to follow one highly specialised trade then the government passed the crisis solved the dilemma needing it before he had had the chance to repay the cost of the training not glory just to repay the cost the laurel of glory provided it was even moderately leafed had human blood on that was permissible only when motherland itself was at stake peace abolished it and that man who would choose between glory and peace had best let his voice be small indeed but this was not reading gaston de la tour at least deserved to be read by whoever held it open looking at it even lying down so he read peaceful resigned no longer thirsting now now he even had a future it would last forever now all he needed was to find something to do with it now that the only trade he had been taughtflying armed aircraft in order to shoot down or try to other armed aircraftwas now obsolete it would be dinner time soon and eating would exhaust get rid of a little of it four perhaps counting tea even five hours out of each twentyfour if one only remembered to eat slowly enough then eight off for sleeping or even nine if you remembered to go slowly enough about that too would leave less than half to have to cope with except that he would not go to tea or dinner either today he had yet almost a quarterpound of the chocolate his mother had sent last week and whether he preferred chocolate to tea and dinner would not matter because theythe new ones the tyros the hunswould probably be sent back home tomorrow and he would return to london if he must without ribbons on his coat but at least he would not go back with a quarterpound of chocolate melting in his hand like a boy returning half asleep from a market fair and anyone capable of spreading eating and sleeping over fourteen hours out of twentyfour should be able to stretch gaston de la tour over what remained of this comaed and widowed day until it met the night the dark and the sleep then tomorrow it had just gone three pip emma he was not only not waiting for anything it had been twentyfour hours now since he had had to remind himself that he was not waiting for anything when the orderly room corporal stood suddenly in the door of the hut what he said what yes sir the corporal said a patrol sir going up in thirty minutes the whole squadron captain bridesman just said you sir in only thirty minutes he said damn it why couldntright he said thirty minutes thanks because he would have to finish the letter now and it was not that thirty minutes was not long enough to finish it in but that they were not long enough to get back into the mood belief in which the letter had been necessary except for signing it and folding it into the envelope he would not even have needed to get the letter out because he remembered it not dangerous at all really i knew i could fly before i came out and i have got to be pretty good on the range and even captain bridesman admits now that im not a complete menace to life in formation so maybe when i settle down i might be of some value in the squadron after all and what else could one add what else say to a woman who was not only a mother but an only and halforphan mother too which was backward of course but anybody would know what he meant who knew perhaps one of the anybody could even suggest a postscript like this say ps a delightful joke on you they declared a recess at noon two days ago and if you had only known it you would not have needed to worry at all from then until three oclock this afternoon you could have gone out to tea two afternoons with a clear conscience which i hope you did and even stayed for dinner too though i do hope you remembered what sherry always does to your complexion except that there was not even time for that he heard engines looking out he saw three busses outside now in front of the hangar the engines running and mechanics about them and the sentry standing again in front of the closed hangar doors then he saw a strange staffcar on the grass plot beside the office and he wrote love david at the foot of the letter and folded and licked it into the envelope and in the mess again now he saw the majors batman cross toward the office carrying an armful of flying kit apparently bridesman hadnt left the office at all except that a moment later he saw bridesman coming up from the hangars already dressed for the patrol so the gear was not his then the office door opened and bridesman came out saying all right get your and stopped because he already had it maps gloves helmet scarf his pistol inside the knee pocket of the sidcott then they were outside walking toward the three aeroplanes in front of b hangar just three he said who else is going the major bridesman said oh he said why did he pick me i dont know out of a hat i think i can wash you out if you dont like it it wont matter i think he really picked you out of a hat why should i not like it he said then he said i just thought and then stopped thought what bridesman said nothing he said then he was telling it he didnt know why i thought that maybe the major found out about it somehow and when he wanted one of the new blokes on this job he remembered about me telling it that morning when he had been supposed simply to be out practicing contour chasing probably and instead had spent that forty or fifty seconds right down on the carpet with the unarmed aeroplane over the hun trenches or at least what he thought was the hun front line you dont get frightened then its not until later afterward and thenits like the dentists drill already buzzing before you have even opened your mouth youve got to open your mouth and you know youre going to all right only you know at the same time that neither knowing you are going to nor opening it either is going to help because even after you have closed it again the thing will buzz at you again and youll have to open it again the next moment or tomorrow or maybe it wont be until six months from now but it will buzz again and you will have to open again because theres nowhere else you can go he said maybe thats all of it maybe when its too late and you cant help yourself anymore you dont really mind getting killed i dont know bridesman said you didnt get even one bullet hole no he said maybe i shall this time and this time bridesman did stop listen bridesman said this is a job you know what jobs in this squadron are for yes to find huns and then bust them you sound like monaghan oh i just ran up behind and busted the ass off the son of a bitch you do that too bridesman said come on they went on but he had needed only one glance at the three aeroplanes your bus is not back yet he said no bridesman said im taking monaghans then the major came and they took off as he passed the office he saw a smallish closed van turn in from the road but he didnt have time to look then not until he was off and up and from the turn could really look down it was the sort of van provost marshals people used and climbing for formation he saw not one car but two behind the messnot ordinary muddy staff cars but the sort which detached life and horse guards officers on the staffs of corps and armycommanders were chauffeured about in now he drew in opposite bridesman across the majors tailplane still climbing but to the southward so that they would approach the lines squarely and did so still climbing bridesman waggled his wings and turned away and he did likewise long enough to clear the vickers into germany or anyway toward germans and traversed the lewis on its quadrant and fired it off too and closed in again now the major turned back northwest parallel above the front still climbing and nothing below now to reveal expose it as front lines although he hadnt seen it but twice to have learned to know it againonly two kite balloons about a mile apart above the british trenches and two others almost exactly opposite them above the german ones no dust no murk no gout and drift of smoke purposeless and unorigined and convoluted with no sound out of nothing and already fading and already replaced no wink of guns as he had seen them once though perhaps at this height you didnt see flashes anyway nothing now but the correlative to a map looking now as it would look on that day when as the general said the last gun would cease beyond the rhinefor that little space before the earth with one convulsive surge would rush to cover and hide it from the light of day and the sight of man he broke off to turn when the major did they were crossing now still climbing right over the upper british balloon heading straight for the german one then he saw it tooa white salvo bursting well below them and in front and then four single bursts pointing away eastward like four asterisks but he never had time to look where it was pointing because at the same instant german archie burst all around themor would have because the major was diving slightly now going east but still he could see nothing yet except the black hun archie it seemed to be everywhere he flew right through a burst of it cringing shrinking convulsively into himself while he waited for the clang and whine which he had heard before but maybe they were going too fast now he and the major really diving now and he noticed for the first time that bridesman was gone he didnt know what had become of him nor when and then he saw it a twoseater he didnt know what kind because he had never seen a german twoseater in the air before nor any other german for that matter then bridesman came vertically down in front of him and putting his nose down after bridesman he discovered that the major had vanished and forgot that too he and bridesman going almost straight down the german right under them now going west he could see bridesmans tracer going right into it until bridesman pulled out and away then his own tracer though he never could seem to get right on the twoseater before he had to pull out and away too the archie already waiting for him before he was clear even as though the hun batteries were simply shooting it up here without caring whom it hit or even watching to see one actually seemed to burst between his upper and lower righthand planes he thought maybe the reason i dont hear any clang is because this one is going to shoot me down before i have time to then he found the twoseater again that is not the aeroplane but the white bursts of british archie telling him or them where it was and an se it would have to be the major bridesman couldnt possibly have got that far by now diving toward the bursts then bridesman was just off his wingtip again the two of them going full out now in the pocking cloud of black archie like two sparrows through a swirl of dead leaves and then he saw the balloons and noticed or remembered or perhaps simply saw the sun he saw them allthe twoseater apparently emerged neatly and exactly from between the two german balloons and in its aureole of white archie flying perfectly straight and perfectly level on a line which would carry it across nomans land and exactly between the two british ones the major behind and above the twoseater and bridesman and himself perhaps a mile back in their cloud of black archie the four of them like four beads sliding on a string and two of them not even going very fast because he and bridesman were up with the major almost at once and perhaps it was the look on his face the major glancing quickly at him then motioning him and bridesman back into formation but he didnt even throttle back and then bridesman was following him the two of them passing the major and he thought maybe i was wrong maybe hun archie doesnt clang and it was ours i heard that day still thinking that when slightly ahead of bridesman they closed that gap too and flew into the white archie enclosing the twoseater before someone could tell the gunners they could stop now too the last white wisp of it vanishing in the last fading drift about him and bridesman now and there was the twoseater flying straight and level and sedate toward the afternoon sun and he pressed the button and nudged and ruddered the tracer right onto it walking the tracer the whole length of it and returnthe engine the back of the pilots head then the observer sitting as motionless as though in a saloon car on the way to the opera the unfired machine gun slanting back and down from its quadrant behind the observer like a rolled umbrella hanging from a rail then the observer turned without haste and looked right into the tracer right at him and with one hand deliberately raised the gogglesa prussian face a prussian generals face he had seen too many caricatures of the hohenzollern crown prince in the last three years not to know a prussian general when he saw oneand with the other hand put up a monocle at him and looked at him through it then removed the monocle and faced front again then he pulled away and went past there was the aerodrome right under them now until he remembered the archie battery just outside the village where he had seen the torch last night and heard the lorry from the tight vertical turn he could look straight down at the gunners shaking his hand at them and yelling come on come on this is your last chance and slanted away and came back diving walking the tracer right through the gun and the pale still upturned discs of the faces watching him about it as he pulled up he saw another man whom he had not seen before standing just on the edge of the wood behind the battery the gentlest nudge on stick and rudder brought this one squarely into the aldis itself this time and pulling up at last to get over the trees he knew that he should have got something very close to a possible ten somewhere about that ones navel then the aerodrome again he saw the twoseater squaring away to land the two ses above and behind it herding it down he himself was too high even if he had not been much too fast even after the vicious sideslip he might still wipe off the ses frail undercarriage which was easy enough to do even with sedate landings but it held stood up he was down first rolling now and for a moment he couldnt remember where he had seen it then he did remember beginning to turn as soon as he dared someday they would put brakes on them those who flew them now and lived would probably see it and turning a glimpse of brass and scarlet somewhere near the office and the infantry in column coming around the corner of the office he was taxiing fast now back along the tarmac past the hangars where three mechanics began to run toward him until he waved them off taxiing on toward the corner of the field and there it was where he had seen it last week and he switched off and got down the twoseater on the ground too now and bridesman and the major landing while he watched the three of them taxiing on in a clump like three waddling geese toward the office where the scarlet and brass gleamed beautiful and refulgent in the sun in front of the halted infantry but he was running a little heavily now in his flying boots and so the ritual had already begun when he arrivedthe major and bridesman on foot now with the adjutant and thorpe and monaghan and the rest of b flight in the center of them the three poperinghe adcs splendid in scarlet and brass and glittering guards badges behind them the infantry officer with his halted platoon deployed into two open files all facing the german aeroplane bridesman he said but at that moment the major said shun and the infantry officer shouted presentharms and at salute now he watched the german pilot jump down and jerk to attention beside the wing while the man in the observers seat removed the helmet and goggles and dropped them somewhere and from somewhere inside the cockpit drew out a cap and put it on and did something rapidly with his empty hand like a magician producing a card and set the monocle into his eye and got down from the aeroplane and faced the pilot and said something rapid in german and the pilot stood himself back at ease and then snapped something else at the pilot and the pilot jerked back to attention and then with no more haste than when he had removed the helmet but still a little quicker than anyone could have stopped it drew a pistol from somewhere and even aimed it for a second while the rigid pilot he looked about eighteen himself stared not even at the pistols muzzle but at the monocle and shot the pilot through the center of the face and turned almost before the body jerked and began to fall and swapped the pistol to the other gloved hand and had started to return the salute when monaghan jumped across the pilots body and flung the other german back into the aeroplane before bridesman and thorpe caught and held him fool bridesman said dont you know hun generals dont fight strangers strangers monaghan said im no stranger im trying to kill the son of a bitch thats why i came two thousand miles over here to kill them all so i can get to hell back home bridesman he said again but again the major said shun there shun and at salute again he watched the german straighten up he hadnt even lost the monocle and flip the pistol over until he held it by the barrel and extend it butt first to the major who took it and then draw a handkerchief from his cuff and brush off the breast and sleeve of his tunic where monaghan had touched him and look at monaghan for just a second with nothing behind the monocle at all as he put the handkerchief back into the cuff and clicked and jerked as he returned the salute and walked forward straight at the group as though it were not there and he didnt even need to see it part and even scramble a little to get out of the way for him to stride through the three guards officers falling in behind between the two open infantry files toward the mess the major said to collyer move this i dont know whether they want it or not but neither do we here bridesman he said again pah bridesman said spitting hard we shant need to go to the mess ive a bottle in the hut then bridesman overtook him where are you going it will only take a moment he said then apparently bridesman saw noticed the aeroplane too whats wrong with your bus you got down all right nothing he said i left it there because theres an empty petrol tin in the weeds we can set the tail up on the tin was there a faint and rusting gleam in the dying end of day because its over isnt it thats what they want with that hun general of course though why they had to do it this way when all somebody needed was just to hold out a white sheet or tablecloth they must have a tablecloth at pop and surely jerrys got one at his headquarters that he took away from a frenchwoman and somebody owes something for that poor bloodstained taxidriver hewhich was not like the book either he did it backward first he should have unpinned the iron cross from his own coat and hung it on the other one and then shot him you fool bridesman said you bloody fool all right this will only take a moment let it be bridesman said just let it be i just want to see he said then i shall it wont take but a moment will you let it be then will you promise of course what else can i do i just want to seeand set the empty petrol tin in position and lifted the ses tail and swung it around onto the tin and it was just right in a little better than flying angle almost in a flat shallow glide the nose coming down just right and bridesman really saying no now ill be damned if i will then ill have to get he hesitated a second then rapidly cunningly monaghan hell do it especially if i can overtake the van or the staffcar or whichever it is and borrow the jerry generals hat or maybe just the monocle will be enoughno just the pistol to hold in my hand take your own word for it bridesman said you were there you saw what they shot at us and what we were shooting at that twoseater you were right on him for five or six seconds once i watched your tracer rake him from the engine right on back through the monocle so were you he said get in why dont you just let it be i have long ago get in do you call this letting be its like a cracked record on the gramophone isnt it chock the wheels bridesman said he found two chocks for the wheels and steadied the fuselage while bridesman got into the cockpit then he went around to face the nose and it was all right he could see the slant of the cowl and the aldis slanting a little since he was taller than most a little high still but then he could raise himself on his toes and he intended to put his arms over his face anyway in case there was something left of whatever it was they had loaded the cartridges with last night by the time it had travelled twenty feet though he never had actually seen any of them strike bounce off the twoseater and he had been right on top of it for the five or six seconds bridesman had talked about and the airscrew was already in open position so the constantinesco would be working or not working or whatever it was doing when it let bullets pass so all he had to do was line up the tube of the aldis on bridesmans head behind the wind screen except that bridesman was leaning out around the screen talking again you promised thats right he said it will be all right then youre too close bridesman said its still tracer it can still burn you yes he said backing away still facing the little black port out of which the gun shot i wondered how they did that i thought tracer was the bullet itself burning up however did they make tracer without a bullet in it do you know i mean what are they bread pellets maybe no bread would have burned up in the breech maybe they are wood pellets dipped in phosphorus which is a little amusing isnt it our hangar last night locked tight as with an armed guard walking back and forth in the dark and the cold outside and inside somebody maybe collyer a chess player ought to be good with a knife whittling sounds philosophical too and they say chess is a philosophers game or maybe it was a mechanic who will be a corporal tomorrow or a corporal who will be a sergeant tomorrow even if it is over because they can give a corporal another stripe even on the way home or at least before he is demobbed or maybe theyll even still keep the air force since a lot of people came into it out of the cradle before they had time to learn to do anything else but fly and even in peace these ones will still have to eat at least now and then still backing away because bridesman was still waving him back still keeping the aldis aligned out here three years and nothing then one night he sits in a locked hangar with a pen knife and a lapfull of wooden blocks and does what ball nor mccudden nor mannock nor bishop nor none of them ever did brought down a whole german general and get the barnacle at buckingham palace his next leaveexcept that there wont be any theres nothing now to be on leave from and even if there was what decoration will they give for that bridesmanall right he said all right ill cover my face too except that he wouldnt really need to now the line of fire was already slanting into the ground and this much further away it would cross well down his chest and so he took one last sight on the aldis for alignment and bowed his head a little and crossed both arms before his face and said all right then the chattering rattle the dusky rose winking in miniature in the watchcrystal on his lifted wrist and the hard light stinging they were pellets of some sort if he had been three feet from the muzzle instead of about thirty they would have killed him as quickly as actual bullets would have and even as it was he had leaned into the burst not to keep from being beaten back but to keep from being knocked down during whichthe falling backwardthe angle pattern would have walked up his chest and he would probably have taken the last of the burst in his face before bridesman could have stopped it bitter thockthockthockthock on his chest and the slow virulent smell of burning cloth before he felt the heat get it off bridesman was shouting you cant put it out get the sidcott off damn it then bridesman was wrenching at the overall too ripping it down as he kicked out of the flying boots and then out of the overall and the slow invisible smoldering stink are you satisfied now bridesman said are you yes thanks he said its all right nowwhy did he have to shoot his pilot here bridesman said get it away from the bus catching up the overall by one leg as though to fling it away until he caught hold of it wait he said ive got to get my pistol out if i dont theyll charge me with it he took the pistol from the sidcotts knee pocket and dropped it into his tunic pocket now then bridesman said but he held on incinerator he said we cant leave it lying about here all right bridesman said come along ill put it in the incinerator and meet you at the hut bring it on to the hut and let the batman put it in the incinerator its like the cracked record again isnt it he said then bridesman released his leg of the sidcott though he didnt move yet then youll come along to the hut of course he said besides ill have to stop at the hangars and tell them to roll me inbut why did he have to shoot his pilot bridesman because he is a german bridesman said with a sort of calm and raging patience germans fight wars by the rulebooks by the book a german pilot who lands an undamaged german aeroplane containing a german lieutenant general on an enemy aerodrome is either a traitor or a coward and he must die for it that poor bloody bugger probably knew while he was eating his breakfast sausage and beer this morning what was going to happen to him if the general hadnt done it here they would probably shoot the general himself as soon as they got their hands on him again now get rid of that thing and come on to the hut right he said then bridesman went on and at first he didnt dare roll up the overall to carry it then he thought what difference could it possibly make now so he rolled up the overall and picked up his flying boots and went back to the hangars bs was open now and they were just rolling in the majors and bridesmans busses the rulebook wouldnt let them put the german twoseater under a british shed probably but on the contrary it would doubtless compel at least six britons who since the infantry were probably all gone now would be air mechanics unaccustomed both to rifles and having to stop up all night to pass the night in relays walking with guns around it i had a stoppage he told the first mechanic there was a live shell in captain bridesman helped me clear it you can roll me in now yes sir the mechanic said he went on carrying the rolled overall gingerly around the hangars and on in the dusk toward the incinerator behind the mens mess then suddenly he turned sharply again and went to the latrines it would be pitch dark inside unless someone was already there with a torch collyer had a tin candlestick passed going or coming from the latrines cloistral indeed he would look tonsured and with his braces knotted about his waist under his open warm it was dark and the smell of the sidcott was stronger than ever inside he put the flying boots down and unrolled it but even in the pitch dark there was nothing to see only the slow thick invisible burning and he had heard that too a man in b flight last year who had got a tracer between the bones of his lower leg and they were still whittling the bone away as the phosphorus rotted it thorpe told him that next time they were going to take off the whole leg at the knee to see if that would stop it of course the blokes mistake was in not putting off until day after tomorrow say going on that patrol or tomorrow for that matter or today except that collyer wouldnt have let him only how could he have known that a year ago when he himself knew one in the squadron who hadnt discovered it until people shot blank archie at him and couldnt seem to believe it even then rolling up the sidcott again and fumbling for a moment in the pitch dark it wasnt quite dark after you got used to it the canvas walls had gathered a little luminousness as if delayed day would even begin inside them after it was done outdoors until he found the boots outside it was not at all night yet night wouldnt even begin for two or three hours yet and this time he went straight to bridesmans hut pausing only long enough to lay the rolled sidcott against the wall beside the door bridesman was in his shirt sleeves washing on the box between his and cowries beds a bottle of whisky sat between his and cowries toothmugs bridesman dried his hands and without stopping to roll down his sleeves dumped the two toothbrushes from the mugs and poured whisky into them and passed cowries mug to him down with it bridesman said if the whiskys any good at all it will burn up whatever germs cowrie put in it or that youll leave they drank more bridesman said no thanks what will they do with the aeroplanes what will what bridesman said the aeroplanes our busses i didnt have time to do anything with mine but i might have if i had had time you know wash it out taxi it into somethinganother aeroplane standing on the tarmac yours maybe finish it do for two of them at once before they can sell them to south america or the levantine so nobody in a comic opera generals suit can lead the squadrons aeroplanes in some air force that wasnt even in this at all maybe collyerll let me fly mine once more then i shall crash it bridesman was walking steadily toward him with the bottle up the mug bridesman said no thanks i suppose you dont know just when well go home will you drink or wont you bridesman said no thanks all right bridesman said ill give you a choice drink or shut uplet benapoo which will you have why do you keep on saying let be let be what of course i know the infantry must go home firstthe pbi in the mud for four years out after two weeks and no reason to be glad or even amazed that you are still alive because all you came out for is to get your rifle clean and count your iron rations so you can go back in for two weeks and so no reason to be amazed until its over of course they must go home first throw the bloody rifle away forever and maybe after two weeks even get rid of the lice then nothing to do forever more but work all day and sit in pubs in the evenings and then go home and sleep in a clean bed with your wife bridesman held the bottle almost like he was going to strike him with it your words worth damn all up the mug thanks he said he put the mug back on the boxall right he said ive let be then cut along and wash and come to the mess well get one or two others and go to madame milhauds to eat collyer told us again this morning none of us were to leave the aerodrome he probably knows its probably as hard to stop a war as it is to start one thanks for the whisky he went out he could already smell it even before he was outside the hut and he stooped and took up the overall and went to his hut it was empty of course there would probably be a celebration perhaps even a binge in the mess tonight nor did he light the lamp dropping the flying boots and shoving them under his bed with his foot then he put the rolled sidcott carefully on the floor beside the bed and lay down on it lying quietly on his back in that spurious semblance of darkness and the time for sleeping which walls held smelling the slow burning and still there when he heard burk cursing something or someone and the door banged back and burk said holy christ whats that stink its my sidcott he said from the bed while someone lit the lamp its on fire what the bloody hell did you bring it in here for burk said do you want to burn down the hut all right he said swinging his legs over and getting up and then taking up the overall while the others watched him curiously for a moment more de marchi at the lamp still holding the burning match in one hand whats the matter no binge tonight then burk was cursing collyer again even before de marchi said collyer closed the bar he went outside it was not even night yet he could still read his watch twentytwo hours no simple ten oclock pm now because now time was back in mufti too and he went around the corner of the hut and put the overall on the ground beside the wall not too close to it the whole northwest one vast fading church window while he listened to the silence crowded and myriad with tiny sounds which he had never heard before in france and didnt know even existed there because they were england then he couldnt remember whether he had actually heard them in english nights either or whether someone had told him about them because four years ago when such peaceful nightsounds were legal or at least de rigeur he had been a child looking forward to no other uniform save that of the boy scouts then he turned he could still smell it right up to the door and even inside too though inside of course he couldnt really have sworn whether he actually smelled it or not they were all in bed now and he got into pyjamas and put out the lamp and got into bed properly rigid and quiet on his back the snoring had already begunburk always snored and always cursed anyone who told him he didso he could hear nothing but night passing time passing the grains of it whispering in a faint rustling whisper from or into whatever it was it ran from or into and he swung his legs quietly over again and reached under the bed and found the flying boots and put them on and stood up and found his warm quietly and put it on and went out already smelling it before he reached the door and on around the corner and sat down with his back against the wall beside the overall not any darker now than it had been at twentytwo no ten pm now the vast church window merely wheeling slowly eastward until almost before you knew it now it would fill renew with light and then the sun and then tomorrow but they would not wait for that already the long lines of infantry would be creeping in the darkness up out of the savage bitter fatal stinking ditches and scars and caves where they had lived for four years now blinking with amazement and unbelief looking about them with dawning incredulous surmise and he tried listening quite hard because surely he should be able to hear it since it would be much louder noisier than any mere dawning surmise and unbelief the single voice of all the women in the western world from what used to be the russian front to the atlantic ocean and beyond it too germans and french and english and italians and canadians and americans and australiansnot just the ones who had already lost sons and husbands and brothers and sweethearts because that sound had been in the air from the moment the first one fell troops had been living with that sound for four years now but the one which had begun only yesterday or this morning or whenever the actual instant had been from the women who would have lost a son or brother or husband or sweetheart today or tomorrow if it hadnt stopped and now wouldnt have to since it had not his women his mother of course because she had lost nothing and had really risked nothing there hadnt been that much timea sound much noisier than mere surmise so much noisier that men couldnt believe it quite yet even where women could and did believe anything they wanted to making didnt want to nor even need to make no distinction between the sound of relief and the sound of anguish not his mother in the house on the river beyond lambeth where he had been born and lived ever since and from which until he died ten years ago his father would go in to the city each day to manage the london office of a vast american cotton establishment theyhis father and motherhad begun too late if he were the man on whom she was to bestow her womans capacity for fond anguish she the woman for whom as history insistedand from the talk he had had to listen to in messes he was inclined to admit that at least history believed it knew what it was talking aboutmen always had he was to seek garlands or anyway sprigs of laurel at the cannons mouth he remembered it was the only time he and two others were celebrating their commissions pooled their resources and went to the savoy and mccudden came in either just finished getting some more ribbons or some more huns very likely both in fact indubitably both and it was an ovation not of men but of women the three of them watching while women who seemed to them more beautiful and almost as myriad as angels flung themselves upward like living bouquets about that heros feet and how watching they thought it whether they said it aloud or not wait but there hadnt been time there was only his mother still and he thought with despair how women were not moved one jot by glory and when they were mothers too they were even irascible about uniforms and suddenly he knew that his mother would be the noisiest of any anywhere the noisiest of all who had never for one instant had any intention of losing anything in the war and now had been proved in the sight of the whole world to have been right because women didnt care who won or lost wars they didnt even care whether anybody did and then he knew that it really didnt matter not to england ludendorff could come on over amiens and turn for the coast and get into his boats and cross the channel and storm whatever he thought fit between goodwin sands and lands end and bishops rock and take london too and it wouldnt matter because london signified england like the foam signifies the beer but the foam is not the beer and nobody would waste much time or breath grieving nor would ludendorff have time to breathe either or spend gloating because he would still have to envelop and reduce every tree in every wood and every stone in every wall in all england not to mention three men in every pub that he would have to tear down brick by brick to get to them and it would not matter when he did because there would be another pub at the next crossroads with three more men in it and there were simply just not that many germans nor anybody else in europe or anywhere else and he unrolled the sidcott at first there had been a series of little smoldering overlapping rings across the front of it but now it had become one single sprawling ragged loop spreading creeping up toward the collar and down toward the belt and across toward each armpit until by morning the whole front would be gone probably because it was constant steadfast invincible and undeviable you could depend on it as ball had and mccudden and bishop and rhys davies and barker and boelcke and richthofen and immelman and guynemer and nungesser and the americans like monaghan who had been willing to die even before their country was even in it to give them a roster of names to brag about and the troops on the ground in the mud the poor bloody infantryall of them who hadnt asked to be safe nor even to not be let down again tomorrow always by the brass hats who had done the best they could too probably but asked only that the need for the unsafeness and the fact that all of them had dared it and a lot of them had accepted it and in consequence were now no more be held by the nations at paris and berlin and washington and london and rome immune and unchallengeable above all save brave victory itself and as brave defeat to the one of which it would give glory and from the other efface the shame tuesday wednesday the next time anyone might have seen or noticed her to remember would have been at the old eastern city gate and they would have noticed her then only because she had been there so long standing beside the arch and staring at each face as it entered then looking quickly on to the next one even before the first one had passed her but nobody noticed her to remember nobody except her lingered about the gate to notice anything even the ones who were still crowding steadily up to pass through the gate had already entered the city in mind and spirit long before their bodies reached it their anxiety and dread already one with the citys vast and growing reservoir of it while their bodies still choked the slow converging roads they had begun to arrive yesterday tuesday when news of the regiments mutiny and arrest first reached the district and before the regiment itself had even been brought back to chaulnesmont for the old supreme generalissimo himself to decide its fate they continued to pour into the city all that night and this morning they still came on the heels of the regiment in the very dust of the lorries which had rushed it back to the city and into it and through it without stopping coming on foot and in clumsy farm carts to crowd through the gate where the young woman stood scanning each face with strained and indefatigable rapidityvillagers and farmers laborers and artisans and publicans and clerks and smiths other men who in turn had served in the regiment other men and women who were parents and kin of the men who belonged to it now and because of that fact were now under close guard beneath the threat of execution in the prisoners compound on the other side of the townother men and women who but for sheer blind chance and luck might have been the parents and kin this time andsome of themwould certainly be the next it was little they knew on that first day when they left their homes and they would learn but little more from the others on the same mutual errand of desperation and terror whom they met or overtook or were overtaken by before they reached the city only that at dawn yesterday morning the regiment had mutinied refused to make an attack it had not failed in an attack it had simply refused to make one to leave the trench not before nor even as the attack started but afterwardhad with no prewarning no intimation even to the most minor lancecorporal among the officers designated to lead it declined to perform that ritual act which after four years had become as much and as inescapable a part of the formal ritual of war as the grand march which opens the formal ball each evening during a season of festival or carnivalthe regiment had been moved up into the lines the night before after two weeks of rest and refitting which could have disabused even the rawest replacement of what was in store for it let alone the sudden moil and seethe of activity through which it fumbled in the darkness on the way up the dense loom and squat of guns the lightless lurch and crawl of caissons and lorries which could only be ammunition then the gunfire itself concentrated on the enemyheld hill sufficient to have notified both lines for kilometres in either direction that something was about to happen at this point the wirecutting parties out and back and at dawn the whole regiment standing under arms quiet and docile while the barrage lifted from the enemys wire to hurdle his front and isolate him from reinforcement and still no warning no intimation the company and sectionleaders officers and ncos had already climbed out of the trench when they looked back and saw that not one man had moved to follow no sign nor signal from man to man but the entire three thousand spread oneman deep across a whole regimental front acting without intercommunication as one man asreversed of coursea line of birds on a telephone wire all leave the wire at the same instant like one bird and that the general commanding the division of which the regiment was a unit had drawn it out and put it under arrest and at noon on that same day monday all activity on the whole french front and the german one opposite it from the alps to the aisne except air patrols and spaced token artillery salvos almost like signal guns had ceased and by three oclock that afternoon the american and british fronts and the enemy one facing them from the aisne to the sea had done likewise and now the general commanding the division of which the regiment was a unit was sending the regiment back to grand headquarters at chaulnesmont where he himself would appear at three oclock on wednesday afternoon nor did they pause to wonder let alone doubt how an entire civilian countryside managed to know two days in advance not only the purpose and intent but the hour too of a high military staff conference and with the support or at least acquiescence of his own immediate superiorsthe commander of the corps to which the division belonged and of the army to which the corps belongeddemand in person of the old generalissimo permission to execute every man in it that was all they knew now as they hurried toward the cityold people and women and children parents and wives and children and kin and mistresses of the three thousand men whom the old generalissimo at chaulnesmont could destroy tomorrow by merely lifting his fingera whole converging countryside flowing toward the city panting and stumbling aghast and frantic torn not even between terror and hope but only by anguish and terror destinationless even since they had no hope not quitting their homes and fields and shops to hurry to the city but hoicked by anguish and terror out of their huts and hovels and ditches and drawn to the city whether they would or not out of the villages and farms and into the city by simple grief to grief since grief and anxiety like poverty take care of their own to crowd into the already crowded city with no other will and desire except to relinquish their grief and anxiety into the citys vast conglomerate of all the passions and forcesfear and grief and despair and impotence and unchallengeable power and terror and invincible will to partake of and share in all by breathing the same air breathed by all and therefore both by the grieving and the begrieved on one hand and on the other the lone gray man supreme omnipotent and inaccessible behind the carved stone door and the sentries and the three symbolical flags of the hôtel de ville who dealt wholesale in death and who could condemn the whole regiment and miss its three thousand men no more from the myriads he dealt in than he would miss the nod of his head or the reverse of the lifted hand which would save them because they did not believe that the war was over it had gone on too long to cease finish overnight at a moments notice like this it had merely arrested itself not the men engaged in it but the war itself war impervious and even inattentive to the anguish the torn flesh the whole petty surge and resurge of victories and defeats like the ephemeral repetitive swarm and swirl of insects on a dungheap saying hush be quiet a moment to the guns and the cries of the wounded toothat whole ruined band of irredeemable earth from the alps to the sea studded with faces watching in lipless and lidless detachment for a moment a day or two days for the old gray man at chaulnesmont to lift that hand besides it did not matter they had got used to the war now after four years in four years they had even learned how to live with it beside it or rather beneath it as beneath a fact or condition of nature of physical lawsthe privations and deprivations the terror and the threat like the loom of an arrested tornado or a tidal wave beyond a single frail dyke the maiming and dying too of husbands and fathers and sweethearts and sons as though bereavement by war were a simple occupational hazard of marriage and parenthood and childbearing and love and not only just while the war lasted but after it was officially over too as if the only broom war knew or had to redd up its vacated room with was death as though every man touched by even one seconds flick of its mud and filth and physical fear had been discharged only under condition of a capital sentence like a fatal diseaseso does war ignore its own recessment until it has ground also to dust the last cold and worthless cinder of its satiety and the tagends of its unfinished business whether the war had ceased or not the men of the regiment would still have had to die individually before their time but since the regiment as a unit had been responsible for its cessation the regiment would surely have to die as a unit by the old obsolete methods of war if for no other reason than to enable its executioners to check their rifles back into the quartermasters stores in order to be disbanded and demobilised in fact the only thing that could save the regiment would be the resumption of the war which was their paradox their bereavement that by mutinying the regiment had stopped the war it had saved france france england too the whole west since nothing else apparently had been able to stop the germans since the march breakthrough in front of amiens and this was to be its reward the three thousand men who had saved france and the world would lose their lives not in the act of it but only after the fact so that to the men who had saved the world the world they saved would not be worth the price they paid for itnot to them of course the three thousand men in the regiment they would be dead the world the west france all would not matter to them but to the wives and parents and children and brothers and sisters and sweethearts who would have lost all in order to save france and the world they saw themselves no longer as one unit integrated into one resistance one nation mutual in suffering and dread and deprivation against the german threat but solitary one small district one clan one family almost embattled against all that western europe whom their sons and fathers and husbands and lovers were having to save because no matter how much longer the threat of the war might have continued some at least of the lovers and sons and fathers and husbands might have escaped with no more than an injury while now that the terror and the threat were past all of their fathers and lovers and husbands and sons would have to die but when they reached the city they found no placid lake of grieving resignation rather it was a cauldron of rage and consternation because now they learned that the regiment had not mutinied by mutual concord and design either planned or spontaneous but instead had been led cajoled betrayed into revolt by a single squad of twelve soldiers and their corporal that the entire three thousand men had been corrupted into capital crime and through it right up into the shadow of the rifles which would be its punishment by thirteen men four of whom including the corporalleader were not only not frenchmen by birth but not even naturalised frenchmen in fact only one of themthe corporalcould even speak french even the army records did not seem to know what their nationality was their very presence in a french regiment or the french army in france was contradictory and obfuscated though indubitably they had must have got there through or by means of some carelessly reported or recorded foreign legion draft since armies never really lost anything for good once it was described and numbered and dated and countersigned onto a scrap of paper the boot bayonet camel or even regiment might vanish and leave no physical trace but not the record of it and the name and rank and designation of whoever had it last or anyway signed for it last the other nine of the squad were frenchmen but only three of them were less than thirty years old and two of them were over fifty but all nine of them had unimpeachable service records extending back not only to august but on to the day when the oldest of them turned eighteen and was drafted thirtyfive years ago and by the next morning wednesday they knew the rest of it by then this part of it was not even waiting for them to reach the city it was running out to meet them on the thronged converging roads like wind or fire through dry grass how not only warned and alerted by the barrage that an attack was coming the german observation posts must have actually seen the men refuse to leave the trench after their officers yet no counterattack came and how even during their best their priceless opportunity which was during the confusion and turmoil while the revolted and no longer tobetrusted regiment was having to be relieved in broad daylight still the enemy made no countermove not even a barrage on the communication lines where the relieved and the relieving regiments would have to pass each other so that an hour after the regiment had been relieved and put under arrest all infantry activity in the sector had stopped and two hours after that the general commanding the regiments division and his corps commander and their army commander and an american staffcolonel and the british commanderinchiefs chief of staff were behind locked doors with the general commanding the entire group of armies where as report and rumor thickened it emerged that not only the private soldiers in the divisions other three regiments but those in both the divisions flanking it knew in advance that the attack was to be made and that the selected regiment was going to refuse and that staff and provostofficers with their sergeants and corporals were moving fast now spurred by amazement and alarm and incredulity too while the telephones shrilled and the telegraphs chattered and the dispatchriders motorcycles roared in and out of the courtyard not only were the foreign corporal and his strange conglomerate squad known personally to every private in those three divisions but for over two years now the thirteen menthe obscure corporal whose name few knew and even they could not pronounce it whose very presence in the regiment along with that of the other three apparently of the same middleeuropean nationality was an enigma since none of them seemed to have any history at all beyond the day when they had appeared materialised seemingly out of nowhere and nothingness in the quartermasters storeroom where they had been issued uniforms and equipment and the nine others who were authentic and until this morning unimpeachable french men and french soldiers had been spending their leaves and furloughs for two years now among the combattroop restbillets not only throughout the entire french army zone but the american and the british ones too sometimes individually but usually as the intact squadthe entire thirteen three of whom couldnt even speak french and their corporalleader only enough of it to hold his rating visiting for days and sometimes weeks at a time not only among french troops but american and british toowhich was the moment when the inspectors and inquisitors in their belts and tabs and pips and bars and eagles and wreaths and stars realised the not enormity but monstrosity incredibility the monstrous incredibility the incredible monstrosity with which they were confronted the moment when they learned that during three of these twoweek leaveperiods two last year and the third last month less than three weeks ago the entire squad had vanished from france itself vanished one night with their passes and transport and ration warrants from their restbillets and reappeared one morning two weeks later in ranks again with the passes and warrants still unstamped and intactmonstrous and incredible since there was but one place on earth since almost four years now where thirteen men in uniform could have gone without having their papers stamped needing no papers at all in fact only darkness and a pair of wirecutters theythe inquisitors and examiners the inspectorsgeneral and the provostmarshals flanked now by platoons of ncos and mps with pistols riding light to the hand in the unstrapped holsterswere moving rapidly indeed now with a sort of furious calm along among that unbroken line of soiled stained unchevroned and braidless men designated only by serial numbers stretching from alsace to the channel who for almost four years now had been standing in sleepless rotation behind their cocked and loaded rifles in the apertures of that one continuous firestep but who now were not watching the opposite german line at all but as though they had turned their backs on war were watching them the inquisitors the inspectors the alarmed and outraged and amazed until a heliograph in a french observation post began to blink and one behind the german line facing it answered and at noon that monday the whole french front and the german one opposite it fell silent and at three oclock the american and the british fronts and the german one facing them followed suit so that when night fell both the dense subterrene warrens lay as dead as pompeii or carthage beneath the constant watchful arch and plop of rockets and the slow wink and thud of backarea guns so now they had a protagonist for anguishment an object for execration stumbling and panting on that wednesday morning through the kilometres final converging above which the city soared into the sunlight the spires and crenellations of its golden diadem pouring crowding through the old city gates becoming one with that vast subterrene of warrened shadow out of which until yesterday the citys iron and martial splendor had serenely stood but which now had become one seethe and turmoil which had overflowed the boulevard at dawn and was still pouring across the city after the fleeing lorries as the lorries sped across the city they soon outdistanced the crowd though when its vanguard emerged also onto the sunny plain beyond the lorries were in sight again fleeing in a sucking swirl of primrosecolored dust toward the camouflagepainted huddle of the prisoncompound a kilometre and a half away but for a moment the crowd seemed unable to discern or distinguish the lorries it stopped bunching onto itself like a blind worm thrust suddenly into sunlight recoiling into arrestment so that motion itself seemed to repudiate it in one fleeing ripple like a line of invisible wind running down a windrow of wheat then they distinguished or located the speeding dust and broke surged not running now becauseold men and women and childrenthey had run themselves out crossing the city and no longer shouting now either because they had spent themselves voiceless too but hurrying panting stumbling beginningnow that they were clear of the cityto spread out fanwise across the plain so that already they no longer resembled a worm but rather again that wave of water which had swept at dawn across the place de ville they had no plan only motion like a wave fanned out now across the plain theyor itseemed to have more breadth than depth like a wave seeming as they approached the compound to increase in speed as a wave does nearing the sand on until it suddenly crashed against the wire barrier and hung for an instant and then burst split into two lesser waves which flowed in each direction along the fence until each spent itself and that was all instinct anguish had started them motion had carried all of them for an hour and some of them for twentyfour and brought them here and flung them like a cast of refuse along the fence itthe compoundhad been a factory once back in the dead vanished days of what the nations called peace a rectangle of brick walls covered with peaceful ivy then converted last year into a training and replacementdepot by the addition of half a hundred geometric plankandpaper barracks composed of material bought with american money and sawn into numbered sections by american machines in america and shipped overseas and clapped up by american engineers and artisans into an eyesore monument and portent of a nations shocking efficiency and speed and converted again yesterday into a manproof pen for the mutinied regiment by the addition of barricades of electrified wire and searchlight towers and machinegun platforms and pits and an elevated catwalk for guards french sappers and service troops were still weaving more barricades and stringing more of the lethal wire to crown them and then abandoned them leaving them lying along the barrier in an inextricable mass like victims being resurrected after a holocaust staring through the taut vicious unclimbable strands beyond which the regiment had vanished as completely as though it had never existed while all circumambiencethe sunny spring the jocund morning the larkloud sky the glinting pristine wire which even when close enough to be touched still had an appearance gossamer and ephemeral like christmas tinsel giving to the working parties immersed in its coils the inconsequential air of villagers decorating for a parish festival the empty parade and the blank lifeless barracks and the senegalese guarding them lounging haughtily overhead along the catwalks and lending a gaudy theatrical insouciance to the raffish shabbiness of their uniforms like that of an american blackface minstrel troupe dressed hurriedly out of pawnshopsseemed to muse down at them contemplative inattentive inscrutable and not even interested and that was all here they had wanted to come for twentyfour hours now and here at last they were lying like the cast of spent flotsam along the fence not even seeing the wire against which they lay let alone anything beyond it for the halfminute perhaps which it took them to realise not that they had had no plan when they came here nor even that the motion which had served in lieu of plan had been motion only so long as it had had room to move in but that motion itself had betrayed them by bringing them here at all not only in the measure of the time it had taken them to cover the kilometre and a half between the city and the compound but in that of the time it would take them to retrace back to the city and the place de ville which they comprehended now they should never have quitted in the first place so that no matter what speed they might make getting back to it they would be too late nevertheless for still another half minute they lay immobile against the fence beyond which the fatigue parties wrestling slowly among their interminable tinsel coils paused to look quietly and incuriously back at them and the gaudy senegalese lounging in lethargic disdain among their machine guns above both the white people engaged in labor inside the fence and the ones engaged in anguish outside it smoked cigarettes and stroked idly the edges of bayonets with broad dark spatulate thumbs and didnt bother to look at them at all nor could even the aviator stationed and motionless in the hard blue wind have said exactly where among them the facingabout began as like the blind headless earthbrute which apparently without any organ either to perceive alarm or select a course to evade it can move at instantaneous notice and instantaneous speed in either direction the crowd began to flow back to the city turning and beginning to move all at one instant as birds do hurrying again weary and indefatigable indomitable in their capacity not alone for endurance but for frenzy as well streaming immediately once more between two files of troops stretching the whole distance back to the cityapparently a whole brigade of cavalry this time drawn up and facing across the cleared path a like number of infantry without packs again but with bayonets still fixed and with grenades too now with at one point the nozzle and looped hose of a flame thrower and at the far the city end of the cleared path the tank again halfseen beyond the arch of the gate like a surly nottoocourageous dog peering from its kennel without seeming to have remarked either the arrival of the troops nor to notice let alone have any curiosity about their presence now nor did the troops pay any attention to the people alerted of course but actually almost lounging on the horses and the grounded rifles while the crowd poured between them as though to the troops themselves and to those who had ordered them here the crowd was like the herd of western cattle which once got into motion about its own vortex is its own warrant both of its own security and of the publics peace they recrossed the city back into the place de ville filling it again right up to the speartipped iron fence beyond which the three sentries flanked the blank door beneath the three morningwindy flags they still crowded into the place long after there was no more room still convinced that no matter how fast they had come back from the compound they would be too late knowing that no courier carrying the order for the execution could possibly have passed them on the road yet convinced that one must indubitably have done so yet they still crowded in as if the last belated ones could not accept the backpassed word but must see or try to see for themselves that they had missed the courier and were too late until even if they had wished to stream stumble pant back to the compound and at least be where they could hear the volley which would bereave them there would have been no room to turn around in and begin to run immobilised and fixed by their own density in that stone sink whose walls were older than clovis and charlemagneuntil suddenly it occurred to them that they could not be late it was impossible for them to be late that no matter what errors and mistakes of time or direction or geography they might make they could no more be late for the execution than they could prevent it since the only reason for the whole vast frantic and anguished influx to the city was to be there when the regiments division commander arrived to ask the old gray general behind the closed stone door facing them to allow him to have the regiment shot and the division general was not even due there until three oclock this afternoon so all they needed to do now was just to wait it was a little after nine oclock now at ten three corporals an american a briton and a frenchman flanked each by an armed soldier of his nation came out of the archway from the rear of the hôtel and exchanged each the sentry of his nation and marched the relieved man back through the archway then it was noon their shadows crept in from the west and centered the same three corporals came with three fresh sentries and relieved the three posts and went away it was the hour when in the old dead time called peace men went home to eat and rest a little perhaps but none stirred their shadows crept eastward lengthening again at two oclock the three corporals came for the third time the three sets of three paced and stamped for the third time through the twohourly ritual and departed this time the car came so fast up the boulevard that it outstripped its own heralding the crowd had only time to press frantically back and let it enter the place and then anneal behind it as it shot across the place and stopped before the hôtel in a bursting puff of dust from its clapped to brakes it was a staff car also but stained with dust and caked with dried mud too since it had come not only from the army zone but out of the lines themselves even if its pennon did bear the five stars of an army commander though after these four years even the children read that much and if it had flown no pennon at all even the children would have recognised two of the men in itthe squat bullchested man who commanded the regiments division who was already beginning to stand up before the car stopped and the tall scholarlylooking man who would be the division commanders armygroup commanders chiefofstaff the division commander springing out of the car before the orderly beside the driver in the front seat had time to get down and open the tonneau door and already chopstriding his short stiff cavalry legs toward the blank sentryflanked entrance to the hôtel before the staff officer had even begun to move then the staff officer rose too taking up a longish object from the seat beside him and in the next second theythe crowdhad recognised it swaying forward out of their immobilised recoil and making a sound now not of execration because it was not even directed at the division commander even before they learned about the foreign corporal they had never really blamed him and even with the corporal although they could still dread the division commander as the postulate of their fear and the instrument of their anguish they had not blamed him not only a french soldier but a brave and faithful one he could have done nothing else but what he was doing believed nothing else except what he believed since it was because of such as he that france had endured this long surrounded and embattled by jealousy and envya soldier that not only his own honor and that of his division but the honor of the entire profession of command from files and squads to armies and groups of them had been compromised a frenchman that the security of the motherland itself had been jeopardised or at least threatened later afterward it would seem to them some of them that during the four or five seconds before they recognised the significance of what the staff officer had taken up from the seat of the car there had been a moment when they had felt for him something almost like pity not only a frenchman and a soldier but a frenchman and a soldier who had to be a man first to have been a frenchman and become a soldier yet who to gain the high privilege of being a brave and faithful frenchman and soldier had had to forfeit and abdicate his right in the estate of manwhere theirs would be only to suffer and grieve his would be to decree it he could share only in the bereaving never in the grief victim like they of his own rank and high estate then they saw what the staff officer had in his hand it was a sabre hethe staff officerhad two wearing one buckled to his ordnance belt and carrying one its harness furled about the hilt and sheath which he was tucking under his arm as he too descended from the car and even the children knew what that meant that the division commander too was under arrest and now they made the sound it was as though only now for the first time had they actually realised that the regiment was going to diea sound not even of simple agony but of relinquishment acceptance almost so that the division commander himself paused and turned and they seemed to look at see him too for the first timevictim not even of his rank and high estate but like them of that same instant in geography and in time which had destroyed the regiment but with no rights in its fate solitary kinless alone pariah and orphan both from them whose decree of orphanage he would carry out and from them whom he would orphan repudiated in advance by them from whom he had bought the high privilege of endurance and fidelity and abnegation with the forfeiture of his birthright in humanity in compassion and pity and even in the right to diestanding for a moment yet looking back at them then turned already chopstriding again toward the stone steps and the blank door the staff officer with the furled sabre under his arm following the three sentries clashing to present arms as the division commander strode up the steps and past them and himself jerked open the doors black yawn before anyone else could have moved to do it and enteredthe squat short figure kinless indomitable and doomed vanishing rigidly and without a backward look across that black threshold as though to the massed faces and eyes watching into abyss or into hell and now it was too late if they could have moved they might at least have reached the compound wire in time to hear the knell now because of their own immobilisation they would have only the privilege of watching the executioner prepare the empty rope in a moment now the armed couriers and outriders would appear and kick into life the motorcycles waiting in the areaway the cars would draw up to the door and the officers themselves would emergenot the old supreme general not the two lesser ones not even the division commander compelled to that last full measure of expiation by watching the doom whose mouthpiece he had beennot any of these but the provostmarshals the specialists they who by avocation and affinity had been called and as by bishops selected and trained and dedicated into the immutable hierarchy of war to be majordomos to such as this to preside with all the impunity and authority of civilised usage over the formal orderly shooting of one set of men by another wearing the same uniform lest there be flaw or violation in the right trained for this moment and this end as racehorses are brought delicately with all mans skill and knowledge and care up to the instant of the springing barrier and the grandstands roar of st leger or derby the pennoned staff cars would roar away rapid and distancing feeding them fading dust once more back to the compound which they knew now they should never have left even if they could have moved only by the most frantic speed could they more than reach the compound fence in time merely to hear and see the clapping away of echoes and the wisping away of smoke which made them orphaned and childless and relict but now they could not even move enough to face about the whole place one aspic of gaped faces from which rose that sound not yelling but half murmuring and half wailing while they stared at the gray tomblike pile into which the two generals in their panoply and regalia and tools of glory had vanished as into a tomb for heroes and from which when something did emerge it would now be deathglaring at it anguished and aghast unable to move anywhere unless the ones in front might perhaps fling themselves upon and beneath the cavalcade before it could start and so destroy it and dying themselves with it bequeath to the doomed regiment at least that further span of breathing comprised in the time necessary to form a new one but nothing happened a courier did appear after a while from the archway but he was only an ordinary dispatchrider and alone his whole manner declared that he had no concern whatever in anything regarding them or their trouble he didnt even look at them so that the sound never too loud ceased while he straddled one of the waiting motorcycles and kicked it to life and moved away not even in the direction of the compound but toward the boulevard pushing the popping mechanism along between his straddled legs since in the crowd there was no chance whatever of running it fast enough to establish its balance the crowd parting just enough to let him through and then closing behind him again his urgent constant adjurations for passage marking his progress lonely urgent and irritable like the crying of a lost wildfowl after a while two more came out identical even to the air of private and leisurely independence and departed on two more of the machines their cries too marking their infinitesimal and invisible progress give way you bastards offspring of sheep and camels and that was all then it was sunset as they stood in the turning flood of night the ebb of day rang abruptly with an orderly discordant diapason of bugles orderly because they all sounded at once discordant because they sounded not one call but three the battre aux champs of the french the last post of the english the retreat of the americans beginning inside the city and spreading from cantonment and depot to cantonment and depot rising and falling within its own measured bruit as the bronze throat of orderly and regulated war proclaimed and affirmed the end of day clarion and sombre above the parade rite of mount and stand down as the old guards custodians of today relinquished to tomorrows the six sergeants themselves appearing this time each with his old guard or his new the six files in ordered tramp and wheel facing each its rigid counterpart juxtaposed the barked commands in the three different tongues ringing in the same discordant unison as the bugles in staccato poste and riposte as the guards exchanged and the three sentries of the new ones assumed the posts then the sunset gun went from the old citadel deliberate and profound as if a single muffled drumstick had been dropped once against the inverted bowl of hollow and resonant air the sound fading slowly and deliberately until at last with no suture to mark its annealment it was lost in the murmur of bunting with which the flags bright blooms of glory myriad across the embattled continent sank windless again down they were able to move now the fading whisper of the gun and the descending flags might have been the draining away of what had been holding them gelid there would even be time to hasten home and eat and then return so they were almost running walking only when they had to and running again when they could wan indomitable and indefatigable as the mornings ebb flowed back through the twilight the darkling the nightannealing city toward the warrens and tenements where it had risen they were like the recessed shift out of a factory furiously abridging the ordered retinue of day and dark producing shells say for a retreating yet unconquered army their eyes bloodshot from the fumes their hair and garments stinking with the reek hurrying to eat and then return already eating the waiting food while they still ran toward it and already back at the clanking flashing unstopping machines while still chewing and swallowing the food they would not taste tuesday wednesday wednesday night it was late spring of when the runner joined the battalion the whole brigade had been moved from flanders down into picardy in billets near amiens resting and refitting and receiving replacements to be an integer in what would be known afterward as the first battle of the sommean affair which would give even those who had survived to remember loos and the canal not only something to blench for but the discovery that something even remained to blench with he had debarked that same dawn from the dover leave packet a lorry had given him a lift from boulogne he got directions from the first man he met and in time entered the brigade office with his posting order already in his hand expecting to find a corporal or a sergeant or at most the brigade adjutant but found instead the brigadier himself sitting at the desk with an open letter who said afternoon as you were a moment will you the runner did so and watched enter a captain whom he was to know as commander of one of the companies in the battalion to which he would be assigned followed by a thin wiry surlylooking private who even to the runners first glance seemed to have between his bowed legs and his hands the shape of a horse the brigadier saying pettishly stand at ease stand at ease then opened the folded letter and glanced at it then looked at the private and said this came by special courier this morning from paris someone from america is trying to find you someone important enough for the french government to have located you through channels and then send a special courier up from paris someone named and glanced at the letter again reverend tobe sutterfield and now the runner was watching the private too already looking at him in time not only to hear but to see him say quick and harsh and immediately final no sir the captain prompted no what the brigadier said an american a blackamoor minister you dont know who it is no the private said he seemed to think you might say that he said to remind you of missouri no the private said rigid and harsh and final i was never in missouri i dont know anything about him say sir the captain said thats your last word the brigadier said yes sir the private said all right the brigadier said carry on then they were gone and rigid at attention he the runner felt rather than saw the brigadier open the brigade order and begin to read it and then look up at himno movement of the head at all merely an upward flick of the eyes steady for a moment then down to the order again thinking the runner quietly not this time theres too much rank thinking it wont even be the colonel but the adjutant which by ordinary could have been as much as two weeks later since a runner formally assigned to a combat battalion his status was the same as any other member of it and he too would be officially resting until they went back up the lines and except for coincidence probably would have been reporting the runner not to the battalion sergeantmajor but to coincidence entering his assigned billet two hours later and in the act of stowing his kit into a vacant corner saw again the man he had seen two hours ago in the brigadiers officethe surly almost insubordinate stableauraed private who by his appearance would have pined and died one day after he was removed further from whitechapel than a newmarket paddock perhaps yet who was not only important enough to be approached through official channels by some american individual or agent or agency himself or itself important enough to use the french government for messenger but important enough to repudiate the approachseated this time on a bunk with a thick leather moneybelt open on one knee and a small dirty dogeared notebook on the other and three or four other privates facing him in turn to each of which he counted out a few french notes from the moneybelt and then made a notation with the stub of a pencil in the notebook and the next day the same scene and the day after that and the one after that directly after the morning parade for rollcall and inspection the faces different faces and varying in number two or three sometimes only one but always one the worn moneybelt getting a little thinner but apparently inexhaustible anyway bottomless the pencil stub making the tedious entries in the grimed notebook then the fifth day after noon mess it was payday and approaching the billet for a moment the runner thought wildly that part of the pay parade was taking place there a line a queue of men extending out into the street waiting to creep one by one inside so that the runner had trouble entering his own domicile to stand now and watch the whole affair in reverse the customers clients patientswhatever they werenow paying the grimed frayed wads of french notes back into the moneybelt the tedious pencil stub still making the tedious entries and still standing there watching when the orderly whom he had seen that first morning in the brigade anteroom entered and broke through the line saying to the man on the bunk come on youre for it this time its a bleeding f ing motorcar from paris with a bleeding f ing prime minister in itwatching the runner the man on the bunk without haste stow the notebook and the pencilstub into the moneybelt and strap it up and turn and roll the belt into the blanket behind him and rise and follow the orderly the runner speaking to the nearest of the now broken and dispersing line what is it whats the money for hes gone now why dont you just help yourselves while hes not here to put it down against you and still getting only the watchful secretive already dispersing stares and not waiting even for that himself outside too now in the cobbled street and saw that too one of the long black funereal french motorcars such as high government officials use with a uniformed driver and a french staffcaptain in the front seat and a british one and a thin negro youth on the two small jump seats and behind them in the rear seat a middleaged woman in rich furs who could be nothing but a rich american the runner did not recognise her though almost any frenchman would since her money partially supported a french air squadron in which her only son was a pilot and a frenchman who was not the prime minister but the runner did recognise this was at least a high cabinet secretary for something and sitting between them an old negro in a worn brushed tophat with the serene and noble face of an idealised roman consul the owner of the moneybelt rigid and wooden staring but at nothing saluting but saluting no one just saluting then rigid and wooden again and ten feet away while the old negro man leaned speaking to him then the old negro himself descended from the car the runner watching that too and not only the runner but the entire circumambience the six people still in the car the orderly who had fetched the man from the bunk the thirtyodd men who had been in the creeping line when the orderly broke through it having followed into the street to stand before the billet door watching too perhaps waiting the two of them drawn aside now the owner of the moneybelt still rigid wooden invincibly repudiant while the serene and noble head the calm imperial chocolatecolored face still talked to him murmured barely a minute then the negro turned and went back to the car and got into it the runner not waiting to watch that either already following the white man back toward the billet the waiting group before the door parting to let him through then crowding in after him until the runner stopped the last one by touching grasping his sleeve the money the runner said what is it its the association the man said all right all right the runner said almost testily how do you get it can anybody right the man said you take ten bob then on the next payday you begin paying him sixpence a day for thirty days if youre still alive the runner said right the other said when you have paid up you can start over again but suppose youre not the runner said but this time the man merely looked at him so that he said almost pettishly again all right all right im not really that stupid to still be alive a year from now is worth six hundred percent of anything but still the man looked at him with something so curious in his face behind his eyes that the runner said quickly yes what youre new the other said yes the runner said i was in london last week why the rate aint so high if youre a the voice stopping ceasing the eyes still watching him so curiously so intently that it seemed to the runner that his own gaze was drawn as though by some physical force down the mans side to where his hand hung against his flank at which instant the hand flicked out in a gesture a signal so brief so rapid before it became again immobile against its owners khaki leg that the runner could hardly believe he had seen it what the runner said what but now the face was closed inscrutable the man was already turning away why dont you ask him what you want to know he said he wont bite yer he wont even make you take the ten bob if you dont want the runner watched the long car back and fill in the narrow street to return wherever it came from nor had he even seen the battalion adjutant yet who at worst could be no more than captain and very likely not even as old as he so the preliminaries would not take long probably no more than this what hollywood in a few more years would coin a word for doubletake then the adjutant oh youre that one why havent you got up your mc or did they take that back too along with the pip then he i dont know could i wear an mc on this then the adjutant i dont know either what else did you want youre not due here until orderly room monday then he would ask who by now had divined who the rich american woman would be since for two years now europefrance anywayhad been full of themthe wealthy philadelphia and wall street and long island names whose money supported ambulance units and air squadrons in the french frontthe committees organizations of officially nonbelligerent amateurs by means of which america fended off not germans but war itself he could ask then saying but why here granted that they have one with at the head of it an old blackamoorwho looks like a nonconformist preacher why did the french government send him up here in a state motorcar for a twominute visit with a private soldier in a british infantry battalionoh yes he could ask getting nothing probably except the old negros name which he already knew and hence was not what he lacked needed must have if there were peace which took another three days from that monday when reporting at orderly room he became officially a member of the battalion family and could cultivate the orderly corporal in charge of the battalion correspondence and so hold at last in his own hands the official document signed by the chiefofstaff at poperinghe containing not only the blackamoors name but the rich and organrolling one of the organization committee which he headed les amis myriades et anonymes à la france de tout le mondea title a designation so embracing so richly sonorous with grandeur and faith as to have freed itself completely from man and his agonies majestic in empyrean as weightless and palpless upon the anguished earth as the adumbration of a cloud and if he had hoped to get anything at all even that much let alone anything more from the owner of the moneybelt he would have been wrong indeed there which the failure cost him five shillings in francs hunting the man down and stopping him by simply getting in front of him and standing there saying baldly and bluntly who is reverend tobe sutterfield then still standing there for better than another minute beneath the harsh spent vituperation until he could say at last are you finished now then i apologise all i really want is ten bob and watched his name go down into the little dogeared book and took the francs which he would not even spend so that the thirty sixpences would go back to their source in the original notes but at least he had established a working a speaking relationship because of his orderlyroom contact he was able to use it not needing to block the way this time to speak best keep this a staff matter though i think you should know were going back in tonight the man looked at him something is going to happen they have brought too many troops down here its a battle the ones who thought up loos cant rest on their laurels forever you know still the man only looked at him its your money so you can protect yourself who knows you may be one of the ones to stay alive instead of letting us bring you only sixpence a day demand it all at once and bury it somewhere still the man just looked at him not even with contempt suddenly the runner thought with humility abasement almost he has ethics like a banker not to his clients because they are people but because they are clients not pity he would bankrupt anyallof them without turning a hair once they had accepted the gambit its ethics toward his vocation his trade his profession its purity no its even more than that its chastity like caesars wifewatching it the battalion went in that night and he was right when it came out againthe sixtyodd percent which was left of itit bore forever across its memory like the sear of a heated poker the name of the little stream not much wider in places than a good downwind spit and the other somme namesarras and albert bapaume and st quentin and beaumont hamelineradicable to last as long as the capacity for breathing would the capacity for tearssaying the runner this time you mean that all that out there is just a perfectly healthy and normal panic like a marketcrash necessary to keep the body itself strong and hale that the ones who died and will still die in it were allotted to do so like the little brokers and traders without wit or intelligence or perhaps just enough money backing whose high destiny it is to commit suicide in order to keep the edifice of finance solvent and still the other only looked at him not even contemptuous not even with pity just waiting until the runner had finished this time then he said well do you want the tanner or dont you the runner took the money the francs he spent them this time seeing for the first time thinking how finance was like poetry demanding requiring a giver and a taker too in order to endure singer and listener banker and borrower buyer and seller both ethical unimpugnable immaculate in devotion and faith thinking i was the one who failed i was the debaser the betrayer spending the money this time usually at one blow in modest orgies of food and drink for whoever would share it with him fulfilling his sixpencebysixpence contract then borrowing the ten shillings again with the singlemindedness of a roman catholic at his devotions or expiating a penance through that fall that winter it would be spring soon and now his leave would be coming up again and he thought quietly without grief without regret of course i could go back home back to london because what else can you do to a cashiered subaltern in this year of our lord one nine one seven but give him a rifle and a bayonet and i already have those when suddenly and peacefully he knew what he would do with that freedom that liberty which he no longer had any use for because there was no more any place for it on the earth and this time he would ask not for shillings but pounds setting its valuation not in shillings but in pounds not only on his pilgrimage back to when and where the lost free spirit of man once existed but on that which made the pilgrimage possible asking for ten of them and himself setting the rate and interest at ten shillings a day for thirty days going to paris to celebrate your f ing dcm are you the other said why not he said and took the ten pounds in francs and with the ghost of his lost youth dead fifteen years now he retraced the perimeter of his dead life when he had not only hoped but believed concentric about the oncesylvan vale where squatted the gray and simple stone of saint sulpice saving for the last the narrow crooked passageway in which he had lived for three years passing the sorbonne but only slowing not turning in and the other familiar left bank placesquai and bridge gallery and garden cafewhere he had spent his rich leisure and his frugal money it was not until the second solitary and sentimental morning after coffee and figaro today was april eighth an english liner this time practically full of americans had been torpedoed yesterday off ireland he thought peacefully tearless theyll have to come in now we can destroy both hemispheres now at the deux magots taking the long way through the luxembourg gardens again among the nursemaids and maimed soldiers another spring perhaps by this autumn even there would be american uniforms too and the stained effigies of gods and queens into the rue vaugirard already looking ahead to discern the narrow crevice which would be the rue servandoni and the garret which he had called home perhaps monsieur and madame gargne patron and patronne would still be there to greet him when he saw itthe banner the lettered cloth strip fastened above the archway where the ducal and princely carriages had used to pass affirming its grandiose and humble declaration out of the old faubourg of aristocrats les amis myriades et anonymes à la france de tout le monde and already one in a thin steady trickle of peoplesoldiers and civilians men and women old and youngentered something which seemed to him afterward like a dream a vestibule an anteroom where a strong hale plain woman of no age in a white coif like a nun sat knitting who said monsieur monsieur le président madame sil vous plaît monsieur le révérend sutterfield and who the woman said again with no pause in the click and flick of the needles monsieur le chef de bureau madame le directeur monsieur le réverénd sutterfield ah the woman said monsieur tooleyman and still knitting rose to precede guide conduct him a vast marblefloored hall with gilded cornices and hung with chandeliers and furnished crowded heterogeneous and without order with wooden benches and the sort of battered chairs you rent for a few sous at band concerts in parks murmurous not with the voices but as though with the simple breathing the inspiration and suspiration of the peoplethe soldiers maimed and unmaimed the old men and women in black veils and armbands and the young women here and there carrying a child against or even beneath the complete weeds of bereavement and grievingsingly or in small groups like family groups about the vast room murmurous also still of dukes and princes and millionaires facing the end of the room across which was suspended another of the cloth banners the lettered strip like that one above the gateway and lettered like it les amis myriades et anonymes à la france de tout le monde not looking at the banner not watching it not like people in church it was not subdued enough for that but perhaps like people in a railway station where a train has been indefinitely delayed then the rich curve of a stairway the woman stopping and standing aside still knitting and not even looking up to speak prière de monter monsieur and he did so who had traversed a cloud now mounting to the uttermost airy nepenthelene pinnacle a small chamber like a duchesss boudoir in heaven converted temporarily to represent a business office in a charade a new innocent and barren desk and three hard and innocent chairs and behind the desk the serene and noble face in its narrow clasp of white wool rising now from the horizonblue of an infantry corporals uniform which by its look had lain only yesterday still on a supply sergeants shelves and slightly behind him the polethin negro youth in the uniform and badges of a french sublieutenant which looked almost as new himself facing them across it the voices also serenely congruous and inconsequential like dream yes it used to be sutterfield but i changed it to make it easier for the folks from the association oh tout le monde yes tooleyman so you came up that day to see i was about to say friend yes he aint quite ready yet it was to see if he needed money money he the horse the old negro said that they claimed we stole except that we couldnt have stole it even if we had wanted to because it never belonged to no man to be stole from it was the worlds horse the champion no thats wrong too things belonged to it not it to things things and people both he did i did all three of us did before it was over he the runner said mistairy mist what the runner said harry the youth said thats how he pronounced it oh the runner said with a sort of shame of course mistairy thats right the old negro said he kept on trying to get me to say just airy but i reckon i was too old so he told it what he had seen watched at first hand and what he had divined from what he had seen watched which was not all the runner knew that thinking a protagonist if im to run with the hare and be the hounds too i must have a protagonist even while the youth speaking for the first time answered that it was the deputy marshal that sent the new orleans lawyer the who the runner said the federal deputy marshal the youth said the head man of the folks chasing us all right the runner said tell me it was two years before the war the horse was a threeyearold running horse but such a horse that even the price which the argentine hideandwheat prince paid for it at the newmarket sale although an exceptional one was not an outrageous one its groom was the sentry the man with the ledger and the moneybelt he went out to america with it whereupon within the next twentyfour months three things happened to him which changed completely not only his life but his character too so that when late in he returned to england to enlist it was as though somewhere behind the mississippi valley hinterland where within the first three months he had vanished a new man had been born without past without griefs without recollections he was not merely included in the sale of the horse he was compelled into it and not by the buyer nor even the seller but by the sold the chattel the horse itself with an imperiousness not even to be temporised with let alone denied it was not because he was the exceptional groom which he might have been nor even the first rate one which he actually was it was because there had developed apparently on sight between the man and the animal something which was no mere rapport but an affinity not from understanding to understanding but from heart to heart and glands to glands so that unless the man was present or at least nearby the horse was not even less than a horse it was no longer a horse at all not at all intractable and anything but unpredictable because it was quite predictable in fact not only dangerous but in effect for all its dedicated and consecrated end and purposethe long careful breeding and selecting which finally produced it to be sold for the price it brought to perform the one rite for which it had been shapedworthless letting none save the one man enter the same walls or fence with it to groom or feed it no jockey or exercise boy to approach and mount it until the man bade it and even then with the rider actually up not even running untilwhatever the communication was voice touch whateverthe man had set it free so the argentine bought the groom too for a sum left in escrow in a london bank to become the grooms on his return to england after being formally discharged by the horse of course since nothing else could which the horse in the end discharged and absolved them all the old negro telling this part of it since this was where hetheyhimself and his grandsoncame into itthe horse which before the groom came into its life merely won races but which after his advent began to break records three weeks after it first felt his hand and heard his voice it set a mark the race was named the sillinger the old negro said it was like our derby at home which seven years later was still standing and in its first south american race although only two weeks out of the ship after a month and a half at sea it set one not likely to be touched at any time not nowhere at no time by no horse the old negro said and the next day it was bought by a united states oil baron for a price which even the argentine millionaire could not refuse and two weeks later landed in new orleans where the old negro a preacher on sunday and the rest of the week a groom and hostler in the new owners kentucky breeding and training stables met it and two nights later the train drawing the van containing the horse and the two grooms the white one and the black one plunged through a floodweakened trestle out of which confusion and mischance were born the twentytwo months from which the english groom emerged at last a practicing baptist a mason and one of his times most skillful manipulators of or players at dice sixteen of the twentytwo were the months during which the five separately organised though now grimly unified groupsthe federal government the successive state police forces and the railways and the insurance companys and the oil barons private detectivespursued the four of themthe crippled horse and the english groom and the old negro and the twelveyearold child who rode itup and down and back and forth through the section of the mississippi watershed between illinois and the gulf of mexico and kansas and alabama where on three legs the horse had been running in remote backcountry quarterraces and winning most of them the old negro telling it grave and tranquil serenely and peacefully inconsequential like listening to a dream until presently the runner five years afterward was seeing what the federal deputy marshal had five years ago while in the middle of it not a theft but a passion an immolation an apotheosisno gang of opportunists fleeing with a crippled horse whose value even whole had ceased weeks back to equal the sum spent on its pursuit but the immortal pageantpiece of the tender legend which was the crowning glory of mans own legend beginning when his first paired children lost well the world and from which paired prototypes they still challenged paradise still paired and still immortal against the chronicles grimed and bloodstained pages adam and lilith and paris and helen and pyramus and thisbe and all the other recordless romeos and their juliets the worlds oldest and most shining tale limning in his brief turn the warplegged foulmouthed english horsegroom as ever paris or lochinvar or any else of earths splendid rapers the doomed glorious frenzy of a lovestory pursued not by an unclosed office file nor even the raging frustration of the millionaire owner but by its own inherent doom since being immortal the story the legend was not to be owned by any one of the pairs who added to its shining and tragic increment but only to be used passed through by each in their doomed and homeless turn he didnt tell how they did it only that they did it as if once it was done how no longer mattered that if something must be done it is done and then hardship or anguish or even impossibility no longer signifygot the frantic and injured horse out of the demolished car and into the bayou where it could swim while they held its head above waterhe found a boat the old negro said if you could call it a boat whittled out of a log and done already turned over before you even put your foot in it they called them pirogues they talked gobble talk there like they do herethen out of the bayou too into such complete invisibility that when the railroad detectives reached the scene the next morning it was as if the flood itself had washed the three of them away it was a hummock a small island in the swamp not a mile from the collapsed trestle where a worktrain and crew had arrived the next morning to rebuild the bridge and the track and from which they got the horse as far up out of the water as they could the first night and the old negro was left to attend it i just give it water and kept a mud pack on the hip and tried to keep the gnats and flies and mosquitoes away the old negro said the groom returned at dawn on the third day with a blockandtackle bearing the railroad companys stencil in the pirogue and food for themselves and the horse and canvas for the sling and cradle and plaster of paris for the casei know what youre going to ask now the old negro said where we got the money for all that he got it like he done the boat telling that too the cockney horsegroom who had never been further from london than epsom or doncaster yet who in two years of america had become a mason and a baptist who in only two weeks in the forecastle of the american freighter up from buenos aires had discovered or anyway revealed to himself that rapport with and affinity for dice who on the first return to the scene of the wreck had picked up the blockandtackle simply because he happened to pass it since his true destination had been the bunkcar where the negro workgang slept waking them the white man in his swampfouled alien jodhpurs and the black ones in undershirts or dungaree pants or in nothing at all squatting around a spread blanket beneath the smoking lantern and the bank notes and the coins and the clicking and scuttering diceand in the pitch darkhe had brought back no lantern no light it would not only have been dangerous to show one he didnt even need one scornfully even contemptuously who from his tenth year had known the bodies of horses as the blind man knows the room he durst not leave any more than he would have brought back a veterinary not only not needing one but he would not have let any hand save his or the old negros touch the horse even if the horse had permitted itthey suspended the horse and set the hip and built the immobilising cast then the weeks while the ruined hip knitted and the searchparties with every exit to the swamp watched and guarded continued to drag the bayou beneath the trestle and to splash and curse among the moccasins and rattlesnakes and alligators of the swamp itself long after they the pursuers had come to believe that the horse was dead for the simple reason that it must be dead since that particular horse could not be anything else but dead and still be invisible and that the owner would in the end gain only the privilege of venting his vengeance on the thieves and once each week as soon as it was dark enough and the searchparties had withdrawn for the night the groom would depart in the pirogue to return before dawn two or three days later with another supply of food and forage two and three days now because the trestle was repaired now once more trains roared hollowly across it in the night and the workgang and that source of revenue or income was gone back to new orleans where it had come from and now the white man was going to new orleans himself bucking the professional games on baizecovered tables beneath electric lights and now not even the old negroa horseman a groom merely by accident but by avocation and dedication a minister of god sworn dedicated enemy of sin yet who apparently without qualm or hesitation had long since drawn and then forgot it the line of his rectitude to include the magnificent ruined horse and all who were willing to serve itwould know how far he sometimes had to go before he found another spread blanket beneath a smoked lantern or as a last resort the electriclit baize table where although in their leathern cup the dice were as beyond impugnment as caesars wife the counterschips moneystill accrued whether or not to the benison of his gift or to the simple compulsion of his need then months not only within daily earshot of the trains once more thundering across the repaired trestle but of the search parties themselves to whom at times either of them could have spoken without even raising his voice the search continuing long after the ones who did the cursing and splashing and the frantic recoiling from the sluggish thrash or vicious buzz of startled moccasins and rattlesnakes all believed that the horse was long since dead and vanished forever into the sleepless insatiable appetites of eels and gars and turtles and the thief himself fled out of the country and out of the nation and perhaps even out of the continent and the hemisphere but continuing nevertheless because the railroad company had for stake an expensive set of triple blocks and over two hundred feet of twoinch cable and the insurance company owned banks and barge lines and chain stores from portland maine to oregon and so could afford not to lose even a onedollar horse let alone a fifty thousand dollar one and the horses owner that bottomless purse which would not miss the value of the sixty race horses he still owned in order to revenge himself on the thief of the sixtyfirst and the federal police had more at stake than even the state ones who could only share in the glory and the reward they had a file to be closed outuntil one day a united press flash came relayed last night from washington to the federal deputy of how a horse a valuable thoroughbred and running on three legs in charge of or at least accompanied by a small bandylegged foreigner who could barely speak english and a middleaged negro preacher and ridden by a twelveyearold negro boy had run away from the whole field in a threefurlong race at weatherford texaswe walked it the old negro said before the runner could ask him at night it needed that much to get used to itself again to stop remembering that trustle and get limbered up again and start being a horse when daylight come we would hide in the woods again and afterwards too telling that too how they didnt dare else run one race and then leave directly afterward without even stopping almost because as soon as that threelegged horse won a race the whole world would hear about it and they had to stay at least one day ahead of themand got there one day too late to learn that the negro preacher and the snarling contemptuous foreigner had appeared suddenly from nowhere exactly in time to enter the threelegged thoroughbred in a race on which the foreigner had betted sums ranging by this time all the way from ten to a thousand dollars at odds ranging all the way from one to ten to one to a hundred the threelegged horse breaking so fast from the post that the barrier seemed actually to have sprung behind it and running so fast that the trailing field appeared if anything to be running in another and later race and so far ahead at the finish that the jockey seemed to have no control over it at allif anyone let alone a child of twelve or at most thirteen who rode the race without saddle at all but simply a bellyband and a surcingle to hold on to this informant had seen the race could have held it after the barrier dropped the horse crossing the finish line at full speed and apparently bent on making another circuit of the track had not the white foreigner leaning on the rail beyond the finish line spoken a single word to it in a voice you could not have heard fifteen feet away and the next place where they were within even three days of the horse was at willow springs iowa and next to that bucyrus ohio and the next time they were almost two weeks behindan inaccessible valley in the east tennessee mountains three months later so remote not only from railroads but even telegraphs and telephones too that the horse had been running and winning races for ten days before the pursuit ever heard of it this was indubitably where he joined was received into the order of masons since this was the first time they had stopped for longer than one afternoon the horse able now to run for ten undisturbed days before the pursuit even heard about it so that when the pursuers left the valley they were twice ten days behind the horse since after two weeks of patient asking and listening up and down that thirtymilelong mountaincradled saucer again as at the scene of the original disappearance they had not found one human being who had ever heard of the threelegged horse and the two men and the child let alone seen them so when they heard of the horse next in central alabama it was already gone from there moving west again the pursuers still a month behind across mississippi across the mississippi river into arkansas pausing only as a bird pauses not alighting though the last thing the pause could have been called was hovering since the horse would be running once more at that incredible that unbelievable speed and at the incredible and unbelievable odds too by report and rumor the two menthe aged negro man of god and the foulmouthed white one to whom to grant the status of man was merely to accept darkness emissary in the stead of its actual prince and masterhad won tens of thousands of dollars as if their mundane progress across america were too slow to register on the eye and only during those incredible moments against a white rail did the horse and the three adjunctive human beings become visible whereupon the federal deputy the titularbyprotocol leader of the pursuit found that suddenly and with no warning something had happened to him which was to happen five years later in paris to a british soldier even whose name he would never hear hethe deputywas a poet not the writing kind or anyway not yet but rather still one of homers mere mute orphan godchildren sired by blind chance into a wealthy and political new orleans family and who by that familys standards had failed at harvard and then wasted two years at oxford before the family found out about it and fetched him home where after some months under the threat of the full marshalate he compromised with his father on the simple deputyship and so that nightit was in arkansas in a new paintrank hotel room in a little booming logging town itself less old than last yearhe realised what it was about the whole business that he refused to accept ever since weatherford texas and then in the next second dismissed it forever because what remained had not only to be the answer but the truth too or not even the truth but truth because truth was truth it didnt have to be anything it didnt even care whether it was so or not even looking the deputy at it not even in triumph but in humility because an old negro minister had already seen it with one glance going on two years ago nowa minister a man of god sworn and dedicated enemy of mans lusts and follies yet who from that first moment had not only abetted theft and gambling but had given to the same cause the tender virgin years of his own child as ever of old had samuels father or abraham his isaac and not even with pride because at last he had finally seen the truth even if it did take him a year but at least pride in the fact that from the very first as he knew now he had performed his part in the pursuit with passion and regret so ten minutes later he waked his secondincommand and two days later in the new york office he said give it up youll never catch him meaning you wont the owner of the horse said if you like it that way the deputy said ive resigned you should have done that eight months ago when you quit touché then the deputy said if that makes you feel better too maybe what im trying to do now is apologise because i didnt know it eight months ago too he said i know about what you have spent so far you know what the horse is now ill give you my check for that amount ill buy your ruined horse from you call it off the owner told him what he had actually paid for the horse it was almost as much as the public believed all right the deputy said i cant give you a check for that much but ill sign a note for it even my father wont live forever the owner pressed a button a secretary entered the owner spoke briefly to the secretary who went out and returned and laid a check on the desk before the owner who signed the check and pushed it across to the deputy it was for a sum still larger than the difference between the horses cost and that of the pursuit to date it was made out to the deputy thats your fee for catching my horse and deporting that englishman and bringing my nigger back in handcuffs the owner said the deputy folded the check twice and tore it across twice the owners thumb already on the buzzer as the deputy dropped the fragments carefully into an ashtray and was already standing to leave when the secretary opened the door again another check the owner said without even turning his head add to it the reward for the capture of the men who stole my horse but he didnt even wait for that one and it was oklahoma before he ex now overtook the pursuit joining it now as the private young man with money in his pocketor who had had it once and lost or spent ithad used to join marlboroughs continental tours and indeed meeting among them who a week ago had been his companions in endeavor the same coldfronted unanimity of halfcontempt which the private young men would meet among marlboroughs professionals then the little bleak railway stations between a cattlechute and a watertank the men in broad hats and heeled boots already clumped about the placard offering for a stolen horse a reward such as even americans had never seen beforethe reproduction of a newspaper photograph made in buenos aires of the man and the horse together with a printed description of botha face as familiar and recognisable now to the central part of the united states canada and mexico too as that of a president or a female murderer but above all the sum the amount of the rewardthe black succinct evocation of that golden dream that shining and incredible heap of dollars to be had by any man for the simple turn of a tongue always ahead of them of the pursuit certainly and the deputy now believed of the pursued too disseminating the poison faster than they advanced faster even than the meteorcourse of love and sacrifice until already the whole mississippimissouriohio watershed must be corrupt and befouled and at last the deputy knew that the end was in sight thinking how it was no wonder that man had never been able to solve the problems of his span upon earth since he has taken no steps whatever to educate himself not in how to manage his lusts and follies they harm him only in sporadic almost individual instances but in how to cope with his own blind mass and weight seeing themthe man and the horse and the two negroes whom they had snatched as it were willy nilly into that fierce and radiant orbitdoomed not at all because passion is ephemeral which was why they had never found any better name for it which was why eve and the snake and mary and the lamb and ahab and the whale and androcles and balzacs african deserter and all the celestial zoology of horse and goat and swan and bull were the firmament of mans history instead of the mere rubble of his past nor even because the rape was theft and theft is wrong and wrong shall not prevail but simply because due to the sheer repetition of zeros behind a dollarmark on a printed placard everyone within eyerange or tonguespread which was every human capable of seeing and hearing between canada and mexico and the rockies and the appalachians would be almost frantically attuned to the merest whisper regarding the horses whereabouts no it would not be much longer now and for an instant he thought toyed with the idea of confounding corruption with corruption using the equivalent of the check which in new york he had offered to write to combat the reward and put that away because that would fail too not that corrupting corruption would merely spread corruption that much further but because the idea merely created an image which even a poet must regard as only a poets fantastic whimsy mammons david ringing for a moment anyway mammons goliaths brazen invincible unregenerate skull it was not long now the end was actually in sight when the course the run as if it too knew that this was near the end turned sharply back south and east across missouri and into the closing v where the st francis river entered the mississippi haunted still by the ghosts of the old bankandrailroad bandits who had refuged there then over finished done an afternoon a little lost branchline county seat with a fairgrounds and a railless halfmile track the pursuers crossing the infield in the van of a growing crowd of local people town and swamp and farm all men silent watching not crowding them at all yet just watching and now for the first time they laid eyes on the thief whom they had pursued now for almost fifteen months the foreigner the englishman leaning in the doorless frame of the fallen stable the butt of the stillwarm pistol protruding from the waistband of his filthy jodhpurs and behind him the body of the horse shot neatly once through the star on its forehead and beyond the horse the roman senators head and the brushed worn frock coat of the old negro preacher and beyond him in turn in deeper shadow still the still white eyeballs of the child and that night in the jail cell the exdeputy still a lawyer even though the prisoner violently and obscenely repudiated him said i would have done it too of course but tell me whyno i know why i know the reason i know its true i just want to hear you say it hear both of us say it so ill know its realalreadyor stillspeaking even through the others single vicious obscene contemptuous epithet you could have surrendered the horse at any time and it could have stayed alive but that was not it not just to keep it alive anymore than for the few thousands or the few hundred thousands that people will always be convinced you won on itstopping then and even waiting or anyway watching exultant and calm while the prisoner cursed not toward him nor even just at him but him the exdeputy steadily and for perhaps a full minute with harsh and obscene unimagination then the exdeputy speaking again rapid and peaceful and soothing all right all right the reason was so that it could run keep on running keep on losing races at least finish races at least even if it did have to run them on three legs did run them on three legs because it was a giant and didnt need even three legs to run them on but only one with a hoof at the end to qualify as a horse while they would have taken it back to the kentucky farm and shut it up in a whorehouse where it wouldnt need any legs at all not even a sling suspended from a travelling crane geared by machinery to the rhythm of ejaculation since a skillful pander with a tin cup and a rubber gloveexultant and quite calm murmuring fathering colts forever more they would have used its ballocks to geld its heart with for the rest of its life except that you saved it because any man can be a father but only the best the brave and left in the middle of the spent dull repetitive cursing and from new orleans the next morning sent back the best lawyer which even he with all the vast scope of his familys political affiliations and his own semiprofessional and social ones could finda lawyer whose like the little lost missouri town had probably never seen before nor anyone else for that matter as having come four hundred miles to defend a nameless foreign horsethieftelling the lawyer what he had seen there the curious watching attitude of the town a mob the lawyer said with a sort of unction almost its a long time since i have coped with a mob no no the client said quickly they are just watching waiting for something i didnt have time to find out what and the lawyer saw that too he found more than that arriving on the second morning after an allnight drive in his private chauffeured limousine and within thirty minutes was on the telephone back to his client in new orleans because the man he had come to defend was gone vanished not escaped from the jail but freed from it the lawyer sitting at the telephone where he could look out into the quiet square almost empty of movement from which nobody watched him now nor for that matter had ever actually looked at him but where he was conscious of themnot so much the dour slowspeaking halfwestern halfsouthern faces but of the waiting the attention and not only the white man the two negroes were gone too the lawyer on the new orleans telephone again that evening not because it had taken him this long to learn these meagre details but simply because he realised now that this was all he was going to find out here by inquiry or purchase or just by simple listening no matter how much longer he stayed how the two negroes had never reached the jail at all but had vanished apparently into thin air somewhere between it and the courthouse where the exdeputys federal successor had formally relinquished the three prisoners to the local sheriff only the white man ever to reach the jail because the exdeputy had seen him there and he gone too now not even freed so much as just vanished the lawyer discovering five minutes after his arrival that there was no prisoner and at the end of thirty no felon and by midafternoon no crime even the body of the horse having vanished too sometime during that first night and nobody had moved it nor seen anyone moving it nor heard of anyone who might have moved it or in fact even knew that it was missing but the pursuit had long ago learned about all there was to know about those two weeks in the eastern tennessee valley last fall and the exdeputy had briefed the lawyer and so to the lawyer there was no mystery about it he had already divined the solution there would be masons in missouri tooan opinion which the client in new orleans didnt even bother to ignore let alone acknowledge not the exdeputys but the poets voice actually babbling at his end of the wire while the lawyer was still talking about the money the lawyer said they searched him of course all right all right the exdeputy said right perhaps justice certainly might not have prevailed but something more important had he had only ninetyfour dollars and a few cents the lawyer said the old negro has got the rest of it in the tail of that frockcoat the exdeputy saidtruth love sacrifice and something else even more important than they some bond between or from man to his brother man stronger than even the golden shackles which coopered precariously his ramshackle earth ill be damned the lawyer said of course thats where the money is why the hell i didnthush and listen to me a minute theres nothing more i can do here so im coming back to town as soon as they unlock the garage in the morning and i can get my car but you are already on the scene you can do it quicker than i can by telephone from here get in touch with your people and get notices spread up and down the valley as quick as you canplacards descriptions of all three of them no the exdeputy said you must stay there if anything further comes out of the charge it will have to originate there you must be there to protect him the only one who will need protection here is the first man who tries to lay a hand on the man who earned as much money as they believe he did with nothing but his bare hands and a threelegged horse the lawyer said hes a fool if he had stayed here he could have had the sheriffs badge without even running for it but i can do everything necessary by telephone from my office until we catch them i said from the first that you didnt understand the exdeputy said no that you still did not believe me even after i tried to tell you i dont want to find himthem i had my turn at bat and struck out you stay there thats what you are for the exdeputy said and hung up though still the lawyer didnt move his end of the connection still open the smoke from his cigar standing like a balanced pencil on a carven hand until the other new orleans number answered and he spoke to his confidential clerk describing the two negroes rapid and explicit and succinct cover all the river towns from st louis to basin street watch the cabin or stable or whatever it is in lexington of course if he doesnt go back home himself he might try to send the child back youre in the middle of a pretty good place to look for him now the clerk said if the sheriff there wont listen to me the lawyer said listen carefully he must not reappear here under any condition he must not be found at all until he can be picked up for something like vagrancy in some city big enough for nobody to know who he is or care under no condition must he come into the clutches of any local officers in any town or hamlet small enough even to have heard of that threelegged horse let alone seen it do you understand a moment then the clerk so they really did win that much money do as i tell you the lawyer said of course the clerk said only youre too late the owner of the horse has already beat you the police here have had that notice ever since yesterday and i imagine the police everywhere have it by nowdescription reward and all they even know where the money is in the tailpocket of that preachers coat the nigger wears its too bad every house he passes dont have a wireless like ships do then he would know how valuable he is and he would have something to trade with you on do as i tell you the lawyer said that was the second day then the third day and the lawyer had established his headquarters or post of command in the judges chambers next the courtroom in the courthouse not by the consent or even acquiescence of the judge who was a circuit judge and merely followed the itinerary of his court and did not live in the town and was not even consulted nor by the acquiescence of the town either but by its will so that it did not even matter whether the judge was a mason too or not and in the barbershop that day the lawyer saw last nights st louis paper bearing something which even purported to be a photograph of the old negro with the usual description and even a guess at the amount of money in the tail of the frockcoat the barber busy with another client having apparently glanced at least once at the lawyer where he stood looking at the paper because the barber said that many folks hunting for him ought to find him then silence and then a voice from the other end of the shop speaking to nothing and no one and with no inflection several thousand dollars then the fourth day when the department of justice investigator and the one from the sheriffs bonding company arrived the first st louis reporter had reached the scene one train ahead of the up man from little rock and from his high small quiet borrowed window the lawyer watched the two strangers and the sheriff and the two men who would be the sheriffs local bondsmen cross the square not to the front door of the bank but around to the discreet side one which led directly to the presidents office five minutes there then out again the two strangers stopping while the sheriff and the two local men scattered briskly and vanished the two strangers looking after them until the federal man removed his hat and seemed to be studying the inside of it for a moment a second then he turned briskly leaving the bonding companys man still looking out across the square and crossed to the hotel and entered it moving briskly now and reappeared with his strapped bag and sat down on the bench opposite the bus stop and then the bonding companys man moved too and crossed to the hotel and reappeared with his bag then the fifth day and the sixth and even the two reporters had returned to where they came from and there remained in the town no stranger save the lawyer nor was he a stranger anymore now though he was never to know by what means the town had learned or divined that he was there not to prosecute but to shield and at times during that idleness and waiting he would imagine envision himself actually in court with the man whom he had not only no expectation but even intention of ever seeing at alla picture of himself not engaged in just one more monotonous legal victory but as aperhaps thefigure in a pageant which in reality would be an historical commemoration in fact even more than that the affirmation of a creed a belief the declaration of an undying faith the postulation of an invincible way of life the loud strong voice of america itself out of the westward roar of the tremendous and battered yet indomitably virgin continent where nothing save the vast unmoral sky limited what a man could try to do nor even the sky limit his success and the adulation of his fellow man even the defence he would employ would be in the old fine strong american tradition of rapine its working precedent having been already established in this veryor anyway approximateland by an older and more successful thief than any english groom or negro preacher john murrell himself himself his own attorney the rape was not a theft but merely a misdemeanor since the placard offering the reward before the horses demise had constituted a legal power of attorney authorising any mans hand to the body of the horse and its violation had been a simple breach of trust the burden of the proof of which lay with the pursuers since they would have to prove that the man had not been trying simply to find the owner and restore him his property all the time this out of daydreams idle unexpectation because the lawyer did not really expect ever to see either of them since the owner or the federal government would indubitably catch them first right up to the morning of the seventh day when there was a knock at the jails kitchen doora knock not much louder than audibility yet quite firm and firm yet not at all peremptory just polite courteous and firm a knock not often heard at the back door of a small missouri jail nor even quite at the back door of an arkansas or louisiana or mississippi plantation house where it might sooner have been at home the turnkeys wife wiping her hands on her apron as she turned from the sink and opened the door on a middleageless negro man in a worn brushed frockcoat and carrying a napless tophat whom she did not recognise because she had not expected to see him there possibly because he was alone the boy the child still standing five minutes later just inside the mouth of the alley beside the jail where neither he nor the old one gave any sign of recognition whatever although his grandfatherhandcuffed now to the turnkeyactually brushed him in passing but her husband recognised him at once not by the face he scarcely glanced at that but by the coat the worn dusty broadcloth garment whichnot the man but the coat and not even the whole coat but the elbowdeep suitcaseroomy tails of itthe county and state police of five contiguous commonwealths had been blocking roads and searching farm wagons and automobiles and freight trains and the jim crow cars of passenger ones and depot lavatories charging in pairs and threes with shotguns and drawn pistols through the pool halls and burial associations and the kitchens and bedrooms of negro tenements for sixtyfive hours now trying to find as did the town too the turnkey and his shackled prize had scarcely left the jail before they began to gather behind them a growing tail of men and youths and small boys like that of a rising kite which in the street leading to the square the turnkey could still tell himself that he was leading and which while crossing the square toward the courthouse he even still looked like he was walking faster and faster almost dragging the prisoner at the other end of the chain joining them until at last he broke and even took one step actually running before he stopped and turned to face the pressing crowd drawing the pistol from its holster all in one blind motion like the hopeless and furious repudiation of the boy turning once more whole stainless and absolved to hurl his toy pistol into the very face of the charging elephant victim no more of terror but of pride and cried in a thin forlorn voice which itself was like the manless voice of a boy stop men this hyers the lawwho without doubt if they had run at him would have stood his ground still holding the pistol which he had not and would not even cock dying without a struggle beneath the trampling feet in that one last high second of his badge and warranta small mild ordinary man whom you have seen in his ten thousands walking the streets of little american towns and some not so little either not just in the vast central valley but on the eastern and western watersheds and the high mountain plateaus too who had received his job and office out of that inexhaustible reservoir of nepotism from which during the hundredodd years since the republics founding almost that many millions of its children had received not just their daily bread but a little something over for saturday and christmas too since coeval with the republic it was one of the prime foundationsin this case from the current sheriff whose remote kinswoman to his unending surprise and unbelief even ten years afterward the turnkey had somehow managed to marrya man so quiet so mild and so ordinary that none remarked the manner in which he accepted and affirmed the oath when sworn into his office merely somebody elses nameless and unknown cousin by blood or maybe just marriage promising to be as brave and honest and loyal as anyone could or should expect for the pay he would receive during the next four years in a position he would lose the day the sheriff went out of office turning to meet his one high moment as the male mayfly concentrates his whole one day of life in the one evening act of procreation and then relinquishes it but the crowd was not running at him only walking and that only because he was between them and the courthouse checking for an instant at sight of the drawn pistol until a voice said take that thing away from him before he hurts somebody and they did a hand not ungently nor even unkindly wrenching the pistol firmly from him the crowd moving again converging on him the same voice not impatient so much as irascible speaking to him by name this time gwan irey get out of the sun so that turning again the turnkey faced merely another gambit he must choose all over again either to acquiesce forever more to man or sever himself forever more from the human race by the actgetting either himself or the prisoner free from one end or the other of the steel chain joining themwhich would enable him to flee or not flee not flight who to dispute the moments heroic image even in that last second no puny fumbling with a blind mechanical insentient key but instead one single lightningstroke of sword or scimitar across the betraying wrist and then running the scarletspurting stump inevictably aloft like an unbowed pennons staff or the undefeated lances headless shank not even in adjuration but in abdication of all man and his corruption but there was not even time for that his only choice was against being trampled as shoulder to shoulder now with his captive and if anything slightly behind him they moved on in the center of the crowd across the square and into the courthouse a firm hand now grasping him above the elbow and thrusting him firmly on exactly as he had nightlily dreamed ever since he assumed his office of himself in the act of doing as soon as he found a felon either small enough or mild enough to permit him through the corridor and up the stairs to the judges chambers where the new orleans lawyer gave one start of outrage then of astonishment and then the infinitesimal flicker which never reached his face at all nor even his eyes until the same calm merely irascible voice said this aint big enough well use the courtroom and he the lawyer was moving too the three of them nowhimself the turnkey and the prisoner like three hencoops on a floodfilling the little room with a sibilant sound as though all the ghosts of coke upon littleton upon blackstone upon napoleon upon julius caesar had started up and back in one inextricable rustle one aghast and dusty cry and through the opposite door into the courtroom itself where suddenly the lawyer was not only himself free of the crowd he had managed quite skilfully for all his bulk a man not only tall but big in rich dark broadcloth and an immaculate pique waistcoat and a black cravat bearing a single pearl like the egg of a celestial humming bird to extricate the turnkey and the prisoner too in the same motion kneeing the swing gate in the low railing enclosing bench and witness stand and jury box and counsels tables and thrust the other two through it and followed and let the gate swing back while the crowd itself poured on into the auditorium people were entering now not only through the judges chambers but through the main doors at the back too not just men and boys now but women alsoyoung girls who already at eight and nine in the morning had been drinking coca cola in the drugstores and housewives testing meat and cabbages in the groceries and markets or matching scraps of lace and buttons over drygoods countersuntil not just the town but the county itself all of which had probably seen the threelegged horse run and most of which had contributed at least one or two each of the dollars by now the total had reached the thirty thousands which the two men had won and which the old negro preacher had escaped with and indubitably concealedseemed to be converging steadily into the courthouse ringing with unhurried thunder the corridor and stairs and the cavernous courtroom itself filling row by row the hard pewlike wooden benches until the last reverberation faded behind the cool frantic pulsing of pigeons in the clock tower on the roof and the brittle chitter and rattle of sparrows in the sycamores and locusts in the yard and the calm merely irascible voice saidand not from behind any face but as though no one man spoke but rather the room itself all right mister commence and standing with his prize behind the railings flimsy sanctuary bayed trapped in fact between the little wooden barrier which a child could step over in one stride like a degree of latitude or of honesty and the sacred dais to which even before he saw it he had already lost his appeal not alone except for his two companions nor even despite them but in fact because of them for a moment yet the lawyer watched man pouring steadily into the tabernacle the shrine itself of his last tribal mysteries entering it without temerity or challenge because why not it was his he had decreed it built it sweated it up not out of any particular need nor any long agony of hope because he was not aware of any lack or long history of agony or that he participated in any long chronicle of frustrated yearning but because he wanted it could afford it or anyway was going to have it whether he could afford it or not to be no symbol nor cradle nor any mammalian apex harbor where the incredible cockleshell of his invincible dream made soundings at last from the chartless latitudes of his lost beginnings and where like that of the enduring sea the voice of his affirmation roared murmuring home to the atolldais of his unanimity where no mere petty right but blind justice itself reigned ruthless and inattentive amid the deathless invincible smells of his victories his stale tobacco spit and his sweat because to begin with he was not he but they and they only by electing to be because what he actually was was i and in the first place he was not a mammal and as for his chartless latitudes he not only knew exactly where he came from six thousand years ago but that in three score and ten or thereabouts he was going back there and as for affirmation the mark of a free man was his right to say no for no other reason except no which answered for the unanimity too and the floor was his because he had built it paid for it and who could spit on it if not he and perhaps the lawyer had even read dickens and hugo once long ago when he was a young man looking now across the flimsy barrier into no brickandplaster barn built yesterday by the godfearing grandfathers of other orderly and decorous and godfearing missouri farmers but back a hundred years into the stone hall older than orleans or capet or charlemagne filled with the wooden sabots until yesterday reeking with plowed land and manure which had stained and fouled the trampled silks and lilies which had lasted a thousand years and were to have endured ten thousand more and the caps of mediterranean fishermen and the smocks of cobblers and porters and roadmenders stiffening with the crimson smears of the hands which had rent and cast down the silks and the lilies looking out at them not even with mere awe and respect not alone alarm but with triumph and pride pride in the triumph of man and that out of all his kind time and geography had matched him with this houramerica the united states in this april of our lord one thousand nine hundred and fourteen where man had had a hundred and forty years in which to become so used to liberty that the simple unchallenged right to attend its ordered and regimented charades sufficed to keep him quiet and content looking out at them a moment longer then he turned and struck the handcuffs a sharp and almost musical blow and thundered down at the turnkey what does this mean dont you know that no man shall be put twice in the same jeopardy then turned again and spoke into the room in that same voice like the rich snore of an organ this man has been illegally arrested the law compels his right to consult a lawyer we will recess for ten minutes and turned again and opened the gate in the railing this time by thrusting the other two through it and on ahead of him toward the door to the judges chambers not even looking back as five men rose at the back of the room and went out through the main doors and thrust the negro and the turnkey into the judges chambers and followed and shut the door andthe turnkey told this afterwardwithout even stopping went on to the opposite door and opened it and was already standing in it when the five men from the courtroom came around the corner five minutes gentlemen the lawyer said then we will resume in the courtroom and closed the door and came back to where the turnkey and the negro stood but he didnt even look at the negro and the turnkey spent exhausted almost comatose from courage and excitement discovered realised with a kind of outraged unbelief that the lawyer who had voluntarily given himself only ten minutes to do whatever he intended to do was apparently going to use up some of them smoking watching the lawyer produce the cigar from an upper pocket of the white vest which looked as if it had come right out from under the washerwomans smoothingiron five minutes agoa pocket which contained three more just like it then the turnkey recognised its brand and therefore its costone dollarbecause he had owned one once and on the following sunday morning smoked it through the mistake of a stranger under the impression that it was the sheriff who had married his the turnkeys sister instead of he who had married the sheriffs brothers wifes niece recognised it with grief and outrage too the same thing happening again but this time a thousand times worse the man who gave him the other cigar had asked nothing of him whereas he knew now and at last what the lawyer wanted was after had been after all the while setting the price of his the turnkeys corruption at that of one onedollar cigar this was the forty thousand dollars which the nigger had escaped with and hidden so good that even the federal government couldnt find it then the grief and outrage was not even outrage let alone grief it was triumph and pride and even joy too since not only had the lawyer already lost even before he laid eyes on the nigger he the lawyer wasnt even going to find it out until he the turnkey got good and ready to tell him waiting for the lawyer to speak first with no organ in the voice either now which instead was as hard and calm and cold and vacant of trash as that of his wifes unclebymarriage youve got to get him out of town its your only chance and maybe his the turnkeys voice wasnt too calm and maybe to a big city lawyer it didnt sound too hard either but even one as big as this one could have heard the finality in it and if he listened the scorn and the contempt and the pleasure too i can think of another in fact im fixing right now to take it then to the nigger come on already moving toward the corridor door drawing the nigger after him and already reaching from the snap on his belt the ring containing the handcuff key youre thinking of that money i aint because it aint mine to think about its his half of it is that is whether or not a nigger aint got any business with half of forty thousand dollars aint none of my business nor yours neither and soon as i unlock these handcuffs he can go and get it and turned the knob and had opened the door when the voice stopped himthe hard calm not even loud voice behind him sounding like somebody dropping pebbles into a churn neither am i because theres not any money im not even thinking about you im thinking about your bondsmen and the turnkey heard the match and turned in time to watch the flames hunchy squat at the drawing cigars tip and the first pale gout of smoke hiding for an instant the lawyers face thats all right too the turnkey said i been living in the jail two years already so i wont even have to move i expect i can even stand chaingang work too pah the lawyer said not through smoke but in smoke by means of smoke the puff the gout the pale rich costly balloon bursting vanishing leaving the hard calm not loud word as durable and single as a piece of gravel or a buckshot when you arrested this man the second time you broke the law as soon as you turn him loose he wont have to hunt for a lawyer because there are probably a dozen of them from memphis and saint louis and little rock waiting down there in the yard now just hoping you will have no more sense than to turn him loose theyre not going to put you in jail theyre not even going to sue you because you havent got any money or know where any is anymore than this nigger does theyre going to sue your bondsmenwhoever they were and whatever it was they thought you could do for themand yourwhat is it brotherinlawthe sheriff they were my he started to say kinsmen but they were not they were his wifes kinsmen he had plenty of his own but none of themor all of them together for that matterhad enough money in a bank anywhere to guarantee a bond then he started to say friends but they were his wifes familys friends too but then it didnt matter what he said because the voice had already read his mind which makes it harder you might leave your own kinfolks holding the sack but these are the sheriffs friends and youve got to sleep in the same bed with his niece every night which was wrong too since three years and two months and thirteen nights ago now but that didnt matter either the cigar smoking in the judges ashtray now and the voice come back here and he returned drawing the negro with him until they stood facing the white vest with its loop of watchchain like a section of gold plowtrace and the voice youve got to get him into a jail somewhere where they can hold him long enough for you to put a charge on him that the law will accept they can turn him loose the next day or the next minute if they want to all you want is to have him on record as having been charged with a legal crime or misdemeanor by a legally qualified officer of a legally constituted court then when his lawyers sue your bondsmen for false arrest they can tell them to go chase themselves what charge the turnkey said whats the next big jail from here not a county seat a town with at least five thousand people in it the turnkey told him all right take him there take my car its in the hotel garage ill telephone my driver from here only youllbut surely i dont need to tell you how to spirit a prisoner out of the clutches of a mob which was true too that was a part of the turnkeys dream too he had planned it all run it through his mind out to the last splendid and victorious gesture time and again since that moment two years ago when he had laid his hand on the book and sworn the oath not that he really expected it to happen but to be prepared against that moment when he should be called upon to prove not merely his fitness for his office but his honor and courage as a man by preserving and defending the integrity of his oath in the very face of them by whose sufferance he held his office yes he said only all right the lawyer said unlock that damn thing here give me the key and took it from his hand and unlocked the handcuffs and flung them onto the table where they made again that faint musical note only the turnkey said again now go around by the corridor and shut the big door to the courtroom and lock it on the outside that wont stop themhold them dont worry about them ill attend to that go on yes he said and turned then stopped again wait what about them fellows outside the door there for perhaps two or three seconds the lawyer didnt say anything at all and when he did speak it was as though there was nobody else in the room or in fact as though he was not even speaking aloud five men and you a sworn officer of the law armed you might even draw your pistol theyre not dangerous if youre careful yes he said and turned again and stopped again not looking back just stopping as he had turned that charge vagrancy the lawyer said vagrancy he said a man owning half of fortyfive thousand dollars pah the lawyer said he doesnt own half of anything even one dollar go on but now it was he who didnt move maybe he didnt look back but he didnt move either talking himself this time and calm enough too because this thing is all wrong its backwards the law spirits a nigger prisoner out of jail and out of town to protect him from a mob that wants to take him out and burn him all these folks want to do is to set this one free dont you think the law should cut both ways the lawyer said dont you think it should protect people who didnt steal fortyfive thousand dollars too yes the turnkey said and now he looked at the lawyer his hand on the doorknob again but not turning it yet only that aint the question i want to ask anyway and i reckon you got an answer to this one too and i hope its a good one speaking calm and slow and clear himself too this is all to it i just take him to blankton long enough to get a legal charge on the books then he can go look at his face the lawyer said he hasnt got any money he doesnt even know where any is neither of them do because there never was any and what little there might have been that cockney swipe threw away long ago on whores and whisky you still aint answered the turnkey said as soon as the charge is on the books he can go yes the lawyer said lock the courtroom doors first then come back for the nigger then the turnkey opened the door the five men stood there but he didnt even falter on through and past them then suddenly instead of following the corridor to the courtrooms rear door as the lawyer had ordered him he turned toward the stairs moving fast now not running just moving fast down the stairs and along the hall to the office of his wifes uncleinlaw deserted now and into the office around the partition and straight to the drawer and opened it and without even faltering took from beneath the mass of old discharged warrants and incomplete subpoenas and paper clips and rubber stamps and corroded pen points the spare office pistol and slipped it into the empty holster and returned to the hall and mounted the opposite stairway which brought him to the main courtroom doors and drew them quietly to even as a face then three then a dozen turned to look at him and turned the key in the lock and withdrew it and put it into his pocket already hurrying again even running now back to the judges chambers where the lawyer had put the receiver back on its hook and pushed the telephone away and reached for the cigar in the ashtray and actually looked for the first time at the negro drawing the cigar to life in one slow inhaleexhale and through the smoke for the first time examined the calm noaged roman senators face framed in a narrow unclosed circlet of grizzled hair clasping the skull like a caesars laurels above the aged worn carefully brushed carefully mended frock coat and then spoke the two of them in succinct flat posteriposte that was almost monotone you havent got any money have you no you dont even know where any is do you no because theres not any there never was and even that little your white bully boy threw away before you even saw it youre wrong and you believe youre wrong too because i know all right maybe it was even a whole hundred dollars more than that more than thirty thousand dollars and only the faintest hesitation here no faulting only an interval the voice still strong still invincibly unshaken and unshakable yes how much more than thirty thousand dollars all right how much more than a hundred dollars did you ever have a hundred dollars ever see a hundred dollars all right you know its more than a hundred dollars but you dont know how much more is that it yes but you dont need to worry and you came back to get your half of the hundred dollars anyway i came back to tell him goodbye before he goes back home back home the lawyer said quickly you mean england did he tell you that and the other insuperably calm insuperably intractable how could he told me because he wouldnt need to when a man comes to the place where he aint got anything left worth spending or losing he always goes back home but you dont need to worry because i know what youre fixing to do lock me up in the jail until he hears about it in the newspapers and comes back and youre right because thats what hell do because he needs me too and you dont need to worry about how much money it is itll be enough for all the lawyers too like the loaves and the fishes the lawyer said but this time it was not an interval there was no answer at all serenely nothing and the interval was the lawyers to put an end to so hes the one who needs you yet hes the one who has the forty thousand dollars how can anyone with forty thousand dollars need you and again the interval intractable and serene again the lawyers to break are you an ordained minister i dont know i bears witness to what god to man god dont need me i bears witness to him of course but my main witness is to man the most damning thing man could suffer would be a valid witness before god youre wrong there the negro said man is full of sin and nature and all he does dont bear looking at and a heap of what he says is a shame and a mawkery but cant no witness hurt him someday something might beat him but it wont be satan and turned both of them at the sound of the door and saw the turnkey inside the room trying to hold the corridor door braced against its slow remorseless movement until the yawns full inswing dismissed him completely into the wall and the five men from the corridor entered the lawyer already moving before they had got inside the room crossing to the opposite courtroom door saying over his shoulder this way gentlemen and opened the door and stood aside holding it no gesture or motion commanding nor even peremptory as docile and simultaneous as five sheep they filed across the room after him like five of the identical targetsducks or clay pipes or starstraversing on their endless chain the lilliputian range of a shootinggallery and on through the door the lawyer following on the last ones heels and saying over his shoulder to the turnkey or the negro or perhaps both or perhaps neither five minutes and followed on and then through the five men who had stopped huddled blocking the narrow passage as if they had walked full tilt as into an invisible wall into the rooms massed and waiting cynosure and on through the swing gate into the enclosure to stop facing the massed room in almost the same prints he had stood in ten minutes ago solitary this time but anything but alone amid against as a frieze or tapestry that titanic congeries invincible and judgmatical of the long heroic roster who were the milestones of the rise of manthe giants who coerced compelled directed and on occasion actually led his myriad moil caesar and christ bonaparte and peter and mazarin marlborough and alexander genghis and talleyrand and warwick marlborough and bryan bill sunday general booth and prester john prince and bishop norman dervish plotter and khan not for the power and glory nor even the aggrandisement these were merely secondarily concomitant and even accidental but for man by putting some of him in one motion in one direction by him of him and for him to disjam the earth get him for a little while at least out of his own waystanding there a moment then two then three not accepting but compelling the entire blast of the cynosure as in the twilit room the mirror concentrates to itself all of light and all else owns visibility only at second hand four then five then six while breathed no sound no sigh no sound of breathing even save the watchchains golden sough and the thin insistent music of the pearl still holding as in his palm like putty the massed anonymity and the waiting as the sculptor holds for another moment yet the malleable obedient unimpatient clay or the conductor across his balanced untensile hands the wand containing within its weightless pencilgleam all the loud fury and love and anguish then he moved his hand feeling as he did so the whole vast weight of the watching and the attention concentrate in one beam upon it as the magicians hand compels and took out the watch and snapped it open seeing even as he calculated the elapsed creep of the hands within the lids mellow concavity as in the seers crystal ball the shadowy miniatures of the turnkey and the prisoner who should be well into the square by now and even perhaps already in the alley leading to the hotel garage even at the moment there came into the room the rising roar of an automobile engine then the sound of the car itself rushing fast into the square and across and out of it rushing on at that contemptuous and reckless gait at which his insolent negro driver always drove when under his masters orders the car contained passengers whom the driver considered beneath him or beneath the cars splendora swaggering demidartagnan of a mulatto murderer whom the lawyer had let remain in the penitentiary at hard labor for exactly one year and one day as the handler wires the dead game bird to the neck of the intractable hunting dog then getting him out on parole not that he the lawyer held any brief even for the murder of this particular woman but because of the way it had been done apparently with the razor already naked in his hand the man had not driven the woman out of the cabin but had simply harried and chivvied her through a scene which as the lawyer imagined it must have had the quality of ballet until the woman broke and ran out of the house screaming into the moonlit lane running without doubt toward the sanctuary of the white kitchen where she worked until the man without haste overtook her not to catch grasp at her but simply ran past her with one single neat surgeonlike backhanded slash of the razor running into then out of the instants immobility into which all motion flowed in one gesture of formulated epicene almost finicking even niggardly fatal violence like the bullfighters the two of them running on side by side for two or three paces in the moonlight until the woman fell the man not even spotted and the blade itself barely befouled as if he had severed not a jugular but a scream and restored merely to the midnight silence so the lawyer could have stopped now with one word leaving them once more fixed as with one twitch of his cape the espada does the bull and walk again through the door to the judges chambers and on to the hotel and pack and strap his bag but he did not who owed this little more as the old pagan before he quaffed it empty tilted always from the goblets brimming rim one splash at least upon the hearth not to placate but simply in recognition of them who had matched him with his hour upon the earth in one of the houses on one of the best streets in one of the most unassailable sections of new orleans he owned a picture a painting no copy but proved genuine and coveted for which he had paid more than he liked to remember even though it had been validated by experts before he bought it and revalidated twice since and for which he had been twice offered half again what he had paid for it and which he had not liked then and still didnt and was not even certain he knew what it meant but which was his own now and so he didnt even have to pretend that he liked it whichso he believed then with more truth than any save himself knewhe affirmed to have bought for the sole purpose of not having to pretend that he liked it one evening alone in his study wifeless and childless in the house too save for the whitejacketed softfooted not tamed but merely tractable mulatto murderer suddenly he found himself looking at no static rectangle of disturbing mediterranean blues and saffrons and ochres nor even at the signboard affirming like a trumpetblast the inevictable establishment in coeval space of the sum of his pastthe house in its unimpeachable street the membership in clubs some of whose doors were older than the state and behind which his fathers name would could never have disturbed the air and the cryptic numbers which opened his lock boxes and monotonous incrementation of his securitieslistsbut instead was looking at the cognizance of his destiny like the windhard banner of the old norman earl beneath whose vast shadow not just bankers and politicians clicked and sprang nor governors and lieutenants blenched and trembled but at the groaning tables in whose kitchens and sculleries or even open courtyards and kennels daily sixty thousand who wore no swords and spurs and owned no surnames made the one last supreme sacrifice the free gift of their pauperism and the lawyer thought i didnt really earn this i didnt have time i didnt even need to earn to earn it man out of his boundless and incalculable folly foisted it on me before i even had time to resist him and closed the watch and put it back into the waistcoat pocket and then the voice not even raised murmurous ventriloquial sourceless as though it were not even he but circumambience the room the high unsubstanced air itself somewhere about or among the soaring and shadowy cornices not speaking to the faces but rather descending not as sound but as benison as light itself upon the docile the enduring the triumphing heads ladies gentlemen then not louder merely sharp peremptory and succinct like the report of a small whip or a toy pistol democrats on the fourth of november two years ago there rose from the ballot boxes of america the sun of a thousand years of peace and prosperity such as the world has never seen on the fourth day of november two years from now we will see it set again if the octopus of wall street and the millionaire owners of new england factories have their way waiting and watching their chance to erect once more the barricade of a yankee tariff between the southern farmer and the hungry factories and cheap labor of the old world in europe already entered into its own millennium of peace and reason freed at last after two thousand years of war and the fear of war panting only to exchange at a price you can afford to accept your wheat and corn and cotton for the manufactured goods necessary to your life and happiness and that of your children at a price you can afford to pay affirming again that inalienable right decreed by our forefathers a hundred and twentysix years ago of liberty and free trade the right of man to sell the produce of his own sweat and labor wherever and whenever he wants to without fear or favor of new york capitalists or new england factory owners already spending like water the money ground out of the child labor of their sweatshops to divert to the farthest corners of the earth the just profits of your sweat and labor so that not your wives and children but those of african savages and heathen chinese will have the good roads and the schools and the cream separators and the automobiles then already in motion before he stopped speaking crossing rapidly to the gate in the railing as with one concerted unhaste the entire room stood up not flowing so much as swaying toward the main doors at the back since almost at once a voice said from the doors hits locked the sway not even pausing only reversing and becoming a flow one murmurous hollow roaring of feet not running merely shuffling yet as the crowd flowed back toward and into the narrow passage leading to the judges chambers where the lawyer passing rapidly through the swing gate now stood between them and the door and even as he thought my first mistake was moving he made another stand back men he said and even raised his hand palm out seeing marking for the first time faces individual faces and eyes which least of all were those of individuals now but rather one single face bearing steadily down on him and overwhelming him until suddenly he was moving backward no shock no concussion but simply enclosed accepted into one moving envelopement he stumbled once but immediately what felt like a dozen quick firm impersonal hands steadied and even turned him and then checked him while others reached past him and opened the door to the judges chambers not flinging nor even sweeping him aside but evacuating voiding him back into the wall as the crowd flowed on across the little room to the opposite corridor door already emptying the room before they had had time to fill it so that he knew that the first ones out had gone around to the main courtroom doors and unlocked them so that not only the corridor but the whole building was murmuring again with the hollow unhurried thunder of feet while he stood for a moment more against the wall with in the center of the once immaculate waistcoat the print not smeared just blurred not hurried just firm and plain and light of a hand and suddenly in outrage and prescience he started actually sprang almost already knowing what he would see before he reached the window looking through it down into the square where they had already halted the turnkey already facing back toward the courthouse as he fumbled inside his coat except there were three of them now and the lawyer thought rapid inattentive and with no surprise oh yes the child who rode the horse and looked no more at the turnkey scrabbling clumsily beneath his coattail but watched instead the deliberate pour of the crowd from the courthouse portal already spreading as it converged toward the three waiting figures like the remorseless unhurried flow of spilled ink across a table cloth thinking the lawyer how only when he is mounted on somethinganything from a footstool through a horse or rostrum to a flagpole or a flying machineis man vulnerable and familiar that on his own feet and in motion he is terrible thinking with amazement and humility and pride too how no mere immobile mass of him no matter how large nor apparently doing or about to do no matter what nor even the mass of him in motion mounted on something which not he but it was locomotive but the mass of him moving of itself in one direction toward one objective by means of his own frail clumsilyjointed legs and feetnot ghengis bone horns nor murats bugles let alone the golden voice of demosthenes or cicero or the trumpetblast of paul or john brown or pitt or calhoun or daniel webster but the children dying of thirst amid mesopotamian mirages and the wild men out of the northern woods who walked into rome carrying even their houses on their backs and moses fortyyear scavengers and the tall men carrying a rifle or an axe and a bag of beads who changed the color of the american race and in the lawyers own memory the last individual cowboy who marked the whole of western america with the ranging dung of his horse and the oxidising hulls of his sardine and tomato cans exterminated from the earth by a tide of men with wirestretchers and pockets full of staples thinking with pride and awe too how threatful only in locomotion and dangerous only in silence neither in lust nor appetite nor greed lay wombed the potency of his threat but in silence and meditation his ability to move en masse at his own impulse and silence in which to fall into thought and then action as into an open manhole with exultation too since none knew this better than the lords proprietors of his massed breathing the herogiant precentors of his seething moil who used his spendthrift potency in the very act of curbing and directing it and ever had and ever would in detroit today an oldtime bicycleracer destined to be one of the worlds giants his very surname an adjectival noun in the worlds mouth who had already put half a continent on wheels by families and in twentyfive more would have half a hemisphere on wheels individually and in a thousand would have already effaced the legs from a species just as that longago and doubtless at the time notevennoticed twitch of cosmos drained the seas into continents and effaced the gills from their fish but that was not yet that would be peace and to attain that the silence must be conquered too the silence in which man had space to think and in consequence act on what he believed he thought or thought he believed the silence in which the crowd walked flowed steadily across the square toward the three waiting figures and out of which the turnkey cried in his thin high manless voice dragging the new pistol in its turn from beneath his coat skirts stop men im going to count three and began to count onetwo staring even glaring at the faces which were not rushing at him nor did they even seem to walk at him but rather towered down and over him feeling again the pistol neither wrenched nor snatched but just wrung firmly from him and then other hands had him too you durn fools he cried struggling but how say it how tell them you had to be honorable about money no matter who had it if you were not honorable about money pitying the weak did them no good because about all they got from you then was just pity besides it was already too late to try to tell them even if there had been no other reason the firm quite kind almost gentle hands not only holding him up but even lifting raising him and then they were even carrying him as two kinless bachelors might carry a child between them his feet remembering earth but no longer touching it then raising him still further until he could see between and past the heads and shoulders the ringed circumference of faces not grim and never angry just unanimous and attentive and in the center of it the old negro in the worn frock coat and the thin chocolatecolored adolescent boy with eyeballs of that pure incredible white which flemish painters knew how to grind then the owner of the calm irascible voice spoke again and now for the first time the turnkey could see and recognise him no lawyer or merchant or banker or any other civic leader but himself a gambler who bucked from choice the toughest game of all ownership of a small peripatetic sawmill where he had gone to work at the age of fifteen as the sole support of a widowed mother and three unmarried sisters and now at forty owned the mill and a wife and two daughters and one granddaughter of his own speaking at last into a silence in which there was not even the sound of breathing how much did you and that fellow really win on that horse a hundred dollars more the old negro said a thousand more than that and now indeed there was no stir no breath only one vast suspension as if the whole bright april morning leaned was it forty thousand all right was it half of forty thousand how much did you see how much did you count can you count to a thousand dollars it was a heap the old negro said and now they breathed one stir one exhalation one movement the day the morning once more relinquished the voice its valedictory therell be a train at the depot in twentyfive minutes you be on it when it leaves and dont come back we dont like rich niggers here so we got on the train the old negro said and rode to the next station then we got out and walked it was a far piece but we knowed where he would be now if they would just let him alone the blue hazecradled valley where the corners of georgia and tennessee and carolina meet where he had appeared suddenly from nowhere that day last summer with a threelegged racehorse and an old negro preacher and the negro child who rode the horse and stayed two weeks during which the horse outran every other one within fifty miles and finally one brought all the way from knoxville to try to cope with it then the four of them vanished again overnight six hours ahead of a horde of federal agents and sheriffs and special officers like the converging packs of a state or nationwide foxhunt and we was right he must a come straight back there from the missouri jail because it was still june they told us about it a sunday morning in the church and likely it was the preacher that seen him first because he was already facing that way before the rest of them turned their heads and recognised him too standing against the back wall just inside the door like he hadnt never left the runner seeing it too seeing almost as much as the federal exdeputy would have seen if he had been therethe morose savage foulmouthed almost inarticulate only the more so for the fact that occasionally a fragment of what he spoke sounded a little like what the valley knew as english foreigner who moved breathed not merely in an aura of bastardy and bachelordom but of homelessness too like a halfwild pedigreeless pariah dog fatherless wifeless sterile and perhaps even impotent too misshapen savage and foul the worlds portionless and intractable and inconsolable orphan who brought without warning into that drowsing vacuum an aggregation bizarre mobile and amazing as a hippodrome built around a comet two negroes and the ruined remnant of the magnificent and incredible horse whose like even on four legs the valley or the section either had never seen before into a country where a horse was any milkless animal capable of pulling a plow or a cart on weekdays and carrying sacks of corn to the mill on saturdays and bearing as many of the family as could cling to its gaunt ridgepole to the church on sundays and where there not only were none but there never had been any negroes whose people man and boy from sixtyodd down to fourteen and thirteen had fifty years ago quitted their misty unmapped eyries to go for miles and even weeks on foot to engage in a war in which they had no stake and if they had only stayed at home no contact in order to defend their land from negroes not content merely to oppose and repudiate their own geopolitical kind and their common economic derivation they must confederate with its embattled enemies stealing creeping once at a crossroads tavern a party of them fought something resembling a pitched battle with a confederate recruiting party by night through the confederate lines to find and join a federal army to fight not against slavery but against negroes to abolish the negro by freeing him from them who might bring negroes among them exactly as they would have taken their rifles down from the pegs or deer antlers above hearth and doorway to repel say a commercial company talking about bringing the indians back hearing it too except it wasnt two weeks we was there that first time it was fifteen days the first two they spent just looking at us they would come from all up and down the valley walking or on horses and mules or the whole family in the wagon to set in the road in front of the store where we would be squatting on the gallery eating cheese and crackers and sardines looking at us then the men and boys would go around behind the store where we had built a pen out of rails and scraps of boards and pieces of rope to stand and look at the horse then we begun to run and by the fifth day we had outrun every horse in the whole valley and had done won even one mortgage on a tenacre cornpatch up on the mountain and by the seventh day we was running against horses brought all the way in from the next counties across what they called the gap then six days more with the folks in the valley betting on our horse now until the fifteenth day when they brought that horse from knoxville that had run at churchill downs back home once and this time it was not just the valley folks but folks from all that part of tennessee watching that threelegged horse without even no saddle we never used no bridle neither just a onerein hackamore and a bellyband for this boy to hold on to outrun that knoxville horse the first time at five furlongs and the next time at a full mile for double stakes with not just the folks in the valley but the folks from the other counties too betting on it now so that everybody or anyway every family in that part of tennessee had a share in what it won thats when he was taken into the masons the runner said during that two weeks fifteen days the old negro said yes there was a lodge therethen just before daylight the next morning a man on a mule rid down from the gap just about a hour ahead of them the runner hearing this too as the old negro himself had heard it a year afterward when the sun rose the automobile itself stood in front of the storethe first automobile which the soil of the valley had ever emprinted and which some of the old people and children had ever seen driven part of the way over the gap trail but indubitably hauled and pushed and probably even carried here and there for the rest of the distance and inside the store the sheriff of the county and the city strangers in their city hats and neckties and shoes smelling stinking of excise officers revenuers while already the horses and mules and wagons of yesterday flowed back down from the coves and hills the riders and occupants dismounting at once now to pause for a moment to look quietly and curiously at the automobile as though at a mediumsized rattlesnake then crowding into the store until it would hold no more of them facing not the city strangers standing in a tight wary clump in front of the cold spitmarked stove in its spitmarked sandbox they had looked at them once and then no more but rather the sheriff so that since the sheriff was one of them bore one of the names which half the valley bore and the valley had all voted for him and in fact except for his dimestore cravat and their overalls even looked like them it was as though the valley merely faced itself they stole the horse the sheriff said all the man wants is just to get it back but no reply only the quiet grave courteous not really listening but just waiting faces until one of the city strangers said in a bitter city voice wait already stepping quickly past the sheriff his hand already inside the buttoned front of his city coat when the sheriff said in his flat hill voice you wait his hand inside the others buttoned coat too already covering the other smaller one plucking it out of the coat and holding easily in the one grasp both the small city hand and the flat city pistol so that they looked like toys in it not wrenching but merely squeezing the pistol out of the hand and dropping it into his own coat pocket and said well boys lets get on moving walking his companions in their white shirts and coat sleeves and pants legs and shoes creased and polished two days ago in chattanooga hotels heeling him compact and close while the faces the lane opened through the store the lane the faces closing behind across the gallery and down the steps the silent lane still opening and closing behind them until they reached the automobile then and young mountain men had not yet learned how to decommission an automobile simply by removing the distributor or jamming the carburetor so they had used what they did know a tenpound hammer from the blacksmiths shop not knowing even then the secret of the things life beneath the hood and so overfinding it the fine porcelain dust of shattered plugs and wrenched and battered wires and dented pipes and even the mute halfhorseshoe prints of the hammer punctuating the spew of oil and gasoline and even the hammer itself immobile against an overalled leg in plain view and now the city man cursing in his furious bitter voice was scrabbling with both hands at the sheriffs coat until the sheriff grasped both of them in his one and held the man so and facing them now across the ruined engine again it was merely the valley facing itself the automobile dont belong to the government the sheriff said it belongs to him he will have to pay to have it fixed nor anything yet for a moment then a voice how much how much the sheriff said over his shoulder how much the city man said a thousand dollars for all i know maybe two thousand well call it fifty the sheriff said releasing the hands and removing the trim pearlcolored city hat from the city head and with his other hand took from his trousers pocket a small crumple of banknotes and separated one and dropped it into the hat holding the hat upside down and as though baited with the single bill toward the nearest of the crowd next he said except that they had to look quick because before the preacher could say the benediction so they could get up and even tell him howdy he was done gone from there too but quick as he left it wasnt before the word could begin to spread telling that too thirtyseven in the church that morning so in effect the whole valley was and by midafternoon or sundown anyway every cove and hill and run knew he was back alone without the horse and broke and hungry not gone again just disappeared out of sight for the time so that they knew they had only to wait to bide until the moment which was that night in the loft above the postofficestoreit was the lodgeroom they used it for they politic too and for the court but mostly for the poker and crapgames that they claimed had been running there ever since the valley was first settled and the store was built there was a regular outside staircase going up to it that the lawyers and judges and politicians and masons and eastern stars used but mainly it was a ladder nailed flat to the back wall outside leading up to a back window that everybody in the valley knowed about but not one of them would ever claim he even seen let alone climbed and inside there was a jug always full of white mountain whisky setting on the shelf with the waterbucket and the gourd that everybody in the valley knowed was there just like they done the ladder but that nobody could see while the court or the lodge or a meeting was going on telling it an hour after dark when the six or seven men including the stores clerk squatting around the spread blanket on the floor beneath the lantern it was sunday night they just shot craps on sunday night they wouldnt allow no poker heard his feet on the ladder and watched him crawl through the window and then didnt look at him anymore while he went to the jug and poured himself a drink into the gourd dipper not watching him exactly as not one of them would have offered him as a gift the actual food or as a loan the money to buy it with not even when he turned and saw the coin the halfdollar on the floor beside his foot where ten seconds ago no coin had been nor when he picked it up and interrupted the game for two or three minutes while he compelled them one by one to disclaim the coins ownership then knelt into the circle and bet the coin and cast the dice and drew down the original halfdollar and pyramided for two more casts then passed the dice and rising left the original coin on the floor where he had found it and went to the trap door and the ladder which led down into the stores dark interior and with no light descended and returned with a wedge of cheese and a handful of crackers and interrupted the game again to hand the clerk one of the coins he had won and took his change and squatting against the wall and with no sound save the steady one of his chewing ate what the valley knew was his first food since he returned to it reappeared in the church ten hours ago andsuddenlythe first since he had vanished with the horse and the two negroes ten months ago they just took him back like he hadnt never even been away it was more than that it was like there never had been no more than what they seen now no horse to win races on three legs and never had been because they probably never even asked him what had become of it never no two niggers like me and this boy never no money to ask him how much of it he won like all them folks back there in missouri done not even no time between that one a year ago last summer and this one no interval of fall and winter and spring no flame of oak and hickory nor drive of sleet nor foam and rush of laurel and rhododendron down the mountainsides into summer again the man himself the runner seeing this too out of the listening the hearing unchanged and not even any dirtier just alone this time though not as well as the federal exdeputy could have seen itthe same savage and bandy misanthrope in the foul raked checked cap and the cheap imitation tweed jacket and the bagging bedford cords he called them jodhpurs they would have held three of him he said they was made in a place called savile row for what he called the second largest duke in the irish peerage squatting on the stores front gallery beneath the patent medicine and tobacco and baking powder placards and the announcements and adjurations of candidates for sheriff and representative and district attorney this was an even year they had already been defeated and forgotten and there remained only their fading photographs joblotted from the lowest bidder and not looking like them anyway which no one had expected but merely like any candidate which was all that any hoped dotting the countryside on telephone poles and fences and the wooden rails of bridges and the flanks of barns and already fading beneath the incrementation of time and weather like ejaculations a warning a plea a cry just squatting there at first not doing nothing and not nobody bothering him even to try to talk to him until sunday when he would be in the church again setting in the last pew at the back where he could get out first after the benediction he was sleeping on a straw tick in the lodge room over the store and eating out of the store too because he had won that much that first night he could have had a job they told me about that too him squatting on the gallery one morning when some fellow brought a horse in to the blacksmith that he had tried to shoe himself and quicked it in the nigh hind the horse plunging and kicking and squealing every time they tried to touch it until at last they was trying to crosstie it up and maybe even have to throw it to pull the quick shoe until he got up and went in and laid his hand on its neck a minute and talked to it and then just tied the halter rein in the ring and picked up the foot and pulled the shoe and reset it the blacksmith offered him a steady job right there but he never even answered just back on the gallery squatting again then sunday in the back pew in the church again where he could get out first before anybody could try to talk to him because they couldnt see his heart his heart the runner said yes the old negro said then he did vanish because the next time they seed him they wouldnt have knowed him except for the cap the coat and them irish britches gone now and wearing overhalls and a hickory shirt except that they would have had to gone out there to seen that because he was a farmer now a wagehand likely not getting much more than his board and lodging and washing because the place he was working on hadnt hardly supported the two folks that was already trying to live on it the runner seeing that now almost as well as the federal exdeputy could have seen ita childless couple of arthritic middleage two heirs of misfortune drawn as though by some mutual last resort into the confederation of matrimony as inversely two heirs of great wealth or of royalty might have beena oneroomandleanto cabin a hovel almost clinging paintless to a sheer pitch of mountainside in a straggling patch of corn standing in niggard monument to the incredible the not just back but heartbreaking labor which each meagre stalk represented molocheffigy of selfsustenance which did not reward mans sweat but merely consumed his fleshthe man who ten months ago had walked in the company of giants and heroes and who even yesterday even without the horse and solitary and alone had still walked in its magnificent gigantic shadow now in faded overalls milking a gaunt hill cow and splitting firewood and the three of them distinguishable at any distance from one another only because one wore the checked cap and another a skirt hoeing the lean and tilted corn coming down the mountain to squat not talking yet not actually mute either among them on the gallery of the store on saturday afternoon and on the next morning sunday again in his back pew in the church always in that clean fresh rotation of faded blue which was not the regalia of his metamorphosis and the badge of all plodding enduring husbandry but which hid and concealed even the horsewarped curvature of his legs obliterating effacing at last the last breath or recollection of the old swaggering aura bachelor footfree and cavalier so that it was july now there remained not the heart only the foul raked heavilychecked cap talking not the heart talking of passion and bereavement among the empty tennessee hills of the teeming metropolitan outland then he was gone it was august the mail rider had brought the chattanooga and knoxville papers back over the gap that week and the next sunday the preacher made the prayer for all the folks across the water swamped again in battle and murder and sudden death and the next saturday night they told me how he taken his last degree in masonry and how that time they tried to talk to him because the chattanooga and knoxville papers was coming over the gap every day now and they was reading them too about that battle mons the runner said mons the old negro saidsaying to him them was your folks too wasnt they and getting the sort of answer there wasnt no reply to except just to hit him and when the next sunday came he was gone though at least this time they knowed where so that when we finally got there that day what the runner said it took you from june until august to travel from missouri to tennessee it wasnt august the old negro said it was october we walked we would have to stop now and then to find work to earn money to eat on that taken a while because this boy never had no size then and i never knowed nothing but horses and preaching and any time i stopped to do either one somebody might have asked me who i was you mean you had to bring the money to him first before you could even draw travel expenses from it there wasnt no money the old negro said there never was none except just what we needed had to have never nobody but that new orleans lawyer ever believed there was we never had time to bother with winning a heap of money to have to take care of we had the horse to save that horse that never wanted nothing and never knowed nothing but just to run out in front of all the other horses in a race from being sent back to kentucky to be just another studhorse for the rest of its life we had to save it until it could die still not knowing nothing and not wanting nothing but just to run out in front of everything else at first he thought different aimed different but not long it was during that time when we was walking to texas we was hiding in the woods one day by a creek and i talked to him and that evening i baptised him in the creek into my church and after that he knowed too that betting was a sin we had to do a little of it win a little money to live on buy feed for it and grub for us but that was all god knowed that too that was all right with him are you an ordained minister the runner said i bears witness the old negro said but youre not an ordained priest then how could you confirm him into your church hush pappy the youth said wait the runner said i know he made you a mason too suppose he did the old negro said you and this boy are alike you think maybe i never had no right to make him a christian but you know he never had no business making me a mason but which do you think is the lightest to undertake to tell a man to act like the head mason thinks he ought to act thats just another man trying to know whats right to do or to tell him how the head of heaven knows he ought to act thats god and knows whats right to ease his suffering and save him all right the runner said it was october only this time they knowed where he was france i says with this boy already jerking at my sleeve and saying come on grampaw come on grampaw which way is that i says is that in tennessee too come on grampaw this boy says i knows where it is yes the runner said to the youth ill get to you in a moment too he said to the old negro so you came to france i wont even ask how you did that with no money because that was god wasnt it it was the society the youth said only he didnt say society he said société yes the runner said to the youth he said in french his best french the glib smart febrile argot immolated into the international salons via the nightclubs from the paris gutter i wondered who did the talking for him it was you was it someone had to the youth said in still better french the french of the sorbonne the institute the old negro listening peaceful and serene until he said his mamma was a new orleans girl she knowed gobble talk thats where he learned it but not the accent the runner said where did you get that i dont know the youth said i just got it could you just get greek or latin or spanish the same way i aint tried the youth said i reckon i could if they aint no harder than this one all right the runner said to the old negro now did you have the society before you left america and heard that insequent and without order or emphasis like dream too they were in new york who a year ago had not known that the earth extended further than the distance between lexington kentucky and louisville until they walked on it trod with their actual feet the hard enduring ground bearing the names louisiana and missouri and texas and arkansas and ohio and tennessee and alabama and mississippiwords which until then had been as foundationless and homeless as the ones meaning avalon or astalot or ultima thule then immediately there was a woman in it a lady not young richly in furs i know the runner said she was in the car with you that day last spring when you came up to amiens the one whose son is in the french air squadron that she is supporting was the youth said her boy is dead he was a volunteer one of the first airmen killed in the french service thats when she began to give money to support the squadron because she was wrong the old negro said wrong the runner said oh her dead sons monument is a machine to kill as many germans as possible because one german killed him is that it and when you told her so it was just like that morning in the woods when you talked to the horsethief and then baptised him in the creek and saved him all right tell me yes the old negro said and told it the three of them traversing a succession almost like avatars from what must have been a park avenue apartment to what must have been a wall street office to another office room a youngish man with a black patch over one eye and a cork leg and a row of miniature medals on his coat and an older man with a minute red thing like a toy rosebud in his buttonhole talking gobble talk to the lady and then to the youth too a french consulate the runner said looking for a british soldier it was verdun the youth said verdun the runner said that was just last year it took you until we was walking and working then pappy begun to hear them there was too many of them the old negro said men and boys marching for months down into one muddy ditch to kill one another there was too many of them there wasnt room to lay quiet and rest all you can kill is mans meat you cant kill his voice and if there is enough of the meat without even room to lay quiet and rest you can hear it too even if its not saying anything but why the runner said what can trouble you more than having a human man saying to you tell me why tell me how show me the way and you can show him the way i can believe the old negro said so because you believed the french government sent you to france it was the lady the youth said she paid for it she believed too the old negro said all of them did the money didnt count no more now because they all knowed by now that just money had done already failed all right the runner said anyway you came to france hearing it a ship there was a committee of at least one or two at brest even if they were just military staff officers to expedite not a special train maybe but at least one with precedence over everything not military the house palace sonorous and empty was already waiting for them in paris even if the banner to go above the ducal gates was not ready yet thought of yet into the words but that was not long and the house the palace was not empty long either first the women in black the old ones and the young ones carrying babies then the maimed men in trenchstained horizon blue coming in to sit for a while on the hard temporary benches not always even to see him since he was still occupied in trying to trace down his companion his mistairy telling that too from the paris war office to the department of state to downing street to whitehall and then out to poperinghe until the mans whereabouts were ascertained at last who that newmarket horse and its legend were known and remembered in whitehall too could have gone out as groom to the commanderinchief himselfs horse if he had chosen but enlisted instead into the londoners until having barely learned how to wrap his spiral putties he found himself in a posting which would have left him marooned for the duration as groomfarrierhostler in a troop of guards cavalry had he not taught the sergeant in charge of the draft to shoot dice in the american fashion and so won his escape from him and for two years now had been a private in a combat battalion of northumberland borderers only when you finally found him he barely spoke to you the runner said he aint ready yet the old negro said we can wait theres plenty of time yet we the runner said you and god too yes even if it will be over next year the war this war did god tell you that its all right laugh at him he can stand that too what else can i do but laugh the runner said hadnt he rather have that than the tears hes got room for both of them theyre all the same to him he can grieve for both of them yes the runner said too much of it too many of them too often there was another one last year called the somme they give ribbons now not for being brave because all men are brave if you just frighten them enough you must have heard of that one you must have heard them too i heard them too the old negro said les amis à la france de tout le monde the runner said just to believe to hope that little so little just to sit together in the anguished room and believe and hope and thats enough like the doctor when youre ill you know he cant cure you just by laying his hands on you and you dont expect him to all you need is someone to say believe and hope be of good cheer but suppose its already too late for a doctor now all that will serve now is a surgeon someone already used to blood up there where the blood already is then he would have thought of that too then why hasnt he sent you up there instead of here to live on hot food in clean bugless clothes in a palace maybe because he knows i aint brave enough the old negro said would you go if he sent you i would try the old negro said if i could do the work it wouldnt matter to him or me neither whether i was brave to believe and to hope the runner said oh yes i walked through that room downstairs i saw them i was walking along the street and happened by simple chance to see that placard over the gate i was going somewhere else yet here i am too but not to believe and hope because man can bear anything provided he has something left a little something left his integrity as a creature tough and enduring enough not only not to hope but not even to believe in it and not even to miss its lack to be tough and to endure until the flash crash whatever it will be when he will no longer be anything and none of it will matter anymore even the fact that he was tough and until then did endure thats right the old negro said peaceful and serene maybe it is tomorrow you got to go back so go on now and have your paris while you got a little time aha the runner said ave bacchus and venus morituri te salutant eh wouldnt you have to call that sin evil is a part of man evil and sin and cowardice the same as repentance and being brave you got to believe in all of them or believe in none of them believe that man is capable of all of them or he aint capable of none you can go out this way if you want to without having to meet nobody thanks the runner said maybe what i need is to have to meet somebody to believe not in anything just to believe to enter that room down there not to escape from anything but to escape into something to flee mankind for a little while not even to look at that banner because some of them probably cant even read it but just to sit in the same room for a while with that affirmation that promise that hope if i only could you only could anybody only could do you know what the loneliest experience of all is but of course you do you just said so its breathing send for me the old negro said oh yesif i only could i know the old negro said you aint ready yet neither but when you are send for me are what the runner said when you needs me what can i need you for when it will be over next year all ive got to do is just stay alive send for me the old negro said goodbye the runner said descending retracing his steps they were still there in the vast cathedrallike room not only the original ones but the steady trickle of new arrivals entering not even to look at the lettered banner but just to sit for awhile inside the same walls with that innocent and invincible affirmation and he had been right it was august now and there were american uniforms in france not as combat units yet but singly still learning they had a captain and two subalterns posted to the battalion to blood themselves on the old somme names preparatory to qualifying themselves to lead their own kind into the ancient familiar abbatoir he thought oh yes three more years and we will have exhausted europe then wehun and allies togetherwill transfer the whole business intact to the fresh transatlantic pastures the virgin american stage like a travelling minstrel troupe then it was winter later remembering it it would seem to him that it might actually have been the anniversary of the son of man a gray day and cold the gray cobbles of that village place de ville gleaming and wimpled like the pebbles beneath the surface of a brook when he saw the small augmenting crowd and joined it too from curiosity then seeing across the damp khaki shoulders the small clump of battlestained horizon blue whose obvious or at least apparent leader bore a french corporals insigne the faces alien and strange and bearing an identical lostness likesome of them at leastthose of men who have reached a certain point or place or situation by simple temerity and who no longer have any confidence even in the temerity and three or four of which were actually foreign faces reminding him of the ones the french foreign legion was generally believed to have recruited out of european jails and if they had been talking once they stopped as soon as he came up and was recognised the faces the heads above the damp khaki shoulders turning to recognise him and assume at once that expression tentative reserved and alert with which he had become familiar ever since the word seeped down probably through a corporalclerk from the orderly room that he had been an officer once so he came away he learned in the orderly room that they were correctly within military protocol they had passes to visit the homes of one or two or three of them in villages inside the british zone then from the battalion padre he even began to divine why not learn why divine it its a staff problem the padre said its been going on for a year or two even the americans are probably familiar with them by now they just appear with their passes all regularly issued and visaed in troop restbillets they are known and of course watched the trouble is they have done no and stopped the runner watching him you were about to say done no harm yet the runner said harm he said gently problem is it a problem and harmful for men in frontline trenches to think of peace that after all we can stop fighting if enough of us want to to think it not to talk it thats mutiny there are ways to do things and ways not to do them render under caesar the runner said i cannot discuss this subject while i bear this the padre said his hand flicking for an instant toward the crown on his cuff but you wear this too the runner said his hand in its turn indicating the collar and the black v inside the tunics lapels god help us the padre said or we god the runner said maybe the time has now come for that and went away from there too the winter following its course too toward the spring and the next final battle which would end the war during which he would hear of them again rumored from the back areas of the now three army zones watched still by the now three intelligence sections but still at stalemate because still they had caused no real harm at least not yet in fact the runner had now begun to think of them as a formally accepted and even dispatched compromise with the soldiers natural and inevictable belief that he at least would not be killed as orderly batches of whores were sent up back areas to compromise with mans natural and normal sex thinking the runner bitterly and quietly as he had thought before his prototype had only mans natural propensity for evil to contend with this one faces all the scarletandbrazen impregnability of general staffs and this time it was may again the fourth one he had seen from beneath the brim of a steel helmet the battalion had gone in again two days ago and he had just emerged from corps headquarters at villeneuve blanche when he saw the vast black motor car again there was such a shrilling of ncos whistles and a clashing of presented arms that he thought at first it was full of french and british and american generals until he saw that only one was a general the french one then recognised them all in the rear seat beside the general the pristine blue helmet as unstained and innocent of exposure and travail as an uncut sapphire above the roman face and the unstained horizonblue coat with its corporals markings and the youth in the uniform now of an american captain on the second jump seat beside the british staffmajor the runner halfwheeling without even breaking stride to the car and halted one pace short then took that pace and clapped his heels and saluted and said to the staffmajor in a ringing voice sir then in french to the french generalan old man with enough stars on his hat to have been at least an army commander monsieur the general good morning my child the general said with permission to address monsieur the director your companion certainly my child the general said thank you my general the runner said then to the old negro you missed him again yes the old negro said he aint quite ready yet and dont forget what i told you last year send for me and dont you forget what i told you last year too the runner said and took that pace backward then halted again but good luck to you anyway he doesnt need it he said and clapped his heels again and saluted and said again to the staffmajor or perhaps to no one at all in the ringing and empty voice sir and that was all he thought he would never see either of them againthat grave and noble face the grave and fantastic child but he was wrong it was not three days until he stood in the ditch beside the dark road and watched the lorries moving up toward the lines laden with what the old st omer watchman told him were blank antiaircraft shells and not four when he waked groaning and choking on his own blood until he could turn his head and spit his lip was cut and he was going to lose two teethspitting again he had already lost themand now he even remembered the riflebutt in his face hearing already that was what had waked roused him the terror of that silence he knew at once where he was where he always was asleep or on duty either lying someone had even spread his blanket over him on the dirt ledge hacked out of the wall of the tiny cave which was the anteroom to the battalion dugout and he was alone no armed guard sitting across from him as he realised now he had expected nor was he even manacled nothing save himself lying apparently free on his familiar ledge in that silence which was not only above ground but down here too no telephonist at the switchboard opposite none of the soundsvoices movement the coming and going of orderlies and company commanders and ncosall the orderly disorder of a battalion pc functioning normally in a cramped space dug forty feet down into the earthwhich should have been coming from the dugout itselfonly the soundless roar of the massed weight of shored and poised dirt with which all subterrene animalsbadgers and miners and molesare deafened until they no longer hear it his watch curiously it was not broken said whether ack emma or pip emma he could not tell down here except that it could not be it must not be pip emma he could not he must not have been here going on twenty hours the seven which ack emma would signify would already be too many so he knew at least where they would be the whole pc of themcolonel adjutant sergeantmajor and the telephonist with his temporarily spliced and extended linetopside too crouching behind the parapet staring through periscopes across that ruined and silent emptiness at the opposite line where their opposite german numbers would be crouching also behind a parapet gazing too through periscopes across that vernal desolation that silence expectant too alerted and amazed but he did not move yet it was not that it might already be too late he had already refused to believe that and so dismissed it it was because the armed man might be in the dugout itself guarding the only exit there he even thought of making a sound a groan something to draw the man in he even thought of what he would say to him dont you see we dont know what they are up to and only i seem to have any fears oralarms if i am wrong we will all die sooner or later anyway if i am right and you shoot me here we will all surely die or better still shoot me i shall be the one man out of this whole four years who died calmly and peacefully and reposed in dry clothing instead of panting gasping befouled with mud to the waist or drenched completely in the sweat of exertion and anguish but he didnt do it he didnt need to the dugout was empty also the armed man might be at the top of the stairs instead of the foot of them but then there or thereabouts would be where the colonel and his orderly room and periscope were too besides he would have to face risk the rifle somewhere and it wouldnt matter where since it contained only for him one bullet while what he was armed with was capable of containing all of time all of man he found his helmet at once he would have no rifle of course but even as he dismissed this he had one leaning against the wall behind the sergeantmajors desk oh yes what he was armed with even equipped him at need with that which his own armament was even superior to and yes there it still was in the sergeantmajors desk the pass issued to him monday to pass him out to corps headquarters and then back so that he didnt even expect to find a guard at the top of the fiftytwo steps leading up and debouching into the trench only the transubstantiated orderly room as he had foreknowncolonel adjutant sergeantmajor telephone periscopes and all his speech all ready on his tongue when the sergeantmajor turned and looked back at him latrine he said right the sergeantmajor said be smart about it then report back here yessir he said and two hours later he was again among the trees from which he had watched the torches moving about the archie battery two nights ago three hours after that he saw the three aeroplanesthey were sesin the sky which had been empty of aircraft for fortyeight hours now and saw and heard the frantic uproar of shells above where the enemy front would be then he saw the german aeroplane too watched it fly arrowstraight and apparently not very fast enclosed by the pocking of white british archie which paced it back across nomans land the three ses in their pocking of black hun archie zooming and climbing and diving at the german he watched one of them hang on the germans tail for what must have been a minute or two the two aircraft apparently fastened rigidly together by the thin threads of tracer and still the german flew steadily and sedately on descending descending now even as it passed over him and the battery behindnearwhich he lurked opened on it in that frenzy of frantic hysterical frustration common to archie batteries descending vanishing just above the trees and suddenly he knew where the aerodrome just outside villeneuve blanche vanishing sedately and without haste downward enclosed to the last in that empty similitude of fury the three ses pulling up and away in one final zoom and as if that were not enough to tell him what he had to do he saw one of them roll over at the top of its loop and frozen and immobile watched it in its plan as it dove rushed straight down at the battery itself its nose flicking and winking with the tracer which was now going straight into the battery and the group of gunners standing quietly about it down and down past what he would have thought was the instant already too late to save itself from crashing in one last inextricable jumble into the battery then levelling himself watching the rapid pattering walk of the tracer across the intervening ground toward him until now he was looking directly into the flicking wink and the airmans helmeted and goggled face behind and above it so near that they would probably recognise one another if they ever saw each other againthe two of them locked in their turn for a moment an instant by the thin fiery thread of a similitude of death afterward he would even remember the light rapid blow against his leg as if he had been tapped rapidly and lightly once by a finger the aeroplane pulling level and with a single hard snarling downward blast of air zooming climbing on until the roaring whine died away he not moving yet immobile and still frozen in the ravelling fading snarl and the faint thin sulphurstink of burning wool from the skirt of his tunic it was enough he didnt even expect to get nearer the villeneuve aerodrome than the first roadblock himself speaking to the corporal not even across a rifle but across a machine gun im a runner from the th battalion i cant help that the corporal said you dont pass here nor did he really want to he knew enough now ten hours later in the villeneuve blanche gendarmes uniform he was in paris traversing again the dark and silent streets of the aghast and suspended city dense not only with french civil police but the military ones of the three nations patrolling the streets in armed motorcars until he passed again beneath the lettered banner above the arched gateway wednesday night to the young woman waiting just inside the old eastern city gate that dispersal in the place de ville made a long faint hollow faraway rushing sound as remote and impersonal as a pouring of water or the wings of a tremendous migratory flock with her head turned and arrested and one thin hand clutching the crossing of the shabby shawl on her breast she seemed to listen to it almost inattentively while it filled the saffron sunset between the violet city and the cobaltgreen firmament and died away then she turned back to where the road entered the city beneath the old arch it was almost empty now only a trickle approached and entered the last of them the dregs when she turned back to it her face though still wan and strained was almost peaceful now as if even the mornings anguish had been exhausted and even at last obliterated by the day of watching and waiting then she was not even watching the road as her hand releasing the shawl brushed past the front of her dress and stopped her whole body motionless while her hand fumbled at something through the cloth fumbling at whatever it was as if even the hand didnt know yet what it was about to find then she thrust her hand inside the dress and brought the object outthe crust of the bread which the man had given her in the boulevard almost twelve hours ago warm from her body and which by her expression she had completely forgotten even the putting it there then she even forgot the bread again clutching it to her mouth in one thin voracious fist tearing at it with quick darting birdlike snatches as she once more watched the gate which those entering now approached with creeping and painful slowness because these were the dregs the residuethe very old and the very young belated not because they had had further to come but because some of them had been so long in life as long ago to have outlived the kin and friends who would have owned carts to lend or share with them and the others had been too brief in it yet to have friends capable of owning carts and who had already been orphaned of kin by the regiment at bethune and souchez and the chemin des dames three years agoall creeping cityward now at the pace of the smallest and weakest when she began suddenly to run she was still chewing the bread still chewing when she darted under the old twilit arch running around an old woman and a child who were entering it without breaking stride but merely changing feet like a running horse at a jump flinging the crust behind her spurning it with her palm against the hollow purchaseless air as she ran toward a group of people coming up the now almost empty roadan old man and three women one of them carrying a child the woman carrying the child saw her and stopped the second woman stopped too though the othersan old man on a single crutch and carrying a small clothknotted bundle and leaning on the arm of an old woman who appeared to be blindwere still walking on when the young woman ran past them and up to the woman carrying the child and stopped facing her her wan face urgent and frantic again marthe she said marthe the woman answered something rapid and immediate not in french but in a staccato tongue full of harsh rapid consonants which went with her facea dark high calm ugly direct competent peasants face out of the ancient mountainous centraleuropean cradle which though a moment later she spoke in french and with no accent was no kin whatever to the face of the child she carried with its blue eyes and florid coloring filtered westward from flanders she spoke french at once as if having looked at the girl she realised that whether or not the girl had ever once understood the other tongue she was past comprehending or remembering it now now the blind woman leading the crippled old man had stopped and turned and was coming back and now you would have noticed for the first time the face of the second woman the one who had stopped when the one carrying the child did it was almost identical with the others they were indubitably sisters at first glance the second face was the older of the two then you saw that it was much younger then you realised that it had no age at all it had all ages or none it was the peaceful face of the witless hush now the woman carrying the child said they wont shoot him without the others then the blind woman dragged the old man up she faced them all but none in particular motionless while she listened for the sound of the girls breathing until she located it and turned quickly toward the girl her fierce cataracted stare have they got him she said as we all know the woman with the child said quickly she started to move again lets get on but the blind woman didnt move square and sightless in the road blocking it still facing the girl you she said i dont mean the fools who listened to him and who deserve to die for it i mean that foreigner that anarchist who murdered them have they got him answer me hes there too the woman carrying the child said moving again come on but still the blind woman didnt move except to turn her face toward the woman with the child when she spoke thats not what i asked she said you heard me say they will shoot him too the woman carrying the child said she moved again as though to touch the blind woman with her hand and turn her but before the hand touched her the woman who could not even see had jerked her own up and struck it down let her answer me she said she faced the girl again they havent shot him yet wheres your tongue you were full enough of something to say when you came up but the girl just stared at her answer her the woman carrying the child said no the girl whispered so the blind woman said she had nothing to blink for or from yet there was nothing else to call it but blinking then her face began to turn rapidly between the girls and the womans carrying the child even before she spoke the girl seemed to shrink staring at the blind woman in terrified anticipation now the blind womans voice was silken smooth you too have kin in the regiment eh husbandbrothera sweetheart yes the woman carrying the child said which one of you the blind woman said all three of us the woman carrying the child said a brother a sweetheart too maybe the blind woman said come now yes the woman carrying the child said so then the blind woman said she jerked her face back to the girl you she said you may pretend youre from this district but you dont fool me you talk wrong and you she jerked back to face the woman carrying the child again youre not even french i knew that the minute the two of you came up from nowhere back yonder talking about having given your cart to a pregnant woman maybe you can fool them that dont have anything but eyes and nothing to do but believe everything they look at but not me angélique the old man said in a thin quavering disused voice the blind woman paid no attention to him she faced the two women or the three women the third one too the older sister who had not spoken yet whom anyone looking at her would never know whether she was going to speak or not and even when she did speak it would be in no language of the used and familiar passions suspicion or scorn or fear or rage who had not even greeted the girl who had called the sister by a christian name who had stopped simply because the sister had stopped and apparently was simply waiting with peaceful and infinite patience for the sister to move again watching each speaker in turn with serene inattention so the anarchist who is murdering frenchmen is your brother the blind woman said still facing the woman carrying the child she jerked her head sideways toward the girl what does she claim him as a brother too or maybe an uncle she is his wife the woman carrying the child said his whore maybe you mean the blind woman said maybe im looking at two more of them even if both of you are old enough to be his grandmothers give me the child again she moved as unerring as light toward the faint sound of the childs breathing and before the other could move snatched the child down from her shoulder and swung it onto her own murderers she said angélique the old man said pick it up the blind woman snapped at him it was the clothknotted bundle only the blind woman who was still facing the three other women not even the old man himself knew that he had dropped it he stooped for it letting himself carefully and with excruciating slowness hand under hand down the crutch and picked it up and climbed the crutch hand over hand again as soon as he was up her hand went out with that sightless unerring aim and grasped his arm jerking him after her as she moved the child riding high on her other shoulder and staring silently back at the woman who had been carrying it she was not only holding the old man up she was actually leading the way they went on to the old arch and passed beneath it the last of sunset was gone even from the plain now marthe the girl said to the woman who had carried the child now the other sister spoke for the first time she was carrying a bundle tooa small basket neatly covered with an immaculate cloth tucked neatly down thats because hes different she said with peaceful triumph even people in the towns can see it marthe the girl said again this time she grasped the others arm and began to jerk at it thats what theyre all saying theyre going to kill him thats why the second sister said with that serene and happy triumph come on marthe said moving but the girl still clung to her arm im afraid she said im afraid we cant do anything just standing here and being afraid marthe said were all one now it is the same death no matter who calls the tune or plays it or pays the fiddler come now were still in time if we just go on they went on toward the old duskfilling archway and entered it the sound of the crowd had ceased now it would begin again presently though when having eaten the city would hurry once more back to the place de ville but now what sound it was making was earthy homely inturned and appeased no longer the sound of thinking and hope and dread but of the peaceful diurnal sublimation of viscera the very air was colored not so much by twilight as by the smoke of cooking drifting from windows and doorways and chimneys and from braziers and naked fires burning on the cobbles themselves where even the warrens had overflowed gleaming rosily on the spitted hunks of horses and the pots and on the faces of the men and children squatting about them and the women bending over them with spoons or forks that is until a moment ago because when the two women and the girl entered the gate the street as far as they could see it lay arrested and immobilised under a deathlike silence rumor having moved almost as fast as anguish did though they never saw the blind woman and the old man again they saw only the backturned squatting faces about the nearest fire and the face of the woman turned too in the act of stooping or rising one hand holding the fork or spoon suspended over the pot and beyond them faces at the next fire turning to look and beyond them people around the third fire beginning to stand up to see so that even marthe had already stopped for a second when the girl grasped her arm again no marthe she said no nonsense marthe said havent i told you we are all one now she freed her arm not roughly and went on she walked steadily into the firelight into the thin hot reek of the meat the squatting expressionless faces turning like the heads of owls to follow her and stopped facing across the closed circle the woman with the spoon god be with all here this night and tomorrow she said so here you are the woman said the murderers whores his sisters marthe said this girl is his wife we heard that too the woman said the group at the next fire had left it now and the one beyond it but of the three strangers only the girl seemed aware that the whole street was crowding quietly up growing denser and denser not staring at them yet the faces even lowered or turned a little aside and only the gaunt children staring not at the three strangers but at the covered basket which the sister carried marthe had not once even glanced at any of them we have food she said well share with you for a share in your fire without turning her head she said something in the mountain tongue reaching her hand back as the sister put the handle of the basket into it she extended the basket toward the woman with the spoon here she said hand me the basket the woman said a man in the squatting circle took the basket from marthe and passed it to her without haste the woman put the spoon back into the pot pausing to give the contents a single circular stir turning her head to sniff at the rising steam then in one motion she released the spoon and turned and took the basket from the man and swung her arm back and flung the basket at marthes head it spun once the cloth still neatly tucked it struck marthe high on the shoulder and caromed on revolving again and emptying itself it was food just before it struck the other sister in the chest she caught it that is although none had seen her move she now held the empty basket easily against her breast with one hand while she watched the woman who threw it interested and serene youre not hungry she said did that look like we want your food the woman said thats what i said the sister said now you dont have to grieve then the woman snatched the spoon from the pot and threw it at the sister but it missed that is as the woman stooped and scrabbled for the next missile it was a wine bottle half full of vinegar she realised that the spoon had struck nothing that none of the three strangers had even ducked as though the spoon had vanished into thin air as it left her hand and when she threw the bottle she couldnt see the three women at all it struck a man in the back and caromed vanishing as the whole crowd surged baying the three strangers in a little ring of space like hounds holding fixed but still immune some animal not feared but which had completely confounded them by violating all the rules of chase and flight so that as hounds fall still and for a moment even cease to whimper the crowd even stopped yelling and merely held the three women in a ring of gaped suspended uproar until the woman who threw the spoon broke through carrying a tin mug and two briquettes and flung them without aim the crowd baying and surging again as marthe turned half carrying the girl in one arm and pushing the sister on ahead with the other hand walking steadily the crowd falling away in front and closing behind so that the flexing intact ring itself seemed to advance as they did like a miniature whirlpool in a current then the woman screaming now darted and stooped to a scatter of horse droppings among the cobbles and began to hurl the dried globules which might have been briquettes too but for hue and durability marthe stopped and turned the girl half hanging from the crook of her arm the sisters ageless interested face watching from behind her shoulder while refuse of all sortsscraps of food rubbish sticks cobbles from the street itselfrained about them a thread of blood appeared suddenly at the corner of her mouth but she didnt move until after a time her immobility seemed to stay the missiles too and the gaped crowding faces merely bayed at them again the sound filling the alley and roaring from wall to wall until the reverberations had a quality not only frantic but cachinnant recoiling and compounding as it gathered strength rolling on alley by alley and street to street until it must have been beating along the boulevards respectable fringes too because the patrolit was a mounted provost marshals partymet them at the first corner the crowd broke burst because this was a charge the yelling rose a whole octave without transition like flipping over a playing card as motionless again the three women watched the crowd stream back upon them they stood in a rushing vacuum while the mass divided and swept past on either hand in front of and beneath and behind the running horses the cobbleclashing fireringing hooves and the screams dying away into the single vast murmur of the whole citys tumult leaving the alley empty save for the three women when the nco leader of the patrol reined his horse and held it shortbitted ammoniac and reekspreading and bouncing a little against the snaffle while he glared down at them where do you live he said they didnt answer staring up at himthe wan girl the tall calm woman the quicking and serene approval of the sister the nco listened for an instant to the distant tumult then he looked at them again all right he said harshly get out of town while you can come on now get started we belong here too marthe said for a second he glared down at them he and the horse in high sharp fading silhouette against the sky itself filled with anguish and fury is the whole damned world crowding here to crucify a bastard the armys going to fix anyway he said in thin furious exasperation yes marthe said then he was gone he slacked the horse its iron feet clashed and sparked on the cobbles the hot reek sucked after it pungent for a fading instant then even the galloping had faded into the sound of the city come marthe said they went on at first she seemed to be leading them away from the sound but presently she seemed to be leading them straight back to it she turned into an alley then into another not smaller but emptier deserted with an air about it of back premises but she seemed to know where she was going or at least what she was looking for she was almost carrying the girl now until the sister moved up unbidden and exchanged the empty basket to the other arm and took half the girls weight and then they went quite rapidly on to the end of the alley and turned the wall and there was what marthe had gone as directly to as if she had not only known it was there but had been to it beforean empty stone stall a byre or stable niched into the citys nightfading flank there was even a thin litter of dry straw on the stone floor and once inside although the sound was still audible it was as though they had established armistice with the tumult and the fury not that it should evacuate the city in their favor but at least it should approach no nearer marthe didnt speak she just stood supporting the girl while the sister set down the empty basket and knelt and with quick deft darting motions like a little girl readying a dolls house she spread the straw evenly and then removed her shawl and spread it over the straw and still kneeling helped marthe lower the girl onto the shawl and took the other shawl which marthe removed from her shoulders and spread it over the girl then they lowered themselves onto the straw on either side of the girl and as marthe drew the girl to her for warmth the sister reached and got the basket and not even triumphant with another of those clumsy darting childlike motions which at the same time were deft or least efficient or anyway successful she took from the basket which everyone had seen empty itself when the woman at the fire threw it at her a piece of broken bread a little larger than two fists again marthe said nothing she just took the bread from the sister and started to break it in three the sister said and took the third fragment when marthe broke it and put it back into the basket and they reclined again the girl between them eating it was almost dark now what little light remained seemed to have gathered about the doors worn lintel with a tender nebulous quality like a worn lost halo the world outside but little lighter than the stone interiorthe chill sweating stone which seemed not to conduct nor even contain but to exude like its own moisture the murmur of the unwearying citya sound no longer auricularly but merely intellectually disturbing like the breathing of a sick puppy or a sick child but when the other sound began they stopped chewing they stopped at the same instant when they sat up it was together as though a spreader bar connected them sitting each with a fragment of bread in one poised hand listening it was beneath the first sound beyond it human too but not the same sound at all because the old one had women in itthe mass voice of the ancient limitless mammalian capacity not for suffering but for grieving wailing to endure incredible anguish because it could become vocal without shame or selfconsciousness passing from gland to tongue without transition through thoughtwhile the new one was made by men and though they didnt know where the prisoners compound was nor even nobody had taken time to tell them yet that the regiment was in a compound anywhere they knew at once what it was hear them the sister said serene in astonished and happy approval so rapt that marthes movement caused her to look up only after the other had risen and was already stooping to rouse the girl whereupon the sister reached again with that deft unthinking immediate clumsiness and took the fragment of bread from marthe and put it and her own fragment back into the basket with the third one and rose to her knees and began to help raise the girl speaking in a tone of happy anticipation where are we going now she said to the mayor marthe said get the basket she did so she had to gather up both the shawls too which delayed her a little so that when she was on her feet marthe supporting the girl had already reached the door but even for a moment yet the sister didnt follow standing clutching the shawls and the basket her face lifted slightly in rapt and pleased astonishment in the murmurous last of light which seemed to have brought into the damp stone cubicle not merely the citys simple anguish and fury but the city itself in all its invincible and impervious splendor even inside the stone singlestalled stable it seemed to rise in glittering miniature tower and spire tall enough and high enough to soar in sunlight still though dark had fallen high enough and tall enough above earths old miasmic mists for the glittering and splendid pinnacles never to be in darkness at all perhaps invincible everlasting and vast he will wear a fine sword here she said shortly before sunset the last strand of wire enclosing the new compound had been run and joined and the electric current turned into it then the whole regiment with the exception of the thirteen special prisoners who were in a separate cell to themselves were turned out of the barracks they were not released they were evicted not by simultaneous squads of guards nor even by one single roving detachment moving rapidly alert compact and heavily armed from barracks to barracks but by individual senegalese armed sometimes with a bayoneted rifle and sometimes merely with the naked bayonet carried like a brush knife or a swagger stick and sometimes with nothing at all they appeared abruptly and without warning in each room and drove its occupants out hustling them with scornful and contemptuous expedition toward the door not even waiting to follow but going along with them each one already well up into the middle of the group before it even reached the door and still pressing on toward the head of it prodding each his own moving path with the reversed rifle or the bayonets handle and even within the ruck moving faster than it moved riding head and shoulders not merely above the moving mass but as though on it gaudy ethiope and contemptuous resembling harlequined trees uprooted say from the wild lands the tameless antipodal fields moving rigid and upright above the dull sluggish current of a citysoiled commercial canal so the senegalese would actually be leading each group when it emerged into its company street nor would they even stop then not even waiting to pair off in couples let alone in squads but seeming to stride once or twice still carrying the bayoneted rifles or the bayonets like the spears and knives of a lion or antelope hunt and vanish as individual and abrupt as they had appeared so when the regiment unarmed unshaven hatless and halfdressed began to coalesce without command into the old sheeplike molds of platoons and companies it found that nobody was paying any attention to it at all that it had been deserted even by the bayonets which had evicted it out of doors but for a while yet it continued to shuffle and grope for the old familiar alignments blinking a little after the dark barracks in the glare of sunset then it began to move there were no commands from anywhere the squads and sections simply fell in between the old filemarkers and closers and began to flow drift as though by some gentle and even unheeded gravitation into companies in the barracks streets into battalions onto the parade ground and stopped it was not a regiment yet but rather a shapeless mass in which only the squads and platoons had any unity as the coherence of an evicted city obtains only in the household groups which stick together not because the members are kin in blood but because they have eaten together and slept together and grieved and hoped and fought among themselves so long huddling immobile and blinking beneath the high unclimbable wire and the searchlights and machinegun platforms and the lounging scornful guards all in silhouette on the sunset as if the lethal shock which charged the wire ten minutes ago had at the same instant electrocuted them all into inflexible arrestment against the end of time they were still huddled there when the new tumult began in the city the sun had set the bugles had rung and ceased the gun had crashed from the old citadel and clapped and reverberated away and the huddled regiment was already fading into one neutral mass in the middle of the parade ground when the first faint yelling came across the plain but they did nothing at first except to become more still as dogs do at the rising note of a siren about to reach some unbearable pitch which the human ear will not hear at all in fact when they did begin to make the sound it was not human at all but animal not yelling but howling huddling still in the dusk that fading and shapeless mass which might have been protoplasm itself eyeless and tongueless on the floor of the first dividing of the sea palpant and vociferant with no motion nor sound of its own but instead to some gigantic uproar of the primal aircrashing tides mighty copulation while overhead on the catwalks and platforms the senegalese lounged on their rifles or held to cigarettes the small windless flames of lighters contrived of spent cartridge cases as if the glare of day had hidden until now that which the dusk exposed that the electric shock which had fixed them in carbon immobility had left here and there one random notyetfaded coal the dusk seemed to have revealed to them the lighted window too it was in the old onceivied wall of what had been the factorys main building they might even have seen the man standing in it though probably the window alone was enough not yelling but howling they began to flow across the compound but the night moved still faster the mass of them had already faded completely into it before they had crossed the parade ground so that it was the sound the howling which seemed to roll on and crash and recoil and roar again against the wall beneath the lighted window and the motionless silhouette of the man standing in it and recoiled and roared again while a hurried bugle began to blat and whistles to shrill and a close body of white infantry came rapidly around the corner and began to push them away from the wall with short jabbing blows of rifle butts when the guard came for them the corporal was still standing at the window looking down at the uproar the thirteen of them were in a small perfectly bare perfectly impregnable singlewindowed cell which obviously had been a strong room of some sort back in the old dead time when the factory had been merely a factory a single dingy electric bulb burned in the center of the ceiling behind a wire cage like the end of a rattrap it had been burning when they were herded into the room shortly after dawn this morning and since it was american electricity or that is was already being charged daily one day in advance to the service of supply of the american expeditionary force it had been burning ever since so as the day succumbed to evening the faces of the thirteen men sitting quietly on the floor against one wall did not fade wanly back into the shadows but rather instead emerged not even wan but unshaven and therefore even more virile gathering to themselves an even further ghastly and jaundiced strength when the first stir of movement went through the compound as the senegalese began to evict the regiment from the barracks the thirteen men sitting against the wall of the cell did not appear to respond to it unless there might have been a further completer stillness and arrestment travelling as though from one to another among twelve of themthe halfturn of a face the quick almost infinitesimal sideglancing of an eye toward the thirteenth one the corporal sitting in the center of them whothe corporaldid not move at all until the first roar of yelling rolled across the parade ground and crashed like a wave against the wall beneath the window then the corporal rose to his feet not quietly nor deliberately so much as easily as mountain men move and went to the window and his hands lying as lightly and easily among the bars as they had lain on the lorrys top rail stood looking down at the yelling he didnt seem to be listening to it just looking at it watching it pour across the compound to break in one inaudible crash beneath the window in the wan glow from which the men themselves were now visiblethe clenched fists the pale individual faces which even gaped with yelling he may have recognised having spent four years crouched with them behind bulletsnicked parapets or trying bittentongued to anneal into the stinking muck of shell craters beneath drum fire or rolling barrages or flattened immobile and unbreathing beneath the hiss and whisper of flares on night patrols he seemed not to listen to it but to watch it immobile and detached while the frantic bugle yelped and the whistles shrilled and the infantry section burst on its collapsing flank and whirled it slowly away he didnt move he looked exactly like a stonedeaf man watching with interest but neither surprise nor alarm the pantomime of some cataclysm or even universal uproar which neither threatens nor even concerns him since to him it makes no sound at all then heavy boots tramped and clashed in the corridor the corporal turned from the window and this time the other twelve faces moved too lifting as one and pacing along the wall the tramp of the invisible feet beyond it until the feet halted so that they were all looking at the door when it opened and flung back and a sergeant they were not senegalese nor even white infantry this time but provost marshals people stood in it and made a sweeping peremptory gesture with his arm on your feet he said still preceding the chiefofstaff and pausing only long enough for the aide to open the door and get out of the way the division commander entered the room it was less large than a modern concert hall in fact it had been merely a boudoir back in the time of its dead duchess or marquise and it still bore the imprint of that princely insensate and perhaps one of the duchesses or marquises had thought impregnable opulence in its valanced alcoves and pilastered medallioned ceiling and crystal chandeliers and sconces and mirrors and girandoles and buhl etageres and glazed cabinets of faience bibelots and a white rug into which warbleachened boots sank ankledeep as into the muck of trenches say in the cold face of the moon flooring bland and soft as cloud that majestic vista at the end of which the three old generals sat backed by a hovering frieze of aides and staff they sat behind a tremendous oblong table as bare and flat and richly austere as the top of a knights or a bishops sarcophagus all three in the spectacles of old men and each with a thick identical sheaf of clipped papers before him so that the whole group in their dust or horizoncolored clothing and brassandscarletandleather harness had a look paradoxical and bizarre both scholarly and outlandish like a pack of tameless forest beasts dressed in the regalia and set in the environment of civilised office and waiting in decorous and almost somnolent unhaste while the three old leaders sat for a specified time over the meaningless papers which were a part of the regalia too until the moment came not to judge nor even condemn but just to fling away the impeding papers and garments and execute the windows were open curtain and casement so that there came into the room not only the afternoon light and air but something of the citys tumult toonot sound because the voices even the sudden uproar of them which the division commander and the chiefofstaff had just left outside in the place de ville didnt reach here it was rather a sense a quality as of the light itself a reflection as of light itself from the massed faces below refracted upward into the room through the open windows like light from disturbed water pulsing and quivering faintly and constantly on the ceiling where nobody not even the clerks and secretaries coming and going steadily on their endless minuscule errands would notice it without they chanced to look up unless like now when something had caused the pulse to beat a little faster so that when the division commander and the chiefofstaff entered everyone in the room was looking at the door though almost as soon as they entered that too died away and the refraction merely quivered again the division commander had never seen the room before he did not look at it now he just entered and paused for a rigid infinitesimal instant until the chiefofstaff came abreast on his right the sabre between them now under the chiefofstaffs left arm then almost in step they trod the rugs blanched vista to the table and halted rigidly together while the chiefofstaff saluted and took from under his arm the dead sabre furled loosely in the dangling buckleends of its harness like a badlyrolled umbrella and laid it on the table and staring rigidly at nothing while the chiefofstaff verbally performed the formal rite of his relinquishment the division commander thought its true he knew me at once thinking no worse that the old man had already known him long before anyone announced the two of them from an anteroom that apparently he had come all the long way from that instant in the observation post two mornings back where his career died merely to prove what all who knew the old marshals name believed that the old man remembered the name and face of every man in uniform whom he had ever seennot only those out of the old regiment into which he had been commissioned from st cyr and the ranking commanders of his armies and corps whom he saw daily but their staffs and secretaries and clerks and the commanders of divisions and brigades and their staffs and regimental and battalion and company officers and their orderlies and batmen and runners and the privates whom he had decorated or reprimanded or condemned and the nco leaders and degreeless fileclosers of sections and platoons and squads whose inspectionopened ranks he had merely walked rapidly through once thirty and forty years ago calling them all my child just as he did his own handsome young personal aide and his ancient batman and his chauffeur a sixandahalf foot basque with the face of a murderer of female children he the division commander had seen no movement his recollection on entering was that the old marshal had been holding the sheaf of papers open in his hand yet it was not only closed now it was pushed slightly aside and the old marshal had removed the spectacles holding them lightly in a mottled old mans hand almost completely hidden inside the round tremendous orifice of an immaculately laundered cuff detachable from an oldfashioned starched white civilian shirt and looking for just a second into the spectacleless eyes the division commander remembered something lallemont had said once if i were evil i would hate and fear him if i were a saint i would weep if i were wise and both or either i would despair yes general gragnon the old general said staring again not at anything but at simple eyelevel above the old generals head the division commander repeated orally the report which he had already recognised as soon as he entered the roomthe verbatim typescripts signed by himself and endorsed by the corps commander lying now in mimeographed triplicate before the three generals and finished and stopped for a moment as the lecturer pauses to turn a page or sip from the glass of water then repeated for the fourth time his official request for the regiments execution inflexible and composed before the table on which lay the triumvirate markers of his careers sepulture the triplicate monument of what the group commander had called his glory he discharged for the fourth time the regiment from the rolls of his division as though it had vanished two mornings ago in the face of a machinegun battery or a single mine explosion he hadnt changed it it had been right thirtysix hours ago when his honor and integrity as its or any regiments division commander compelled him to anticipate having to make it it was still right the second after that when he discovered that that which had given him the chance to become commander of a division in exchange for the dedication of his honor and life was compelling him to deliver it so it was still right now for the very reason that it was the same honor and integrity which the beneficence had found worthy to be conferred with the three stars of his major generals rank rather than the beneficence itself which was making the demand the compulsion because the beneficence itself didnt need the gesture as the group commander himself had practically told him this morning what he was saying now had no connection at all beyond mere coincidence with what lay on the table the speech was much older than that moment two days ago in the observation post when he discovered that he was going to have to make it its conception was the moment he found he was to be posted to officers school its birth the day he received the commission so that it had become along with the pistol and sabre and the sublieutenants badges a part of the equipment with which he would follow and serve his destiny with his life as long as life lasted its analogous coeval was that one of the live cartridges constant through the pistols revolving cylinder against the moment when he would discharge the voluntary lien he had given on his honor by expiating what a civilian would call bad luck and only a soldier disgrace theanybad luck in it being merely this moment now when the need compelled the speech yet at the same time denied the bullet in fact it seemed to him now that the two of them speech and bullet were analogous and coeval even in more than birth analogous in the very incongruity of the origins from which they moved not even shaped yet toward their mutual enda lump of dross exhumed from the earth and become under heat brass and under fierce and cunning pressure a cartridge case from a laboratory a pinch a spoonful a dust precipitate of earths and airs primordial motion the two condensed and combined behind a tiny locked grooved slug and all micrometered to a servant breech and bore not even within its cognizance yet like a footman engaged from an employment agency over the telephonehalf europe went to war with the other half and finally succeeded in dragging half the western hemisphere along a plan a design vast in scope exalted in conception in implication and hope terrifying not even conceived here at grand headquarters by the three old generals and their trained experts and advisers in orderly conference but conceived out of the mutual rage and fear of the three oceandividing nations themselves simultaneously at washington and london and paris by some immaculate pollenization like earths simultaneous leafage and come to birth at a council not even held at grand headquarters but behind locked and guarded doors in the quai dorsaya council where trained military experts dedicated as irrevocably to war as nuns are married to god were outnumbered by those who were not only not trained for war they were not even braided and panoplied for itthe prime ministers and premiers and secretaries the cabinet members and senators and chancellors and those who outnumbered even them the board chairmen of the vast establishments which produced the munitions and shoes and tinned foods and the modest unsung omnipotent ones who were the priests of simple money and the others still who outnumbered even these the politicians the lobbyists the owners and publishers of newspapers and the ordained ministers of churches and all the other accredited travelling representatives of the vast solvent organizations and fraternities and movements which control by coercion or cajolery mans morals and actions and all his massvalue for affirmation or negationall that vast powerful terrorinspiring representation which running all democracys affairs in peace come indeed into their own in war finding their true apotheosis then in iron conclave now decreeing for half the earth a design vast in its intention to demolish a frontier and vaster still in its furious intent to obliterate a people all in conclave so single that the old gray inscrutable supreme general with the face of one who long ago had won the right to believe in nothing whatever save mans deathless folly didnt need to vote at all but simply to preside and so presiding contemplated the plans birth and then watched it not even needing to control it as it took its ordained undeviable course descending from nations confederated to nations selected to forces to army groups to armies to corps all that gigantic long complex chronicle at the end reduced to a simple regimental attack against a simple elevation of earth too small to show on a map known only to its own neighborhood and even that by a number and a nickname dating back less than four years to the moment when someone had realised that you could see perhaps a quartermile further from its summit than its foot an attack not allotted to a division but selfcompelled to it by its own geography and logistics because the alternatives were either here or nowhere this or nothing and compelled to his particular division for the reason that the attack was doomed and intended as failure and his was the division among all with which failure could be bought cheapest as another might be the division with which a river could be crossed or a village taken cheapest he realised now that it had not been necessary for anyone to have foreseen the mutiny because the mutiny itself didnt matter the failure alone would have been enough and how and why it failed nobody cared the mutiny flung in as lagniappe to that end whose sole aim had been to bring him to attention here before the table on which lay in its furled scabbard the corpse of his career to repeat for the fourth time the speech who had been denied the bullet and finish it and stop the whole regiment the old marshal said repeating in his turn in a voice inscrutable and pleasant and so void of anything as to seem almost warm inattentive almost impersonal not just this ringleader and his twelve disciples by all means the nine of them who are frenchmen yet still permitted themselves to be corrupted there was no ringleader the division commander said harsh and rigid the regiment mutinied the regiment mutinied the old marshal repeated again and suppose we do what of the other regiments in your division when they learn of it shoot them the division commander said and the other divisions in your corps and the other corps on either side of you shoot them the division commander said and stood again inflexible and composed while the old marshal turned and translated quietly and rapidly to the british general and the american on either side of him then turned back and said to the chiefofstaff thank you general the chiefofstaff saluted but the division commander did not wait for him already aboutfacing leaving the chiefofstaff once more the split of a second late since he had to perform his own manoeuver which even a crack drillsergeant could not have done smoothly with no more warning than this having in fact to take two long extra steps to get himself again on the division commanders right hand and failingor almosthere too so that it was the old marshals personal aide who flanked the division commander the chiefofstaff himself still half a pace behind as they trod the white rug once more back to the now open door just outside which a provost marshals officer correct with sidearms waited though before they reached him the division commander was even in front of the aide so the aide was flanking not the division commander but the chiefofstaff pacing him correctly on the left back to the open door beyond which the provost officer waited while the division commander passed through it whereupon the aide not only effaced from the room the entire significance of the surrendered sabre he obliterated from it the whole gauche inference of war as he stepped quickly and lightly and even a little swaggeringly toward the open door beyond which the division commander and the provost officer had vanished it was as though in declining in advance to hold the door for the division commander even though the division commander had already declined the courtesy in advance by not waiting for it he had not merely retaliated upon the junior general for the juniors affrontment to the senior generals precedence he had used the junior as the instrument to postulate both himself and the chiefofstaff as being irrevocably alien and invincibly unconcerned with everything the room and those it contained representedthe very tall elegantly thin captain of twentyeight or thirty with the face and body of a durable matinee idol who might have been a creature from another planet anachronistic and immune inviolable so invincibly homeless as to be completely and impregnably at home on this or any other planet where he might find himself not even of tomorrow but of the day before it projected by reverse avatar back into a world where what remained of lost and finished man struggled feebly for a moment yet among the jumbled ruins of his yesterdaysa creature who had survived intact the fact that he had no place no business whatever in war who for all gain or loss to wars inexorable gambit or that of the frantic crumbling nations either might as well have been floating gowned and capped and with the golden tassel of a lordship too since he looked more like a scion than any dukes son across an oxford or cambridge quadrangle compelling those watching him and the chiefofstaff to condone the deodorization of wars effluvium even from the uniforms they wore leaving them simply costumes stepping rapidly and lightly and elegantly past the chiefofstaff to grasp the knob and shut the door until the latch caught then turned the knob and opened the door and clicked not to attention but into a rigid brief inclination from the waist as the chiefofstaff passed through it then he closed the door and turned and started back down the room then in the same instant stopped again and now apparently essayed to efface from it even the rumor of war which had entered at second hand motionless for that moment at the top of the splendid diminishing vista there was about him like an aura a quality insouciant solitary and debonair like harlequin solus on a second or thirdact stage as the curtain goes down or rises while he stood with his head turned slightly aside listening then he moved rapid and boneless on his long boneless legs toward the nearest window but the old marshal spoke before he had taken the second step saying quietly in english leave them open the aide paid no attention whatever he strode to the window and thrust his whole upper body out as he reached for the outswung casement and began to swing it in then he stopped he said in french not loud in a sort of rapt amazement dispassionate and momentary it looks like a crowd at a race track waiting for the twosou window to openif they have such no they look like they are watching a burning pawnshop leave it open the old general said in english the aide paused again the casement half closed he turned his head and said in english too perfectly with no accent whatever not even of oxford not even of beacon hill why not have them inside and be done with it they cant hear whats going on out there this time the old general spoke french they dont want to know he said they want only to suffer leave it open yes sir the aide said in french he flung the casement out again and turned as he did so one leaf of the double doors in the opposite wall opened it opened exactly six inches by no visible means and stopped the aide didnt even glance toward it he came on into the room saying in that perfect accentless english dinner gentlemen as both leaves of the door slid back the old general rose when the two other generals did but that was all when the doors closed behind the last aide he was already seated again then he pushed the closed folder further aside and folded the spectacles into their worn case and buttoned the case into one of his upper tunic pockets and alone now in the vast splendid room from which even the citys tumult and anguish was fading as the afternoon light died from the ceiling motionless in the chair whose high carven back topped him like the back of a throne his hands hidden below the rich tremendous table which concealed most of the rest of him too and apparently not only immobile but immobilised beneath the mass and glitter of his braid and stars and buttons he resembled a boy a child crouching amid the golden debris of the tomb not of a knight or bishop ravished in darkness but perhaps the mummy itself of a sultan or pharaoh violated by christians in broad afternoon then the same leaf of the double door opened again exactly as before for exactly six inches and no hand to show for it and making only the slightest of sounds and even then giving the impression that if it had wanted to it could have made none and that what it did make was only the absolute minimum to be audible at all opening for that six inches and then moving no more until the old general said yes my child then it began to close making no sound at all now that sound was no longer necessary moving on half the distance back to closure with its fellow leaf when it stopped again and with no pause began to open again still noiseless but quite fast now so fast that it had opened a good eighteen inches and in another instant who or whatever moved it would of necessity reveal expose him or itself before the old general could or did speak no he said the door stopped it didnt close it just quit moving at all and seemed to hang like a wheel at balance with neither top nor bottom hanging so until the old general spoke again leave them open then the door closed it went all the way to this time and the old general rose and came around the table and went to the nearest window walking through the official end of day as across a threshold into night because as he turned the end of the table the scattered bugles began to sound the three assemblies and as he crossed the room the clash of boots and rifles came up from the courtyard and when he reached the window the two guards were already facing one another for the first note of the three retreats and the formal exchange to begin but the old general didnt seem to be watching it he just stood in the window above the thronged motionless place where the patient mass of people lay against the iron fence nor did he turn his head when the door opened rapidly this time and the young aide entered carrying a telephone whose extension flowed behind him across the white rug like the endless tail of a trophy and went behind the table and with his foot drew up one of the chairs and sat down and set the telephone on the table and lifted the receiver and shot into view the watch on his other wrist and became motionless the receiver to his ear and his eyes on the watch instead he just stood there a little back from the window and a little to one side holding the curtain slightly aside visible if anyone in the place had thought to look up while the scattered brazen adjurations died into the clash and stamp as the two guards came to at ease and the whole borderline no longer afternoon yet not quite evening either lay in unbreathing suspension until the bugles began again the three this time in measured discordant unison the three voices in the courtyard barking in unison too yet invincibly alien the two groups of heavily armed men posturing rigidly at each other like a tribal ritual for religious immolation he could not have heard the telephone since the aide already had the receiver to his ear and merely spoke an acknowledging word into it then listened a moment and spoke another word and lowered the receiver and sat waiting too while the bugles chanted and wailed like cocks in the raddled sunset and died away he has landed the aide said he got down from the aeroplane and drew a pistol and called his pilot to attention and shot him through the face they dont know why they are englishmen the old general said that will do of course the aide said im surprised they have as little trouble as they do in continental wars in any of their wars he said yes sir he rose to his feet i had arranged to have this line open at five points between here and villeneuve blanche so you could keep informed of his progress it is indistinguishable from his destination the old general said without moving that will do the aide put the receiver back on its hook and took up the telephone and went back around the table the limber endless line recoiling onto itself across the rug until he flicked the diminishing loop after him through the door and closed it at that moment the sunset gun thudded no sound but rather a postulation of vacuum as though back into its blastvacated womb the regurgitated martial day had poured in one reverberant clap from just beyond the window came the screak and whisper of the three blocks and the three downreeling lanyards and the same leaf of the door opened again for that exact six inches paused then without any sound opened steadily and unmotived on and still the old general stood while the thricealien voices barked and beneath the three tenderlyborne mystical rags the feet of the three color guards rang the cobbled courtyard and in measured iron diminution the cobbled evening itself and now the mass beyond the fence itself began to move flowing back across the place toward the diverging boulevards emptying the place already fading before it was out of the place as though with one long quiet inhalation evening was effacing the whole meek mist of man now the old general stood above the city which already immune to mans enduring was now even free of his tumult or rather the evening effaced not man from the place de ville so much as it effaced the place de ville back into mans enduring anguish and his invincible dust the city itself not really free of either but simply taller than both because they endured as only endurance can firmer than rock more invincible than folly longer than grief the darkling and silent city rising out of the darkling and empty twilight to lower like a tumescent thunderclap since it was the effigy and the power rising tier on inviolate tier out of that mazed chiaroscuro like a tremendous beehive whose crown challenged by day the sun and stemmed aside by night the celestial smore first and topmost were the three flags and the three supreme generals who served them a triumvirate consecrated and anointed a constellation remote as planets in their immutability powerful as archbishops in their trinity splendid as cardinals in their retinues and myriad as brahmins in their blind followers next were the three thousand lesser generals who were their deacons and priests and the hierarchate of their households their acolytes and bearers of monstrance and host and censer the colonels and majors who were in charge of the portfolios and maps and memoranda the captains and subalterns who were in charge of the communications and errands which kept the portfolios and maps up to date and the sergeants and corporals who actually carried the portfolios and mapcases and protected them with their lives and answered the telephone and ran the errands and the privates who sat at the flickering switchboards at two and three and four oclock in the morning and rode the motorcycles in the rain and snow and drove the starred and pennoned cars and cooked the food for the generals and colonels and majors and captains and subalterns and made their beds and shaved them and cut their hair and polished their boots and brass and inferior and nethermost even in that braided inviolate hierarchate so crowded was the city with generals of high rank and their splendid and shining staffs that not only were subalterns and captains and even majors and colonels nothing distinguishable from civilians only because they wore uniforms there was even a nadir among these men who had actually been in come out of the battle zone as high in rank as majors and even colonels sometime strayed into the glittering and gunless city through nobody knew what bizarre convulsion of that military metabolism which does everything to a man but lose him which learns nothing and forgets nothing and loses nothing at all whatever and foreverno scrap of paper no unfinished record or uncompleted memorandum no matter how inconsequential or trivial a few of them were always there not many but enough platoon or section leaders and company commanders and battalion seconds stained with the filth of front lines who amid that thronged pomp and glitter of stars and crossed batons and braid and brass and scarlet tabs moved diffident and bewildered and ignored with the lost air of oafish peasants smelling of field and stable summoned to the castle the great house for an accounting or a punishment a wounded man armless legless or eyeless was stared at with the same aghast distasteful refusive pity and shock and outrage as a man in an epileptic seizure at high noon on a busy downtown corner then the civilians antipas his friends and their friends merchant and prince and bishop administrator clacquer and absolver to ministrate the attempt and applaud the intention and absolve the failed result and all the nephews and godsons of tiberius in far rome and their friends and the friends of the wives and the husbands of their friends come to dine with the generals and sell to the generals governments the shells and guns and aircraft and beef and shoes for the generals to expend against the enemy and their secretaries and couriers and chauffeurs who had got military deferment because the briefcases had to be carried and the motorcars driven and those who actually dwelled as paterfamiliae among the citys boulevards and avenues and even less base streets already before the city entered its fouryear apotheosis and while apotheosis obtained and would still so they hoped after apotheosis had ceased and been forgottenmayor and burgher doctor attorney director inspector and judge who held no particular letter from tiberius in rome yet whose contacts were still among generals and colonels and not captains and subalterns even if they were restricted to drawing rooms and dining tables publican and smith and baker and grocer and wright whose contacts were not with captains nor subalterns nor with sergeants and corporals and privates neither since it was their wives who knitted behind the zinc bars and weighed and exchanged sous for the bread and greens and beat the underwear on the rivers margin stones and the women who were not the wives of directors or bakers who traded not in war but because of war and who as in a sense two thousand nine hundred and ninetyseven of the generals were just one general were all one woman too whether staff colonels stood when they entered rooms or whether they lived on the same floor in modest pensions with service corps captains or boiled the soup of communications corporals or troops themselves received their partners in what is called love and perhaps even is from a sergeants rollcall as a soldier receives his iron ration or boots and no need for that partner to put back on his tunic or greatcoat before going on into the lines because the sergeant who checked him into and out of that love which perhaps had never let him take either off so that as often as not she carried into sleep with her that night a dead mans still warm and living seed and then and last even anonymitys absolute whose nameless faceless mass cluttered old jerusalem and old rome too while from time to time governor and caesar flung them bread or a circus as in the old snowy pantomime the fleeing shepherd casts back to the pursuing wolves fragments of his lunch a garment and as a last resort the lamb itselfthe laborers who owned today only the spending of what they earned yesterday the beggars and thieves who did not always understand that what they did was beggary and theft the lepers beneath city gate and temple door who did not even know they were not whole who belonged neither to the military nor to the merchants and princes and bishops who neither derived nor hoped for any benefit from army contracts nor battened by simply existing breathing coeval with the prodigality and waste concomitant with a nations mortal agony that strange and constant few who each time are denied any opportunity whatever to share in the rich carnival of their countrys wasting lifeblood whose luck is out always with no kin nor friends who have kin or friends who have powerful kin or friends or patrons who owned nothing in fact save a reversion in endurance without hope of betterment nor any spur of pridea capacity for endurance which even after four years of existence as tolerated and rightless aliens on their own land and in their own city still enabled them without hope or pride even in the endurance to endure asking or expecting no more than permission to exercise it like a sort of immortality out of that enduring and anguished dust it rose out of the dark gothic dream carrying the gothic dream arch and buttresswinged by knight and bishop angels and saints and cherubim groined and pilastered upward into soaring spire and pinnacle where goblin and demon gryphon and gargoyle and hermaphrodite yelped in icy soundless stone against the fading zenith the old general dropped the curtain and began to turn from the window you may close he said then he stopped it was as though he didnt anticipate the sound so much as he simply foreknew it already motionless when the sound came into the windowan uproar thin and distant across the city not diffuse now but localised and still curiously localised by source even when it began to move as if it were directed at some small specific object no larger than a man and it was not the yelling which moved but the object of it retreating slowly before the yellingnot turning back to the window but simply arrested beside it hooves clattered suddenly in the place and a body of cavalry crossed it at trot and entered the boulevard leading toward the old eastern gate already at canter and went on then for a time the sound of the hooves seemed to have dissolved into been smothered by the yelling until suddenly the cavalry had ridden as though into the yelling as into a weightless mass of dead leaves exploding them flinging and hurling them to reappear the next second like centaurs in furious soundless motion intact in an intact visible cloud of swirling frantic screams which continued to swirl and burst in that faint frenetic tossing even after the horses must indubitably have been gone still swirling and tossing in scattered diminuendo when the other sound began it came up beneath them beginning not as sound at all but rather as light diffused yet steady from across the plain beyond the city the voices of men alone choral almost growing not in volume but in density as dawn itself increases filling the low horizon beyond the citys black and soaring bulk with a band not of sound but light while above and into it the thin hysteric nearer screams and cries skittered and spun and were extinguished like sparks into water still filling the horizon even after the voices themselves had ceased with a resonant humming like a fading sunset and heatless as aurora against which the black tremendous city seemed to rush skyward in one fixed iron roar out of the furious career of earth toward its furious dust upreared and insensate as an iron ships prow among the fixed insensate stars this time the old general turned from it the single leaf of the door was now open about three feet and there stood beside it an old old man not at all at attention but just standing there he was hardly larger than a child not stooped or humped and shrunken was not the word either he was condensed intact and unshriveled the long ellipsoid of his life almost home again now where rosy and blemishless without memory or grieving flesh mewling bald and toothless he would once more possess but three things and would want no more a stomach a few surface nerves to seek warmth a few cells capable of sleep he was not a soldier the very fact that he wore not only a heavy regulation infantrymans buttonedback greatcoat but a steel helmet and a rifle slung across his back merely made him look less like one he stood there in spectacles in the faded coat which had been removed perhaps from its first or last owners corpseit still bore the darker vacancies where an ncos chevrons and a regimental number had been removed and neatly stitched together on the front of it just above where the skirts folded back was the suture where something a bayonet obviously had entered it and within the last twentyfour hours it had been brushed carefully and ironed by hand by someone who could not see very welland processed through a cleansing and delousing plant and then issued to him from a quartermasters salvage depot and the polished steel helmet and the clean polished rifle which looked as lovinglytended and unused as a twelfthcentury pike from a private museum which he had never fired and did not know how to fire and would not have fired nor accepted a live cartridge for even if there was a single man in all the french armies who would have given him one he had been the old generals batman for more than fifty years except for the thirteen years beginning on the day more than forty years ago now when the old general a captain with a brilliant and almost incredible future had vanished not only from the army lists but from the ken of all the people who up to that time had thought they knew him also to reappear thirteen years later in the army lists and the world too with the rank of brigadier and none to know whence nor why either although as regards the rank they did know how his first official act had been to find his old batman then a clerk in a commissarys office in saigon and have him assigned back to his old position and rating he stood there healthily pink as an infant ageless and serene in his aura of indomitable fidelity invincibly hardheaded incorrigibly opinionated and convinced undeflectable in advice suggestion and comment and invincibly contemptuous of war and all its ramifications constant durable faithful and insubordinate and almost invisible within the clutter and jumble of his martial parody so that he resembled an aged servant of some ancient ducal house dressed in ceremonial regalia for the annual commemoration of some old old event some ancient defeat or glory of the house so long before his time that he had long ago forgotten the meaning and significance if he ever knew it while the old general crossed the room and went back around the table and sat down again then the old batman turned and went back through the door and reappeared immediately with a tray bearing a single plain soup bowl such as might have come from an ncos mess or perhaps from that of troops themselves and a small stone jug and the end of a loaf and a battered pewter spoon and an immaculate folded damask napkin and set the tray on the table before the old marshal and the beautifully polished rifle gleaming and glinting as he bent and recovered and stood back watched fond and domineering and implacable the old marshals every move as the old marshal took up the bread and began to crumble it into the bowl when he entered st cyr at seventeen except for that fragment of his splendid fate which even here he could not escape he seemed to have brought nothing of the glittering outside world he had left behind him but a locketa small object of chased worn gold obviously valuable or anyway venerable resembling a huntingcase watch and obviously capable of containing two portraits only capable of containing such since none of his classmates ever saw it open and in fact they only learned he possessed it through the circumstance that one or two of them happened to see it on a chain about his neck like a crucifix in the barracks bathroom one day and even that scant knowledge was quickly adumbrated by the significance of that destiny which even these gates were incapable of severing him fromthat of being not only the nephew of a cabinet minister but the godson of the board chairman of that gigantic international federation producing munitions which with a few alterations in the lettering stamped into the head of each cartridge and shellcase fitted almost every military rifle and pistol and light fieldpiece in all the western hemisphere and half the eastern too yet despite this because of his secluded and guarded childhood until he entered the academy the world outside the faubourg st germain had scarcely ever seen him and the world which began at the paris banlieu had never even heard of him except as a male christian name he was an orphan an only child the last male of his line who had grown from infancy in the sombre insulate house of his mothers eldest sister in the rue vaugirardwife of a cabinet minister who was himself a nobody but a man of ruthless and boundless ambition who had needed only opportunity and got it through his wifes money and connections andthey were childlesshad legally adopted her family by hyphenating its name onto his own the child growing to the threshold of manhood not only that heir and heir to the power and wealth of his bachelor godfather the comité de ferrovie chairman who had been his fathers closest friend but before any save his aunts faubourg st germain salons and their servants and his tutors could connect his face with his splendid background and his fabulous future so when he entered the academy none of the classmates with whom he was to spend the next four years and probably the staff and the professors too had ever seen him before and he had been there probably twentyfour hours before any of them except one even connected his face with his great name this one was not a youth too but instead already a man twentytwo years old who had entered the academy two days before and was to stand number two to the others one on the day of graduation who on that first afternoon began to believe and for the next fifteen years would continue that he had seen at once in that seventeenyearold face the promise of a destiny which would be the restored this was two years after the capitulation and formal occupation of paris glory and destiny of france too as for the rest of them their first reaction was that of the world outside surprise and amazement and for the moment downright unbelief that he this youth was here at all it was not because of his appearance of fragility and indurability they simply read the face also into that fragility and indurability which during that first instant when he seemed to be not entering the gates but rather framed immobilely by them had fixed him as absolutely and irrevocably discrepant to that stonebastioned iron maw of wars apprenticeship as a figure out of a stained glass cathedral window set by incomprehensible chance into the breached wall of a fort it was because to them his was the golden destiny of an hereditary crown prince of paradise to them he was not even a golden youth he was the golden youth to them inside the academy and to all that world stretching from the paris banlieu to the outermost rim where the word paris faded he was not even a parisian but the parisian a millionaire and an aristocrat from birth an orphan and an only child not merely heir in his own right to more francs than anyone knew save the lawyers and bankers who guarded and nursed and incremented them but to the incalculable weight and influence of the uncle who was the nations first cabinet member even though another did bear the title and the precedence and of that godfather whose name opened doors which a comité de ferrovie chairmans because of their implications and commitments or a bachelors of their sex gender even that of a cabinet minister could not who had only to reach majority in order to inherit that matchless of all catastrophes the privilege of exhausting his lifeor if necessary shortening itby that matchless means of all being young male unmarried an aristocrat wealthy secure by right of birth in paris that city which was the world too since of all cities it was supreme dreamed after and adored by all men and not just when she was supreme in her pride but whenas nowshe was abased from it indeed never more dreamed after and adored than now while in abasement never more so than now because of what in any other city would have been abasement never more than now was she not frances paris but the worlds the defilement being not only a part of the adored immortality and the immaculateness and therefore necessary to them but since it was the sort of splendid abasement of which only paris was capable being capable of it made her the worlds paris conqueredor rather not conquered since frances paris she was inviolate and immune to the very iron heel beneath which the rest of france and since she was the worlds paris too the rest of the world also lay supine and abasedimpregnable and immune the desired the civilised worlds inviolate and forever unchaste virgin barren and insatiable the mistress who renewed her barren virginity in the very act of each barren recordless promiscuity eve and lilith both to every man in his youth so fortunate and blessed as to be permitted within her omnivorous insatiable orbit the victorious invading hun himself bemazed not so much by his success as his sudden and incredible whereabouts shuffling his hobbed boots in the perfumed anteroom dreaming no less than one born to that priceless fate on whom herself immortal she conferred brief immortalitys godhead in exchange for no more than his young mans youth yet here he was just another anonymous one in a class of candidates for professional careers not merely in the rigid hierarchy of an army but in an army which for the next fifty years would be struggling simply to survive to emerge from the debacle and debasement of defeat in order not to be feared as a threat but merely respected as a monument an anglosaxon mind could and almost any american would have read into his presence here a young mans dream in which he would see himself not by some irremediable sacrifice rescuing that adored city andromedalike from her brutal rock perhaps but at least as one of niobes or rachels children clapping up sword and buckler but not the latin the french mind to it that city had nothing to be saved from who had strangled all mans heart in any one strand of her vagrant lilith hair who barren had no sons they were her lovers and when they went to war it was for glory to lay before the altar of that unchaste unstale bed so only that single classmate ever believed other than that it was not the youth who repudiated paradise but paradise which repudiated its scion and heir not he but his family which had put him where he was not disinherited at all but disfranchised segregated the family which had compelled him into the army asfor them their name and positionat best the isolation quarantine of whatever was the threat he had become or represented and at worst the mausoleum of the shame which would be its result andfor hima refuge from the consequences because he was still who he was male and solitary and heir the family would still use the power and the influence even though they had had to isolate and quarantine his failure to be what he mightshouldhave been in fact his family had not even merely bought absolution for him on the contrary they would gain a sort of blinding redundance on the great names original splendor from the golden braid which his hat and sleeves would someday bear because even the single classmate believed that all that class and presently the three ahead of it too were eating and sleeping with one who would be a general at forty andgiven any sort of opportunity for any kind of a military debacle worthy of the name inside the next thirty yearsa marshal of france when the nation buried him only he didnt use the influence not in the next four years at least he didnt even need it he graduated not only at the top of the class but with the highest marks ever made at the academy such was his record that not even his classmates who would not have been offered it no matter what grades they graduated with were not even jealous of the quartermaster captaincy which rumor said was waiting for him at the academys exit like a hat or a cloak on the arm of a footman at the exit from a theatre or a restaurant yet when he next came into their cognizancewhich was immediately on the succeeding day when the rest of the class had barely begun the regulation two weeks leave before assuming dutyhe didnt have the captaincy he simply appeared at toulon without it still looking little different from what he had four years ago not fragile so much as invincibly indurable with his unblemished paybook for which he would have no more use than would the beggar for the kings farriers nail or the king for the beggars almsbox and his untried spartan subalterns kit and his virgin copy of the manual of war and the locket of course his classmates had not forgot that in fact they even knew now what the two portraits in it would be the uncle and the godfather his crucifix indeed his talisman his reliquary but with no more captaincy than the guest or patron leaving the theatre or restaurant by a fire exit or rear alley would have hat or cloak when he reached the boulevard butsave that onethey believed they knew the answer to this it was a gesture not the youths but the familysone of those gestures of modesty and discretion of the potent and powerful who are powerful and potent enough to afford even discretion and modesty they and he too were all waiting for the same thing for the arrival of the great suave hearselike midnightcolored limousine bringing not the civilian secretary bearing the captaincy like a ducal coronet on a velvet cushion but rather the uncleminister himself who would walk the nephew back to the quai dorsay and in that privacy fling away the meagre african subalterns kit with the cold outrage of a cardinal plucking a copy of martin luther from the robe of a kneeling candidate for consecration but that didnt happen either the car would have come too late because although the draft to which he would have been posted was not to leave for two weeks yet and its personnel had not even begun to arrive at the depot he was gone after only one night to africa to immediate field service quietly almost surreptitiously with the same simple sublieutenants rank and the same meagre equipment which the rest of them would have in their turn so now those who might have been jealous of him not only his st cyr coevals junior and senior who had no ministeruncles and chairmangodfathers but the career men who did have parents and guardians but not cabinet members and comité de ferrovie chairmen who hated him not because he had been offered the captaincy but because he had not accepted it no longer had to be because they knew that they would never overtake him now who would be removed forever more from envy and hence from hatred and fear both the three of them nephew godfather and uncle going fast now who had been ruthless even to the long tradition of nepotism the youth hurried to whatever remote frontier where rampant indeed would be the uncles and the godfathers power and will with none save an occasional inspectorgeneral to challenge it no bounds to the familys ambition nor check to that which furthered it they would be free who had bought immunity from envy by simply outlasting it when he reappeared say two years from now as a colonel of twentythree he would be far beyond the range of any envy and jealousy let alone theirs or perhaps it wouldnt even take two years one might be enough so great was their faith in not just the uncles and the godfathers power and will but in rapacity itself the compassionate the omnipotent the allseeing and allpervading one day the quai dorsay would gently outbreathe and against that fierce african foreshore would officially beat a national unanimity loud and long enough not only to obfuscate the mere circumstances of fact but to distract the mind from all curiosity regarding them there would remain only the accomplishment and its protagonist juxtaposed without past on a stage without yesterday like two masques for a pantomime furbished out of the bloodless lumberroom of literature because by that time he would have escaped not merely from fear and hatred but from the long rigid mosaic of seniority itself as irrevocably as does a girl from maidenhood they wouldcouldeven watch him now heatless peaceful and immune to any remembered anguisheven see him again passing among the windy bunting and the paraded troops in the cheering oran street in the governor generals car sitting on the right hand of the governor general himself the hero of twentytwo or three who had not at all merely saved some whatever scrap or fragment of an empire but had set again against the zenith the fierce similitude of a bird be though as it was but one more lost feather of the eagles which seventy years ago had stooped at all europe and africa and asia too they watching without jealousy now nor even rancor but rather with amazed admiration not merely for france but for invincible manthe hero still girlishlooking even after two years of african sun and solitude still frail and fragile in the same way that adolescent girls appear incredibly delicate yet at the same time invincibly durable like wisps of mist or vapor drifting checkless and insensate among the thunderous concretebedded mastodons inside a foundry appearing now only the more durable because of the provenno reprovenfragility at once frail yet at the same time intact and inviolable because of what in another had been not merely ruin but destruction too like the saint in the old tale the maiden who without hesitation or argument feeed in advance with her maidenhood the ferryman who set her across the stream and into heaven an anglosaxon fable too since only an anglosaxon could seriously believe that anything buyable at no more cost than that could really be worth a sainthoodthe hero the sheeplike acclaiming mass with not one among them all to ask or even wonder what he had done or when or where nor even against what or whom the victory as he passed immune even to the uproar across the cheering city to the quai and the destroyer a cruiser maybe a destroyer certainly which would carry him to his paris triumph and then return him chief of a corps and commander of a department or perhaps even governor general himself but that didnt happen either he crossed the mediterranean and disappeared when they followed in the order of their postings they learned that he had gone on from the port base too after even less than one night to assigned duty somewhere in the interior exactly where and on exactly what service nobody at the port base knew either but they had expected that they believed they even knew where he would be no place remote merely because it was far away and impossible to reach like brazzaville say where the three pale facescommandantgovernor new subaltern and halfbreed interpreterwould slumber hierarchate and superposed benignant and inscrutable irascible and hieroglyph like an american indian totem pole in ebon eden innocence but a place really remote not even passively isolate but actively and even aggressively private like an oasis in the deserts heart itself more blind than cave and circumferenced than safaria silken tent odorous with burning pastille and murmurous with the dreamy chock of the woodcutters axe and the pad of watercarriers feet where on a lionrobed divan he would await untimed destinys hasteless accouchement but they were wrong he had left the port base the same day he arrived for a station as famous in its circles as the black hole of calcuttaa small outpost not only five hundred kilometres from anything resembling a civilised stronghold or even handhold but sixty and more from its nearest supporta tiny lost compound manned by a sergeants platoon out of a foreign legion battalion recruited from the guttersweepings of all europe and south america and the levanta well a flagstaff a single building of loopholed clay set in a seared irreconciliable waste of sun and sand which few living men had ever seen to which troops were sent as punishment or incorrigibles for segregation until heat and monotony on top of their natural and acquired vices divorced them permanently from mankind he had gone straight there from the port base three years ago and the only officer present and for all practical purposes the only white man too had not only served out his own oneyear tour of command but that of his successor too and was now ten months forward in that of what would have been his successors successor in the shock of that first second of knowledge it seemed to themexcept that onethat earth itself had faltered rapacity itself had failed when regardless of whatever had been the nephews old defalcation from his familys hope or dream seven or eight or ten years ago even that uncle and that godfather had been incapable of saving him this until that single classmate picked up the whole picture and reversed it he was a norman son of a caen doctor whose grandfather while an art student in paris had become the friend and then the fanatic disciple of camille desmoulins until robespierre executed them both the greatgrandson come to paris to be a painter too but relinquished his dream to the military academy for the sake of france as the greatgrandfather had done his to the guillotine for the sake of man who for all his vast peasant bones had looked at twentytwo even more indurable and brittlykeyed than ever had his obsession at seventeena man with a vast sick flaccid moon of a face and hungry and passionate eyes who had looked once at that one which to all the world else had been that of any seventeenyearold youth and relinquished completely to it like a sixtyyearold longtime widower to that of a pubic unconscious girl who picked up the three figuresuncle nephew and godfatherlike so many paper dolls and turned them around and set them down again in the same positions and attitudes but obversed though this would be several years yet almost ten in fact after that day when they had watched that sunstricken offing behind oran accept that fragile stride and then close markless behind it like a painted backdrop not only markless but impenetrable too and not just a backdrop but alices lookingglass rather through which he had stepped not into unreality but instead carrying unreality with him to establish it where before there had been none four years from that day and he was still there at his little lost barren sunglared unfutured outpost who whether or not he had ever been an actual threat once was now an enigma burying its ostrichhead from the staff commission which would drag him back to paris and at least into vulnerable range of his old sybaritic renunciation five years from that day and beginning the sixth voluntary tour of that duty which should have fallen to every officer in the army list every man everywhere before it came to him and so grave the defalcation from which his family had had to bury him that not only was mere seniority confounded but the immutable rotation of military leave too not even the cafes of casa blanca or oran or algiers let alone paris had ever seen him then six years from that day and he had vanished from africa too none knew where except the norman classmates passionate and hungry hope vanished not only from the knowledge of man but from the golden warp and woof of the legend too leaving behind him only a name in the army list still with the old unchanged rank of sublieutenant but with nothing after it not even dead not even whereabouts unknown and even this was another two years by which time all of them who had feared him once not only the old st cyr class but its successors too were scattered and diffused about the perimeter where the thricebarred flag flew until the afternoon when five of them including the norman classmate and a staff captain met by chance in a quai dorsay anteroom were now sitting about a sidewalk table in front of the most adjacent cafe the staff officer already four years a captain even though only five years out of st cyr descendant of a napoleonic duchy whose founder or recipient had been a butcher then a republican then an imperialist then a duke and his son a royalist then a republican again andstill alive and still a dukethen a royalist again so that three of the four watching and listening to him thought how here was the true golden youth which that other one of eleven years ago whom he was talking about had refused to be realising aware for the first time not just what the other would have been by now butwith that family and background and powerwhat matchless pinnacle he might have reached since this one had behind him only simple proprietors of banks and manipulators of shares the staff captain using the anteroom to serve his captaincy in and three of the other four having reported to it that morning by mutual coincidence after three years on the asiatic station and the fourth one the junior having been assigned to it right out of the gates themselves the five of them coincidental about the cramped table on the crowded terrace while three of themincluding the norman giant who sat not among them so much as above them immense and sick and apparently insensate as a boulder save for his flaccid and hungry face and the passionate and hungry eyeslistening while the staff captain burly blunt brutal heavywitted and assured and so loud that people at the other tables had begun to turn talked about the almostforgotten sublieutenant at his tiny lost post in the depths of nevernever who should have been the idol pattern and hope not merely for all career officers but for all golden youth everywhere as was bonaparte not merely for all soldiers but for every ancestorless frenchman qualified first in poverty who was willing to hold life and conscience cheap enough wondering the staff captain what could have been out there in that desert to hold for six years above a quartermaster captaincy the sublieutenantcommand of a stinking well enclosed by eight palm trees and inhabited by sixteen unnationed cutthroats what out there that oran or casa blanca or even paris couldnt matchwhat paradise within some camelodored tentwhat limbs old and weary and cunning with ancient pleasures that montmartre bagnios and even st germain boudoirs knew nothing of yet so ephemeral so incipient with satiation and at last actual revulsion that after only six years the sultanmaster must vacate it vacate it one of the three said you mean hes gone he actually left that place at last not quite gone the staff captain said not until his relief arrives after all he accepted an oath to france even he even if he does hold from the comité de ferrovie he failed he lost a camel there was a man too even if he had spent most of his five enlistments in clink telling it the soldier spawned by a marseilles cesspool to be the ultimate and fatal nemesis of a woman a girl whom eighteen years ago he had corrupted and diseased and then betrayed into prostitution and at last murdered and had spent the eighteen years since as member of lost frontier garrisons such as this because thisthe rim of oblivionwas the one place on earth where he could continue to walk and breathe and be fed and clothed whose one fear now was that he might do something which would prompt someone to make him a corporal or a sergeant and so compel him back to some post within a days walk of any community large enough to possess one civilian policeman where not he would see a strange face but where some strange face would see him hethe soldier the trooper had vanished along with the camel obviously into the hands of an adjacent band or tribe of the riffs who were the excuse for the garrison being where it was and the reason for its being armed and though the man was a piece of government property too even if not a very valuable one that camel was a camel yet the commander of the post had apparently made no effort whatever to recover them whereupon theyhis listenersmight say that the commanders only failure in the matter had been that he had prevented a local war which was wrong he had not stopped a war he had simply failed to start one which was not his purpose there not why he had been tested and found competent for that command not to fail to start wars but to preserve government property so he had failed and yesterday his official request to be relieved had forwarded to the adjutantgenerals desk the norman was already on his feet while the staff captain was still talking at least four of them knew how he heard of the commands vacancy but not even these knew how he managed to get the succession to ita man without family or influence or money at all with nothing in fact to front or fend for him in his profession save the dubious capacity of his vast ill body to endure and the rating of two in his st cyr class already because of the rating a sublieutenant of engineers and because of the rating and his sick body both in addition to the fact that he had just completed a tour of field service in indo china from now on secure for a home establishment post probably in paris itself until retirement age overtook him yet within an hour he was in the office of the quartermaster general himself using having deliberately used the number two rating for the first and probably the last time in his life for the chance to stand facing the desk which he could not know or dream that someday he himself would sit behind himself in his turn sole unchallengeable arbiter over the whereabouts and maintenance of every man wearing a french uniform you an engineer the man facing him said so was hethe voice eager serene not importunate so much as simply not to be denied thats why you see remember i was number two to him in our class when he leaves it it belongs to me then you remember this the other said tapping the medical survey on the desk before him this is why you are not going back to saigon after your leave why you are going on home establishment from now on as for that you wouldnt live a year out there in that you were about to say hole he said isnt that its purpose for the honorable disposal of that selfproven to have no place in the establishment of man man france then he said and thirteen days later looked from the back of the camel across the glaring markless intervening miles as a thousand years afterward the first pilgrim must have looked at the barely distinguishable midden which the native guide assured him had been not golgotha of course but gethsemane at the flagstaff and the sunblanched walls in a nest of ragged and meagre palms at sunset he stood inside them rigid and immolant while the horn chanted and there descended on him in his turn that fringy raveling of empires carapace at first dark the two camels rumbling and gurgling just beyond earshot above the waiting orderly he stood at the gate beside the man who had been one to his two in the old class six years ago the two of them barely visible to one another leaving only the voice serene and tender passionate for suffering sick with hope i know they thought you were hiding they were afraid of you at first then they decided you were just a fool who insisted on becoming a marshal of france at fifty instead of fortyfive using the power and influence at twentyone and two and three and four and five to evade at fortyfive the baton you would have nothing left to fend off at fifty the power and the influence to escape the power and influence the world to escape the world to free yourself of flesh without having to die without having to lose the awareness that you were free of flesh not to escape from it and you could not be immune to it nor did you want to be only to be free of it to be conscious always that you were merely at armistice with it at the price of constant and unflagging vigilance because without that consciousness flesh would not exist for you to be free of it and so there would be nothing anywhere for you to be free of oh yes i knew the english poet byrons dream or wish or cry that all living women had but one single mouth for his kiss the supreme golden youth who encompassed all flesh by putting still virgin to it all flesh away but i knew better who sought a desert not as simeon did but as anthony using mithridates and heliogabalus not merely to acquire a roostingplace for contempt and scorn but for fee to the cave where the lion itself lay down whothe ones who feared you oncebelieved that they had seen ambition and greed themselves default before one seventeenyearold childhad seen the whole vast hitherto invulnerable hegemony of ruthlessness and rapacity reveal itself unfearsome and hollow when even that uncle and that godfather could not cope with your crime or defalcation as though so poor and thin was the ambition and greed to which even that uncle and that godfather were dedicant that voracity itself had repudiated them who had been its primest pillars and its supremest crown and glory which could not be that was not merely incredible it was unbearable rapacity does not fail else man must deny he breathes not rapacity its whole vast glorious history repudiates that it does not cannot must not fail not just one family in one nation privileged to soar cometlike into splendid zenith through and because of it not just one nation among all the nations selected as heir to that vast splendid heritage not just france but all governments and nations which ever rose and endured long enough to leave their mark as such had sprung from it and in and upon and by means of it became forever fixed in the amazement of mans present and the glory of his past civilization itself is its password and christianity its masterpiece chartres and the sistine chapel the pyramids and the rockwombed powdermagazines under the gates of hercules its altars and monuments michelangelo and phidias and newton and ericsson and archimedes and krupp its priests and popes and bishops the long deathless roster of its glorycaesar and the barcas and the two macedonians our own bonaparte and the great russian and the giants who strode nimbused in red hair like fire across the aurora borealis and all the lesser nameless who were not heroes but glorious in anonymity at least served the destiny of heroesthe generals and admirals the corporals and ratings of glory the batmen and orderlies of renown and the chairmen of boards and the presidents of federations the doctors and lawyers and educators and churchmen who after nineteen centuries have rescued the son of heaven from oblivion and translated him from mere meek heir to earth to chairman of its board of trade and those who did not even have names and designations to be anonymous fromthe hands and the backs which carved and sweated aloft the stone blocks and painted the ceilings and invented the printing presses and grooved the barrels down to the last indestructible voice which asked nothing but the right to speak of hope in roman lionpits and murmur the name of god from the indiananticked pyres in canadian forestsstretching immutable and enduring further back than mans simple remembering recorded it not rapacity it does not fail suppose mithridates and heliogabalus heir had used his heritage in order to escape his inheritees mithridates and heliogabalus were heliogabalus and mithridates still and that scurry from oran was still only a mouses since one of grimalkins parents was patience too and that whole st cyrtoulonafrica business merely flight as when the maiden flees the ravisher not toward sanctuary but privacy and just enough of it to make the victory memorable and its trophy a prize not rapacity which like poverty takes care of its own because it endures not even because it is rapacity but because man is man enduring and immortal enduring not because he is immortal but immortal because he endures and so with rapacity which immortal man never fails since it is in and from rapacity that he gets holds his immortalitythe vast the allbeing the compassionate which says to him only believe in me though ye doubt seventy times seven ye need only believe again but i know i was there i saw that day eleven years ago paused in that iron maw of war not fragile actually just fixed and immune in fragility like the figure in the stained window not through any alices mirror into unreality but just immune moral opposed and invincibly apostate if there still existed for you even in dream the splendid and glittering boulevards and faubourgs of your old cradle and your lost estate it was merely as dream forever inextricable from your past and forever interdict from your destiny inextricable the dream yourself and the dream annealed yourself interdict and free from that pain and that longing forever more inextricable from that youth who is this man now as is this little lost barren spot here inextricable forever from that destinynever that uncles and that godfathers private donjon but rather the figment of that consecrations necessary tarryment for this time this space somewhere in time and spacenot the youth the fragility not to test the youth but to test the fragility to measure and gauge and test never an intractable and perverse child who fled never an uncle and godfather coercing and compelling by attrition starvation but all of them the trinity still intact because it had never been otherwise testing as one the fragilitys capacity for the destiny and the consecration using the desert for yardstick as when in the old days the cadet would spend that last night of his maiden squiredom on his knees on the lonely chapels stone floor before the cushion bearing the virgin spurs of his tomorrows knighthood thats what they think not that man failed rapacity but that man failed man his own frail flesh and blood lets him down the blood still runs but cooling now into the second phase of his brief and furious span when the filling of his belly is better than glory or a throne then on into the third and last one where anticipation of the latrine is more moving than even the spread of a girls hair on the pillow thats what they believe is to be your destiny and end and ten years from now they will still know no better because your time your moment will not have come even in ten years it will take longer than that it will need a new time a new age a new century which doesnt even remember our old passions and failures a new century from that one when man discovered god for a second and then lost him postulated by a new digit in the record of his hope and need it will be more than twenty years even before the day the moment when you will appear again without past as if you had never been because by that time you will no longer exist for them except in mutual remembering a lay figure not only without life but integrated as myth only in mutual confederation the property of no one of them because you will be the property of all possessing unity and integration only when your custodians happen to meet from the ends of the earth which is the french empire and match fragments and make you whole for a moment you will lie weightless across the face of france from mozambique to miquelon and devils island to the treaty ports like a barely remembered odor a fading word a habit a legendan effigy cut by a jigsaw for souvenirs becoming whole only over a cafe or mess table in brazzaville or saigon or cayenne or tananarive dovetailed for a moment or an hour as when boys match and exchange the pictures of the actresses and generals and presidents from the packs of cigarettes not even the shadow of a breathing man but instead something synthetic and contrived like the composite one of the homely domestic objects contrived by the nurses hand between the nursery lamp and the wall for the child to take into slumber with it a balloon a duck punchinello la gloire the head of a cata shadow cast backward on that arid curtain behind oran beyond which you disappeared not by the sun but by that quartermaster captains commission the refusal of which first struck them with terror and rage until after twenty years not you nor even your two powerful kinsmen will be real but only that old fading parchment and it real only because your refusal of it incorporated it onto your legendthe shopworn and now harmless vellum vainly dangling its fading seals and ribbons beside the rent beyond which you vanished in the oldest of comedies the youth fleeing the forsaken aging yet indomitable betrothed pursuing abject constant undismayable undeflectable terrifying not in threat but in fidelity until at last those who feared you once will have watched you pass out of enmity to amazement to contempt to unreality and at last out of your race and kind altogether into the dusty lumber room of literature but not i he said looming visible only as a gaunt gigantic shape sick furious murmuring because i know better i knew that first moment eleven years ago when i looked and saw you standing there in that gate i knew i wont be here to see it of course my last medical survey you know that marvelous and amazing thing a human life spanned and thenwhats the boer wordoutspanned by one dry and dusty page of doctors jargon they are wrong of course i mean in the quai dorsay they didnt want to post me here at all since in doing it they would in their opinion simply double the work of whatever clerk would not only have to relieve me but discharge me from the army list also and then post my successor before my tour here was even completed and at first i grieved a little because once i thought that you might need me i mean need me other than for my simple seniority of hope in the condition of man thats right he said though the other had made no sound laugh at that dream that vain hope too because you will not need anybody wherever it is you are going now in order to return from it mind you i dont ask where i was about to say to find whom or what you will need to be your instrument but i refrained from that in time too so at least you dont need to laugh at that since i know that you are going wherever it is you are going in order to return from it when the time the moment comes in the shape of mans living hope may i embrace you must you the other said then should you then quickly of course but before he moved the taller one had stooped loomed downward from his vast and depthless height and took the smaller mans hand and kissed it and released it and erect again took the others face between his two hands almost like a parent a mother and held it for a moment then released it with christ in god he said go now so im to save france the other said france he said not even brusquely not even contemptuously you will save man farewell and he was right for almost two years that is he was almost wrong he did not remember the camel or litterwhatever it had beenat all only a momentprobably without doubt in the base hospital in orana face a voice probably a doctors marvelling not that he had failed to keep consciousness over that fierce and empty distance but that he had kept life at all then not much again only motion the mediterranean then he knew peacefully not with joy or exultation just peacefully almost unattentively unable yet nor did that matter either to raise his own head to look that this was france europe home then he could move his head and lift his hands too even if the vast peasant norman frame did seem still to lie outside its transparent envelope he said weakly but aloud with a sort of peaceful amazement weakly but at least aloud i had forgot what winter looks like lying halfpropped all day now on the glassed veranda above zermatt watching the matterhorn watching not the ordered and nameless progression of days fade but rather the lesser earth since always the great peak carried into the next one as in a gigantic hand one clutch of light but that was only the body and it was mending too soon it would be as strong not perhaps as it ever was nor even as it ever would but rather as it would ever need to be since they were the sameonly the body not the memory because it had forgotten nothing not even for one second the face which had been the junior that afternoon two years ago around the table on the quai dorsay terrace come all the way from paris just to see him not paris the other said verdun were building fortifications there now which they will never pass again they he said peacefully its too late now too late nonsense the fever and the fury are still there i grant you it seems to be born in them they probably cant help it but it will be decades perhaps a whole generation before it reaches convulsion again not for us he said too late for them oh the other said who did not see at all he knew that then the other said i brought this it came out just after you left for africa you probably havent seen it yet it was a page from the gazette yellowed faded almost three years old now the other holding it spread while he looked at the rigid epitaph to lieutenantcolonel souslieutenant and the name march relieved and retired lieutenantcolonel and the name march he never came back to paris the other said not even to france no he said peacefully so you were probably the last to see himyou did see him didnt you yes he said then maybe you even know where he went where he is yes he said peacefully you mean he told you himself i dont believe it yes he said it is nonsense isnt it not for me to claim that he told me but that he should have to have told anyone hes in a tibetan lamasery a what yes the east the morning which even the dead even the pagan dead lie facing so that the first faint fall of shadow of the risen son of it can break their sleep now he could feel the other watching him and there was something in the face but he would not bother about it yet and when the other spoke there was something in the voice too but he would not bother about that yet either they gave him a ribbon too the other said it was the red one he not only saved your post and garrison for you he probably saved africa he prevented a war of course they had to get rid of him afterwardask for his resignation all right he said peacefully then he said what the camel and the soldier he lost the murdererdont you remember surely if he told you where he was going he told you about that too now the other was looking at him watching him there was a woman in itnot his of course you mean he didnt tell you yes he said he told me then of course i wont have to yes he said again he told me she was a riff a native belonging to the village tribe settlement whatever it was which was the reason for the post and the garrison being there you must have seen that anyway while you were therea slave valuable nobodys wife or daughter or favorite it appeared or anyway was reported just simply merchantable she died too like the other one back in marseilles eighteen years ago the mans power over women was indeed a fatal one whereupon the next morning the camelit was histhe commandantsprivate mount possibly a pet if you canwant topet a cameland its groom driver mahout whatever they are had vanished and two dawns later the groom returned on foot and thoroughly terrified with the ultimatum from the chief headman to the commandant giving the commandant until the next dawn to send him the man there were three involved but the chief would be content with the principal one responsible for the womans death and her spoliation as merchandise else the chief and his men would invest the post and obliterate it and its garrison which they could probably have done if not immediately certainly in the almost twelve months before the next inspectorgeneral would turn up to look at it so the commandant asked for a volunteer to slip away that night before the ultimatum went into effect at dawn and the place was surrounded and go to the next post and bring back a relieving forcei beg your pardon but he had not spoken rigid himself the fragile one now who was yet only barely erect from death i thought you said chose one the other said he didnt need to choose because this was the mans one chance he could have escaped at any timehoarded food and water and stolen away on almost any night during the whole eighteen years possibly reached the coast and perhaps even france but where would he go then who could have escaped only from africa never from himself from the old sentence from which all that saved him was his uniform and that only while he wore it in the light of day but now he could go he was not even escaping he was not even entering mere amnesty but absolution from now on the whole edifice of france would be his sponsor and his purifaction even though he got back with the relief too late because he not only had the commandants word but a signed paper also to avouch his deed and command all men by these presents to make good its reward so the commandant didnt need to choose him only accept him and at sunset the garrison paraded and the man stepped out of ranks and now the commandant should have taken the decoration from his own breast and pinned it on that of the sacrifice except that the commandant had not got the ribbon yet oh yes ive thought of the locket too to remove the chain from his own neck and cast it about the condemneds but that is reserved for some finer more durable instant in that rockets course than the abolishment of a blackguard or the preservation of a flyspeck so without doubt that would be the moment when he gave him the signed paper setting him free of his past the man not knowing that that first step out of ranks had already set him free of whatever else breathing could do to him more and the man saluted and about faced and marched out the gate into darkness into death and i thought for a moment you had spoken again were about to ask how if the ultimatum would not take effect until dawn tomorrow did the riff chief discover that a scout would attempt to get out that night and so have an ambush ready at the mouth of the wadi through which the scout would pass yes how the man himself probably asking that in the one last choked cry or scream remaining to him of indictment and repudiation because he didnt know about the ribbon then either into darkness night the wadi into hell even hugo didnt think of that because from the looks of what remained of him it took him most of that night to die the sentry above the gate challenged at dawn the next morning then the camel not the plump missing one of course but an old mangy one because the dead woman was valuable and besides one camel looks just like another in a transport office return cantered in with the body tied on it stripped of clothing and most of the flesh too so the siege the investment was lifted the enemy retired and that sunset the commandant buried its lone casualty except for the better camel and after all the woman had been valuable with a bugle and a firingsquad and you relieved him and he departed a lieutenantcolonel with the rosette in a himalayan lamasery leaving nothing behind him but that little corner of france which he saved to be mausoleum and cenotaph of the man whom he tricked into saving it a man the other said watching him a human being a murderer he said a murderer twice spawned into murder by a french cesspool but repudiated by all the worlds cesspools nationless twice without fatherland twice since he had forfeited life worldless twice since he was already forfeit to death belonging to no man since he was not even his own but a man the other said speaking thinking in french only because nationless he must of necessity use that tongue which of all is international wearing that french uniform because inside a french uniform was the only place on earth where a murderer could be safe from his murder but bearing it bearing at least without complaint his rewardless share of the vast glorious burden of empire where few other men dared or could even behaving himself in his fashion nothing in his record but a little drunkenness a little thievery until now he cried only thievery buggery sodomyuntil now which were his sole defense against the corporals or sergeants warrant which would have been his death sentence asking nothing of none until his blind and valueless fate tangled with that of him who had already exhausted the comité de ferrovie and the french army and was now reduced to rooting about among the hogwallows and cesspools of the human race itself who already forfeit of life owed nothing to france save the uniform he wore and the rifle he oiled and tended who in return for filling on demand a mans width of space in a platoon front asked and expected nothing save the right to hope to die in a barracksbed still unregenerate yet who had been tricked into giving his life without even the chance to prepare himself for that country which would guillotine him within fifteen minutes of putting its civilian hand on him he was a man the other said even dead angelsjustice itselfstill fought for him you were away at the time so you have not heard this either it was at the signing of the citation for that rosette while bearing the parchment across to the desk for the grand commanders signature the clerk in private life an amateur alpinist stumbled and overturned a litre bottle of ink onto it blotting out not merely the recipients name but the entire record of the achievement so they produced a new parchment it reached the desk but even as the grand commander reached his hand for the pen a draft of air came from nowhere if you know general martel you know that any room he stops in long enough to remove his hat must be hermetically sealedcame from nowhere and wafted the parchment twenty metres across the room and into the fire where it vanished pouf like celluloid but to what avail between them armed only with the flaming swords of clumsy mythology and the comité de ferrovie snoring with revolving pistols and the rattling belch of maxim guns so now he has gone to a tibetan lamasery to repent to wait he cried to prepare yes the other said thats what they call it too der tag so maybe id better hurry on back to verdun and get on with our preparing and waiting too since we are warned now that we shall need them both oh i know i was not there that day to see his face in that gate as you saw it but at least i inherited it we all did not just that class but all the others which came after yours and his and at least we know now what we inherited only fear not anguish a prophet discharged us of that by giving us a warning of it so only the respect for the other need remain a murderer he said but a man the other said and was gone leaving him not quite erect from death perhaps but at least with his back once more toward it erect enough to be aware of the steadily diminishing numbers of his seniority that diminishing reservoir on which the bark of his career floated to be aground soon at this rate in fact that day would come when he would know that it was aground revokable never more by any tide or wave or flood who had believed all his life if not in his durability at least in the vast frame which the indurability clothed whereupon in the next moment he would know that aground or not ithewould never be abandoned that that edifice which had accepted the gaunt frames dedication would see always that there was at least one number between him and zero even if it were only his own so that the day came der tag the enemy poured not through verdun because his caller of that morning twentyfive years back had been right and they would not pass there but through flanders so fast and so far that a desperate ragtag met them in paris taxicabs and held them for the necessary desperate moment and still behind his glassed veranda he heard how that number one to his two in the old st cyr class was now number one among all the desperate and allied peoples in western europe and he said even from here i will have seen the beginning of it then two months later he stood across a desk from the face which he had not seen in thirty years which he had seen the first time in the st cyr gate forty years ago and had been marked forever with it looking not much older still calm composed the body the shoulders beneath it still frail and delicate yet doomedno not doomed potentto bear the fearful burden of mans anguish and terror and at last his hope looking at him for a moment then saying the appointment of quartermaster general is within my gift will you accept the office and he said to himself with a sort of peaceful vindication not even of great and desperate hope now but of simple reason logic i will even see the end accomplishment of it too i will even be present there but that was a quarter of a century away yet as the caller of ten minutes ago had prophesied now he lay beneath his own peaceful tears while the nurse bent over him with a folded cloth saying weak but indomitable still invincibly obdurate incurable and doomed with hope using the two hes indiscriminately as though the nurse too knew yes he was a man but he was young then not much more than a child these tears are not anguish only grief the room was now lighted candelabrum sconce and girandole the windows were closed now curtain and casement the room seemed now to hang insulate as a diving bell above the citys murmur where the people had already begun to gather again in the place below the jug and bowl were gone and the old general sat once more flanked by his two confreres behind the bare table though among them now was a fourth figure as incongruous and paradoxical as a magpie in a bowl of goldfisha bearded civilian sitting between the old generalissimo and the american in that blackandwhite costume which to the anglosaxon is the formal regalia for eating or seduction or other diversions of the dark and to the continental european and south american the rigid uniform for partitioning other governments or overthrowing his own the young aide stood facing them he said rapid and glib in french the prisoners are here the motorcar from villeneuve blanche will arrive at twentytwo hours the woman about the spoon spoon the old general said did we take her spoon return it no sir the aide said not this time the three strange women the foreigners his honor the mayors business for a moment the old general sat perfectly still but there was nothing in his voice they stole the spoon nor was there anything in the aides either rigid inflectionless she threw the spoon at them it disappeared she has witnesses who saw one of them pick up the spoon and hide it the old general said the aide stood rigid looking at nothing she threw a basket too it was full of food the same one caught it in the air without spilling it i see the old general said does she come here to protest a miracle or merely affirm one yes sir the aide said do you want the witnesses too let the strangers wait the old general said just the plaintiff yes sir the aide said he went out again by the smaller door at the end of the room though when in the next second almost he reappeared he had not had time to get out of anyones way he returned not swept but tumbled not in but rather on because he rose loomed not half a head nor even a whole head but half a human being above a tight clump of shawled or kerchiefed women led by one of a short broad strong fiftyish who stopped just at the edge of the white rug as if it were water and gave the room one rapid comprehensive look then another rapid one at the three old men behind the table then moved again unerringly toward the old generalissimo leading her group save the aide who had at last extricated himself beside the door firmly out onto the blanched surface of the rug saying in a strong immediate voice thats right dont hope to conceal yourselfnot behind a mayor anyway there are too many of you for that once i would have said that the curse of this country is its forest of mayoral sashes and swords i know better now and after four years of this harassment even the children can tell a general on sightprovided you can ever see one when you need him a third miracle then the old general said since your first postulate is proved by the confounding of your second miracle the woman said bah the miracle is that we have anything left after four years of being overrun by foreigners and now even americans has france come to that sorry pass where you must not only rob us of our kitchen utensils but even import americans in order to fight your battles war war war dont you ever get tired of it indubitably madame the old general said your spoon it vanished dont ask me where ask them or better have some of your corporals and sergeants search them its true there are two of them beneath whose garments even a sergeant would not want to fumble but none of them would object no the old general said more should not be demanded of corporals and sergeants beyond the simple hazard of military life he spoke the aides name sir the aide said go to the scene find the gentlewomans spoon and return it to her i sir the aide cried take a full company on your way out let the prisoners come in no first the three officers they are here yes sir the aide said good the old general said he turned toward his two confreres started to speak paused then spoke to the civilian when he did so the civilian began to rise from his seat with a sort of startled and diffuse alacrity that should take care of the spoon the old general said i believe the rest of your problem was the complaint of the three strange women that they have no place to sleep tonight that and the mayor said yes the old general said i will see them presently meanwhile will you take care of finding quarters for them or shall but certainly general the mayor said thank you then goodnight he turned to the woman and to you also and in peace your spoon will be restored now it was the mayor who was swept carriedthe magpie this time in a flock of pigeons or perhaps hens or maybe geeseback toward the door which the aide held open and through it the aide still looking back at the old general with his expression of shocked disbelief a spoon the aide said a company ive never commanded one man let alone a company of them and even if i could knew how how can i find that spoon of course you will find it the old general said that will be the fourth miracle now the three officers but first take the three strange ladies to your office and ask them to wait there for me yes sir the aide said he went out and closed the door it opened again three men entered a british colonel a french major an american captain the two juniors flanking the colonel rigidly down the rug and to rigid attention facing the table while the colonel saluted gentlemen the old general said this is not a parade it is not even an inquiry merely an identificationchairs please he said without turning his head to the galaxy of staff behind him then the prisoners three of the aides brought chairs around now that end of the room resembled one end of an amphitheatre or a section of an american bleachers the three generals and the three newcomers sitting in the beginning of a semicircle against the bank of aides and staff as one of the aides who had fetched the chairs went on to the smaller door and opened it and stood aside and now they could smell the men before they even enteredthat thin strong ineradicable stink of front lines of foul mud and burnt cordite and tobacco and ammonia and human filth then the thirteen men entered led by the sergeant with his slung rifle and closed by another armed private bareheaded unshaven alien stained still with battle bringing with them still another compounding of the smellwariness alertness just a little of fear too but mostly just watchfulness deploying a little clumsily as the sergeant spoke two rapid commands in french and halted them into line the old general turned to the british colonel colonel he said yes sir the colonel said immediately the corporal the old general turned to the american captain he said yes sir the american said thats him colonel beales righti mean he cant be right but the old general was already speaking to the sergeant let the corporal remain he said take the others back to the anteroom and wait there the sergeant wheeled and barked but the corporal had already paced once out of ranks to stand not quite at attention but almost while the other twelve wheeled into file the armed private now leading and the sergeant last up the room to the door not through it yet but to it because the head of the file faltered and fell back on itself for a moment and then gave way as the old generals personal aide entered and passed them and then himself gave way aside until the file had passed him the sergeant following last and drawing the door after him leaving the aide once more solus before it boneless tall baffled still and incredulous still but not outraged now merely disorganised the british colonel said sir but the old general was looking at the aide at the door he said in french my child the three women the aide said in my office now while we have our hands on them why dont oh yes the old general said your authority for detached duty tell the chiefofstaff to let it be a reconnaissance ofsayfour hours that should be enough he turned to the british colonel certainly colonel he said the colonel rose quickly staring at the corporalthe high calm composed not wary but merely watchful mountain face looking courteous and merely watchful back at him boggan the colonel said dont you remember me lieutenant beale but still the face only looked at him courteous interrogatory not baffled just blank just waiting we thought you were dead the colonel said isaw you i did more than that the american captain said i buried him the old general raised one hand slightly at the captain he said to the briton yes colonel it was at mons four years ago i was a subaltern this man was in my platoon that afternoon when they caught us he went down before a lance i saw the point come through his back before the shaft broke the next two horses galloped over him on him i saw that too afterward i mean just for a second or two how his face looked after the last horse before ii mean what had used to be his face he said still staring at the corporal his voice if anything even more urgent because of what its owner had now to cope with boggan but still the corporal only looked at him courteous attentive quite blank then he turned and said to the old general in french im sorry i understand only french i know that the old general said also in french he said in english to the briton then this is not the man it cant be sir the colonel said i saw the head of that lance i saw his face after the horsesbesides ii saw he stopped and sat there martial and glittering in his red tabs and badges of rank and the chainwisps symbolising the mail in which the regiment had fought at crecy and agincourt seven and eight hundred years ago with his face above them like death itself tell me the old general said gently you saw what you saw him again later afterward perhaps i know alreadythe ghosts of your ancient english bowmen there at monsin leather jerkins and hose and crossbows and he among them in khaki and a steel helmet and an enfield rifle was that what you saw yes sir the colonel said then he sat erect he said quite loudly yes sir but if this could be the same man the old general said im sorry sir the colonel said you wont say either way that he is or is not that man im sorry sir the colonel said ive got to believe in something even if only death im sorry sir the colonel said the old general turned to the american captain he said that puts us all in a fix doesnt it the american captain said all three of us i dont know whos worst off because i didnt just see him dead i buried him in the middle of the atlantic ocean his name iswasno it cant be because im looking at himwasnt brzonyi at least it wasnt last year it wasdamn itim sorry siris brzewski hes from one of the coal towns back of pittsburgh i was the one that buried him i mean i commanded the burial party read the service you know we were national guard you probably dont know what that means i know the old general said sir the captain said i know what you mean the old general said continue yes sircivilians organised our own company ourselves to go out and die for dear old rutgersthat sort of thing elected our officers notified the government who was to get what commission and then got hold of the articles of war and tried to memorise as much of it as we could before the commission came back so when the flu hit us we were in the transport coming over last october and when the first one diedit was brzewskiwe found out that none of us had got far enough in the manual to find out how to bury a dead soldier except mei was a shasecond lieutenant thenand i just happened to have found out by accident the last night before we left because a girl had stood me up and i thought i knew why i mean who it was who the guy was and you know how it is you think of all the things to do to get even make her sorry you lying dead right there where shes got to step over you to pass and its too late now and boy wont that fix her yes the old general said i know sir the captain said i know that too the old general said of course you doremember anyway the captain said nobodys really that old i dont care how going that far before he managed to stop himself im sorry sir he said dont be the old general said continue so you buried him so that night just by chance or curiosity or maybe it was personal interest i was reading up on what somebody would have to do to get rid of me afterward and make uncle sams books balance and so when br he paused and glanced rapidly at the corporal but only for a second even less than that barely a falter even the first one died i was elected to certify personally with the mo that the body was a dead body and sign the certificate and drill the firing squad and then give the command to dump him overboard though by the time we got to brest two weeks later all the rest of them had had plenty of practice at it so you see where that leaves us i mean him hes the one in the fix if i buried him in the middle of the atlantic ocean in october last year then colonel beale couldnt have seen him killed at mons in and if colonel beale saw him killed in he cant be standing here now waiting for you to shoot him tomor he stopped completely he said quickly im sorry sir i didnt yes the old general said in his courteous and bland and inflectionless voice then colonel beale was wrong no sir the captain said then you wish to retract your statement that this is the man whose death you personally certified and whose body you saw sink into the atlantic ocean no sir the captain said so you believe colonel beale if he says so sir thats not quite an answer do you believe him he watched the captain the captain looked as steadily back at him then the captain said and that i certified him dead and buried him he said to the corporal even in a sort of french so you came back im glad to see you and i hope you had a nice trip and looked back at the old general again as steadily as he as courteously and as firm a good moment this time until the old general said in french you speak my tongue also thank you sir the captain answered him no other frenchman ever called it that do not demean yourself you speak it well what is your name middleton sir you have twentyfive years perhaps twentyfour sir twentyfour some day you are going to be a very dangerous man if you are not already so and said to the corporal thank you my child you may return to your squad and spoke a name over his shoulder without turning his head though the aide had already come around the table as the corporal aboutfaced the aide flanking him back to the door and through it and out the american captain turning his head back in time to meet for another second yet the quiet and inscrutable eyes the courteous bland almost gentle voice because his name is brzonyi here too he sat back in the chair again he looked like a masquerading child beneath the illusion of crushing and glittering weight of his blueandscarlet and gold and brass and leather until even the five who were still sitting had the appearance of standing too surrounding and enclosing him he said in english i must leave you presently for a short time but major blum speaks english it is not as good as yours of course nor as good as captain middletons french but it should do one of our alliescolonel bealesaw him slain and the othercaptain middletonburied him so all that remains for us is to witness to his resurrection and none more competent for that than major blum who was graduated from the academy into the regiment in and so was in it before and has been in it ever since the day when this ubiquitous corporal reached it so the only question is he paused a second it was as though he had even glanced about at them without even moving the delicate and fragile body the delicate face beautiful serene and terrifying who knew him first colonel beale at mons in august or major blum at chalons in that same monthbefore of course captain middleton buried him at sea in but that is merely academic identityif there is suchhas been established indeed it was never disputed there remains only recapitulation and major blum will do that he stood up except for the two generals the others rose quickly too and although he said rapidly no no sit down sit down the three newcomers continued to stand he turned to the french major colonel beale has his ghostly bowmen in belgium at least we can match that with our archangels on the aisne surely you can match that for usthe tremendous aerial shapes patrolling our front and each time they are thickest heaviest densest most archangelic our corporal is there too perhaps pacing with themthe usual night firing going on just enough to make a sane man keep his head below the trench and be glad he has a trench to keep his head below yet this corporal is outside the trench between the parapet and the wire pacing along as peacefully as a monk in his cloister while the great bright formless shapes pace the dark air beside and above him or perhaps not even pacing but simply leaning on the wire contemplating that desolation like a farmer his turnipfield come major my imagination wears only a majority sir the major said it cannot compete with yours nonsense the old general said the crimeif anyis already established if any established we did not even need to establish it he did not even merely accept it in advance he abrogated it all that remains now is to find extenuationpity if we can persuade him to accept pity come tell them there was the girl the major said yes the old general said the wedding and the wine no sir the major said not quite now you see i canhow do you saydémentircontrediresay against contradict the american captain said thank you the major said contradict you here my majority can cope with simple regimental gossip tell them the old general said so the major did though that was after the old general had left the rooma little girl a child going blind in one of the aisne towns for lack of an operation which a certain famous paris surgeon could perform the corporal levying upon the troops of two nearby divisions a franc here and two francs there until the surgeons fee was raised and the child sent to him and an old man he had a wife daughter and grandson and a little farm in but waited too long to evacuate it unable until too late to tear himself away from what he possessed his daughter and grandson vanished in the confusion which ended at the first marne battle his old wife died of exposure on the roadside the old man returning alone to the village when it was freed again and he could where an idiot name forgotten grief and all forgotten only moaning a little drooling grubbing for food in the refuse of army kitchens sleeping in ditches and hedgerows on the spot of earth which he had owned once until the corporal used one of his leaves to hunt out a remote kinsman of the old mans in a distant midi village and levied again on the regiment for enough to send him there and now the major said he turned to the american captain how to say touché youre out the captain said and i wish he was still present so i could hear you say it to him bah the major said he is a frenchman it is only a boche marshal that no man can speak to and now youre out from him to me because now the wedding and the wine and told thata village behind montfaucon and only this past winter because they were american troops they had just been paid a dice game was going on the floor littered with franc notes and half the american company crowded around them when the french corporal entered and without a word began to gather up the scattered money for a time a true international incident was in the making until the corporal finally managed to communicate explain what it was about a wedding one of the young american soldiers and a girl an orphan refugee from somewhere beyond rheims who was now a sort of slavey in the local estaminet she and the young american hadhad the rest of his company would say he had knocked her up the american captain said but we know what you mean go on so the major did the matter ending with the entire company not only attending the wedding but adopting it taking charge of it buying up all the wine in the village for the supper and inviting the whole countryside adopting the marriage too endowing the bride with a wedding gift sufficient to set up as a lady in her own right to wait in her own single rented room untilifher husband returned from his next tour in the lines but that would be after the old general had left the room now the three newcomers made way for him as he came around the table and paused and said tell them tell them how he got the medal too what we seek now is not even extenuation not even pity but mercyif there is suchif he will accept that either and turned and went on toward the small door at which moment it opened and the aide who had taken the prisoner out stood at attention beside it for the old general to pass then followed and closed the door behind them yes the old general said they are in de montignys office the aide said the youngest one the girl is a frenchwoman one of the older ones is the wife of a frenchman a farmer i know the old general said where is the farm was sir the aide said it was near a village called viennelapucelle north of st mihiel that country was all evacuated in on monday morning viennelapucelle was under the enemys front line then she and her husband dont know whether they have a farm or not the old general said no sir the aide said ah the old general said then he said again yes the motorcar from villeneuve blanche has just entered the courtyard good the old general said my compliments to our guest and conduct him to my study serve his dinner there and request his permission to receive us in one hour the aides office had been contrived three years ago by carpenters out ofor intoa corner of what had been a ballroom and then a courtroom the aide saw it each twentyfour hours and obviously even entered it at least once during those periods because on a rack in the corner hung his hat and topcoat and a very fine beautifullyfurled london umbrella in juxtaposition to that hat and that coat as bizarre and paradox as a domino or a fan until you realised that it could quite well have owed its presence there to the same thing which the only other two objects of any note in the room did two bronzes which sat at either end of the otherwise completely bare deska delicate and furious horse poised weightless and epicene on one leg and a savage and slumbrous head not cast molded but cut by hand out of the amalgam by gaudierbrzeska otherwise the cubicle was empty save for a wooden bench against the wall facing the desk when the old general entered the three women were sitting on it the two older ones on the outside and the younger one between them as he crossed to the desk without yet looking at them the younger one gave a quick almost convulsive start as though to get up until one of the others stopped her with one hand then they sat again immobile watching him while he went around the desk and sat down behind the two bronzes and looked at themthe harsh high mountain face which might have been a twin of the corporals except for the difference in age the serene and peaceful one which showed no age at all or perhaps all ages and between them the strained and anguished one of the girl then as though on a signal as if she had waited for him to complete the social amenity of sitting too the peaceful oneshe held on her lap a wicker basket neatly covered by an immaculate tuckedin clothspoke im glad to see you anyway she said you look so exactly like what you are marya the other older one said dont be ashamed the first one said you cant help it you should be pleased because so many dont she was already rising the other said again marya and even raised her hand again but the first one came on to the desk carrying the basket beginning to raise her other hand as though to approach the basket with it as she reached the desk then extending the hand until it lay on the desk it now held a longhandled iron spoon that nice young man she said at least you should be ashamed of that sending him out to tramp about the city at night with all those soldiers the fresh air will be good for him the old general said he doesnt get much of it in here you could have told him i never said you had it i only said i believed you could produce it when it was needed here it is she released the spoon and laid that hand lightly on the one which held the tuckedin and undisturbed basket then immediately and peacefully but without haste she smiled at him serene and uncritical you really cant help it can you you really cant marya the woman on the bench said again immediately but without haste the smile went away it was not replaced by anything it just went away leaving the face unchanged uncritical serene yes sister she said she turned and went back to the bench where the other woman had risen now again the girl had made that convulsive start to rise too this time the tall womans hard thin peasant hand was gripping her shoulder holding her down this is the old general said his wife the tall woman said harshly who did you expect it to be ah yes the old general said looking at the girl he said in that gentle inflectionless voice marseilles toulon perhaps then named the street the district pronouncing the street name which was its byword the woman started to answer but the old general raised his hand at her let her answer he said then to the girl my child a little louder yes sir the girl said oh yes the woman said a whore how else do you think she got heregot the papers to come this far to this place except to serve france also but his wife too the old general said his wife now the woman corrected accept that whether you believe it or not i do both the old general said accept that from me too then she moved released the girls shoulder and came toward the desk almost to it in fact then stopping as though at the exact spot from which her voice would be only a murmur to the two still on the bench when she spoke do you want to send them out first why the old general said so you are magda yes she said not marthe magda i wasnt marthe until after i had a brother and had to cross half of europe to face thirty years later the french general who would hold the refusal of his life not gift refusal and even thats wrong the taking back of it she stood tall still looking down at him so you even knew us i was about to say not remembered us because you never saw us but maybe thats wrong too and you did see us then if you did you would remember us even if i wasnt but nine then and marya eleven because as soon as i saw your face tonight i knew that it would never need to flee hide from fear or dread or grieve at having to remember anything it ever looked at marya might fail to see that maybemarya now too since she also had to come all the way to france to watch the refusal of her halfbrothers life even if she doesnt need to fear or dread or grieve at having to remember eitherbut not i maybe marya is why you remember us if you saw us then because she was eleven then and in our country girls at eleven are not girls anymore but women but i wont say that not because of the insult that would be even to our mother let alone to youour mother who had something in heri dont mean her facewhich did not belong in that villagethat village in all our mountains all that countrywhile what you must have hadhad havein you is something which all the earth had better beware and dread and be afraid of the insult would have been to evil itself i dont mean just that evil i mean evil as if there was a purity in it a severity a jealousy like in goda strictness of untruth incapable of compromise or secondbest or substitute a purpose an aim in it as though not just our mother but you neither could help yourselves and not just you but ourmine and maryasfather too not two of you but three of you doing not what you would but what you must that people men and women dont choose evil and accept it and enter it but evil chooses the men and women by test and trial proves and tests them and then accepts them forever until the time comes when they are consumed and empty and at last fail evil because they no longer have anything that evil can want or use then it destroys them so it wasnt just you a stranger happened by accident into a country so far away and hard to get to that whole generations of us are born and live and die in it without even knowing or wondering or caring what might be on the other side of our mountains or even if the earth extends there not just a man come there by chance having already whatever he would need to charm trance bewitch a weak and vulnerable woman then finding a woman who was not only weak and vulnerable but beautiful toooh yes beautiful if that was what you had had to plead her beauty and your love my face would have been the first to forgive you since the jealousy would be not yours but hersjust to destroy her home her husbands faith her childrens peace and at last her lifeto drive her husband to repudiate her just to leave her children fatherless then her to die in childbirth in a cowbyre behind a roadside inn just to leave them orphans then at last have the rightprivilegeduty whatever you want to call itto condemn that last and only male child to death just that the name which she betrayed shall be no more because thats not enough its nowhere near enough it must be something much bigger than that much more splendid much more terrible not our father gone all that long distance from our valley to seek a beautiful face to be the mother of his names succession then finding instead the fatal and calamitous one which would end it not you blundered there by chance but sent there to meet that beautiful and fatal face not her so weak in pride and virtue but rather doomed by that face from themnot the three of you compelled there just to efface a name from mans history because who on earth outside our valley ever heard that name or cares but instead to create a son for one of you to condemn to death as though to save the earth save the world save mans history save mankind she brought both hands up in front of her and let them rest there the fist of one lying in the other palm of course you knew us my folly was in even thinking i would need to bring you proof so now i dont know just what to do with it when to use it like a knife capable of only one stroke or a pistol with just one bullet which i cant afford to risk too soon and dare not wait too late maybe you even know the rest of it already too i remember how wrong i was that you would not know who we are maybe your face is telling me now that you already know the rest of it end of it even if you werent there had served your destinyor anyway hersand gone away tell me then the old general said if i must is that it the ribbons and stars and braid that turned forty years of spears and bullets yet not one of them to stop a womans tongueor try to tell you that is because i dont know i was only nine then i only saw and remembered marya too even if she was eleven because even then she already didnt need to dread or grieve for anything just because her face had looked at it not that we needed to look at this because it had been there all our lives most of the valleys too it was already ours ourthe valleyspride with a little awe in it as another one might have a peak or glacier or waterfallthat speck that blank white wall or dome or towerwhatever it waswhich was first in all our valley that the sun touched and the last that lost it still holding light long after the gulch we crouched in had lost what little it had ever snared yet it wasnt high either high wasnt the right word either you couldntwe didntmeasure where it was that way it was just higher than any of our men even herdsmen and hunters ever went not higher than they could but than they did dared no shrine or holy place because we knew them too and even the kind of men that lived in haunted served them mountain men too before they were priests because we knew their fathers and our fathers had known their grandfathers so they would be priests only afterward with what was left instead it was an eyrie like where eagles nested where peoplemencame as if through the air itself you leaving no more trace of coming or arriving yes you or departing oh yes you than eagles would oh yes you too if marya and i ever saw you then we did not remember it nor when you saw us if you ever did except for our mothers telling i almost said if our father himself ever saw you in the flesh because of course he did you would have seen to that yourself a gentleman honorable in gentleman fashion and brave too since it would have taken courage our father having already lost too much for that little else to be dear spending come there not to tremble on their knees on stone floors but to think to think not that dreamy hoping and wishing and believing but mainly just waiting that we would think is thinking but some fierce and rigid concentration that at any timetomorrow today next moment this onewill change the shape of the earth not high just high enough to stand between us and the sky like a waystation to heaven so no wonder when we died the rest of us believed the soul hadnt stopped there maybe but at least had paused to surrender half the coupon no wonder when our mother was gone for that week in the spring marya and i knew where she had gone to not dead we had buried nothing so she wouldnt have to pass it but certainly there since where else could she bethat face which had never belonged to had no place in our valley from the beginning not to mention what we even her children had felt sensed behind that face which had no place in our mountains among our kind of people anywhere where else but there not to think to be accepted into that awesome and tremendous condition because even her face and what was behind it could not match that but at least to breathe bathe in the lambence of that furious meditation the wonder was that she came back not the valleys wonder but mine and maryas too because we were children we didnt know we only watched and saw and knitted knotted tried to what simple threads we had of implication to us it was simply that the face that somethingwhatever it wasin her that had never been ours and our fathers anyway even if it had been wife to one and mother to the others had at last simply done what from the beginning it had been doomed to do yet she came back she didnt change forever that house home life and all she had already done that by leaving as she did and coming back to it only compounded what she had already left there she had been alien and a passing guest always anyhow she couldnt possibly come back any more so so marya and i even children knew even more than the valley did that it couldnt last the child another child a new brother or sister or whichever it would be next winter meant nothing to us even if we were children we knew about babies who so young in our country as not to know since in our country our hard and unpiteous mountains people used had to use needed required had nothing else to use children as people in lands savage with dangerous animals used guns and bullets to defend preserve themselves endure we didnt see as our father did that child not the brand of sin but incontrovertible proof of something which otherwise he might have schooled himself to bear he didnt turn her out of his house dont think that it was usshe he was just going to leave himself put home past all the dreams and hopes that people call home the rage the impotence the outraged masculinityoh yes heartbreak too why notall behind him it was she who cut that cord and left swollen belly and all because it could not be long now it was already winter and maybe we couldnt compute gestation but we had seen enough swelled female bellies to guess approximations so we left it was at night after dark he had left right after supper we didnt know where and now i would say maybe just hunting dark and solitude and space and silence for what wasnt there or anywhere else for him either and i know now why the direction weshetook was west too and where the money came from that we had for a while too until we couldnt pay for riding anymore and had to walk because shewetook nothing from that house except the clothes we wore and our shawls and a little food which marya carried in that same basket yonder and i could say here also but you were safe it was not enough except that i dont not to you who have in you what all heaven too might do well to blench at so we walked then and still westward who might not have learned to think in that place during that week but at least she had memorised something of geography then there was no more food except what we could beg but it would not be long now even if we had had money left to ride with too then that night it was already winter when we left home and now it was christmas the eve before and now i dont remember if we were driven from the inn itself or just turned away or maybe perhaps it was our mother still who would cut even that cord too with man i remember only the straw the dark stable and the cold nor whether it was marya or i who ran back through the snow to beat on the closed kitchen door until someone cameonly the light at last the lantern the strange and alien faces crowding downward above us then the blood and lymph and wet i a child of nine and an elevenyearold idiot sister trying to hide into what privacy we could that outraged betrayed abandon and forsaken nakedness while her closed hand fumbled at mine and she tried to speak the hand still gripping holding onto it even after i had given my word my promise my oath she stood looking down at him the closed fist of the one hand lying in the palm of the other not for you for him no thats wrong it was already for you for this moment that night thirtyfive years ago when she first gripped it into my hand and tried to speak i must have known even at nine that i would cross half of europe to bring it to you some day just as i must have known even at nine how vain the bringing it would be a fate a doom communicated imposed on me by the mere touch of it against my flesh before i even opened it to look inside and divine surmise who the face belonged to even before iwefound the purse the money which was to bring us here oh you were generous nobody denied that because how could you have known that the money which was to have bought you immunity from the consequence of your youthful follya dowry if the child should be a girl a tilted scrap of pasture and a flock to graze it if a boy and a wife for him in time and so even the same grandchildren to immobilise your follys partner forever beyond the geographic range of your vulnerabilitywould instead accomplish the exact opposite by paying our passage to beirut andwith what was left overbecoming what was its original intent a dowry because we could have stayed there in our mountains our country among people whose kind we knew and whose kind knew us we could have stayed right there at the inn the village where we were because people are really kind they really are capable of pity and compassion for the weak and orphaned and helpless because it is pity and compassion and they are weak and helpless and orphaned and people though of course you cannot dare not believe that who dare believe only that people are to be bought and used empty and then thrown away in fact we did stay there for almost ten years we worked of course at the innin the kitchen with the milk cows inforthe village too being witless marya had a way with simple unmartial creatures like cows and geese which were content to be simple cows and geese instead of lions and stags but then so would we have worked back home which was where for all their kindness perhaps because of their kindness they tried at first to persuade us to return but not i the doom might have been his but the curse to hurry it consummate it at least was mine i was the one now wearing the secret talisman token not to remember cherish no tender memento of devoted troth nor plighted desertion either but lying instead against my flesh beneath my dress like a brand a fever a coal a goad driving me i was his mother now the doom that moved him would have to move me first already at nine and ten and eleven i was the mother of twothe infant brother and the idiot sister two years my senior toountil at beirut i found a father for them both toward the day the hour the moment the instant when with his same blood he would discharge the one and expiate the other yes the doom was his but at least i was its handmaiden to bring you this i must bring you the reason for its need too to bring you this i must bring with me into your orbit the very object which would constitute and make imperative that need worse by bringing it into your orbit i myself created the need which the token the last desperate cast remaining to me would be incapable of discharging a curse and doom which in time was to corrupt the very kindly circumambience which harbored us because already you are trying to ask how in the world we managed to have to pass through asia minor in order to reach western europe and i will tell you it was not us it was the village no it was all of us together a confederation france a word a name a designation significant yet foundationless like the ones for grace or tuesday or quarantine esoteric and infrequent not just to us but to the ignorant and kindly people among whom we had found orphaned and homeless haven who had barely heard of france either and did not care until our advent among them whereupon it was as though they had established a living rapport with it through by means of us who did not even know where it was except west and that wei dragging the other two with memust go there until presently we were known to the whole villagevalley districtas the little franchini the three who were going tobound fordedicated forfrance as others might be for some distant and irrevocable state or condition like a nunnery or the top of mount everestnot heaven everybody believes he will be on his way there just as soon as he finds time to really concentrate on itbut some peculiar and individual esoteric place to which no one really wants to go save in idle speculation yet which reflects a certain communal glory on the place which was host to the departure and witnessed the preparations because we had never heard of beirut at all it required older and more worldly than us to have known that beirut even was let alone that there was a french colony there a garrison officialin effect france the nearest france to where we were that is the real france might have been nearer but that was overland and therefore expensive and we were poor what we had to travel on was time and leisure there was the purse of course which probably wouldnt have taken all three of us to france the quickest route anyway even if there had not been a better reason than that to save the purse so we spent what we had the most of travelling as only the very poor or the very rich can only they travel rapidly who are too rich to have time and too poor to have leisure by sea spending only enough of the purse to set the three of us in the nearest available official authentic fringe of france and still leave as much as possible over because i was nineteen now and in me we had now something even more mutually compoundable than the purse of which we needed only enough to set me not emptyhanded into the quickest marriagerange of the french husband who would be the passport of all three of us into the country where our brothers destiny waited for him that was why beirut i had never heard of it but why should i have doubted when the village didnt any more that in its or gods good time beirut would appear at the end of the ship the voyage than that the french husband would be waiting for me there which he was i had never even heard his name before and i dont even recall all the circumstances of our meeting only that it was not long and he wasisa good man and has been a good husband to me and brother to marya and father to him of whom i am apparently to have all the anguishes save the initial one of having borne him and i have triedwill still tryto be a good wife to him he was a soldier in the garrison that is doing his military service because he was bred a farmer and his time was just up oh yes it was that close one more day and i would have missed him which should have told me warned me that what faced us was doom not destiny since only destiny is clumsy inefficient procrastinative while doom never is but i didnt know that then i knew only that we must reach france which we did the farmi wont even bother to tell you where it is i know where it is the old general said she had been immobile all the while so she couldnt become stillera tall figure breathing so quietly that she didnt seem to be doing that either clasping the closed fist into the other motionless palm looking down at him so we have already come to that she said of course you have learned where the farm is how else could you know what spot to hesitate to give me permission to bury the flesh and bone of the flesh and bone you loved oncelusted after once at leastin you even know already in advance the request ill finally demand of you since we both know now that this without uncrossing her hands she moved the closed one slightly then returned it to the other palm will be in vain yes the old general said i know that too and granted in advance too since by that time hell be no more a threat no no dont answer yet let me believe a little longer that i could never have believed that anyone not even you could any more control the flux of the bowels of natural compassion than he could his physical ones where was i oh yes the farm in that ship to beirut i had heard them talk of landfall and harbor by beirut i even knew what haven meant and now at last in france i believed that wehehad found them home who had never known one before four walls and a hearth to come back to at the end of day because they were mutually his walls and hearth work to be done not for pay or the privilege of sleeping in a hayloft or leftover food at a kitchen door but because the finished task was mutually his too to choose between its neglect and its completion because already he was not just a natural farmer he was a good one as though that half of his blood and background and heritage which was peasant had slept in untimed suspension until his destiny found and matched him with land earth good and broad and rich and deep enough so that by the end of the second year he was my husbands heir and would still be coheir even if we had children of our own and not just home but fatherland too he was already a french subject in ten more years he would be a french citizen too a citizen of france a frenchman to all effect and purpose and his very nameless origin would be as though it had never been so now at last wei hecould forget you no not that we couldnt forget you because you were why we were where we were had at last found the harbor haven where as they said in the ship we could drop anchor and make fast and secure besides he couldnt very well forget you because he had never heard of you yet it was rather that i forgave you now at last i could stop seeking you harrying dragging two other people over the earth in order to find and face and reproach compel whatever it would be remember i was a child still even if i had been the mother of two since i was nine years old it was as though it had been i in my ignorance who had misread you and owed you the apology and the shame where you in your wisdom had known all the time the one restitution for which he was fitted that because of that ineradicable peasant other half of his origin any other relationship juxtaposition with you would have brought him only disaster perhaps even to the point of destroying him oh yes i believed now that you already knew this history not only where we were but how and what we were doing there hopedyes believedthere that you had deliberately arranged and planned it to be even if you may not quite have anticipated that i should establish it intact on your own doorstephaven and harbor and home not just for him but us too marya and me too all four of us not just yourself and the one you had begot but the other two whose origin you had had no part in all branded forever more into one irremediable kinship by that one same passion which had created three of our lives and altered forever the course or anyway the pattern of your own the four of us together even obliterating that passions irremediable past in which you had not participated in your own get you dispossessed your predecessor in marya and me you effaced even his seniority and in marya her first child you even affirmed to yourself the trophy of its virginity more in the two of usnot marya this time because unrational and witless she was incapable of threatening you and herself innocent of harm was herself invulnerable even to you since the witless know only loss and absence never bereavementbut he and i were not only your absolution but even your expiation too as though in your designs first completion you had even foreseen this moment here now and had decreed already to me in proxy the last right and privilege of your dead abandoned paramour to vaunt her virtue for constancy at the same time she heaped on you the reproach of her fall so i didnt even need to forgive you either we were all four one now in that workable mutual neither compassionate nor uncompassionate armistice and none of us neither needed or had the time to waste forgiving or reproaching one another because we would all be busy enough in supporting balancing that condition of your expiation and ourhisreparations whose instrument you had been nor had i ever seen your face to remember either and now i began to believe that i never would never would have to that even whenifthe moment ever came when you would have could no longer evade having to face one another he alone would be enough and he would not require my ratification or support no it was the past itself which i had forgiven could at last forgive now swapped all that bitter and outraged impotence for the homeharborhaven which was within the range of his capacities which he was fitted and equipped formore would have chosen himself if he had had the choicewhose instrument you in your anonymity had been whether you actually intended for it to be in france or not where since he was free of you the two others of us could be also then his military class was called he went almost eagerlynot that he could have done else as i know but then so do you know that there are ways and still ways of accepting what you have no choice of refusing but he went almost eagerly and served his touri almost said time but didnt i just say he went almost eagerlyand came back home and then i believed that he was free of youthat you and he also had struck a balance an armistice in liability and threat he was a french citizen and a frenchman now not only legally but morally too since the date of his birth proved his right to the one and he had just doffed the uniform in which he himself had proved his right and worthiness to the other not only was he free of you but each of you were free now of the other you absolved of the liability since having given him life you had now created for him security and dignity in which to end it and so you owed him nothing he absolved of threat since you no longer harmed him now and so you didnt need to fear him anymore yes free of you at last or so i thought or you were free of him that is since he was the one who had better be afraid if any minuscule of danger still remained for you in him he himself would eradicate it now by the surest means of all marriage a wife and family so many economic responsibilities to bear and discharge that he would have no time over to dream of his moral rights a family children that strongest and most indissoluble bond of all to anneal him harmless forever more into his present and commit him irrevocable to his future and insulate him for good and always from the griefs and anguishes he had none of course in the sense i mean because he still had never heard of you of his past but it seems that i was wrong wrong always in regard to you wrong every time in what i thought you thought or felt or feared from him never more wrong than now when apparently you had come to believe that bribing him with independence of you had merely scotched the snake not killed it and marriage would compound his threat in children any one of which might prove impervious to the bribe of a farm any marriage even this one and at first it looked like your own blood was trying to fend and shield you from this threat as though in a sort of instinctive filial loyalty we had long ago designed marriage for him and now that he was free grown a man a citizen heir to the farm because wemy husband and iknew now that we would have no children his military service forever so we thought then behind him we began to plan one except that he refused twice declined twice the candidates virtuous and solvent and suitable which we picked for him and still in such a way that we could never tell if it was the girl he said no to or the institution perhaps both being your son though as far as i know he still didnt know you even existed perhaps both having inherited both from you the repudiation of the institution since his own origin had done without it the choicy choosing of a partner since with him once passion had had to be enough because it was all and he in his turn felt desired believed that he deserved no less to match his own inheritance with or was it even worse than that to you your own son truly demanding not even revenge on you but vengeance refusing the two we picked who were not only solvent but virtuous too for that one who had not even sold the one for the other but in bartering one had trafficked them both away i didnt know we didnt know only that he had refused declined and still in that way i told you of less of refusal than negation so that we just thought he wasnt ready yet that he still wanted a little more of that young mans bachelor and tieless freedom which he had only regainedregained foundyesterday when he doffed the uniform so we could wait too and we did more time passed but we still thought there was enough of it since marriage is long enough to have plenty of room for time behind it thensuddenly with no warning to us who knew only work and bread not politics and gloryit was and whether there had been time enough or not or he had been right to wait or not didnt matter because he didnt wait now either he was gone that first week in the old uniform still stinking of the mothballs from the garret trunk but even that was no quicker nor faster than we were you know where the farm iswas no still is since it will have to still be there in order to be a basis for what you will finally grant us so i dont need to tell you how we left it either since a part of your trade is coping with the confused and anguished mass of the civilian homeless in order to make room for your victories he didnt even wait to be called by his class a stranger might have guessed it to be a young bachelor accepting even war as a last desperate cast to escape matrimony but that stranger would be wrong of course as he himself proved two years later but we knew better he was a frenchman now all france asked of him in return for that dignity and right and that security and independence was his willingness to defend it and them and he had gone to do that then suddenly all france all western europe too for that matter was loud with your name every child even in france knew your face because you would save usyou to be supreme of all not to command our armies and the armies of our allies because they did not need to be commanded since the terror and the threat was their terror and threat too and all they needed was to be led comforted reassured and you were the one to do that because they had faith in you believed in you but i knew more not better just more i had only to match almost any newspaper with this again she moved slightly the closed hand lying in the other palm and now i knew not only who you were but what you were and where you were no no you didnt start this war just to further prove him as your son and a frenchman but rather since this war had to be his own destiny fate would use it to prove him to his father you see you and he together to be one in the saving of france he in his humble place and you in your high and matchless one and victory itself would be that day when at last you would see one another face to face he rankless still save for the proven bravery and constancy and devotion which the medal you would fasten to his breast would symbolise and affirm it was the girl of course his revenge and vengeance on you which you feared a whore a marseilles whore to mother the grandchildren of your high and exalted blood he told us of her on his leave in the second year weisaid no of course too but then he had that of you also the capacity to follow his will always oh yes he told us of her a good girl he said leading through her own fate necessity compulsions there is an old grandmother a life which was not her life and he was right we saw that as soon as he brought her to us she is a good girl now anyway since then anyway maybe always a good girl as he believed or maybe only since she loved him anyway who are we to challenge him and her if what this proves is what love can do save a woman as well as doom her but no matter now you will never believe perhaps you dare not risk it chance it that he would never have made any claim on you that this whores children would bear not his fathers name but my fathers you would never believe that they would never any more know whose blood they carried than he would have known except for this but its too late now thats all over now i had imagined you facing him for the first time on that last victorious field while you fastened a medal to his coat instead you will see him for the first timeno you wont even see him you wont even be theretied to a post you to see himif you were to see him which you will notover the shoulders and the aimed rifles of a firingsquad the hand the closed one flicked jerked so fast that the eye almost failed to register it and the object seemed to gleam once in the air before it even appeared already tumbling across the vacant top of the desk until it sprang open as though of its own accord and came to resta small locket of chased worn gold opening like a huntingcase watch upon twin medallions miniatures painted on ivory so you actually had a mother you really did when i first saw the second face inside it that night i thought it was your wife or sweetheart or mistress and i hated you but i know better now and i apologise for imputing to your character a capacity so weak as to have earned the human warmth of hatred she looked down at him so i did wait too late to produce it after all no thats wrong too any moment would have been too late any moment i might have chosen to use it as a weapon the pistol would have misfired the knifeblade shattered at the stroke so of course you know what my next request will be i know it the old general said and granted in advance of course since then he can no longer threaten you but at least its not too late for him to receive the locket even though it cannot save him at least you can tell me that come say it at least its not too late for him to receive it its not too late the old general said so he must die they looked at one another your own son then will he not merely inherit from me at thirty what i had already bequeathed to him at birth by its size and location the room which the old general called his study had probably been the chamber cell of the old marquises favorite ladyinwaiting or perhaps tiringwoman though by its appearance now it might have been a library lifted bodily from an english country home and then reft of the books and furnishings the shelves were empty now except for one wall and those empty too save for a brief row of the textbooks and manuals of the old generals trade stacked neatly at one end of one shelf beneath this against the wall was a single narrow army cot pillowless beneath a neatly and immaculately drawn gray army blanket at the foot of it sat the old generals battered field desk otherwise the room contained a heavyish victorianlooking almost americanlooking table surrounded by four chairs in which the four generals were sitting the table had been cleared of the remains of the german generals meal an orderly was just going out with the final tray of soiled dishes before the old general sat a coffee service and its cups and a tray of decanters and glasses the old general filled the cups and passed them then he took up one of the decanters schnaps general of course he said to the german general thanks the german general said the old general filled and passed the glass the old general didnt speak to the british general at all he simply passed the port decanter and an empty glass to him then a second empty glass since general he called the american generals name is already on your left he said to no one directly calling the american generals name again doesnt drink after dinner as a rule though without doubt he will void it tonight then to the american unless you will have brandy too port thank you general the american said since we are only recessing an alliance not abrogating it bah the german general said he sat rigid bright with medals the ground glass monocle it had neither cord nor ribbon it was not on his face his head like an ear but set as though inevictable into the socket of his right eye like an eyeball itself fixed in a rigid opaque glare at the american general alliances that is what is wrong each time the mistake weus and youand youand you his hard and rigid stare jerking from face to face as he spoke have made always each time as though we will never learn and this time we are going to pay for it oh yes we dont you realise that we know as well as you do what is happening what is going to be the end of this by another twelve months twelve months bah it wont last twelve months another winter will see it we know better than you do to the british general because you are on the run now and do not have time to do anything else even if you were not running you probably would not realise it because you are not a martial people but we are our national destiny is for glory and war they are not mysteries to us and so we know what we are looking at so we will pay for that mistake and since we will youand youand you the cold and lifeless glare stopping again at the american who only think you came in late enough to gain at little riskmust pay also then he was looking at none of them it was almost as though he had drawn one rapid quiet and calming inhalation still rigid though and still composed but you will excuse me please it is too late for that nowthis time our problem now is the immediate one also first he rose tossing his crumpled napkin onto the table and picking up the filled brandy glass so rapidly that his chair scraped back across the floor and would have crashed over had not the american general put out a quick hand and saved it the german general standing rigid the brandy glass raised his close uniform as unwrinkleable as mail against the easy coat of the briton like the comfortable jacket of a gamekeeper and the americans like a tailormade costume for a masquerade in which he would represent the soldier of fifty years ago and the old generals which looked like a wife had got it out of a mothballed attic trunk and cut some of it off and stitched some braid and ribbons and buttons on what remained hoch the german general said and tossed the brandy down and with the same motion flung the empty glass over his shoulder to crash against the wall hoch the old general said courteously he drank too but he set his empty glass back on the table you must excuse us he said we are not situated as you are we cannot afford to break french glasses he took another brandy glass from the tray and began to fill it be seated general he said the german general didnt move and whose fault is that he said that we have beenja twicecompelled to destroy french property not yours and mine not ours here not the fault of any of us all of us who have to spend the four years straining at each other from behind two wire fences its the politicians the civilian imbeciles who compel us every generation to have to rectify the blunders of their damned international horsetrading be seated general the old general said as you were the german general said then he caught himself he made a rigid quarterturn and clapped his heels to face the old general i forgot myself for a moment you will please to pardon it he reversed the quarterturn but without the heelclap this time his voice was milder now quieter anyway the same blunder because it is always the same alliance only the pieces moved and swapped about perhaps they have to keep on doing making the same mistake being civilians and politicians perhaps they cant help themselves or being civilians and politicians perhaps they dare not because they would be the first to vanish under that one which we would establish think of it if you have not already the alliance which would dominate all europe europe bah the worldus with you france and you england he seemed to catch himself again for a second turning to the american general with you forwith your good wishes a minority stockholder the american said thank you the german general said an alliance the alliance which will conquer the whole eartheurope asia africa the islandsto accomplish where bonaparte failed what caesar dreamed of what hannibal didnt live long enough to do who will be emperor the old general said it was so courteous and mild that for a moment it didnt seem to register the german general looked at him yes the british general said as mildly who the german general looked at him there was no movement of the face at all the monocle simply descended from the eye down the face and then the tunic glinting once or twice as it turned in the air into the palm lifted to receive it the hand shutting on it then opening again the monocle already in position between the thumb and the first finger to be inserted again and in fact there had been no eyeball behind it no scar nor healed suture even only the lidless and empty socket glaring down at the british general perhaps now general the old general said thanks the german general said but still he didnt move the old general set the filled brandy glass in front of his stillvacant place thanks the german general said still staring at the british general he drew a handkerchief from his cuff and wiped the monocle and set it back into the socket now the opaque oval stared down at the british general you see why we have to hate you english he said you are not soldiers perhaps you cant be which is all right if true you cant help it we dont hate you for that we dont even hate you because you dont try to be what we hate you for is because you wont even bother to try you are in a war you blunder through it somehow and even survive because of your little island you cant possibly get any bigger and you know it and because of that you know that sooner or later you will be in another war yet this time too you will not even prepare for it oh you send a few of your young men to your military college where they will be taught perfectly how to sit a horse and change a palace guard they will even get some practical experience by transferring this ritual intact to little outposts beside ricepaddies or teaplantations or himalayan goatpaths but that is all you will wait until an enemy is actually beating at your front gate then you will turn out to repel him exactly like a village being turned out cursing and swearing on a winter night to salvage a burning hayrickgather up your guttersweepings the scum of your slums and stables and paddocks they will not even be dressed to look like soldiers but in the garments of ploughmen and ditchers and carters your officers look like a countryhouse party going out to the butts for a pheasant drive do you see getting out in front armed with nothing but walking sticks saying come along lads that seems to be enemy yonder and there appear to be a goodish number of them but i dare say not too manyand then walking strolling on not even looking back to see if they are followed or not because they dont need to because they are followed do follow cursing and grumbling still and unprepared still but they follow and die still cursing and grumbling still civilians we have to hate you there is an immorality an outrageous immorality you are not even contemptuous of glory you are simply not interested in it only in solvency he stood rigid and composed staring down at the british general he said calmly in a voice of composed and boundless despair you are swine you know then he said no and now in his voice there was a kind of invincibly incredulous outrage too you are worse you are unbelievable when we are on the same side we winalways and the whole world gives you the credit for the victory waterloo when we are against you you losealways passchendaele mons cambrai and tomorrow amiensand you dont even know it if you please general the old general said in his mild voice the german general didnt even pause he turned to the american you also swine the american said soldiers the german said you are no better you mean no worse dont you the american said i just got back from st mihiel last night then perhaps you can visit amiens tomorrow the german said i will conduct you general the old general said this time the german general stopped and even looked at the old general he said not yet i amhow you saysupplicant he said again supplicant then he began to laugh that is up to the dead indomitable unregenerate eye speaking not even to anyone not even to himself only to outraged and unregenerate incredulity i a german lieutenant general come eightyseven kilometres to request ofja insist onan englishman and a frenchman the defeat of my nation weicould have saved it by simply refusing to meet you here i could save it now simply by walking out i could have done it at your aerodrome this afternoon by using on myself the pistol which i employed to preserve even in defeat the integrity of what this he made a brief rapid gesture with one hand with barely a motion of it he indicated his entire uniformbelts brass braid insigne and all represents has won the right to stand for preserves still that for which those of us who have died in it died for then this one this blunder of the priests and politicians and civilian timeservers would stop now since in fact it already has three days ago now but i did not i do not as a result of which inside another year wenot us again without moving he indicated his uniform but they whose blunder we tried to rectify will be done finished and with them us too since now we are no longer extricable from themoh yes us too let the americans annoy our flank as much as they like they will not pass verdun either by tomorrow we will have run you to the briton out of amiens and possibly even into what you call your ditch and by next month your people to the old general now in paris will be cramming your official sacred talismans into briefcases on the way to spain or portugal but it will be too late it will be over finished twelve months from now and wenot they for this but we uswill have to plead with you on your terms for their survival since already it is impossible to extricate theirs from ours because i am a soldier first then a german thenor hope to bea victorious german but that is not even second but only third because this again he indicated the uniform is more important than any german or even any victory now he was looking at all of them his voice was quite calm almost conversational now that is our sacrifice the whole german army against your one french regiment but you are right we waste time he looked at them rapidly erect still but not quite rigid you are here i am he looked at them again he said again bah for a little time anyway we dont need secrets i am eightyseven kilometres from here i must return as you say he faced the american general his heels clapped again a sound very loud in the quiet and insulate room this is only a recess not an abrogation still without moving he looked rapidly from the american to the briton then back again you are admirable but you are not soldiers all young men are brave the american said continue the german general said say it even germans even frenchmen the old general said in his mild voice wouldnt we all be more comfortable if you would sit down a moment the german general said he did not even look at the old general we again without moving he looked rapidly from one to the other you two and i discussed this business thoroughly while yourwhat do i say formal or mutualcommanderinchief was detained from us we are agreed on what must be done that was never any question now we need only to agree to do it in this little time we have out of the four years of holding one another offwe germans on one side and you english and french he turned to the american again the heels clapped you americans too i have not forgot youon the other engaging each the other with half a hand because the other hand and a half was required to defend our back areas from our own politicians and priests during that discussion before your commanderinchief joined us something was said about decision he said again decision he didnt even say bah now he looked rapidly again from the american to the briton to the american again you he said yes the american general said decision implies choice the german general looked at the briton you he said yes the british general said god help us the german general paused pardon sorry the british general said let it be just yes then he said god help us the american general said why why the german general said the why is to me were both right this time the american general said at least we dont have to cope with that so the german general said that is both of you three of us he sat down picked up the crumpled napkin and drew his chair up and took up the filled brandy glass and sat back and erect again into that same rigidity of formal attention as when he had been standing to toast his master so that even sitting the rigidity had a sort of visible inaudibility like a soundless clap of heels the filled glass at level with the fixed rigid glare of the opaque monocle again without moving he seemed to glance rapidly at the other glasses be pleased to fill gentlemen he said but neither the briton nor the american moved they just sat there while across the table from them the german general sat with his lifted and rigid glass he said indomitable and composed not even contemptuous so then all that remains is to acquaint your commanderinchief with what part of our earlier discussion he might be inclined to hear then the formal ratification of our agreement formal ratification of what agreement the old general said mutual ratification then the german general said of what the old general said the agreement the german general said what agreement the old general said do we need an agreement has anyone missed onethe port is with you general he said to the briton fill and pass thursday thursday night this time it was a bedroom the grave and noble face was framed by a pillow looking at him from beneath a flannel nightcap tied under the chin the nightshirt was flannel too open at the throat to reveal a small cloth bag not new and not very clean and apparently containing something which smelled like asafoetida on a soiled string like a necklace the youth stood beside the bed in a brocade dressing gown they were blank shells the runner said in his light dry voice the aeroplaneall four of themflew right through the bursts the german one never even deviated not even going fast even when one of ours hung right on its tail from about fifty feet for more than a minute while i could actually see the tracer going into it the same oneaeroplaneoursdove at us at me i even felt one of whatever it was coming out of the gun hit me on the leg here it was like when a child blows a garden pea at you through a tube except for the smell the stink the burning phosphorus there was a german general in it you see i mean in the german one there had to be either we had to send someone there or they had to send someone here and since weor the frenchwere the ones who started it thought of it first obviously it would be our rightprivilegeduty to be host only it would have to look all right from beneath they couldntcouldnt dare anywayissue a synchronised simultaneous order for every man on both sides to shut their eyes and count a hundred so they had to do the next best thing to make it look all regular all orthodox to anyone they couldnt hide it from what the old negro said dont you see yet its because they cant afford to let it stop like this i mean let us stop it they dont dare if they ever let us find out that we can stop a war as simply as men tired of digging a ditch decide calmly and quietly to stop digging the ditch i mean that suit the old negro said that policemans suit you just took it didnt you i had to the runner said with that peaceful and terrible patience i had to get out to get back in too at least back to where i hid my uniform it used to be difficult enough to pass either way in or out but now it will be almost impossible to get back in but dont worry about that all i need is he dead the old negro said what the runner said oh the policeman i dont know probably not he said with a sort of amazement i hope not he said i knew night before lasttwo nights ago tuesday nightwhat they were planning to do though of course i had no proof then i tried to tell him but you know him youve probably tried yourself to tell him something you couldnt prove or that he didnt want to believe so ill need something else not to prove it to him make him believe it theres not time enough left to waste that way thats why i came here i want you to make me a mason too or maybe theres not even time for that either so just show me the signlike this he jerked flicked his hand low against his flank as near as he had been able to divine at the time or anyway remember now from the man two years ago on the day he joined the battalion that will be enough it will have to be ill bluff the rest of it through wait the old negro said tell me slow im trying to the runner said with that terrible patience every man in the battalion owes him his pay for weeks ahead provided they live long enough to earn it and he lives long enough to collect it from them he did it by making them all masons or anyway making them believe they are masons he owns them you see they cant refuse him all he will need to do is wait the old negro said wait dont you see the runner said if all of us the whole battalion at least one battalion one unit out of the whole line to start it to lead the wayleave the rifles and grenades and all behind us in the trench simply climb barehanded out over the parapet and through the wire and then just walk on barehanded not with our hands up for surrender but just open to show that we had nothing to hurt harm anyone not running stumbling just walking forward like free menjust one of us one man suppose just one man then multiply him by a battalion suppose a whole battalion of us who want nothing except just to go home and get themselves clean into clean clothes and work and drink a little beer in the evening and talk and then lie down and sleep and not be afraid and maybe just maybe that many germans who dont want anything more too or maybe just one german who doesnt want more than that to put his or their rifles and grenades down and climb out too with their hands empty too not for surrender but just so every man could see there is nothing in them to hurt or harm either suppose they dont the old negro said suppose they shoot at us but the runner didnt even hear the us he was still talking wont they shoot at us tomorrow anyway as soon as they have recovered from the fright as soon as the people at chaulnesmont and paris and poperinghe and whoever it was in that german aeroplane this afternoon have had time to meet and compare notes and decide exactly where the threat danger is and eradicate it and then start the war again tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow until the last formal rule of the game has been fulfilled and discharged and the last ruined player removed from sight and the victory immolated like a football trophy in a clubhouse showcase thats all i want thats all im trying to do but you may be right so you tell me the old negro groaned he groaned peacefully one hand came out from beneath the covers and turned them back and he swung his legs toward the edge of the bed and said to the youth in the dressing gown hand me my shoes and britches listen to me the runner said theres not time it will be daylight in two hours and ive got to get back just show me how to make the sign the signal you cant learn it right in that time the old negro said and even if you could im going too maybe this is what i been hunting for too didnt you just say the germans might shoot at us the runner said dont you see thats it thats the risk if some of the germans do come out then they will shoot at us both of them their side and ours tooput a barrage down on all of us theyll have to there wont be anything else for them to do so your mind done changed about it the old negro said just show me the sign the signal the runner said again the old negro groaned peaceful almost inattentive swinging his legs on out of the bed the innocent and unblemished corporals uniform was hanging neatly on a chair the shoes and the socks were placed neatly beneath it the youth had picked them up and he now knelt beside the bed holding one of the socks open for the old negros foot arent you afraid the runner said aint we already got enough ahead of us without bringing that up the old negro said pettishly and i know what youre fixing to say next how am i going to get up there and i can answer that i never had no trouble getting here to france i reckon i can make them other just sixty miles and i know what you are fixing to say after that one too i cant wear this french suit up there neither without no general with me only i dont need to answer that one because you done already answered it kill a british soldier this time the runner said you said he wasnt dead i said maybe he wasnt you said you hoped he wasnt dont never forget that the runner was the last thing which the sentry would ever see in fact he was the first thing the sentry saw that morning except for the relief guard who had brought his breakfast and who now sat his rifle leaning beside him against the dugouts opposite earthen shelf he had been under arrest for almost thirty hours now that was all just under arrest as though the furious blows of the riflebutt two nights ago had not simply hushed a voice which he could bear no longer but had somehow separated him from mankind as if that aghast reversal that cessation of four years of mud and blood and its accompanying convulsion of silence had cast him up on this buried dirt ledge with no other sign of man at all save the rotation of guards who brought him food and then sat opposite him until the time came for their relief yesterday and this morning too in ordained rote the orderly officers sergeant satellite had appeared suddenly in the orifice crying shun and he had stood bareheaded while the guard saluted and the orderly officer himself entered and said rapid and glib out of the glib and routine book any complaints and was gone again before he could have made any answer he did not intend to make but that was all yesterday he had tried for a little while to talk to one of the rotated guards and since then some of them had tried to talk to him but that was all of that too so that in effect for over thirty hours now he had sat or sprawled and lay asleep on his dirt shelf morose sullen incorrigible foulmouthed and snarling not even waiting but just biding pending whatever it was they would finally decide to do with him or with the silence both or either if and when they did make up their minds then he saw the runner at the same moment he saw the pistol already in motion as the runner struck the guard between the ear and the rim of the helmet and caught him as he toppled and tumbled him onto the ledge and turned and the sentry saw the burlesque of a soldier entering behind himthe travesty of the wrapped putties the tunic whose lower buttons would not even meet across the paunch not of sedentation but of age and above it beneath the helmet the chocolate face which four years ago he had tried to relegate and repudiate into the closed book of his past that makes five the old negro said all right all right the runner answered rapidly and harshly hes not dead either dont you think that by this time i have learned how to do it he said rapidly to the sentry you dont need to worry either now all we need from you now is inertia but the sentry was not even looking at him he was looking at the old negro i told you to leave me alone he said and it was the runner who answered him in that same rapid and brittle voice its too late for that now because i am wrong we dont want inertia from you what we want is silence come along notice i have the pistol if i must i shall use it ive already used it six times but only the flat of it this time ill use the trigger he said to the old negro in the rapid brittle and almost despairing voice all right this one will be dead then you suggest something you cant get away with this the sentry said who expects to the runner said thats why we have no time to waste come along youve got your investments to protect you know after a breathing spell like this and the fresh start it will give them let alone the discovery of what can happen simply by letting the same men hang around in uniforms too long the whole battalion will probably be wiped out as soon as they can get us up in gunrange again which may be this afternoon they flew a german general over yesterday without doubt he was at chaulnesmont by late dinner last night with our poohbahs and the american ones too already waiting for him and the whole affair settled and over with by the time the port passed if german generals drink port though why not since we have had four years to prove to us even if all history had not already done it that the biped successful enough to become a general had ceased to be a german or british or american or italian or french one almost as soon as it never was a human one and without doubt he is already on his way back and both sides are merely waiting until he is out of the way as you hold up a polo game while one of the visiting rajahs rides off the field the sentryin what time he had leftwould remember it he knew at once that the runner meant exactly what he said about the pistol he had proof of that at onceof the flat side of it anywaywhen he almost stumbled over the sprawled bodies of the orderly officer and his sergeant in the tunnel before he saw them but it would seem to him that it was not the hard muzzle of the pistol in the small of his back but the voice itselfthe glib calm rapid desperate and despairing voice carrying sweeping them into the next dugout where an entire platoon lay or sat along the earthen shelf the faces turning as one to look at them as the runner thrust him in with the muzzle of the pistol and then thrust the old negro forward too saying make the sign go on make itthe tense calm desperate voice not even stopping then as it seemed to the sentry that it never had thats right of course he doesnt need to make the sign he has enough without he has come from outside so have i for that matter but you wont even need to doubt me now you need only look at him some of you may even recognise horns dcm on that tunic but dont worry horn isnt dead any more than mr smith and sergeant bledsoe i have learned to use the flat of this he raised the pistol for an instant into sight quite neatly now because here is our chance to have done with it be finished with it quit of it not just the killing the getting dead because thats only a part of the nightmare of the rot and the stinking and the waste the sentry would remember it incorrigible still merely acquiescent believing still that he was waiting biding the moment when he or perhaps two or three of them at once would take the runner off guard and smother him listening to the glib staccato voice watching the turned faces listening to it too believing still that he saw in them only astonishment surprise presently to fade into one incorrigible concert which he would match and neither of us would have got back in if it had not been for his pass from the ministry of war in paris so you dont even know yet what they have done to you theyve sealed you up in herethe whole front from the channel to switzerland though from what i saw in paris last nightnot only military police the french and american and ours too but the civilian police tooi wouldnt have thought theyd have enough left to seal anything with but they have the colonel himself could not have got back in this morning unless the pass bore the signature of that old man in the castle at chaulnesmont its like another front manned by all the troops in the three forces who cant speak the language belonging to the coat they came up from under the equator and half around the world to die in in the cold and the wetsenegalese and moroccans and kurds and chinese and malays and indianspolynesian melanesian mongol and negro who couldnt understand the password nor read the pass either only to recognise perhaps by memorised rote that one cryptic hieroglyph but not you you cant even get out now to try to come back in nomans land is no longer in front of us its behind us now before the faces behind the machine guns and the rifles at least thought caucasian thoughts even if they didnt speak english or french or american now they dont even think caucasian thoughts theyre alien they dont even have to care they have tried for four years to get out of the white mans cold and mud and rain just by killing germans and failed who knows by killing off the frenchmen and englishmen and americans which they have bottled up here they might all be on the way home tomorrow so there is nowhere for us to go now but east now the sentry moved that is he did not move yet he dared not yet he simply made a single infinitesimal transition into a more convulsive rigidity speaking now harsh and obscene cursing the rapt immobilised faces are you going to let them get away with this dont you know were all going to be for it they have already killed lieutenant smith and sergeant bledsoe nonsense the runner said they arent dead didnt i just tell you i have learned how to use the flat of a pistol its his money thats all everyone in the battalion owes him he wants us to sit here and do nothing until he has earned his months profit then he wants them to start it up again so we will be willing to bet him twenty shillings a month that we will be dead in thirty days which is what they are going to dostart it up again you all saw those four aeroplanes yesterday and all that archie the archie were blank shells there was a german general in the hun aeroplane last night he was at chaulnesmont he would have to have been else why did he come at all why else wafted across on a cloud of blank archie shell with three ses going through the motion of shooting him down with blank ammunition oh yes i was there i saw the lorries fetching up the shells night before last and yesterday i stood behind one of the batteries firing them when one of the sesthat pilot would have been a child of course too young for them to have dared inform him in advance too young to be risked with the knowledge that fact and truth are not the samedived and put a burst right into the battery and shot me in the skirt of my tunic with somethingwhatever it waswhich actually stung a little for a moment what else except to allow a german general to visit the french and the british and the american ones in the allied commanderyinchief without alarming the rest of us bipeds who were not born generals but simply human beings and since theyall four of themwould speak the same language no matter what clumsy isolated national tongues they were compelled by circumstance to do it in the matter probably took them no time at all and very likely the german one is already on his way back home at this moment not even needing the blank shells now because the guns will be already loaded with live ones merely waiting for him to get out of the way in order to resume efface obliterate forever this ghastly and incredible contretemps so we have no time you see we may not even have an hour but an hour will be enough if only it is all of us the whole battalion not to kill the officers they themselves have abolished killing for a recess of three days besides we wont need to with all of us if we had time we could even draw lots one man to each officer to simply hold his hands while the rest of us go over but the flat of a pistol is quicker and no more harmful really as mr smith and sergeant bledsoe and horn will tell you when they awake then never to touch pistol or rifle or grenade or machine gun again to climb out of ditches forever and pass through the wire and then advance with nothing but our bare hands to dare defy the germans not to come out too and meet us he said quickly in the desperate and calmly despairing voice all right meet us with machinegun fire you will say but the hun archie yesterday was blank too he said to the old negro now make them the sign have not you already proved that if anything it means brotherhood and peace you fools the sentry cried except that he did not say fools virulent and obscene out of his almost inarticulate paucity struggling now having defied the pistol in one outraged revulsion of repudiation before he realized that the hard little iron ring was gone from his spine and that the runner was merely holding him he the sentry watching glaring at the faces which he had thought were merely fixed in a surprise precursive to outrage too looming bearing down on him identical and alien and concerted until so many hard hands held him that he could not even struggle the runner facing him now the pistol poised flat on one raised palm shouting at him stop it stop it make your choice but hurry you can come with us or you can have the pistol but decide he would remember they were topside now in the trench he could see a silent and moiling group within which or beneath which the major and two company commanders and three or four sergeants had vanished they had taken the adjutant and the sergeantmajor and the corporal signalman in the orderly dugout and the colonel still in bed and in both directions along the trench he could see men coming up out of their holes and warrens blinking in the light dazed still yet already wearing on their faces that look of amazed incredulity fading with one amazed concert into dawning and incredulous hope the hard hands still grasped him as they lifted flung him up onto the firestep and then over the lip of the parapet he already saw the runner spring up and turn and reach down and pull the old negro up beside him while other hands boosted from beneath the two of them now standing on the parapet facing the trench the runners voice thin and high now with that desperate and indomitable despair the sign the sign give it us come on men if this is what they call staying alive do you want that on these terms forever either then he was struggling again he didnt even know he was about to when he found himself jerking and thrashing cursing flinging beating away the hands not even realising then why for what until he found himself in the wire striking hitting backward at the crowding bodies at the entrance to the labyrinthine passageway which the night patrols used hearing his own voice in one last invincible repudiation f them all bugger all of you crawling now not the first one through because when he rose to his feet running the old negro was panting beside him while he shouted at the old negro serve you f ing well right didnt i warn you two years ago to stay away from me didnt i then the runner was beside him grasping his arm and stopping him and turning him about shouting look at them he did so and saw them watched them crawling on their hands and knees through the gaps in the wire as though up out of hell itself faces clothes hands and all stained as though forever one single nameless and identical color from the mud in which they had lived like animals for four years then rising to their feet as though in that four years they had not stood on earth but had this moment returned to light and air from purgatory as ghosts stained forever to the nameless single color of purgatory over there too the runner cried turning him again until he saw that also the distant german wire one faint moil and pulse of motion indistinguishable until it too broke into men rising erect whereupon a dreadful haste came over him along with something else which he had not yet time to assimilate recognise knowing aware of only the haste and not his haste but one haste not only the battalion but the german one or regiment or whatever it was the two of them running toward each other now emptyhanded approaching until he could see distinguish the individual faces but still all one face one expression and then he knew suddenly that his too looked like that all of them did tentative amazed defenseless and then he heard the voices too and knew that his was one alsoa thin murmuring sound rising into the incredible silence like a chirping of lost birds forlorn and defenseless too and then he knew what the other thing was even before the frantic uprush of the rockets from behind the two wires german and british too no he cried no not to us not even realising that he had said we and not i for the first time in his life probably certainly for the first time in four years not even realising that in the next moment he had said i again shouting to the old negro as he whirled about what did i tell you didnt i tell you to let me alone only it was not the old negro it was the runner standing facing him as the first ranging burst of shells bracketed in he never heard them nor the wailing rumble of the two barrages either nor saw nor heard little more of anything in that last second except the runners voice crying out of the soundless rush of flame which enveloped half his body neatly from heel through navel through chin they cant kill us they cant not dare not they cant except of course that he couldnt sit here save for a definitely physically limited length of time because after a while it would be daylight unless of course the sun really failed to rise tomorrow which as they taught you in that subsection of philosophy they called dialectics which you were trying to swot through in order to try to swot through that section of being educated they called philosophy was for the sake of argument possible only why shouldnt he be sitting here after daylight or for the rest of the day itself for that matter since the only physical limitation to that would be when someone with the authority and compulsion to resist the condition of a young man in a second lieutenants uniform sitting on the ground against the wall of a nissen hut had his attention called to it by a horn or whistle and that greater condition which yesterday had sent three fairly expensive aeroplanes jinking up and down the sky with their vickerses full of blank ammunition might well abrogate that one too then the first limitation had been discharged because now it was day and none to know where the night had gone not a dialectic this time but he who didnt know where night had gone this soon this quick or maybe it was a dialectic since as far as he knew only he had watched it out and since only he in waking had watched it out to all the others still in slumber it still obtained like the tree in darkness being no longer green and since he who had watched it out still didnt know where it had gone for him it was still night too then almost before he had had time to begin to bother to think that out and so have done with it a bugle blowing reveille confounded him the sound that sound who had never heard it before or even heard of it a horn blowing at daybreak on a forward aerodrome where people did not even have guns but were armed only with maps and what monaghan called monkeywrenches even getting him up onto his feet that greater conditions abrogation which had now reabrogated in fact if he had been a cadet still he would even know what crime whoever found him sitting there would charge him with not shaving and standing now he realised that he had even forgot his problem too who had sat there all night thinking that he had none evermore as though sitting so long within that peaceful stink had robbed olfactory of its single sense or perhaps the sidcott of its smell and only getting up restored them both in fact for a moment he toyed with the idea of unrolling the sidcott to see how far the burning had spread except that if he did that and let the air in the burning might spread faster thinking with a sort of peaceful amazement hearing himself because its got to last no more not last until just last at least he wouldnt take it inside with him so he left it against the wall and went around the hut and inside itburk and hanley and de marchi had not stirred so the tree was not green for some yet anywayand got his shaving tackle and then picked up the sidcott again and went to the washroom nor would the tree be quite green yet here either and if not here certainly not in the latrines though now it would because the sun was well up now and once more smooth of face the sidcott stinking peacefully under his arm he could see movement about the mess remembering suddenly that he had not eaten since lunch yesterday but then there was the sidcott when suddenly he realised that the sidcott would serve that too turning and already walking theysomeonehad brought his bus back and rolled it in so he trod his long shadow toward only the petrol tin and put the sidcott into it and stood peaceful and empty while the day incremented the infinitesimal ineluctable shortening of the shadows it was going to rain probably but then it always was anyway that is it always did on daysoff from patrols he didnt know why yet he was too new you will though monaghan told him just wait till after the first time youve been good and scaredpronouncing it skeered so it would be all right now the ones who were going to get up would have already had breakfast and the others would sleep on through till lunch he could even take his shaving kit on to the mess without going to the hut at all and stopped he could not even remember when he had heard it last that alien and divorcedthat thick dense mute furious murmur to the north and east he knew exactly where it would be because he had flown over the spot yesterday afternoon thinking peacefully i came home too soon if i had only sat up there all night instead i could have seen it start againlistening motionless in midstride hearing it murmur toward and into its crescendo and sustain a time a while and then cut short off murmuring in his ears for a little time still until he discovered that what he was actually listening to was a lark and he had been right the sidcott had served even better than it knew even or even perhaps intended carrying him still intact across lunch too since it was after ten now provided he could eat enough of course the foodthe eggs and bacon and the marmaladehaving no taste to speak of so that only in that had he been wrong then presently he was wrong there too eating steadily on in the empty mess until at last the orderly told him there was simply no more toast much better than the sidcott could have known to plan or even dream because during lunch the hut itself would be empty and for that while he could use his cot to do some of the reading he had imagined himself doing between patrolsthe hero living by proxy the lives of heroes between the monotonous peaks of his own heroic derring which he was doing for another moment or two while bridesman stood in the door until he looked up lunch bridesman said late breakfast thanks he said drink bridesman said later thanks he said and moved in time taking the book with him there was a tree he had discovered it in the first weekan old tree with two big roots like the arms of a chair on the bank above the cut through which the road ran past the aerodrome to villeneuve blanche so that you could sit like in a chair with the roots to prop the elbows which propped in turn the book secure from war yet still of it not that remote in those days when they had called it war who apparently were not decided yet what to call this now and so now there would have been time enough bridesman would know by now what that had been this morning thinking peacefully the open book still propped before he began to move yes he will know by now he will have to make the decision to tell me or not but he will make it nor was there any reason to take the book to the hut because he might even read some more entering and then leaving bridesmans hut with the book still closed on one finger to mark his place still strolling he had never been walking fast anyway and finally stopping empty and peaceful only blinking a little looking out across the empty field the line of closed hangars the mess and the office where a few people came and went not too many though apparently collyer had lifted the ban on villeneuve blanche soon he would be looking at evening too and suddenly he thought of conventicle but for an instant only and then no more because what could he say to conventicle or they to each other well flight captain bridesman tells me one of our battalions put their guns down this morning and climbed out of the trench and through the wire and met a similar unarmed german one until both sides could get a barrage down on them so all we need now is just to stand by until time to take that jerry general home and then conventicle yes sir so i heard and now he was looking at evening the aftermath of sun treading no shadow at all now to the petrol tin though almost at once he began to hurry a little remembering not the sidcott but the burning it had been more than twelve hours now since he left it in the tin and there might not be anything left of it but he was in time just the tin itself too hot to touch so that he kicked it over and tumbled the sidcott out which would have to cool a little too which it did not evening incrementing now but actual night itself almost summer night this time at home in may and in the latrine the tree once more was no longer green only the stink of the sidcott which had lasted he had wasted that concern dropping it into the sink where it unfolded as of its own accord into visibility into one last repudiationthe slow thick invincible smell of the burning itself visible now in creeping overlaps almost gone nowonly a beggars crumb but perhaps there had been an instant in the beginning when only a crumb of fire lay on the face of darkness and the falling waters and he moved again one of the cubicles had a wooden latch inside the door if you were there first and he was and latched the invisible door and drew the invisible pistol from his tunic pocket and thumbed the safety off again the room was lighted candelabrum sconce and girandole curtain and casement once more closed against the swarmdense citys unsleeping and anguished murmur again the old general looked like a gaudy toy in his blanched and glittering solitude just beginning to crumble the heel of bread into the waiting bowl as the smaller door opened and the youthful aide stood in it he is here the old general said yes sir the aide said let him come in the old general said then let nobody else yes sir the aide said and went out and closed the door and in a time opened it again the old general had not moved except to put quietly down beside the bowl the uncrumbled bread the aide entering and turning stiffly to attention beside the door as the quartermaster general entered and came on a pace or two and then stopped paused the aide going back out the door and drawing it to behind him the quartermaster general standing for a moment longerthe gaunt gigantic peasant with his sick face and his hungry and stricken eyes the two old men looking at one another for another moment then the quartermaster general partly raised one hand and dropped it and came on until he faced the table have you dined the old general said the other didnt even answer i know what happened he said i authorised it permitted it otherwise it couldnt have but i want you to tell me not admit confess affirm it tell me to my face that we did this yesterday afternoon a german general was brought across the lines and here to this house into this house yes the old general said but the other still waited inexorable we did it then the old general said then this morning an unarmed british battalion met an unarmed german force between the lines until artillery from both sides was able to destroy them both we did it then the old general said we did it the quartermaster general said we not british and american and french we against german them nor german they against american and british and french us but we against all because we no longer belong to us a subterfuge not of ours to confuse and mislead the enemy nor of the enemy to mislead and confuse us but of we to betray all since all has had to repudiate us in simple defensive horror no barrage by us or vice versa to prevent an enemy running over us with bayonets and hand grenades or vice versa but a barrage by both of we to prevent naked and weaponless hand touching opposite naked and weaponless hand we you and i and our whole unregenerate and unregenerable kind not only you and i and our tight close jealous unchallengeable hierarchy behind this wire and our opposite german one behind that one but more worse our whole small repudiated and homeless species about the earth who not only no longer belong to man but even to earth itself since we have had to make this last base desperate cast in order to hold our last desperate and precarious place on it sit down the old general said no the other said i was standing when i accepted this appointment i can stand to divest myself of it he thrust one big fleshless hand rapidly inside his tunic then out again though once more he stood just holding the folded paper in it looking down at the old general because i didnt just believe in you i loved you i believed from that first moment when i saw you in that gate that day fortyseven years ago that you had been destined to save us that you were chosen by destiny out of the paradox of your background to be a paradox to your past in order to be free of human past to be the one out of all earth to be free of the compulsions of fear and weakness and doubt which render the rest of us incapable of what you were competent for that you in your strength would even absolve us of our failure due to our weakness and fears i dont mean the men out there tonight this time the vast hand holding the folded paper made a single rapid clumsy gesture which indicated seemed to shape somehow in the brilliant insulate room the whole scope of the murmurous and anguished darkness outside and even as far away as the lines themselvesthe wire the ditches dense and for this time anyway silent with dormant guns and amazed and incredulous men waiting alerted confused and incredulous with hope they dont need you they are capable of saving themselves as three thousand of them proved four days ago they only needed to be defended protected from you not expected to be nor even hope to be just should have been except that we failed them not you this time who did not even what you would but what you must since you are you but i and my few kind who had rank enough and authority and position enough as if god himself had put this warrant in my hand that day against this one three years later until i failed them and him and brought it back his hand also jerked flicked and tossed the folded paper onto the desk in front of the bowl and jug and the still intact morsel on either side of which the old generals veined and mottled hands lay faintly curled at rest back to you by hand as i received it from you i will have no more of it i know by my own token i am too late in returning what i should never have accepted to begin with because even at first i would have known myself incapable of coping with what it was going to entail if i had only known then what that entailment was going to be i am responsible i am responsible mine is the blame and solely mine without me and this warrant which you gave me that day three years ago you could not have done this by this authority i could have prevented you then and even afterward i could have stopped it remanded it as youthe commanderinchief of all the allied armies in franceas quartermaster general over all embattled europe west of our and the british and the american wire i could have decreed that whole zone containing villeneuve blanche or arbitrarily any other point which you might have threatened at one hundred point one of saturation and forbidden whatever number of men it took to drive those lorries of blank antiaircraft shells to enter it and even at one hundred absolute of saturation and so forbidden that single supernumerary german one to come out of it but i didnt so i was responsible even more than you because you had no choice you didnt even do what you would but only what you could since you were incapable of else born and doomed incapable of else while i did have a choice between could and would between shall and must and cannot between must and dare not between will do and i am afraid to do had that choice and found myself afraid oh yes afraid but then why shouldnt i be afraid of you since you are afraid of man i am not afraid of man the old general said fear implies ignorance where ignorance is not you do not need to fear only respect i dont fear mans capacities i merely respect them and use them the quartermaster general said beware of them the old general said which fear them or not you should you someday will not i of course im an old man finished i had my chance and failed whowhatwants or needs me further now what midden or rubbish heap least of all that one beside the seine yonder with its gold hemisphere ravaged from across all of europe by a lesser one than you since he embroiled himself with all the armies of europe in order to lose a petty political empire where you have allied all the armies of both hemispheres and finally even the german one too to lose the world to man will you let me speak a moment the old general said of course the other said didnt i tell you i loved you once who can control that all you dare assume mandate over is oath contract you say they do not need me to save themselves from me and us since they themselves will save themselves if they are only let alone only defended and preserved that long from me and us how do you think we coped with this in time at time and placeat this particular moment in four whole years of moments at this particular point in that thousand kilometres of regimental fronts just by being alert not only alert at this specific spot and moment but prepared to cope and concentrate and nullify at this specific spot and moment with that which every trained soldier had been trained and taught to accept as a factor in war and battle as he must logistics and climate and failure of ammunition this in four long years of fateful and vulnerable moments and ten hundred kilometres of fateful and vulnerable spotsspots and moments fateful and vulnerable because as yet we have found nothing better to man them with than man how do you think we knew in time dont you know how who since you believe in mans capacities must certainly know them now the other had stopped immobile looming vast his sick and hungry face as though sick anew with foreknowledge and despair though his voice was quiet almost gentle how he said one of them told us one of his own squad one of his close and familiar ownas always as that or them or at least one among them for whom man sets in jeopardy what he believes to be his life and assumes to be his liberty or his honor always does his name was polchek he went on sick parade that sunday midnight and we should have known about it inside an hour except that apparently a traitor too by all means call him that if you like had to outface regimental tape so we might not have learned in time at all until too late the division commander being himself already an hour before dawn in a forward observation post where he likewise had no business being except for a lieutenant a blatant and unregenerate eccentric whose career very probably ended there also since he held the sanctity of his native soil above that of his divisional channels he will get a decoration of course but no more the utmost venerability of his beard can only expose that same lieutenants insigne who rang directly through to and insisted on speaking to someone in authority at his army headquarters that was how we knew had even that little time to nullify get in touch with the enemy and offer him too an alternate to chaos so i was right the other said you were afraid i respect him as an articulated creature capable of locomotion and vulnerable to selfinterest you were afraid the quartermaster general said who with two armies which had already been beaten once and a third one not yet blooded to where it was a calculable quantity had nevertheless managed to stalemate the most powerful and skillful and dedicated force in europe yet had had to call upon that enemy for help against the simple unified hope and dream of simple man no you are afraid and so i am well to be thats why i brought it back there it lies touch it put your hand on it or take my word for it that its real the same one not defiled since the defilement was mine who shirked it in the middle of a battle and a concomitant of your rank is the right and privilege to obliterate the human instrument of a failure but can you bring it back here to me the old general said mildly why not werent you the one who gave it to me but can you the old general said dare you ask me to grant you a favor let alone accept it from me this favor the old general said in that gentle and almost inflectionless voice a man is to die what the world will call the basest and most ignominious of deaths execution for cowardice while defending his nativeanyway adoptedland thats what the ignorant world will call it who will not know that he was murdered for that principle which by your own bitter selfscoriation you were incapable of risking death and honor for yet you dont demand that life you demand instead merely to be relieved of a commission a gesture a martyrdom does it match his he wont accept that life the other cried if he does and stopped amazed aghast foreknowing and despaired while the gentle voice went on if he does if he accepts his life keeps his life he will have abrogated his own gesture and martyrdom if i gave him his life tonight i myself could render null and void what you call the hope and the dream of his sacrifice by destroying his life tomorrow morning i will establish forever that he didnt even live in vain let alone die so now tell me whos afraid now the other began to turn slowly a little jerkily as though he were blind turning on until he faced the small door again and stopping not as though he saw it but as if he had located its position and direction by some other and lesser and less exact sense like smell the old general watching him until he had completely turned before he spoke youve forgotten your paper of course the other said so i have he turned back jerkily blinking rapidly his hand fumbled on the table top for a moment then it found the folded paper and put it back inside the tunic and he stood again blinking rapidly yes he said so i did then he turned again a little stiffly still but moving almost quickly now directly anyhow and went on across the blanched rug toward the door at once it opened and the aide entered carrying the door with him and already turning into rigid attention holding it while the quartermaster general walked toward it a little stiffly and awkwardly too big too gaunt too alien then stopped and halfturned his head and said goodbye goodbye the old general said the other went on to the door now almost into it beginning to bow his head a little as though from long habit already too tall for most doors stopping almost in the door now his head still bowed a little even after he turned it not quite toward where the old general sat immobile and gaudy as a childs toy behind the untouched bowl and jug and the still uncrumbled bread and something else the quartermaster general said to say something else with god the old general said of course the quartermaster general said that was it i almost said it the door clashed open the sergeant with his slung rifle entered first followed by a private carrying his unslung one unbelievably long now with the fixed bayonet like a hunter dodging through a gap in a fence they took position one on either side of the door the thirteen prisoners turning their thirteen heads as one to watch quietly while two more men carried in a long wooden benchattached mess table and set it in the center of the cell and went back out going to fatten us up first huh one of the prisoners said the sergeant didnt answer he was now working at his front teeth with a gold toothpick if the next thing they bring is a tablecloth the third will be a priest another prisoner said but he was wrong although the number of casseroles and pots and dishes including a small caldron obviously soup which did come next followed by a third man carrying a whole basket of bottles and a jumble of utensils and cutlery was almost as unnerving the sergeant speaking now though still around past the toothpick hold it now at least let them get their hands and arms out of the way though the prisoners had really not moved yet to rush upon the table the food it was merely a shift semicircular poised while the third orderly set the wine there were seven bottles on the table and then began to place the cups vessels whatever anyone wanted to call themtin cups pannikins from mess kits two or three cracked tumblers two flagons contrived by bisecting laterally one canteen dont apologise garçon the wit said just so its got a bottom at one end and a hole at the other then the one who had brought the wine scuttled back to the door after the two others and out of it the private with the bayonet dodged his sevenfootlong implement through it again and turned holding the door half closed for the sergeant all right you bastards the sergeant said be pigs speak for yourself maître the wit said if we must dine in stink we prefer it to be our own then suddenly in unpremeditated concert as though they had not even planned it or instigated it they had not even been warned of it but instead had been overtaken from behind by it like wind they had all turned on the sergeant or perhaps not even the sergeant the human guards but just the rifles and the bayonets and the steel lockable door not moving rushing toward them but just yelling at thema sound hoarse loud without language not of threat or indictment either just a hoarse concerted affirmation of invincible repudiation which continued for another moment or so even after the sergeant had passed through the door and it had clashed shut again then they stopped yet they still didnt rush at the table still hovering semicircular almost diffidently merely enclosing it their noses trembling questing like those of rabbits at the odors from it grimed filthy reeking still of the front lines and uncertainty and perhaps despair unshaven faces not alarming nor even embittered but harassedfaces of men who had already borne not only more than they expected but than they believed they could and who knew that it was still not over andwith a sort of amazement even terrorthat no matter how much more there would be they would still bear that too come on corp a voice said lets go ok the corporal said watch it now but still there was no stampede rush it was just a crowding a concentration a jostling itself almost inattentive not of famishment hunger but rather of the watchful noncommittance of people stillso far at leastkeeping pace with holding their own still within the fringe of a fading fairytale the cursing itself inattentive and impersonal not eager just pressed as they crowded in onto both the fixed benches five on one side and six on the other facing them until the twelfth man dragged up the cells one stool to the head of the table for the corporal and then himself took the remaining place at the foot end of the unfilled bench like the vice to the chair in a dickensian taverns back rooma squat powerful weathered man with the blue eyes and reddish hair and beard of a breton fisherman captain say of his own small tough and dauntless boatladen doubtless with contraband the corporal filled the bowls while they passed them hand to hand but still there was no voracity a leashed quality but even almost unimpatient as they sat holding each his upended unsoiled spoon like a boatcrew or a parade this looks bad one said its worse another said its serious its a reprieve a third said somebody besides a garage mechanic cooked this so if they went to all that trouble a third began hold it the breton said the man opposite him was short and very dark his jaw wrenched by an old healed wound he was saying something rapidly in an almost unintelligible mediterranean dialectmidi or perhaps basque they looked at one another suddenly still another spoke he looked like a scholar almost like a professor he wants someone to say grace he said the corporal looked at the midian say it then again the other said something rapid and incomprehensible again the one who resembled a scholar translated he says he doesnt know one does anybody know one the corporal said again they looked at one another then one said to the fourth one youve been to school say one maybe he went too fast and passed it another said say it then the corporal said to the fourth one the other said rapidly benedictus benedicte benedictissimus will that do will that do luluque the corporal said to the midian yes yes the midian said they began to eat now the breton lifted one of the bottles slightly toward the corporal okay he said okay the corporal said six other hands took up the other bottles they ate and poured and passed the bottles too a reprieve the third said they wouldnt dare execute us until we have finished eating this cooking our whole nation would rise at that insult to what we consider the first of the arts hows this for an idea we stagger this eat one at a time one man to each hour thirteen hours well still be alive at almost noon tomorrow when theyll serve us another meal another said and well stagger that one into dinner and then stagger dinner on through tomorrow night and in the end eat ourselves into old age when we cant eat anymore let them shoot us then who cares the third said no that bastard sergeant will be in here with his firing squad right after the coffee you watch not that quick the first said you have forgot what we consider the first of the virtues too thrift they will wait until we have digested this and defecated it what will they want with that the fourth said fertiliser the first said imagine that corner that gardenplot manured with the concentrate of this meal the manure of traitors the fourth said he had the dreamy and furious face of a martyr in that case wouldnt the maize the bean the potato grow upside down or anyway hide its head even if it couldnt bury it the second said stop it the corporal said or more than just the corner of a plot the third said the carrion well bequeath france tomorrow stop it the corporal said christ assoil us the fourth said aiyiyi the third said we can call on him then he need not fear cadavers do you want me to make them shut up corp the breton said come on now the corporal said eat youll spend the rest of the night wishing you did have something to clap your jaws on save the philosophy for then the wit too the third said then we will starve the first said or indigest the third said if much of what weve heard tonight is wit come on now the corporal said ive told you twice do you want your bellies to say youve had enough or that sergeant to come back in and say youve finished so they ate again except the man on the corporals left who once more stopped his laden knife blade halfway to his mouth polcheks not eating he said suddenly hes not even drinking whats the matter polchek afraid yours wont produce anything but nettles and you wont make it to the latrine in time and well have to sleep in them the man addressed was on the corporals immediate right he had a knowing almost handsome metropolitan or possibly banlieu face bold but not at all arrogant masked composed and only when you caught his eyes unawares did you realise how alert a day of rest at chaulnesmont wasnt the right pill for that belly of his maybe the first said the sergeantmajors coup de grâce tomorrow morning will be though the fourth said maybe itll cure all of you of having to run a fever over what i dont eat and drink polchek said whats the matter the corporal said to him you went on sick parade sunday night before we came out havent you got over it yet so what polchek said is it an issue i had a bad belly sunday night ive still got it but its still mine i was just sitting here with it not worrying half as much about what i dont put in it as some innocent bystanders do because i dont do you want to make an issue of it the fourth said bang on the door the corporal said to the breton tell the sergeant we want to report a sick man whos making an issue of it now polchek said to the corporal before the breton could move he picked up his filled glass come on he said to the corporal no heel taps if my belly dont like wine tonight as jean says that sergeantmajors pistol will pump it all out tomorrow morning he said to all of them come on to peace havent we finally got what weve all been working for for four years now come on up with them he said louder and sharply with something momentary and almost fierce in his voice face look at once the same excitement restrained fierceness seemed to pass through all of them they raised their glasses too except onethe fourth one of the mountain faces not quite as tall as the others and with something momentary and anguished in it almost like despair who suddenly half raised his glass and stopped it and did not drink when the others did and banged the bizarre and incongruous vessels down and reached for the bottles again as preceded by the sound of the heavy boots the door clashed open again and the sergeant and his private entered he now held an unfolded paper in his hand polchek he said for a second polchek didnt stir then the man who had not drunk gave a convulsive start and although he arrested it at once when polchek stood quietly up they both for a moment were in motion so that the sergeant about to address polchek again paused and looked from one to the other well the sergeant said which dont you even know who you are nobody answered as one the others except polchek were looking at the man who had not drunk you the sergeant said to the corporal dont you know your own men this is polchek the corporal said indicating polchek then whats wrong with him the sergeant said he said to the other man whats your name i the man said again he glanced rapidly about at nothing no one anguished and despairing his name is the corporal said ive got his papers he reached inside his tunic and produced a soiled dogeared paper obviously a regimental posting order pierre bouc he rattled off a number theres no bouc on this list the sergeant said whats he doing here you tell me the corporal said he got mixed in with us somehow monday morning none of us know any pierre bouc either why didnt he say something before this who would have listened the corporal said is that right the sergeant said to the man you dont belong in this squad the man didnt answer tell him the corporal said no the man whispered then he said loudly no he blundered up i dont know them he said blundering stumbling halffalling backward over the bench almost as though in flight until the sergeant checked him the major will have to settle this the sergeant said give me that order the corporal passed it to him out with you the sergeant said both of you now those inside the room could see beyond the door another file of armed men apparently a new one waiting the two prisoners passed on through the door and into it the sergeant then the orderly following the iron door clashed behind them against that room and all it contained signified portended beyond it polchek didnt even lower his voice they promised me brandy where is it shut up the sergeants voice said youll get whats coming to you no bloody fear id better polchek said if i dont i might know what to do about it ive told him once the sergeants voice said if he dont shut up this time shut him up with pleasure sergeant another voice said can do take them on the sergeants voice said though before the iron clash of the door had ceased the corporal was already speaking not loud just prompt still mild not peremptory just firm eat the same man essayed to speak again but again the corporal forestalled him eat he said next time he will take it out but they were spared that the door opened almost immediately but this time it was only the sergeant alone the eleven heads which remained turning as one to look at him where he faced the corporal down the length of the littered table you the sergeant said me the corporal said yes the sergeant said still the corporal didnt move he said again you mean me yes the sergeant said come on the corporal rose then he gave one rapid look about at the ten faces now turning from the sergeant to look at himfaces dirty unshaven strained which had slept too little in too long harassed but absolute one in whatever it wasnot trust exactly not dependence perhaps just oneness singleness youre in charge paul he said to the breton right the breton said till you get back but this time the corridor was empty it was the sergeant himself who closed the door behind them and turned the heavy key and pocketed it there was no one in sight at all where hethe corporalhad expected to find armed men bristling until they in the white glittering room in the hôtel de ville sent for them for the last time then the sergeant turned from the door and now hethe corporalrealised that they were even hurrying a little not at all furtive nor even surreptitious just expedite walking rapidly back up the corridor which he had already traversed three timesonce yesterday morning when the guards had brought them from the lorry to the cell and twice last night when the guards had taken them to the hôtel de ville and brought them back theirhis and the sergeantsheavy boots not ringing because so recent the factorywhen it had been a factorywas these were not stone but brick but making instead a dull and heavy sound seeming only the louder because there were only four now instead of twentysix plus the guards so to him it was as though there was no other way out of it save that one exit no destination to go to in it except on so that he had already begun to pass the small arch with its locked iron gate when the sergeant checked and turned him nor any other life in or near it so that he didnt even recognise the silhouette of the helmet and the rifle until the man was in the act of unlocking the gate from the outside and swinging it back for them to pass through nor did he see the car at once the sergeant not quite touching him just keeping him at that same pace rapidity as though by simple juxtaposition on through the gate into an alley a blank wall opposite and at the curbedge the big dark motionless car which he had not noticed yet because of the silencenot the subterrene and cavernous emptiness in which their boots had echoed a moment back but a culdesac of it himself and the sergeant and the two sentriesthe one who had unlocked the gate for them and then locked it after them and his opposite flanking the other side of the gatenot even at parade rest but at ease their rifles grounded immobile and remote as though oblivious to that to which they in their turn were invisible the four of them set down in a vacuum of silence within the citys distant and indefatigable murmur then he saw the car he didnt stop it was barely a falter the sergeants shoulder barely nudged him before he went on the driver didnt even move to descend it was the sergeant who opened the door the shoulder a hand too now firm and urgent against his back because he had stopped now erect immobile and immovable even after the voice inside the car said get in my child then immovable for another second yet before he stooped and entered it seeing as he did so the pallid glint of braid a single plane of face above the dark enveloping cloak then the sergeant shut the door the car already in motion and that was all only the three of them the old man who bore far too much rank to carry a lethal weapon even if he were not already too old to use it and the driver whose hands were full with managing the car even if he had not had his back to him who could not remember in four days anyhow when there had not been one arm or two but from twenty to a thousand already cocked and triggered for his life out of the alley and still no worddirection or commandfrom the old man in the braided invincible hat and the nightcolored cloak in the corner opposite him not back to the city but skirting through the fringe of it faster and faster pacing its cavernous echoes through the narrow ways of the deserted purlieus taking the rapid turnings as if the mechanism itself knew their destination making a long concentric through the citys edge the ground rising now so that even he began to know where they were probably going the city itself beginning to tilt toward them as it sank away beneath nor any word from the old man this time either the car just stopped and looking past the fine and delicate profile beneath what should have been the insuperable weight of the barred and braided hat he could see not the place de ville itself they were not that high above the city yet but rather as though the concentration of its unwearyable and sleepless anxiety had taken on the glow and glare of light now my child the old general said not to him this time but to the driver the car went on and now he did know where they were going because there was nothing else up here but the old roman citadel but if he felt any first shock of instinctive and purely physical terror he didnt show it and if at the same instant reason was also telling him nonsense to execute you secretly in a dungeon would undo the very thing which they stopped the war and brought all thirteen of you here to accomplish nobody heard that either he just sat there erect a little stiffly who never had sat completely back in the seat alert but quite calm rapid watchful and composed the car in second gear now but still going fast around the final convoluted hairpin turns until at last the stone weight of the citadel itself seemed to lean down and rest upon them like a ponderable shadow the car making the last renversement because now it could go no further stopping at last and not he nor the driver but the old general himself who opened the door and got out and held the door until he was out and erect again and had begun to turn his head to look until the old general said no not yet and turned on himself he following up the final steep and rocky pitch where they would have to walk the old citadel not looming above them but squatting not gothic but roman not soaring to the stars out of the aspiration of mans past but a gesture against them of his mortality like a clenched fist or a shield now turn and look at it the old general said but he already had wasdown the declivitys black pitch to where the city lay trembling and myriad with lights in its bowl of night like a scatter of smoldering autumn leaves in the windy darkness thicker and denser than the stars in its concentration of anguish and unrepose as if all of darkness and terror had poured down in one wash one wave to lie palpitant and unassuageable in the place de ville look at it listen to it remember it a moment then close the window on it disregard that anguish you caused them to fear and suffer but tomorrow you will have discharged them of both and they will only hate you once for the rage they owe you for giving them the terror once for the gratitude they will owe you for taking it away and once for the fact that you are beyond the range of either so close the window on that and be yourself discharged now look beyond it the earth or half of it full half the earth as far as horizon bounds it it is dark of course but only dark from here its darkness is only that anonymity which a man can close behind him like a curtain on his past not even when he must in his desperation but when he will for his comfort and simple privacy of course he can go only in one direction in it now west only one hemisphere of itthe westernis available to him now but that is large enough for his privacy for a year because this condition will only last another year then all earth will be free to him they will ask for a formal meeting for terms sometime this winter by next year we will even have what we will call peacefor a little while not we will request it they willthe germans the best soldiers on earth today or in two thousand years for that matter since even the romans could not conquer themthe one people out of all the earth who have a passion and dedication not even for glory but for war who make war not even for conquest and aggrandisement but as an occupation an avocation and who will lose this one for that very reason that they are the best soldiers on earth not we french and british who accept war only as a last gambit when everything else has failed and even enter that final one with no confidence in it either but they the germans who have not receded one foot since they crossed the belgian frontier almost four years ago and every decision since has been either nil or theirs and who will not stop now even though they themselves know that one more victory will destroy them who will win perhaps two or even three more the number will not matter and then will have to surrender because the phenomenon of war is its hermaphroditism the principles of victory and of defeat inhabit the same body and the necessary opponent enemy is merely the bed they selfexhaust each other on a vice only the more terrible and fatal because there is no intervening breast or division between to frustrate them into health by simple normal distance and lack of opportunity for the copulation from which even orgasm cannot free them the most expensive and fatal vice which man has invented yet to which the normal ones of lechery and drink and gambling which man fatuously believes are capable of destroying him stand as does the childs lollypop to the bottle the courtesan and the playingcard a vice so long ingrained in man as to have become an honorable tenet of his behavior and the national altar for his love of bloodshed and glorious sacrifice more than that even a pillar not of his nations supremacy but of his national survival you and i have seen war as the last resort of politics i shant of course but you willcansee it become the last refuge from bankruptcy you willcan provided you willsee the day when a nation insolvent from overpopulation will declare war on whatever richest and most sentimental opponent it can persuade to defeat it quickest in order to feed its people out of the conquerors quartermaster stores but that is not our problem today and even if it were by simply being in alliance with the ultimate victor wefrance and britainwould find ourselves in the happy situation of gaining almost as much from our victory as the german will through his defeat ourcall it mine if you likeproblem is more immediate there is the earth you will have half of it now by new years you will very probably have all of it all the vast scope of it except this minuscule suppuration which men call europeand who knows in time and with a little discretion and care even that again if you like take my caryou can drive one cant you yes the corporal said go now the old general said take my car if you can drive at all the pennon on its bonnet will carry you anywhere in europe west of the german wire if you can drive well the engine beneath it will take you to the coastbrest or marseilles eitherin two days i have papers ready to pass you aboard any ship you choose there and command its captain then south americaasiathe pacific islands close that window fast lock it forever on that aberrant and futile dream no no he said quickly dont for one second suspect me of that base misreading of your characteryou who in five minutes monday voided that war which the german himself the best soldier in europe in almost four years has never quite nudged from stalemate of course you will have money but only that balance exactly matched to freedom as the eagle or the bandit carry theirs i dont bribe you with money i give you liberty to desert them the corporal said desert whom look again his hand appeared in a brief rapid gesture toward the wan city unsleeping below thema gesture not even contemptuous not anything just a flick then gone already vanished again within the midnightcolored cloak not them where have they been since monday why with their bare hands since they have enough of them have they not torn down brick by brick the walls which far fewer hands than theirs sufficed to raise or torn from its hinges that one door which only one hand sufficed to lock and set all of you free who had essayed to die for them where are the two thousand nine hundred and eightyseven others you hador thought you hadat dawn monday why as soon as you were through the wire didnt all of them cast down their arms too and simply follow you if they too believed you were all weaponed and bucklered out of the arsenal of invulnerable human aspiration and hope and belief why didnt even that mere three thousand thenthey would have been enougherase the bricks and wrench away that door who believed in you for five minutes anyway enough to risk what you anyway knew you riskedthe three thousand that is lacking the twelve who have been locked inside the same incommunicant bricks with you ever since where are they even one of them your own countryman blood brother kinsman probably since you were all blood kin at some time thereone zsettlani who has denied you and the other whether zsettlani or not or blood kin or not at least wasor anyway had been accepted intothe brotherhood of your faith and hopepolchek who had already betrayed you by midnight sunday do you see you even have a substitute to your need as on that afternoon god produced the lamb which saved isaacif you could call polchek a lamb i will take polchek tomorrow execute him with rote and fanfare you will not only have your revenge and discharge the vengeance of the rest of those three thousand whom he betrayed you will repossess the opprobrium from all that voice down there which cannot even go to bed because of the frantic need to anathemise you give me polchek and take freedom there are still ten the corporal said lets try it we will remain here i will send the car back with orders to unlock and open that door and then for every man in that building to vanish from it oblivious of all to which they themselves will be invisiblequietly unlock that door unlock that gate and vanish how long before that ten will have denied you toobetrayed you too if you can call that choice betrayal and you see too the corporal said in ten minutes there would not be ten but a hundred in ten hours there would not be ten hundred but ten thousand and in ten days yes the old general said i have seen that have i not said i dont so basely misread your character oh yes let us say it your threat why else have i offered to buy myoursecurity with things which most men not only do not want but on the contrary do well to fear and flee from like liberty and freedom oh yes i can destroy you tomorrow morning and save usfor the time for the length of my life in fact but only for the time and if i must i will because i believe in man within his capacities and limitations i not only believe he is capable of enduring and will endure but that he must endure at least until he himself invents evolves produces a better tool than he to substitute for himself take my car and freedom and i will give you polchek take the highest of all the ecstasies compassion pity the orgasm of forgiving him who barely escaped doing you a mortal hurtthat glue that catalyst which your philosophers have trained you to believe holds the earth together take the earth there are still ten the corporal said have i forgotten them the old general said have i not said twice that i have never misread you you dont need to threaten me i know that they not you are the problem not you but they are what we are bargaining for because for your profit i must destroy all eleven of you and so compound tenfold the value of your threat and sacrifice for my profit i must let them go too to be witnesses to all the earth that you forsook them for talk as much and as loudly and as long as they will who to believe in the valuevalue validityof the faith they preach when you its prophet and instigator elected your liberty to its martyrdom no no we are not two greek or armenian or jewishor for that matter normanpeasants swapping a horse we are two articulations selfelected possibly anyway elected anyway postulated not so much to defend as to test two inimical conditions which through no fault of ours but through the simple paucity and restrictions of the arena where they meet must contend andone of themperish i champion of this mundane earth which whether i like it or not is and to which i did not ask to come yet since i am here not only must stop but intend to stop during my allotted while you champion of an esoteric realm of mans baseless hopes and his infinite capacityno passionfor unfact no they are not inimical really there is no contest actually they can even exist side by side together in this one restricted arena and could and would had yours not interfered with mine so once more take the earth now answer as i know you will there are still ten there are still that ten the corporal said then take the world the old general said i will acknowledge you as my son together we will close the window on this aberration and lock it forever then i will open another for you on a world such as caesar nor sultan nor khalif ever saw tiberius nor kubla nor all the emperors of the east ever dreamed ofno rome and baiae mere depot for the rapine of ravagers and bagnio for one last exhaustion of the nerveends before returning to their gloomy deserts to wrest more of the one or face at home the hired knives of their immediate underlings thirsting to cure them of the need for both no cathay chimaera of poets bearing the same relation to the reality of attainment as the mahometans paradisea symbol of his escape and a justification of its need from the stinking alleys or fierce sand of his inescapable cradle nor kublas xanadu which was not even a poets rounded and completed dream but a drugsodden english ones lightningbolt which electrocuted him with the splendor he could not even face long enough to describe it downnone of these which were but random and momentary constellations in the empyrean of the worlds history but paris which is the world as empyrean is the sum of its constellationsnot that paris in which any man can have all of theserome cathay and xanaduprovided he is connected a little and does not need to count his money because you do not want these have i not said twice now that i have not misread you but that paris which only my son can inherit from methat paris which i did not at all reject at seventeen but simply held in abeyance for compounding against the day when i should be a father to bequeath it to an heir worthy of that vast and that terrible heritage a fate a destiny in it mine and yours one and inextricable power matchless and immeasurable oh no i have not misread youi already born heir to that power as it stood then holding that inheritance in escrow to become unchallenged and unchallengeable chief of that confederation which would defeat and subjugate and so destroy the only factor on earth which threatened it you with the power and gift to persuade three thousand men to accept a sure and immediate death in preference to a problematical one based on tried mathematical percentage when you had at most only a division of fifteen thousand to work on and your empty hands to work with what can you notwill you notdo with all the world to work on and the heritage i can give you to work with a king an emperor retaining his light and untensile hold on mankind only until another appears capable of giving them more and bloodier circuses and more and sweeter bread bah you will be god holding him forever through a far far stronger ingredient than his simple lusts and appetites by his triumphant and ineradicable folly his deathless passion for being led mystified and deceived so we allyconfederate the corporal said are you that afraid of me i already respect you i dont need to fear you i can do without you i shall i intend to of course in that case you will not see itand how sad that commentary that one last bitterest pill of martyrdom without which the martyrdom itself could not be since then it would not be martyrdom even if by some incredible if you shall have been right you will not even know itand paradox only the act of voluntarily relinquishing the privilege of ever knowing you were right can possibly make you righti know dont say it if i can do without you then so can you yourself to me your death is but an ace to be finessed while to you it is the actual ace of trumps nor this either i mentioned the word bribe once now i have offered it i am an old man you a young one i will be dead in a few years and you can use your inheritance to win the trick tomorrow which today my deuce finessed you of because i will take that risk too dont even say and stopped and raised the hand quickly this time from inside the cloak and said wait dont say it yetthen take life and think well before you answer that because the purse is empty now only one thing else remains in it take life you are young even after four years of war the young can still believe in their own invulnerability that all else may die but not they so they dont need to treasure life too highly since they cannot conceive accept the possible end of it but in time you become old you see death then then you realise that nothingnothingnothingnot power nor glory nor wealth nor pleasure nor even freedom from pain is as valuable as simple breathing simply being alive even with all the regret of having to remember and the anguish of an irreparable wornout body merely knowing that you are alivelisten to this it happened in america at a remote place called by an indian name i think mississippi a man who had committed a brutal murder for some base reasongain or revenge perhaps or perhaps simply to free himself of one woman in order to espouse another it doesnt matterwho went to his trial still crying his innocence and was convicted and sentenced still crying it and even in the death cell beneath the gallows still crying it until a priest came to him not the first time of course nor the second nor perhaps even the third but presently and in time the murderer at last confessing his crime against man and so making his peace with god until presently it was almost as though the murderer and the priest had exchanged places and offices not the priest now but the murderer the strong one the calm one the strong calm steadfast rock not even of tremulous hope but of conviction and unshakable faith on which the priest himself could now lean for strength and courage this right up to the very morning of the execution toward which the murderer now looked with a sort of impatience almost as though actually fretting a little for the moment when he could doff the sorry ephemeral world which had brought him to this and demanded this expiation and accepted his forgiveness right up to the gallows itself which at mississippi i understand is outofdoors in the yard of the jail enclosed temporarily in a high stockade of planks to shield the principals departure from earth from the merely morbid and curious anyway though they would come in their carts and carriages for miles bringing box lunches men women children and grandparents to stand along the tall fence until the bell clock whatever it was to mark the passing of the soul struck and released them to go back home indeed able to see even less than the man who stood beneath the noose already free this whole week now of that sorry and mortal body which was the sorry all which penance could rob him of standing calm composed and at peace the trivial noose already fitted to his neck and in his vision one last segment of the sky beyond which his theology had taught him he would presently be translated and one single branch of an adjacent tree extending over the stockade as though in benison one last gesture of earths absolution with which he had long since severed any frail remaining thread when suddenly a bird flew onto that bough and stopped and opened its tiny throat and sangwhereupon he who less than a second before had his very foot lifted to step from earths grief and anguish into eternal peace cast away heaven salvation immortal soul and all struggling to free his bound hands in order to snatch away the noose crying innocent innocent i didnt do it even as the trap earth world and all fell from under himall because of one bird one weightless and ephemeral creature which hawk might stoop at or snare or lime or random pellet of some idle boy destroy before the sun setexcept that tomorrow next year there would be another bird another spring the same bough leafed again and another bird to sing on it if he is only here to hear it can only remaindo you follow me yes the corporal said then take that bird recant confess say you were wrong that what you led wasled you led nothing you simply participatedan attack which failed to advance take life from me ask mercy and accept it i can give it even for a military failure the general commanding your division willhe already hasdemand a sacrifice not in the name of france or of victory but in that of his blemished record but its not he its i who wear this hat there are still ten the corporal said who will hate youuntil they forget you who will even curse you until they have forgot whom they cursed and why no no close the window upon that baseless dream open this other one perhaps you willcansee nothing but gray beyond itexcept for that bough always that one single bough which will be there always waiting and ready for that weightless and ephemeral burden take that bird dont be afraid the corporal said theres nothing to be afraid of nothing worth it for a moment the old general didnt seem to have heard the corporal at all standing a head below the others high mountain one beneath the seemingly insuperable weight of the blueandscarlet hat crossbarred and dappled with gold braid and heavy golden leaves then he said afraid no no its not i but you who are afraid of man not i but you who believe that nothing but a death can save him i know better i know that he has that in him which will enable him to outlast even his wars that in him more durable than all his vices even that last and most fearsome one to outlast even this next avatar of his servitude which he now faces his enslavement to the demonic progeny of his own mechanical curiosity from which he will emancipate himself by that one ancient tried and true method by which slaves have always freed themselves by inculcating their masters with the slaves own vicesin this case the vice of war and that other one which is no vice at all but instead is the qualitymark and warrant of mans immortality his invincible and deathless folly he has already begun to put wheels under his patio his terrace and his front veranda even at my age i may see the day when what was once his house has become a storageplace for his bed and stove and razor and spare clothing you with your youth could remember that bird see the day when he will have invented his own private climate and moved it stove bathroom bed clothing kitchen and all into his automobile and what he once called home will have vanished from human lexicon so that he wont dismount from his automobile at all because he wont need to the entire earth one unbroken machined demountained disrivered expanse of concrete paving protuberanceless by tree or bush or house or anything which might constitute a corner or a threat to visibility and man in his terrapin myriads enclosed clothesless from birth in his individual wheeled and glovelike envelope with pipes and hoses leading upward from underground reservoirs to charge him with one composite squirt which at one mutual instant will fuel his mobility pander his lusts sate his appetites and fire his dreams peripatetic unceasing and long since no longer countable to die at last at the click of an automatic circuitbreaker on a speedometer dial and long since freed of bone and organ and gut leaving nothing for communal scavenging but a rusting and odorless shellthe shell which he does not get out of because he does not need to but which presently for a time he will not emerge from because he does not dare because the shell will be his only protection from the haillike iron refuse from his wars because by that time his wars will have dispossessed him by simple outdistance his simple frail physique will be no longer able to keep up bear them attend them be present he will try of course and for a little while he will even hold his own he will build tanks bigger and faster and more impervious and with more firepower than any before he will build aircraft bigger and faster and capable of more load and more destruction than any yet for a little while he will accompany direct as he thinks control them even after he has finally realised that it is not another frail and mortal dissident to his politics or his notions of national boundaries that he is contending with but the very monster itself which he inhabits it will not be someone firing bullets at him who for the moment doesnt like him it will be his own frankenstein which roasts him alive with heat asphyxiates him with speed wrenches loose his still livingentrails in the ferocity of its preyseeking stoop so he will not be able to go along with it at all though for a little while longer it will permit him the harmless delusion that he controls it from the ground with buttons then that will be gone too years decades then centuries will have elapsed since it last answered his voice he will have even forgotten the very location of its breedinggrounds and his last contact with it will be a day when he will crawl shivering out of his cooling burrow to crouch among the delicate stalks of his dead antennae like a fairy geometry beneath a clangorous rain of dials and meters and switches and bloodless fragments of metal epidermis to watch the final two of them engaged in the last gigantic wrestling against the final and dying sky robbed even of darkness and filled with the inflectionless uproar of the two mechanical voices bellowing at each other polysyllabic and verbless patriotic nonsense oh yes he will survive it because he has that in him which will endure even beyond the ultimate worthless tideless rock freezing slowly in the last red and heatless sunset because already the next star in the blue immensity of space will be already clamorous with the uproar of his debarkation his puny and inexhaustible and immortal voice still talking still planning and there too after the last ding dong of doom has rung and died there will still be one sound more his voice planning still to build something higher and faster and louder more efficient and louder and faster than ever before yet it too inherent with the same old primordial fault since it too in the end will fail to eradicate him from the earth i dont fear man i do better i respect and admire him and pride i am ten times prouder of that immortality which he does possess than ever he of that heavenly one of his delusion because man and his folly will endure the corporal said they will do more the old general said proudly they will prevailshall we return they went back to the waiting car and descended they traversed once more the echoing and empty warrens concentric about the distant crowded place de ville then the alley again the car slowing and stopping once more opposite the small locked gate in front of which above a struggling group of five men the bayoneted rifles of four of them waved and jerked like furious exclamations the corporal looked once at the struggling group and said quietly there are eleven now there are eleven now the old general said as quietly again one arresting gesture of the fine and delicate hand from beneath the cloak wait let us watch this a moment a man freed of it now apparently trying to fight his way back into what for all he knows will be his death cell so they sat for a moment yet watching the fifth man the same one who two hours ago had been taken from the cell by the same guards who came for polchek straining stocky and furious in the hands of his four captors apparently not away from the small gate but toward it until the old general got out of the car the corporal following and said not raising his voice yet either whats wrong here sergeant the group paused in their straining attitudes the prisoner looked back then he wrenched free and turned and ran across the pavement toward the old general and the corporal the four captors following grasping him again stand still you the sergeant hissed attention his name is pierre bouc he didnt belong in that squad at all though we didnt discover the mistake until one of them he glanced at the corporal youcondescended to produce his regimental order we found him trying to get back in he denied his name he wouldnt even produce the order until we took it away from him holding the short and furious man with one hand he produced the dogeared paper from his pocket immediately the prisoner snatched it from him you lie he said to the sergeant before they could prevent him he ripped the order to shreds and whirled and flung the shreds in the old generals face you lie he shouted at the old general while the bursting gout drifted like a confetti of windless and weightless snow or feathers about the golden and invincible hat the calm incurious inscrutable face which had looked at everything and believed none of it you lie the man shouted again my name is not pierre bouc i am piotr adding something in a harsh almost musical middleeastern tongue so full of consonants as to be almost unintelligible then he turned to the corporal going rapidly onto his knees grasping the corporals hand and saying something else in the incomprehensible tongue to which the corporal answered in it though the man still crouched clinging to the corporals hand the corporal speaking again in the tongue as if he had repeated himself but with a different object noun perhaps and then a third time a third slight alteration in its construction or context or direction at which the man moved rose and stood now rigid at attention facing the corporal who spoke again and the man turned a smart military quarterturn the four captors moving quickly in again until the corporal said in french you dont need to hold him just unlock the gate but still the old general didnt move motionless within the cloaks dark volume composed calm not even bemused just inscrutable saying presently in that voice not even recapitulant not anything forgive me i didnt know what i was doing and you said be a man but no move then you said be a zsettlani and no move then you said be a soldier and he became one then he turned and got back into the car the soft voluminous smother of the coat becoming motionless again about him in the corner of the seat the sergeant came rapidly back across the pavement and stood again just behind the corporals shoulder now the old general himself spoke in the rapid unvoweled tongue and became one no returned to one good night my child goodbye father the corporal answered him not goodbye the old general said i am durable too i dont give up easily either remember whose blood it is that you defy me with then in french to the driver let us go home now the car went on then he and the sergeant turned together the sergeant once more at and just behind his shoulder not touching him back to the iron gate which one of the sentries held open for them to pass through and then closed and locked again so grooved and locked in old assumption he had begun to turn down the corridor toward the cell when the sergeant once more checked and turned him this time into a passage only wide enough for one and barely tall enough for anya oneway secret duct leading as though into the very bowels of incarceration the sergeant unlocked a solid door this time and closed it between himself and the corporal upon a cell indeed this time little larger than a big closet containing one endless manwidth wooden bench for sleeping and an iron bucket for latrine and two men all bathed in one fierce glare of light one of them did have the swaggering face this time reckless and sardonic incorrigible and debonair even to the thin moustache he even wore the filthy beret and the knotted handkerchief about his throat even the limp dead cigarette in the corner of his mouth his hands in his pockets and one foot crossed negligently over the other as he had leaned against the wall of his narrow montmartre alley the other shorter man standing beside him with the peaceful and patient fidelity of a blind doga squat simianlike man whose tremendous empty and peaceful hands hung almost to his knees as if they were attached to strings inside his sleeves with a small quite round simian head and a doughy face itself like one single feature drooling a little at the mouth pray to enter the first said so they tapped you for it did they call me lapin anybody in the prêfecture will validate it without removing his hand from the pocket he indicated the man beside him with a nudge of his elbow this is cassetêtehorse for short were on our way to town hey horse the second man made a single hoarse indistinguishable sound hear that the first said he can say paris as good as anybody tell him again unclewhere were going tomorrow again the other made the thick wet sound it was quite true the corporal could recognise it now whats he doing in that uniform the corporal said ah the sons of bitches scared him the first said i dont mean germans either you dont mean they are going to be satisfied to shoot just one of you out of that whole regiment i dont know the corporal said he hasnt always been like this got a fag the other said im out the corporal produced a pack of cigarettes the other spat the stub from his mouth without even moving his head and took one from the pack thanks the corporal produced a lighter thanks the other said he took the lighter and snapped it on and lit the cigarette alreadyor stilltalking the cigarette bobbing his arms now crossed in front of him each hand grasping lightly the opposite elbow what was that you said has he always been like this naah a few flies upstairs but he was all right untilwhat the corporal stood facing him his hand extended the lighter the corporal said i beg pardon my lighter the corporal said they looked at one another lapin made a slight motion with his wrists and upturned his empty palms the corporal faced him his hand extended jesus the other said dont break my heart dont tell me you even saw what i did with it if you did then they are right they just waited one day too late he made another rapid movement with one hand when it opened again the lighter was in it the corporal took it beats hell dont it the other said a man aint even the sum of his vices just his habits here we are after tomorrow morning neither one of us will have any use for it and until then it wont matter which one of us has it yet youve got to have it back just because you are in the habit of owning it and i have to try to cop it just because thats one of my natural habits too maybe thats what all the bother and trouble theyre getting ready to go to tomorrow morning is forparading a whole garrison just to cure three lousy bastards of the bad habit of breathing hey horse he said to the second man paris the second man said hoarsely you bet the other said thats the one theyre going to cure us of tomorrow the bad habit of not getting to paris after working for four years at it well make it this time though the corporal here is going with us to see that we do what did he do the corporal said thats all right the other said say we murder it was the old dames fault all she had to do was just tell us where the money was hidden and then behave herself keep her mouth shut instead she had to lay there in the bed yelling her head off until we had to choke her or we never would have got to paris paris the second said in his wet hoarse voice because thats all we wanted the other said all he was trying to do we were trying to do just to get to paris only folks kept on steering him wrong sending him off in the wrong direction sicking the dogs on him cops always saying move on move onyou know how it is so when we threw in together that daythat was at clermont ferrand in we didnt know how long he had been on the road because we didnt know how old he was except that it had been a good while he hadnt been nothing but a kid thenyou found out you were going to have to go to paris before you even found out you were going to have to have a woman hey horse paris the second said hoarsely working a little whenever he could find it sleeping in stables and hedgerows until they would set the dogs or the police on him again telling him to move on without even bothering to tell him which way he wanted to go until you would have thought nobody else in france ever heard of paris let alone wantedhadto go there hey horse paris the second said hoarsely then we run into one another that day in clermont and decided to throw in together and then it was all right there was a war on then and all you had to do was get yourself inside a government blue suit and you were free of cops and civilians and the whole human race all you needed was just to know who to salute and do it quick enough so we took a bottle of brandy to a sergeant i knew the human race the corporal said sure the other said you might not think it to look at him but he can move in the dark as quiet as a ghost and even see in it like a cat turn this light off for a second and he will have that lighter out of your pocket and you wont even know itso he was in too now he learned that fast the corporal said of course we had to be a little careful about his hands he never meant nothing see he just didnt know himself how strong they were like that night last month so you got along fine then the corporal said it was duck soupso he was in too now and now he could even ride sometimes with the government paying for it getting closer and closer to paris now not much over a year and we were all the way up to verdun that any boche will tell you is right next door to paris and still doing all right the corporal said why not if you cant trust your money to a bank in peacetime where else can you put it in a war except up the chimney or under the mattress or inside the clock or anywhere else you thought it was hidden for that matter because it didnt matter to us horse here has a nose for a tenfranc note like a pig for a truffle until that night last month and that was the old dames fault all she needed to do was tell us where it was and then lay quiet and keep her mouth shut but that didnt suit her she had to lay there in the bed hollering her head off until horse here had to shut her upyou know no harm intended just to squeeze her throat a little until we could have a little peace and quiet to hunt for it in only we forgot about the hands and when i got back got back the corporal said i was downstairs hunting for the moneygot back it was too late so they caught us and youd have thought that would have satisfied them especially as they even got the money back you found the money the corporal said sure while he was keeping her quietbut no that wasnt enough you found the money and had got away with it and then turned around and came back what the other said why did you change your mind the corporal said after a second the other said fag me again the corporal gave him another cigarette thanks he said the corporal extended the lighter thanks the other said he snapped it and lit the cigarette and snuffed the lighter again his two hands began the rapid and involuted gesture then stopped and in the same motion one of the hands tossed the lighter back to the corporal the arms crossed again palms to opposite elbows the cigarette bobbing while he talked where was i oh yesbut that didnt suit them just to take us out in a decent and peaceful way and shoot us wasnt enough they had to take horse here off in a cellar somewhere and scare the daylights out of him justice see protecting our rights just catching us wasnt enough we got to insist we did it just me saying so wasnt enough horse too has got to holler it to high heavenwhatever that means but its all right now they cant stop us now he turned and clapped the second man a hard quick blow on the back paris tomorrow morning kid fasten on to that the door opened it was the same sergeant again he did not enter saying to the corporal once more and then stood and held the door until the corporal had passed him then he closed and locked it this time it was the office of the prison commandant himself and what hethe corporalassumed to be just another nco until he saw arranged on the cleared desk the utensils for the last sacramenturn ewer stole candles and crucifixand only then remarked the small embroidered cross on the coat of the man standing beside them the other sergeant closing that door too between them so that he and the priest were alone the priest lifting his hand to inscribe into the invisible air the invisible passion while the corporal paused for a moment just inside the door not surprised yet either just once more alert looking at him at which moment a third person in the room would have remarked that they were almost of an age come in my son the priest said good evening sergeant the corporal said cant you say father the priest said of course the corporal said then say it the priest said of course father the corporal said he came on into the room looking quietly and rapidly again at the sacred implements on the desk while the priest watched him not that the priest said not yet i came to offer you life so he sent you the corporal said he the priest said what he can you mean except the giver of all life why should he send me here to offer you what he has already entrusted you with because the man you imply for all his rank and power can only take it from you your life was never his to give you because for all his stars and braid he too before god is just one more pinch of rotten and ephemeral dust it was neither of them which sent me here not the one who has already given you life nor the other who never had yours nor any other life within his gift it was duty which sent me here not this for an instant his hand touched the small embroidered cross on his collar not my cloth but my belief in him not even as his mouthpiece but as a man a french man the corporal said all right the priest said yes a frenchman if you likecommanded me here to commandnot ask offer commandyou to keep the life which you never had and never will have the refusal of to save another one to save another one the corporal said the commander of your regiments division the priest said he will die too for what all the world he knowsthe only world he does know because it was the one he dedicated his life towill call his failure where you will die for what you anyway will call a victory so he did send you the corporal said for blackmail beware the priest said then dont tell me this the corporal said tell him if i can save gragnons life only by not doing something you tell me i already cant and never could do anyway tell him then i dont want to die either beware the priest said that wasnt who i meant the corporal said i meant i know whom you meant the priest said thats why i said beware beware whom you mock by reading your own mortals pride into him who died two thousand years ago in the postulate that man shall never never never need never never never hold suzerainty over anothers life and deathabsolved you and the man you mean both of that terrible burden you of the right to and he of the need for suzerainty over your life absolved poor mortal man forever of the fear of the oppression and the anguish of the responsibility which suzerainty over human fate and destiny would have entailed on him and cursed him with when he refused in mans name the temptation of that mastery refused the terrible temptation of that limitless and curbless power when he answered the temptor render unto caesar the things which are caesarsi know he said quickly before the corporal could have spoken to chaulnesmont the things which are chaulnesmonts oh yes youre right im a frenchman first and so now you can even cite the record at me cant you all right do it the record the corporal said the book the priest said the corporal looked at him you mean you dont even know it i cant read the corporal said then ill cite for you plead for you the priest said it wasnt he with his humility and pity and sacrifice that converted the world it was pagan and bloody rome which did it with his martyrdom furious and intractable dreamers had been bringing that same dream out of asia minor for three hundred years until at last one found a caesar foolish enough to crucify him and you are right but then so is he i dont mean him now i mean the old man in that white room yonder onto whose shoulders you are trying to slough and shirk your right and duty for free will and decision because only rome could have done it accomplished it and even he i do mean him now knew it felt and sensed this furious and intractable dreamer though he was because he even said it himself on this rock i found my church even while he didntand never wouldrealise the true significance of what he was saying believing still that he was speaking poetic metaphor synonym parablethat rock meant unstable inconstant heart and church meant airy faith it wasnt even his first and favorite sycophant who read that significance who was also ignorant and intractable like him and even in the end got himself also electrocuted by the dreams intractable fire like him it was paul who was a roman first and then a man and only then a dreamer and so of all of them was able to read the dream correctly and to realise that to endure it could not be a nebulous and airy faith but instead it must be a church an establishment a morality of behavior inside which man could exercise his right and duty for free will and decision not for a reward resembling the bedtime tale which soothes the child into darkness but the reward of being able to cope peacefully hold his own with the hard durable world in which whether he would ever know why or not wouldnt matter either because now he could cope with that too he found himself not snared in that frail web of hopes and fears and aspirations which man calls his heart but fixed established to endure on that rock whose synonym was the seeded capital of that hard durable enduring earth which man must cope with somehow by some means or perish so you see he is right it wasnt he nor peter but paul who being only onethird dreamer was twothirds man and half of that a roman could cope with rome who did more who rendering unto caesar conquered rome more destroyed it because where is that rome now until what remains but that rock that citadel render unto chaulnesmont why should you die tell him that the corporal said to save another life which your dream will electrocute the priest said tell him that the corporal said remember the priest said no you cant remember you dont know it you cant read so ill have to be both again defender and advocate change these stones to bread and all men will follow thee and he answered man cannot live by bread alone because he knew that too intractable and furious dreamer though he was that he was tempted to tempt and lead man not with the bread but with the miracle of that bread the deception the illusion the delusion of that bread tempted to believe that man was not only capable and willing but even eager for that deception that even when the illusion of that miracle had led him to the point where the bread would revert once more to stone in his very belly and destroy him his own children would be panting for the opportunity to grasp into their hands in their turn the delusion of that miracle which would destroy them no no listen to paul who needed no miracle required no martyrdom save that life thou shalt not kill tell him that the corporal said take your own tomorrow if you must the priest said but save his now tell him that the corporal said power the priest said not just power over the mere earth offered by that temptation of simple miracle but that more terrible one over the universe itselfthat terrible power over the whole universe which that mastery over mans mortal fate and destiny would have given him had he not cast back into the temptors very teeth that third and most terrible temptation of immortality which if he had faltered or succumbed would have destroyed his fathers kingdom not only on the earth but in heaven too because that would have destroyed heaven since what value in the scale of mans hope and aspiration or what tensile hold or claim on man himself could that heaven own which could be gained by that base meansblackmail man in his turn by no more warrant than one single precedent casting himself from the nearest precipice the moment he wearied of the burden of his free will and decision the right to the one and the duty of the other saying to challenging his creator let me fallif you dare tell him that the corporal said save that other life grant that the right of free will is in your own death but your duty to choose is not yours its his its general gragnons death tell him that the corporal said they looked at one another then the priest seemed to make a terrible faint and convulsive effort whether to speak or not to speak was still not clear even when he said like a sort of gesture a valedictory not to defeat nor despair nor even desperation but as though to abnegation itself remember that bird so he did send you here the corporal said yes the priest said he sent for me to render unto caesar he said but he came back came back the corporal said he the one who denied you the priest said that turned his back on you freed himself of you but he came back and now there are eleven of them again he moved until he was facing the corporal save me too he said then he was on his knees before the corporal his hands clasped fist into fist at his breast save me he said get up father the corporal said no the priest said he fumbled a moment inside the breast of his coat and produced his prayerbook dogeared and stained too from the front lines it seemed to open automatically on the narrow purple ribbon of its marker as the priest reversed it and extended it upward read it to me then he said the corporal took the book what he said the office for the dying the priest said but you cant read can you he said he took the book back and now clasped it closed between his hands at his breast his head bowed still save me then he said get up the corporal said reaching down to grasp the priests arm though the priest had already begun to rise standing now fumbling a little clumsily as he put the book back inside his coat as he turned stiffly and clumsily still he seemed to stumble slightly and was apparently about to fall even though again he had recovered himself before the corporal touched him going toward the door now one hand already lifted toward it or toward the wall or perhaps just lifted as though he were blind too the corporal watching him until the corporal said youve forgotten your gear the priest stopped though he didnt turn yet yes he said so i did then he said so i have then he turned and went back to the desk and gathered the articles upbasin ewer stole and crucifixand huddled them clumsily into or onto one arm and extended his hand toward the candles and then stopped again the corporal watching him you can send back for them the corporal said yes the priest said i can send back for them and turned and went again to the door and stopped again and after a moment began to raise his hand toward it though the corporal now had already passed him to strike two or three rapping blows with his knuckles on the wood which a moment later swung open and back revealing the sergeant the priest standing again for a second or two clasping to his breast the huddled symbols of his mystery then he roused yes he said i can send back for them and passed through the door and this time he didnt pause even when the sergeant overtook him and said shall i take them to the chapel father thank you the priest said relinquishing them and now he was free walking on and now he was even safe outside out of doors with only the spring darkness the spring night soft and myriad above the blank and lightless walls and between them too filling the empty topless passage alley at the end of which he could see a section of the distant wire fence and the catwalk spaced by the rigid downglare of the lights these spaced in their turn by the red eyes of the senegalese sentries cigarettes and beyond that the dark plain and beyond the plain in turn the faint unsleeping glow of the sleepless city and now he could remember when he had seen them first finally seen them overtook them at last two winters ago up near the chemin des damesbehind combles souchez he couldnt rememberthe cobbled place in the mild evening no mild evening it was only autumn yet a little while still before there would begin at verdun that final winter of the doomed and accursed race of man already empty again because again he had just missed them by minutes the arms the hands pointing to show him the helpful and contradictory voices giving him directions too many of them in fact too many helpful voices and too many directions until at last one man walked with him to the edge of the village to show him the exact route and even point out to him the distant huddle of the farm itselfa walled yard enclosing house byre and all twilight now and he saw them eight of them at first standing quietly about the kitchen stoop until he saw two more of them the corporal and another sitting on the stoop in baize or oilcloth aprons the corporal cleaning a fowl a chicken the other peeling potatoes into a bowl while beside above them stood the farmwife with a pitcher and a child a girl of ten or so with both hands full of mugs and tumblers then while he watched the other three came out of the byre with the farmer himself and crossed the yard carrying the pails of milk nor did he approach nor even make his presence known just watching while the woman and the child exchanged the pitcher and the drinking vessels for the fowl and bowl and the pails of milk and carried the food on into the house and the farmer filled from the pitcher the mugs and tumblers which the corporal held and passed in turn and then they drank in ritual salutationto peaceful work to the peaceful end of day to anticipation of the peaceful lamplit meal whatever it wasand then it was dark night night indeed because the second time was at verdun which was the freezing night of france and of man too since france was the cradle of the liberty of the human spirit in the actual ruins of verdun itself within actual hearing range of the anguish of gaud and valaumont not approaching this time either but only to stand from a distance watching walled by the filth and anguishstained backs from where the thirteen would be standing in the circles center talking or not haranguing or not he would never know dared not know thinking yes even then i durst not even if they did not need to talk or harangue since simply to believe was enough thinking yes there were thirteen then and even now there are still twelve thinking even if there were only one only he would be enough more than enough thinking just that one to stand between me and safety me and security between meand peace and although he knew the compound and its environs well for a moment he was disoriented as sometimes happens when you enter a strange building in darkness or by one door and then emerge from it in light or by another even though this was not the case here thinking in a sort of quiet unamazement yes i probably knew from the moment he sent for me what door i should have to emerge from the only exit left for me so it only lasted for a moment or two or possibly even less than that one infinitesimal vertiginous lurch and wall stone and brick resumed once more its ordered and forever repudiated place one corner one turn and the sentry was where he had remembered he would be not even pacing his beat but just standing at ease with his grounded rifle beside the small iron gate good evening my son the priest said good evening father the man said i wonder if i might borrow your bayonet the priest said my what the man said your bayonet the priest said extending his hand i cant do that the man said im on paradeon post the corporal willthe officer of the day himself might come along tell them i took it the priest said took it the man said demanded it the priest said his hand still steadily out come then the hand moved not fast and drew the bayonet from the mans belt tell them i took it the priest said already turning good night or perhaps the man even answered perhaps even in the silent and empty alley again one last fading echo of one last warm and human voice speaking in warm and human protest or amazement or simple unquestioning defence of an is simply because it is and then no more thinking it was a spear so i should have taken the rifle too and then no more thinking the left side and im right handed thinking but at least he wasnt wearing an infantrymans overcoat and a magasin du louvre shirt and so at least i can do that opening the coat and throwing it back and then opening the shirt until he could feel the blades cold minuscule point against his flesh and then the cold sharp whisper of the blade itself entering beginning to make a sort of thin audible cry as though of astonishment at its own swiftness yet when he looked down at it barely the point itself had disappeared and he said aloud quietly now what but he was not standing either he thought he was nailed there and he will forgive me and cast himself sideways and downward steadying the bayonet so that the end of the hilt should strike the bricks first and turned a little until his cheek lay against the stillwarm bricks and now he began to make a thin sweet crying of frustration and despair until the pinch of his hand between the bayonets cross guard and his own flesh told him better and so he could stop the crying nowthe sweet thick warm murmur of it pouring suddenly from his mouth beeping its horn steadilynot pettishly nor fretfully nor even irritatedly but in fact with a sort of unwearyable blasé gallic detachmentthe french staffcar crept through the place de ville as though patting the massed crowd gently and firmly to either side with the horn itself to make room for its passage it was not a big car it flew no generals pennon nor in fact any insignia of any kind it was just a small indubitable french army motor car driven by a french soldier and containing three more soldiers three american privates who until they met in the blois orderly room where the french car had picked them up four hours ago had never laid eyes on one another before who sat two in the back and one in front with the driver while the car bleated its snaillike passage through the massed spent wan and sleepless faces one of the two americans in the back seat was leaning out of the car looking eagerly about not at the faces but at the adjacent buildings which enclosed the place he held a big muchfolded and unfolded and refolded map open between his hands he was quite young with brown eyes as trustful and unalarmed as those of a cow in an open reliant invincibly and incorrigibly bucolic facea farmers face fated to love his peaceful agrarian heritage his father as he would after him raised hogs in iowa and rich corn to feed and fatten them for market on for the simple reason that to the end of his eupeptic days what was going to happen to him inside the next thirty minutes would haunt him of course from time to time but only in dreams as nightmares haunt it would never occur to him that he could possibly have found anything more worthy to be lovedleaning eagerly out of the car and completely ignoring the massed faces through which he crept saying eagerly which one is it which one is it which one is what the american beside the driver said the headquarters he said the hotel de villy wait till you get inside the other said thats what you volunteered to look at i want to see it from the outside too the first said thats why i volunteered for this whateveritis ask him he said indicating the driver you can speak frog not this time the other said my french dont use this kind of a house but it wasnt necessary anyway because at the same moment they both saw the three sentriesamerican french and britishflanking the door and in the next one the car turned through the gates and now they saw the whole courtyard cluttered and massed with motorcycles and staffcars bearing the three different devices the car didnt stop there though darting its way among the other vehicles at a really headlong speed now that its gambits were its own durable peers instead of frail untriumphable human flesh it dashed on around to the extreme rear of the baroque and awesome pile now what the one in the front seat said to the iowan who was still leaning out toward the buildings dizzy crenellated wheel did you expect them to invite us in by the front its all right the iowan said thats how i thought it would look to where an american military policeman standing beside a sort of basement areaway was signalling them with a flashlight the car shot up beside him and stopped he opened the door though since the iowan was now engaged in trying to refold his map the american private in the front seat was the first to get out his name was buchwald his grandfather had been rabbi of a minsk synagogue until a cossack sergeant beat his brains out with the shod hooves of a horse his father was a tailor he himself was born on the fourth floor of a walkup coldwater brooklyn tenement within two years after the passage of the american prohibition law with nothing in his bare hands but a converted armysurplus lewis machine gun he himself was to become czar of a milliondollar empire covering the entire atlantic coast from canada to whatever florida cove or sandspit they were using that night he had pale almost colorless eyes he was hard and slender too now though one day a few months less than ten years from now lying in his tenthousanddollar casket banked with half that much more in cut flowers he would look plump almost fat the military policeman leaned into the back of the car come on come on he said the iowan emerged carrying the clumsilyfolded map in one hand and slapping at his pocket with the other he feinted past buchwald like a football halfback and darted to the front of the car and held the map into the light of one of the headlamps still slapping at his pocket durn he said ive lost my pencil the third american private was now out of the car he was a negro of a complete and unrelieved black he emerged with a sort of ballet dancer elegance not mincing not foppish not maidenly but rather at once masculine and girlish or perhaps better epicene and stood not quite studied while the iowan spun and feinted this time through all three of thembuchwald the policeman and the negroand carrying his now rapidly disintegrating map plunged his upper body back into the car saying to the policeman lend me your flashlight i must have dropped it on the floor sweet crap buchwald said come on its my pencil the iowan said i had it at that last big town we passedwhat was the name of it i can call a sergeant the policeman said am i going to have to nah buchwald said he said to the iowan come on theyve probably got a pencil inside they can read and write here too the iowan backed out of the car and stood up he began to refold his map following the policeman they crossed to the areaway and descended into it the iowan following with his eyes the buildings soaring upward swoop yes he said it sure does they descended steps through a door they were in a narrow stone passage the policeman opened a door and they entered an anteroom the policeman closed the door behind them the room contained a cot a desk a telephone a chair the iowan went to the desk and began to shift the papers on it you can remember you were here without having to check it off cant you buchwald said it aint for me the iowan said tumbling the papers through its for the girl im engaged to i promised her does she like pigs too buchwald said what the iowan said he stopped and turned his head still half stooped over the desk he gave buchwald his mild open reliant and alarmless look why not he said whats wrong with pigs okay buchwald said so you promised her thats right the iowan said when we found out i was coming to france i promised to take a map and mark off on it all the places i went to especially the ones you always hear about like paris i got blois and brest and ill get paris for volunteering for this and now im even going to have chaulnesmont the grand headquarters of the whole shebang as soon as i can find a pencil he began to search the desk again what you going to do with it buchwald said the map when you get it back home frame it and hang it on the wall the iowan said what did you think i was going to do with it are you sure youre going to want this one marked on it buchwald said what the iowan said then he said why dont you know what you volunteered for buchwald said sure the iowan said for a chance to visit chaulnesmont i mean didnt anybody tell you what you were going to do here buchwald said you havent been in the army very long have you the iowan said in the army you dont ask what you are going to do you just do it in fact the way to get along in any army is never even to wonder why they want something done or what they are going to do with it after its finished but just do it and then get out of sight so that they cant just happen to see you by accident and then think up something for you to do but instead they will have to have thought up something to be done and then hunt for somebody to do it durn it i dont believe they have a pencil here either maybe sambos got one buchwald said he looked at the negro what did you volunteer for this for besides a threeday paris pass to see chaulnesmont too what did you call me the negro said sambo buchwald said you no like my names philip manigault beauchamp the negro

at the iowan he was still looking at buchwald you want to make something of it me buchwald said what part of texas you from texas the negro said with a sort of bemused contempt he glanced at the nails of his right hand then rubbed them briskly against his flank mississippi going to live in chicago soon as this craps over be an undertaker if youre interested an undertaker buchwald said you like dead people huh hasnt anybody in this whole durn war got a pencil the iowan said yes the negro said he stood tall slender not studied just poised suddenly he gave buchwald a look feminine and defiant i

buchwald said wilson the iowan said do you know sergeant wilson hes the best sergeant in the army then i dont know him buchwald said without looking at the iowan all the ncos i know are sons of bitches he said to the negro did they tell you or didnt they now the iowan had begun to look from one to the other of them what is going on here he said the door opened it was an american sergeantmajor he entered rapidly and looked rapidly at them he was carrying an attaché case whos in charge he said he looked at buchwald you he opened the attaché case and took something from it which he extended to buchwald it was a pistol thats a german pistol the iowan said buchwald took it the sergeantmajor reached into the attaché case again this time it was a key a door key he extended it to buchwald why buchwald said take it the sergeantmajor said you dont want privacy to last forever do you buchwald took the key and put it and the pistol into his pocket why in hell didnt you bastards do it yourselves he said so we had to send all the way to blois to find somebody for a midnight argument the sergeantmajor said come on he said get it over with he started to turn this time the iowan spoke quite loudly look here he said what is this the sergeantmajor paused and looked at the iowan then the negro he said to buchwald so theyre already going coy on you oh coy buchwald said dont let that worry you the smoke cant help it coy is a part of what you might say one of his habits or customs or pastimes the other one dont even know what coy means yet okay the sergeantmajor said its your monkey you ready wait buchwald said he didnt look back to where the other two stood near the desk watching him and the sergeantmajor what is it i thought they told you the sergeantmajor said lets hear yours buchwald said they had a little trouble with him the sergeantmajor said its got to be done from in front for his own sake let alone everybody elses but they cant seem to make him see it hes got to be killed from in front by a kraut bulletsee you get it now he was killed in that attack monday morning theyre giving him all the benefit out there that morning where he had no business beinga major general safe for the rest of his life to stay behind and say give em hell men but no he was out there himself leading the whole business to victory for france and fatherland theyre even going to give him a new medal but he still wont see it whats his gripe buchwald said he knows hes for it dont he oh sure the sergeantmajor said he knows hes gone that aint the question he aint kicking about that he just refuses to let them do it that wayswears hes going to make them shoot him not in the front but in the back like any topsergeant or shavetail that thinks hes too tough to be scared and too hard to be hurt you know make the whole world see that not the enemy but his own men did it why didnt they just hold him and do it buchwald said now now the sergeantmajor said you dont just hold a french majorgeneral and shoot him in the face then how are we supposed to do it buchwald said the sergeantmajor looked at him oh buchwald said maybe i get it now french soldiers dont maybe next time it will be an american general and three frogs will get a trip to new york yeah the sergeantmajor said if they just let me pick the general you ready now yes buchwald said but he didnt move he said yeah why us anyway if hes a frog general why didnt the frogs do it why did it have to be us maybe because an american doughfoot is the only bastard they could bribe with a trip to paris the sergeantmajor said come on but still buchwald didnt move his pale hard eyes thoughtful and steady come on he said give if youre going to back out why didnt you do it before you left blois the sergeantmajor said buchwald said something unprintable give he said lets get it over with right the sergeantmajor said they rationed it the frogs will have to shoot that frog regiment because its frog they had to bring a kraut general over here wednesday to explain why they were going to shoot the frog regiment and the limeys won that now they got to shoot this frog general to explain why they brought the kraut general over here and we won that maybe they drew straws all right now yes buchwald said suddenly and harshly he cursed yes lets get it over with wait the iowan said no i dont forget your map buchwald said we wont be back here i havent the iowan said what you think i been holding onto it this long for good buchwald said then when they send you back home to prison for mutiny you can mark leavenworth on it too they returned to the corridor and followed it it was empty lighted by spaced weak electric bulbs they had seen no other sign of life and suddenly it was as though they apparently were not going to until they were out of it again the narrow corridor had not descended there were no more steps it was as if the earth it tunnelled through had sunk as an elevator sinks holding the corridor itself intact immune empty of any life or sound save that of their boots the whitewashed stone sweating in furious immobility beneath the whole concentrated weight of history stratum upon stratum of dead tradition impounded by the hôtel above themmonarchy revolution empire and republic duke farmergeneral and sans culotte levee tribunal and guillotine liberty fraternity equality and death and the people the people always to endure and prevail the group the clump huddled now going quite fast until the iowan cried again no i tell you i aint until buchwald stopped stopping them all and turned and said to the iowan in a calm and furious murmur beat it what the iowan cried i cant where would i go how the hell do i know buchwald said i aint the one thats dissatisfied here come on the sergeantmajor said they went on they reached a door it was locked the sergeantmajor unlocked and opened it do we report buchwald said not to me the sergeantmajor said you can even keep the pistol for a souvenir the carll be waiting where you got out of it and was about to close the door until buchwald after one rapid glance into the room turned and put his foot against the door and said again in that harsh calm furious controlled voice christ cant the sons of bitches even get a priest for him theyre still trying the sergeantmajor said somebody sent for the priest out at the compound two hours ago and he aint got back yet they cant seem to find him so were supposed to wait for him buchwald said in that tone of harsh calm unbearable outrage supposed by who the sergeantmajor said move your foot buchwald did the door closed the lock clashed behind them and the three of them were in a cell a cubicle fierce with whitewash and containing the single unshaded electric light and a threelegged stool like a farmers milking stool and the french general that is it was a french face and by its expression and cast it had been used to enough rank long enough to be a generals besides the insignia and the dense splash of ribbons and the sam browne belt and the leather putties though the uniform which bore them were the plain gi tunic and trousers which a cavalry sergeant would have worn standing now erect and rigid now and rather as though enclosed by the fading aura of the convulsive movement which had brought him to his feet who said sharply in french attention there what buchwald said to the negro beside him what did he say how in hell do i know the negro said quick he said in a panting voice that ioway bastard do something about him quick right buchwald said turning grab him then and turned on to meet the iowan no i tell you the iowan cried i aint going to buchwald struck him skilfully the blow seeming not to travel at all before the iowan catapulted backward into the wall then slid down it to the floor buchwald turning again in time to see the negro grasp at the french general and the french general turn sharply face to and against the wall his head turned cheek against it saying over his shoulder in french as buchwald snapped the safety off the pistol shoot now you whorehouse scum i will not turn jerk him around buchwald said put that damn safety back on the negro panted glaring back at him you want to shoot me too come on it will take both of us buchwald closed the safety though he still held the pistol in his hand while they struggled all three of them or two of them to drag the french general far enough from the wall to turn him hit him a little the negro panted we got to knock him out how in hell can you knock out a man thats already dead buchwald panted come on the negro panted just a little hurry buchwald struck trying to gauge the blow and he was right the body collapsed until the negro was supporting it but not out the eyes open looking up at buchwald then watching the pistol as buchwald raised it and snapped the safety off again the eyes not afraid not even despaired just incorrigibly alert and rational so alert in fact as apparently to have seen the squeeze of buchwalds hand as it started so that the sudden and furious movement turned not only the face but the whole body away with the explosion so that the round hole was actually behind the ear when the corpse reached the floor buchwald and the negro stood over it panting the barrel of the pistol warm against buchwalds leg son of a bitch buchwald said to the negro why didnt you hold him he slipped the negro panted slipped my crap buchwald said you didnt hold him son of a bitch yourself the negro panted me stand there holding him for that bullet to come on through hunting me next all right all right buchwald said now we got to plug that one up and shoot him again plug it up the negro said yes buchwald said what the hell sort of undertaker will you make if you dont know how to plug up a hole in a bastard that got shot in the wrong place wax will do it get a candle wherem i going to get a candle the negro said go out in the hall and yell buchwald said swapping hands with the pistol and taking the door key from his pocket and handing it to the negro keep on yelling until you find a frog they must have candles they must have at least one thing in this ing country we never had to bring two thousand miles over here and give to them friday saturday sunday it bade fair to be another bright and perennial larkfilled vernal morning the gaudy uniforms and arms and jangling accoutrements and even the ebon faces too of the senegalese regiment seemed to gleam in it as to the cryptic tribal equatorial cries of its noncoms it filed onto the parade ground and formed three sides of a hollow square facing the three freshlyplanted posts set in a symmetric row on the edge of a long pit or ditch almost filled and obliterated now by four years of wars refusetin cans bottles old messkits wornout cooking utensils boots inextricable coils of rusting and useless wirefrom which the dirt had been excavated to form the railroad embankment running across the end of the parade which would serve as a backstop for what bullets neither flesh nor wood absorbed they came into position then at rest and grounded arms and stood at ease and then easy whereupon there rose a steady unemphatic gabble not festive just gregarious like people waiting for the opening of a marketplace the pallid perennial almost invisible lighters winked and flared from perennial cigarette to cigarette among the babble of voices the ebon and gleaming faces not even watching the working party of white soldiers while they tamped the last earth about the posts and took up their tools and departed in a disorderly straggle like a company of reapers leaving a field of hay then a distant bugle cried once or twice the senegalese ncos shouted the gaudy ranks doused the cigarettes without haste and with a sort of negligent almost inattentive deliberation came to alert and at ease as the sergeantmajor of the city garrison a holstered pistol strapped outside his long buttonedback coat came into the vacant side of the square before the three posts and stopped and stood as to the harsh abrupt ejaculations of the new ncos the mutinied regiment filed into the empty rectangle and huddled pariahs still hatless and unarmed still unshaven alien stained still with aisne and oise and marne mud so that against the gaudy arras of the senegalese they looked like harassed and harried and homeless refugees from another planet moiling a little though quiet and even orderly or at least decorous until suddenly a handful of them eleven it was broke suddenly out and ran in a ragged clump toward the three posts and had knelt facing the posts in the same ragged clump by the time the sergeantmajor had shouted something and an ncos voice took it up and a file of senegalese came rapidly out and around and across the empty parade and surrounded the kneeling men and pulled them not at all roughly back onto their feet and turned them and herded them back among their companions like drovers behind a small band of temporarily strayed sheep now a small party of horsemen rode rapidly up from the rear and stopped just outside the square behind it they were the town major his adjutant the provost marshal adjutant and three orderlies the sergeantmajor shouted the parade save for the pariah regiment came to attention in one long metallic clash the sergeantmajor wheeled and saluted the town major across the rigid palisade of senegalese heads the town major accepted the parade and stood it at ease then back to attention again and returned it to the sergeantmajor who in his turn stood it at ease again and turned to face the three posts as abruptly and apparently from nowhere a sergeant and file came up with the three hatless prisoners interspersed among them whom they bound quickly to the three poststhe man who had called himself lapin then the corporal then the simianlike creature whom lapin had called cassetête or horseleaving them facing in to the hollow of the square though they couldnt see it now because at the moment there filed between them and it another squad of some twenty men with a sergeant who halted and quarterturned and stood them at ease with their backs to the three doomed ones whom the sergeantmajor now approached in turn to examine rapidly the cord which bound lapin to his post then on to the corporal already extending his the sergeantmajors hand to the médaille militaire on the corporals coat saying in a rapid murmur you dont want to keep this no the corporal said no use to spoil it the sergeantmajor wrenched it off the coat not savagely just rapidly already moving on i know who to give it to he said moving on to the third man who said drooling a little not alarmed not even urgent just diffident and promptive as you address someone a stranger on whom your urgent need depends but who may have temporarily forgotten your need or forgotten you paris right the sergeantmajor said then he was gone too now the three bound men could have seen nothing save the backs of the twenty men in front of them though they could still have heard the sergeantmajors voice as he brought the parade to attention again and drew from somewhere inside his coat a folded paper and a worn leather spectacle case and unfolded the paper and put the spectacles on and read aloud from the paper holding it now in both hands against the light flutter of the morning breeze his voice sounding clear and thin and curiously forlorn in the sunny larkfilled emptiness among the dead redundant forensic verbiage talking in pompous and airy delusion of an end of man by order of the president of the court the sergeantmajor chanted wanly and refolded the paper and removed the spectacles and folded them back into the case and stowed them both away command the twenty men aboutturned to face the three posts lapin was now straining outward against his cord trying to see past the corporal to the third man look lapin said anxiously to the corporal load paris the third man said hoarse and wet and urgent say something to him lapin said quick aim paris the third man said again its all right the corporal said were going to wait we wont go without you the corporals post may have been flawed or even rotten because although the volley merely cut cleanly the cords binding lapin and the third man to theirs so that their bodies slumped at the foot of each post the corporals body post bonds and all went over backward as one intact unit onto the edge of the rubbishfilled trench behind it when the sergeantmajor the pistol still smoking faintly in his hand moved from lapin to the corporal he found that the plunge of the post had jammed it and its burden too into a tangled mass of old barbed wire a strand of which had looped up and around the top of the post and the mans head as though to assoil them both on in one unbroken continuation of the fall into the anonymity of the earth the wire was rusted and pitted and would not have deflected the bullet anyway nevertheless the sergeantmajor flicked it carefully away with his toe before setting the pistols muzzle against the ear as soon as the parade ground was empty before in fact the end of the senegalese column had not yet vanished into the company street the fatigue party came up with a handdrawn barrow containing their tools and a folded tarpaulin the corporal in charge took a wirecutter from the barrow and approached the sergeantmajor who had already cut the corporals body free from the broken post here he said handing the sergeantmajor the wirecutter youre not going to waste a groundsheet on one of them are you get those posts out the sergeantmajor said let me have two men and the ground sheet right the corporal said the corporal went away the sergeantmajor cut off a section about six feet long of the rusted wire when he rose the two men with the folded tarpaulin were standing behind him watching him spread it out he said pointing they did so put him in it he said they took up the dead corporals body the one at the head a little finicking because of the blood and laid it on the tarpaulin go on the sergeantmajor said roll it up then put it in the barrow and followed them the fatigueparty corporal suddenly not watching him too the other men suddenly immersed again in freeing the planted posts from the earth nor did the sergeantmajor speak again he simply gestured the two men to take up the handles and himself at the rear established the direction by holding one corner as a pivot and pushing against the other and then pushing ahead on both the laden barrow now crossing the parade ground at a long slant toward the point where the wire fence died in a sharp right angle against the old factory wall nor did he the sergeantmajor look back either the two men carrying the handles almost trotting now to keep the barrow from running over them on toward the corner where at some point they too must have seen beyond the fence the high twowheeled farm cart with a heavy farm horse in the shafts and the two women and the three men beside it the sergeantmajor stopping the barrow just as he had started it by stopping himself and pivoting the barrow by its two rear corners into the angle of the fence then himself went and stood at the fencea man of more than fifty and now looking all of ituntil the taller of the two womenthe one with the high dark strong and handsome face as a mans face is handsomeapproached the other side of the wire the second woman had not moved the shorter dumpier softer one but she was watching the two at the fence and listening her face quite empty for the moment but with something incipient and tranquilly promising about it like a clean though notyetlighted lamp on a kitchen bureau where did you say your husbands farm is the sergeantmajor said i told you the woman said tell me again the sergeantmajor said beyond chalons the woman said how far beyond chalons the sergeantmajor said all right he said how far from verdun its near viennelapucelle the woman said beyond st mihiel she said st mihiel the sergeantmajor said in the army zone worse in the battle zone with germans on one side of it and americans on the other americans should american soldiers be more terrible than other soldiers the woman said because they are fresher at it is that it no sister the other woman said thats wrong its because the americans have been here so young it will be easy for them the two at the fence paid no attention to her they looked at one another through the wire then the woman said the war is over ah the sergeantmajor said the woman made no movement no gesture what else can this mean what else explain it justify it no not even justify it plead compassion plead pity plead despair for it she looked at the sergeantmajor cold griefless impersonal plead exculpation for it bah the sergeantmajor said did i ask you did anyone he gestured behind him with the wirecutter one of the men released the handle of the barrow and came and took it cut the bottom strand the sergeantmajor said cut the man said it species of a species the sergeantmajor said the man started to stoop but the sergeantmajor had already snatched the wirecutter back from him and stooped himself the taut bottommost strand sprang with a thin almost musical sound recoiling get it out of the barrow the sergeantmajor said lively they understood now they lifted the long tarpaulinwrapped object from the barrow and lowered it to the ground the woman had moved aside and the three men now waited at the fence to draw drag the long object along the ground and through the wires vacancy then up and into the cart wait the sergeantmajor said the woman paused the sergeantmajor fumbled inside his coat and produced a folded paper which he passed through the fence to her she opened it and looked at it for a moment with no expression whatever yes she said it must be over since you receive a diploma now with your execution what shall i do with it frame it on the parlor wall the sergeantmajor reached through the wire and snatched the paper from between her hands his other hand fumbling out the worn spectacle case again then with both hands still holding the opened paper he got the spectacle on his nose and glanced at the paper a moment then with a violent gesture crumpled the paper into his side pocket and produced another folded one from inside his coat and extended it through the wire shaking it violently open before the woman could touch it saying in a repressed and seething voice say you dont need this one then look at the signature on it the woman did so she had never seen it before the thin delicate faint cryptic indecipherable scrawl which few other people had ever seen either but which anyone in that half of europe on that day competent to challenge a signature would have recognised at once so he knows where his sons halfsisters husbands farm is too she said pah the sergeantmajor said further than st mihiel even if at any place on the way you should be faced with a pearled and golden gate that will pass you through it toothis too he said his hand coming out of his pocket and through the wire again opening on the dull bronze of the small emblem and the bright splash of its ribbon the woman immobile again not touching it yet tall looking down at the sergeantmajors open palm until he felt the other woman looking at him and met the tranquil and incipient gaze whereupon she said hes really quite handsome sister hes not so old either pah the sergeantmajor said again here he said thrusting fumbling the medal into the taller womans hand until she had to take it then snatching his own hand quickly back through the wire begone he said get on with you get out of here breathing a little hard now irascible almost raging who was too old for this feeling the second womans eyes again though he did not meet them yet flinging his head up to shout at the taller ones back there were three of you where is the other onehis poule whatever she iswas then he had to meet the second womans eyes the face no longer incipient now but boundless with promise giving him a sweet and tender smile saying its all right dont be afraid goodbye then they were gone the five of them the horse and the cart rapidly he turned and took the section of rusted wire from the barrow and flung it down beside the severed bottom strand tie it back he said isnt the war over one of the men said the sergeantmajor turned almost savagely but not the army he said how do you expect peace to put an end to an army when even war cant when they passed through the old eastern city gate this time they were all riding marthe with the lines at one end of the high seat and the sister opposite with the girl between them they were quite high not in the citys dense and creeping outflux but above it not a part of it but on it like a boat the three of them riding out of the city as on a float in a carnival procession fluxed out of the anguished city on the fading diffusion on the anguish as on a legless and wheelless effigy of a horse and cart as though borne on the massed shoulders in a kind of triumph borne along so high in fact that they had almost reached the old gate before the owners of the shoulders even appeared or thought to raise their eyes or their attention high enough to remark what they carried and to assume divine or simply recoil from what the cart contained it was not a recoil a shrinking but rather an effacement a recession a suddenly widening ring of empty space beginning to enclose the moving cart as water recedes from a float leaving the float to realise discover only then that it was not maritime but terrestrial and not supported by a medium but attached to earth by legs and wheels a recession as though the shoulders which for a time had borne it were effacing not only the support but the cognizance too of the weight and presence of the burden the crowd pressing steadily away from the cart and even transmitting on ahead as though by osmosis the warning of its coming until presently the path was already opening before the cart itself ever reached it the cart now moving faster than the crowd the faces in the crowd not even looking toward it until the second sister marya began to call down to them from her end of the high seat not peremptory not admonitory just insistent and serene as if she were speaking to children come you owe him no obligation you dont need to hate you havent injured him why should you be afraid marya the other sister said nor ashamed either marya said hush marya the other sister said marya sat back into the seat all right sister she said i didnt mean to frighten them only to comfort them but she continued to watch them bright and serene the cart going on the cleared space moving steadily before it as if the emptiness itself cleared its own advancing vacancy so that when they came to the old gate the archway was completely vacant the crowd now halted and banked on either side of it for the cart to pass when suddenly a man in the crowd removed his hat then one or two more so that when the cart passed beneath the arch it was as though it had quit the city enclosed in a faint visible soundless rustling you see sister marya said with serene and peaceful triumph only to comfort them now they were out of the city the long straight roads diverging away radiating away like spokes from a hub above them slowly crawled the intermittent small clouds of dust within which singly in groups sometimes in carts also the city emptied itself the parents and kin of the revolted regiment who had hurried toward it in amazement and terror to compound between the old walls vituperation and anguish now fled it almost as though in something not quite of relief but shame they didnt look back at it though for a while yet it remained squatting above the flat plain supreme still gray and crowned by the ancient roman citadel and slowly fading until in time it was gone though they still had not looked once back to know it going on themselves behind the strong slow heavy deliberate unhurryable farmhorse they had food with them so they didnt need to stop save for a little while at noon in a wood to feed and water the horse so they only passed through the villagesthe silent arrested faces that same faint visible soundless rustling as the hats and caps came off almost as though they had an outrider or courier to presage them the girl crouching in her shawl between the two older women marthe ironfaced looking straight ahead and only the other sister marya to look about them serene and tranquil never astonished never surprised while the heavy shaggy feet of the horse rang the slow cobbles until that one too was behind just before dark they reached chalons they were in an army zone now and approaching what five days ago had been a battle zone though there was peace now or at least quiet still an army zone anyway because suddenly a french and an american sergeant stood at the horses head stopping him i have the paper marthe said producing and extending it here keep it the french sergeant said you wont need it here it is all arranged then she saw something else six french soldiers carrying a cheap wood coffin approaching the rear of the cart and even as she turned on the seat they had already set the coffin down and were drawing the tarpaulinswaddled body from the cart wait marthe said in her harsh strong tearless voice it is arranged i tell you the french sergeant said you go to st mihiel by train by train marthe said why sister marya said in the train restrain yourself the french sergeant said to marthe you wont have to pay its arranged i tell you this cart is not mine marthe said i borrowed it we know that the french sergeant said it will be returned but i must still carry him from st mihiel to viennelapucelleyou said st mihiel didnt you why do you argue with me the french sergeant said have i not told you one million times it is all arranged your husband will meet you at st mihiel with your own cart and horse get down all of you just because the war has stopped do you think the army has nothing else to do but cajole civilians come along now youre holding up your train it has a little more to do than this too then they saw the train they had not noticed it before though the tracks were almost beside them it was a locomotive and a single van of the type known as fortyandeight they got down from the cart it was dusk now the french soldiers finished fastening down the lid of the coffin they took it up and the three women and the two sergeants followed to the van and stopped again while the soldiers lifted the coffin into the open door then climbed in themselves and took up the coffin again and carried it forward out of sight and then reappeared and dropped one by one to the ground again in with you the french sergeant said and dont complain because you dont have seats theres plenty of clean straw and here it was an army blanket none of the three of them knew where he had got it from that is they had not noticed it before either then the american sergeant said something to the french one in his own language without doubt since it meant nothing to them not even when the french sergeant said attendez they just stood in the slow and failing light until the american sergeant returned carrying a wooden packingcase stencilled with the cryptic symbols of ordnance or supply that didnt matter either the american sergeant setting the box in place before the door and now they knew why with a little of surprise perhaps climbing in turn onto the box and then into the van into almost complete darkness with only one pale shapeless gleam from the coffins unpainted wood to break it they found the straw marthe spread the blanket on it and they sat down at that moment someone else sprang vaulted into the vana man a soldier by his silhouette in the door where there was still a little light an american soldier carrying something in both hands they smelled the coffee the american sergeant looming over them now saying very loud ici café café fumbling the three mugs down until marthe took them and distributed them feeling in her turn the mans hard hand gripping her hand and the mug both while he guided the spout of the coffee pot into the mug he even seemed to anticipate the jerk crying watch it in his own language a second or two before the shrill peanutparcher whistle which did not presage the lurch but rather accompanied it bracing himself against the wall as the van seemed to rush from immobility into a sort of frantic celerity with no transition whatever a gout of burning coffee leapt from the mug in her hand onto her lap then the three of them managed to brace themselves back against the wall too the whistle shrieking again shrill as friction as though it actually were friction not a warning of approach but a sound of protest and insensate anguish and indictment of the hard dark earth it rushed over the vast weight of dark sky it burrowed frantically beneath the constant and inviolable horizon it steadily clove this time the american sergeant knelt braced still using both hands again to fill the mugs but only half full now so that sitting against the wall they drank by installments the hot sweet comforting coffee the van rushing on through darkness themselves invisible even to one another in darkness even the gleam of the coffin at the other end of the van gone now and their own inert bodies now matched and reconciled with the vans speed it was as though there were no motion at all if it had not been for the springless vibration and the anguished shrieks from the engine from time to time when light returned the van had stopped it would be st mihiel they had told her st mihiel and this would be it even if there had not been that sixth sense even after almost four years that tells people when they are nearing home so as soon as the van stopped she had started to get up saying to the american sergeant st mihiel because at least he should understand that then in a sort of despair of urgency she even said began mon homme à moimon mari before she stopped the sergeant speaking himself now using one or two more of the few other words which were his french vocabulary no no no attention attention even in the vans darkness motioning downward at her with his hands as a trainer commands a dog to sit then he was gone silhouetted for another instant against the paler door and they waited huddled together now for warmth in the cold spring dawn the girl between them whether asleep or not whether she had ever slept during the night or not marthe could not tell though by her breathing marya the other sister was it was full light when the sergeant returned they were all three awake now who had slept or not slept they could see the first of saturdays sun and hear the eternal and perennial larks he had more coffee the pot filled again and this time he had bread too saying very loud monjay monjay and theyshecould see him nowa young man with a hard drafted face and with something else in itimpatience or commiseration she anyway could not tell which nor did she care thinking again to try once more to communicate with him except that the french sergeant at chalons had said that it was all arranged and suddenly it was not that she could trust the american sergeant because he must know what he was doing since he had obviously come along with them under orders but because shetheycould do little else so they ate the bread and drank the hot sweet coffee again the sergeant was gone again and they waited she had no way to mark or gauge how long then the sergeant sprang or vaulted into the van again and she knew that the moment was here this time the six soldiers who followed him were americans the three of them rose and stood and waited again while the six soldiers slid the coffin to the door then dropped to the ground invisible to them now so that the coffin itself seemed to flee suddenly through the door and vanish the three of them following to the door while the sergeant dropped through the door there was another box beneath the door for them to descend by into another bright morning blinking a little after the darkness in the sixth bright morning of that week during which there had been no rain nor adumbration at all then she saw the cart her own or theirs her husband standing beside the horses head while the six american soldiers slid the coffin into the cart and she turned to the american sergeant and said thank you in french and suddenly and a little awkwardly he removed his hat and shook her hand quick and hard then the other sisters and put his hat back on without once looking at or offering to touch the girl and she went on around the cart to where her husband stooda broad strong man in corduroy not as tall as she and definitely older they embraced then all four of them turned to the cart huddling for a moment in that indecision as people will but not for long there would not be room for all four of them on the seat but the girl had already solved that climbing up over the shafts and the seat and into the body of the cart to crouch huddle beside the coffin huddled into the shawl her face worn and sleepless and definitely needing soap and water now why yes sister marya the older sister said in her voice of happy astonishment almost of pleasure as though at so simple a solution ill ride back there too so the husband helped her up onto the shaft then over the seat where she sat also on the opposite side of the coffin then marthe mounted strongly and without assistance to the seat the husband following with the lines they were already on the edge of the city so they did not need to pass through it merely around it though actually there was no city no boundaries enclosing and postulating a city from a countryside because this was not even a war zone it was a battle zone city and countryside annealed and indistinguishable one from the other beneath one vast concentration of troops american and french not poised but rather as though transfixed suspended beneath within that vast silence and cessationall the clutter of battle in a state of arrestment like hypnosis motionless and silent transport dumps of ammunition and supplies and soon they began to pass the guns squatting in batteries facing eastward still manned but not poised either not waiting just silent following the now silent line of the old stubborn fouryear salient so that now they were seeing war or what six days ago had been warthe shellpocked fields the topless trees some of which this spring had put out a few green and stubborn shoots from the blasted trunksthe familiar land which they had not seen in almost four years but which was familiar still as though even war had failed to efface completely that old verity of peaceful human occupation but they were skirting the rubble of what had been viennelapucelle before it seemed to occur to her that there still might be dread and fear it was only then that she said to the husband in a voice that did not even reach the two others in the body of the cart the house the house was not damaged the husband said i dont know why but the fields the land ruined ruined it will take years and they wont even let me start now when they gave me permission to come back yesterday they forbade me to work them until they have gone over them to locate the shells which might not have exploded and the husband was right because here was the farm the land pitted not too severely some of the trees had not even been topped with shell craters where she herself had worked beside her husband in the tense seasons and which had been the life of the brother in the cheap coffin behind her in the cart and which was to have been his some day whom she had brought back to sleep in it then the house the husband had been right it was unmarked save for a pock a ragged gout of small holes in one wall which was probably a machinegun burst the husband not even looking at the house but getting down from the cart a little stiffly she remarked for the first time how his arthritis seemed to have increased to go and stand looking out over his ruined land nor did she enter the house either calling him by name then she said come now lets finish this first so he returned and entered the house apparently he had brought some of the tools back with him yesterday too because he reappeared at once with a spade and mounted the cart again though this time she had the lines as though she knew exactly where she wanted to go the cart moving again crossing the field now rank with weeds and wild poppies skirting the occasional craters on for perhaps half a kilometre to a bank beneath an ancient beech tree which also had escaped the shells the digging was easier here into the bank all of them taking turns the girl too though marthe tried once to dissuade her no she said let me let me be doing something though even then it took them a long time until the excavation was deep enough into the bank to contain the coffin the four of them now shoving and sliding the box back into the cave they had made the medal the husband said you dont want to put that in too i can open the box but marthe didnt even answer taking the shovel herself first until the husband relieved her of it and at last the bank was smooth again save for the shovel marks afternoon then and almost evening when they returned to the house and the three women entered it while the husband went on to the stable to put the horse up for the night she had not seen it in almost four years nor did she pause to examine it now she crossed the room and dropped almost tossed the medal onto the vacant mantel and then turned not really examining the room now the house had not been damaged merely eviscerated they had moved out what the cart would carry that day in and the husband had fetched that back with him yesterdayenough dishes and bedding the objects of no value which she had insisted on saving at the expense of things they would actually need when they returned she could not even remember now what she had felt thought then whether they would ever return or not if perhaps that anguished day had not been the actual end of home and hope nor did she try to remember now going on to the kitchen the husband had brought food and fuel for the stove and marya and the girl were already starting a fire in the stove again she said to the girl why dont you rest no the girl said again let me be doing something the lamp was lighted now it was that near to darkness before she noticed that the husband had not yet come in from the stable she knew at once where he would be motionless almost invisible in the faint last of light looking at his ruined land this time she approached and touched him come now she said supper is ready checking him again with her hand at the open lamplit door until he had seen the older sister and the girl moving between the stove and the table look at her she said she has nothing left she was not even kin to him she only loved him but he seemed incapable of remembering or grieving over anything but his land they had eaten the meal and he and she lay again in the familiar bed between the familiar walls beneath the familiar rafters he had gone to sleep at once though even as she lay rigid and sleepless beside him he flung his head suddenly and muttered cried the farm the land waking himself what he said what is it its all right she said go back to sleep because suddenly she knew that he was right stefan was gone all that was over done finished never to be recalled he had been her brother but she had been his mother too who knew now that she would have no children of her own and who had raised him from infancy france england america too by now probably were full of women who had given the lives of their sons to defend their countries and preserve justice and right who was she to demand uniqueness for grieving he was right it was the farm the land which was immune even to the blast and sear of war it would take work of course it might even take years of work but the four of them were capable of work more their palliation and their luck was the work they faced since work is the only anesthetic to which grief is vulnerable more still restoring the land would not only palliate the grief the minuscule integer of the farm would affirm that he had not died for nothing and that it was not for an outrage that they grieved but for simple grief the only alternative to which was nothing and between grief and nothing only the coward takes nothing so she even slept at last dreamless so dreamless that she did not know she had been asleep until someone was shaking her it was the older sister behind her the girl stood with her worn dirty sleepwalkers face which might be pretty again with a little soap and water and a week of proper food it was dawn and then she marthe heard the sound too even before the older sister cried listen sister the husband waking too to lie for an instant then surging upright among the tumbled bedclothing the guns he cried the guns the four of them transfixed for another ten or fifteen seconds like a tableau while the uproar of the barrage seemed to be rolling directly toward them transfixed still even after they began to hear above or beneath the steady roar of explosions the whistle of the shells passing over the house itself then the husband moved we must get out of here he said lurching plunging out of the bed where he would have fallen if she had not caught and held him up the four of them in their night clothing running across the room and then out of the house quitting one roof one ceiling only to run stumbling on their bare feet beneath that other one filled with thunder and demonic whistling not realising yet that the barrage was missing the house by two or three hundred metres the three women following the husband who seemed to know where he was going he did know a tremendous crater in the field which must have been from a big howitzer the four of them running stumbling among the dewheavy weeds and bloodred poppies down into the crater the husband pressing the three women against the wall beneath the lip facing the barrage where they crouched their heads bowed almost as though in prayer the husband crying steadily in a voice as thin and constant as a cicadas the land the land the land that is all of them except marthe she had not even stooped erect tall watching across the lip of the crater the barrage as it missed the house skirting the house and the farm buildings as neatly and apparently as intentionally as a scythe skirts a rosebush rolling on eastward across the field in one vast pall of dust filled with red flashes the dust still hanging in the air after the flashes of the shellbursts had winked and blinked rapidly on to disappear beyond the fields edge like a furious migration of gigantic daylighthaunting fireflies leaving behind only the thunder of their passing it too already beginning to diminish then marthe began to climb out of the crater she climbed rapid and strong agile as a goat kicking backward at the husband as he grasped at the hem of her nightdress and then at her bare feet up and out of the crater running strongly through the weeds and poppies dodging the sparse old craters until she reached the swathe of the barrage where the three still crouched in the crater could see her actually leaping across and among the thick new ones then the field was full of running mena ragged line of french and american troops which overtook and passed her they saw one either an officer or a sergeant pause and gesticulate at her his mouth open and soundless with yelling for a moment before he too turned and ran on with the rest of the charge the three of them out of the crater too now running and stumbling into the new craters and the fading dust and the fierce and fading stink of cordite at first they couldnt even find the bank and when they did at last the beech tree had vanished no mark nothing remained to orient by it was here sister the older sister cried but marthe didnt answer running strongly on they following until they too saw what she had apparently seenthe splinters and fragments whole limbs still intact with leaves scattered for a hundred metres when they overtook her she was holding in her hand a shard of the pale new unpainted wood which had been the coffin she spoke to the husband by name quite gently youll have to go back and get the shovel but before he could turn the girl had already passed him running frantic yet unerring deerlight among the craters and what remained of the weeds and the quenchless poppies getting smaller and smaller yet still running back toward the house that was sunday when the girl returned with the shovel still running they took turns with it all that day until it was too dark to see they found a few more shards and fragments of the coffin but the body itself was gone tomorrow once more there were twelve of them though this time they were led by a sergeant the carriage was a special one though it was still third class the seats had been removed from the forward compartment and on the floor of it rested a new empty military coffin the thirteen of them had left paris at midnight and by the time they reached st mihiel they were already fairly drunk because the job mission was going to be an unpleasant one now that peace and victory had really come to western europe in november six months after the false armistice in may that curious weeks holiday which the war had taken which had been so false that they remembered it only as phenomena and a man even though still in uniform might have thought himself free at least until they started the next one of yesterdays cadavers so they had been issued an extra wine and brandy ration to compensate for this in charge of the sergeant who was to have doled it out to them at need but the sergeant who had not wanted the assignment either was a dour introvert who had secluded himself in an empty compartment forward with a pornographic magazine as soon as the train left paris but alert for the opportunity when the sergeant quitted his compartment at chalons they didnt know why nor bother perhaps to find a urinal possibly it was merely official two of them one had been a fairly successful picklock in civilian life before and planned to resume that vocation as soon as he was permitted to doff his uniform entered the compartment and opened the sergeants valise and extracted two bottles of brandy from it so when the barleduc express dropped their carriage at st mihiel where the local for verdun would engage it they except the sergeant were a shade better than fairly drunk and when shortly after daylight the local set the carriage on a repaired siding in the rubble of verdun they were even another shade better than that by that time also the sergeant had discovered the ravishing of his valise and counted the remaining bottles and what with the consequent uproar of his outraged and angry denunciation plus their own condition they did not even notice the old woman at first only then to remark that there had been something almost like a committee waiting for them as though word of the time of their arrival and their purpose too had preceded thema clump a huddle a small group all men save one of laborers from the town and peasants from the adjacent countryside watching them quietly while the sergeant carrying the valise snarled and cursed at them out of which that one the old woman had darted at once and was now tugging at the sergeants sleevea peasant woman older in appearance than in years when seen close with a worn lined face which looked as though she too had not slept much lately but which was now tense and even alight with a sort of frantic eagerness and hope eh the sergeant said at last what what is it you want you are going out to the forts she said we know why take me with you you the sergeant said now they were all listening what for its theodule she said my son they told me he was killed there in but they didnt send him back home and they wont let me go out there and find him find him the sergeant said after three years i will know him she said only let me go and look i will know him you have a mother think how she would grieve for you if you had died and they had not sent you home take me with you i will know him i tell you i will know him at once come now she was clinging to his arm now while he tried to shake her loose let go he said i cant take you out there without an order even if i would weve got a job to do you would be in the way let go but she still clung to the sergeants arm looking about at the other faces watching her her own face eager and unconvinced boyschildren she said you have mothers toosome of you let go the sergeant said swapping the valise to the other hand and jerking himself free this time gwan beat it taking her by the shoulders the valise pressed against her back and turning her and propelling her across the platform toward the quiet group which had been watching too there aint nothing out there anymore by now but rotten meat you couldnt find him even if you went i can she said i know i can i sold the farm i tell you i have money i can pay you not me the sergeant said not but that if i had my way you could go out there and find yours and bring another one back for us and we would wait for you here but you aint going he released her speaking almost gently you go on back home and forget about this is your husband with you he is dead too we lived in the morbihan when the war was over i sold the farm and came here to find theodule then go on back to wherever it is you are living now because you cant go with us but she went no further than the group she had emerged from to turn and stand again watching the worn sleepless face still eager unconvinced indomitable while the sergeant turned back to his squad and stopped and gave them another scathing and introverted look all right he said at last all of you that aint seeing double lets go because i dont want to mess around out there long enough to get one stinking carcass let alone two how about a drink first one said try and get it want me to carry your grip sarge another said the sergeants answer was simple brief and obscene he turned they followed raggedly a lorry a closed van was waiting for them with a driver and a corporal they drew the empty coffin from its compartment and carried it to the van and slid it inside and got in themselves there was straw for them to sit on the sergeant himself sat on the coffin the valise in his lap and one hand still gripping the handle as if he expected one or maybe all of them to try to snatch it from him the lorry moved dont we get any breakfast one said you drank yours the sergeant said after you stole it first but there was breakfast bread and coffee at a zinc bar in a tiny bistro for some inscrutable reason untouched by the shelling except that it had a new americanmade sheetiron roof which stuck upward from the tumbled masses of collapsed walls surrounding and enclosing it that was arranged too the meal was already paid for from paris christ one said the army sure wants this corpse bad if they have started buying grub from civilians the sergeant ate with the valise on the bar before him between his arms then they were in the lorry again the sergeant gripping the valise on his lap now through the open rear door of the lorry as it crept between the piles of rubble and the old craters they were able to see something of the ruined citythe mountains and hills of shattered masonry which men were already at work clearing away and out of which there rose already an astonishing number of the americanmade iron roofs to glint like silver in the morning sun maybe the americans had not fought all the war but at least they were paying for the restoration of its devastation that is the sergeant could have seen it because almost at once his men had entered a state resembling coma even before they had crossed the meuse bridge and reached the corner where in time the five heroicsized figures would stare steadily and indomitably eastward in basrelief from the symbolical section of stone bastion which would frame and contain them or rather the sergeant could have been able to sitting with the valise huddled between his arms on his lap like a mother with a sick baby watching them intently for perhaps another ten minutes where they lay sprawled against one another in the straw the lorry well out of the city now then he rose still carrying the valise there was a small sliding panel in the lorrys front wall he opened it and spoke rapidly and quietly for a moment with the corporal beside the driver then he unlocked the valise and took all the bottles save one of brandy out of it and passed them to the corporal and locked the valise on the single remaining bottle and returned and sat on the coffin again the valise huddled again on his lap so now as the lorry climbed the repaired road to follow the curve of the meuse heights the sergeant at least could watch beyond the open door the ruined and slain land unfoldthe corpse of earth some of which its soil soured forever with cordite and human blood and anguish would never live again as though not only abandoned by man but repudiated forever by god himself the craters the old trenches and rusted wire the stripped and blasted trees the little villages and farms like shattered skulls no longer even recognisable as skulls already beginning to vanish beneath a fierce rank colorless growth of nourishmentless grass coming not tenderly out of the earths surface but as though miles and leagues up from hell itself as if the devil himself were trying to hide what man had done to the earth which was his mother then the battered fort which nevertheless had endured steadfast still even though france civilization no longer needed it steadfast still even if only to taint the air not only more than two years after the battle had ended and the mass rotting should have annealed itself but more than twice that many months after the war itself had stopped because as soon as the sergeant standing now and clasping the valise to his breast roused them with the side of his boot they were already smelling it who had not thought they would have to begin that until they were actually inside the fort though once the sergeant had kicked and cursed the last of them out of the lorry they saw whya midden of white bones and skulls and some still partly covered with strips and patches of what looked like brown or black leather and boots and stained uniforms and now and then what would be an intact body wrapped in a fragment of tarpaulin beside one of the low entrances in the stone wall while they watched two more soldiers in butchers aprons and with pieces of cloth bound over their nostrils and lower faces emerged from the low entrance carrying between them a twoman wheelless barrow heaped with more scraps and fragments of the forts old defenders in time there would be a vast towered chapel an ossuary visible for miles across the heights like the faintly futuristic effigy of a gigantic gray goose or an iguanodon created out of gray stone not by a sculptor but by expert masonsa long tremendous nave enclosed by niches in each of which a light would burn always the entrance to each arched with the carven names taken not from identity discs but from regimental lists since there would be nothing to match them withsquatting over the vast deep pit into which the now clean inextricable anonymous bones of what had been man men would be shoveled and sealed facing it would be the slope white with the orderly parade of christian crosses bearing the names and regimental designations of the bones which could be identified and beyond it that other slope ranked not with crosses but with rounded headstones set faintly but intractably oblique to face where mecca was set with a consistent and almost formal awryness and carved in cryptic and indecipherable hieroglyph because the bones here had been identifiable too which had once been men come this far from their hot sun and sand this far from home and all familiar things to make this last sacrifice in the northern rain and mud and cold for what cause unless their leaders ignorant too could have explained some of it a little of it to them in their own tongue but now there only the duncolored battered and enduring walls of the fortress flanked by the rounded sunken concrete domes of machinegun placements like giant mushrooms and the midden and the two soldiers in butchers aprons dumping their barrow onto it then turning with the empty barrow to look at them for a moment above the taut rags over their nostrils and mouths with the fixed exhaustless unseeing unrecognising glares of sleepwalkers in nightmares before descending the steps again and over all permeant and invincible the odor the smell as though victims of man and therefore quit of him they had bequeathed him that which had already been invulnerable to him for three years and would still be for thirty more or even three hundred more so that all that remained to him was to abandon it flee it they looked at the midden then at the low orifice in the dun stone through which the two soldiers with the barrow had seemed to plunge drop as though into the bowels of the earth they did not know yet that in their eyes too now was that fixed assuageless glare of nightmares christ one said lets grab one off that dump there and get the hell out of here no the sergeant said there was something behind his voice not vindictiveness so much as repressed gleeful anticipationif they had known it he had worn his uniform ever since september without ever having become a soldier he could remain in it for another decade and still would not be one he was an office man meticulous and reliable his files were never out of order his returns never late he neither drank nor smoked he had never heard a gun fired in his life save the amateur sportsmen banging away at whatever moved on sunday morning around the little loire village where he had been born and lived until his motherland demanded him perhaps all this was why he had been given this assignment no he said the order says proceed to verdun and thence with expedition and despatch to the catacombs beneath the fort of valaumont and extricate therefrom one complete cadaver of one french soldier unidentified and unidentifiable either by name regiment or rank and return with it and thats what were going to do get on with you forward lets have a drink first one said no the sergeant said afterward get it loaded into the lorry first come on sarge another said think what that stink will be down that hole no i tell you the sergeant said get on there forward he didnt lead them he drove herded them to bow their heads one by one into the stone tunnel to drop plunge in their turn down the steep pitch of the stone stairs as though into the bowels of the earth into damp and darkness though presently from beyond where the stairs flattened at last into a tunnel they could see a faint unsteady red gleam not of electricity it was too red and unsteady but from torches they were torches there was one fastened to the wall beside the first doorless opening in the wall and now they could see one another binding across their nostrils and lower faces what soiled handkerchiefs and filthy scraps of rag which they found on themselves one who apparently had neither was holding the collar of his coat across his face huddling and then halting here because an officer his face swatched to the eyes in a silk one had emerged from the opening huddling back against the wall of the narrow tunnel while the sergeant with his valise came forward and saluted and presented his order to the officer who opened it and glanced briefly at it then turned his head and spoke back into the room behind him and a corporal carrying an electric torch and a folded stretcher came out he had a gasmask slung about his neck then the corporal with his torch leading now and the foremost man carrying the stretcher they went on again between the sweating walls the floor itself beneath the feet viscous and greasy so that there was a tendency to slip passing the doorless orifices in the walls beyond which they could see the tiered bunks in which in time during those five months in men had actually learned to sleep beneath the muted thunder and the trembling of the earth the smell which above ground had had a sort of vividness as though even yet partaking invincibly still of something of that motion which is life not increasing so much as becoming familiaran old stale dead and worn accustomedness which man would never eradicate and so in time would even get used to and even cease to smell ita smell subterrene and claustrophobe and doomed to darkness not alone of putrefaction but of fear and old sweat and old excrement and endurance fear attenuated to that point where it must choose between coma and madness and in the intermittent coma no longer feared but merely stank more soldiers in pairs with masked faces and heaped barrows or stretchers passed them suddenly more sweating and viscid stairs plunged away beneath them at the foot of the stairs the tunnel made a sharp angle no longer floored and walled and roofed with concrete and turning the corner behind the corporal it was no longer a tunnel even but an excavation a cavern a cave a great niche dug out of one wall in which during the height of the battle when there had been no other way to dispose of them the bodies which had merely been killed and the ones which had been killed and dismembered too in the fort or the connecting machinegun pits had been tumbled and covered with earth the tunnel itself continuing on beyond it a timbershored burrow not even high enough for a man to stand erect in through or beyond which they now saw a steady white glare which would have to be electricity from which as they watched two more hooded and aproned soldiers emerged carrying a stretcher with what would be an intact body this time wait here the corporal said my orders say the sergeant said your orders the corporal said we got a system here we do things our way down here youre on active service pal just give me two of your men and the stretcher though you can come too if you think nothing less will keep your nose clean thats what i intend to do the sergeant said my orders say but the corporal didnt wait going on the two with the stretcher the sergeant stooping last to enter the further tunnel the valise still clasped against his breast like a sick child it did not take them long as if there were plenty in the next traverse to choose from almost at once it seemed to the remaining ten they saw the sergeant come stooping out of the burrow still clasping the valise followed by the two men with the burdened stretcher at a sort of stumbling run then last the corporal who didnt even pause walking around the stretcher where the two bearers had dropped it already going on toward the stairs until the sergeant stopped him wait the sergeant said the valise now clasped under one arm while he produced his order and a pencil from inside his coat and shook the folded order open we got systems in paris too its a frenchman right the corporal said its all here nothing missing right the corporal said no identification of name regiment or rank right the corporal said then sign it the sergeant said holding out the pencil as the corporal approached you he said to the nearest man about face and bend over which the man did the sergeant holding the paper flat on his bowed back while the corporal signed your lieutenant will have to sign too the sergeant said taking the pencil from the corporal you might go on ahead and tell him right the corporal said going on again all right the sergeant said to the stretcher bearers get it out of here not yet the first stretcher bearer said were going to have that drink first no the sergeant said when we get it into the lorry he had not wanted the assignment and indeed he did not belong here because this time they simply took the valise away from him in one concerted move of the whole twelve of them not viciously savagely just rapidly with no heat at all but almost impersonal almost inattentive as you might rip a last years calendar from the wall to kindle a fire with it the expicklock didnt even pretend to conceal his action this time producing his instrument in plain view the others crowding around him as he opened the valise or they thought the rapidity and ease of the valises rape had been because they were too many for the sergeant staring down at the single bottle it contained with shock then outrage and then with something like terror while the sergeant stood back and over them laughing steadily down at them with a sort of vindictive and triumphant pleasure wheres the rest of it one said i threw it away the sergeant said poured it out poured it out hell another said he sold it when another said when did he have a chance to or pour it out either while we were all asleep in the lorry coming out here i wasnt asleep the second said all right all right the expicklock said what does it matter what he did with it its gone well drink this one wheres your corkscrew he said to a third one but the man already had the corkscrew out opening the bottle okay the expicklock said to the sergeant you go on and report to the officer and well take it up and be putting it into the coffin right the sergeant said taking up the empty valise i want to get out of here too i dont even need to want a drink to prove i dont like this he went on they emptied the bottle rapidly passing it from one to another and flung it away all right the expicklock said grab that thing up and lets get out of here because already he was the leader none to say or know or even care when it had happened because they were not drunk now not inebriates but madmen the last brandy lying in their stomachs cold and solid as balls of ice as they almost ran with the stretcher up the steep stairs where is it then the one pressing behind the expicklock said he gave it to that corporal riding up front the expicklock said through that panel while we were asleep they burst out into the air the world earth and sweet air again where the lorry waited the driver and the corporal standing with a group of men some distance away they had all heard the expicklock and dropped the stretcher without even pausing and were rushing toward the lorry until the expicklock stopped them hold it he said ill do it but the missing bottles were nowhere in the lorry the expicklock returned to the stretcher call that corporal over here one said i know how to make him tell where it is fool the expicklock said if we start something now dont you know whatll happen hell call the mps and put us all under arrest and get a new guard from the adjutant in verdun we cant do anything here weve got to wait till we get back to verdun whatll we do in verdun another said buy some liquor with what you couldnt get one franc out of the whole lot of us with a suction pump morache can sell his watch a fourth said but will he a fifth said they all looked at morache forget that now morache said picklocks right the first thing to do is to get back to verdun come up lets get this thing into that box they carried the stretcher to the lorry and lifted the sheeted body into it the lid of the coffin had not been fastened down a hammer and nails were inside the coffin they tumbled the body into it whether faceup or facedown they didnt know and didnt bother and replaced the top and caught the nails enough to hold it shut then the sergeant with his now empty valise climbed through the rear door and sat again on the coffin the corporal and the driver obviously had returned too because at once the lorry moved the twelve men sitting on the straw against the walls quiet now outwardly as decorous as wellbehaved children but actually temporarily insane capable of anything talking occasionally among themselves peacefully idle and extraneous while the lorry returned to verdun until they were actually in the city again and the lorry had stopped before a door beside which a sentry stood obviously the commandants headquarters and the sergeant began to get up from the coffin then picklock made one last effort i understood orders said we were to have brandy not just to go to valaumont and get the body out but to get it back to paris or am i wrong if you are who made you wrong the sergeant said he looked down at picklock a moment longer then he turned toward the door it was as though he too had recognised picklock as their leader ill have to sign some bumf here take it on to the station and load it into the carriage and wait for me there then well have lunch right picklock said the sergeant dropped to the ground and vanished at once even before the lorry had begun to move again their whole air atmosphere changed as if their very characters and personalities had altered or not altered but rather as if they had shed masks or cloaks their very speech was short rapid succinct cryptic at times even verbless as if they did not need to communicate but merely to prompt one another in one mutual prescient cognizance moraches watch one said hold it picklock said the station first tell him to hurry then another said ill do it he said starting to get up hold it i said picklock said gripping him do you want mps so they stopped talking and just sat immobile and in motion furious in immobility like men strained against a pyramid as if they were straining at the back of the moving lorry itself with the urgency of their passion and need the lorry stopped they were already getting out of it the first ones dropping to the ground before it had stopped moving their hands already on the coffin the platform was empty now or so they thought would have thought if they had noticed which they didnt not even looking that way as they dragged the coffin out of the lorry almost running again across the platform with it toward where the carriage waited on the siding not until a hand began to tug at picklocks sleeve an urgent voice at his elbow saying mister corporal mister corporal picklock looked down it was the old woman of the morning whose son had died in the verdun battle beat it grandma picklock said twitching his arm free come on get that door open but the old woman still clung to him speaking still with that terrible urgency youve got one it might be theodule i will know let me look at him beat it i tell you picklock said were busy so it was not picklock at all leader though he was but one of the others who said suddenly and sharply hissing it wait though in the next second the same idea seemed to occur to them all one end of the box resting now on the floor of the carriage and four of them braced to shove it the rest of the way all of them paused now looking back while the speaker continued you said something this morning about selling a farm selling my farm the woman said money the other said in his hissing undertone yes yes the old woman said fumbling under her shawl and producing an aged reticule almost as large as the sergeants valise now picklock did take charge hold it he said over his shoulder then to the old woman if we let you look at him will you buy two bottles of brandy make it three a third said and in advance a fourth said she cant tell anything from whats in that box now i can she said i will know just let me look all right picklock said go and get two bottles of brandy and you can look at him hurry now before the sergeant gets back yes yes she said and turned running stiffly and awkwardly clutching the reticule back across the platform all right picklock said get it inside one of you get the hammer out of the lorry luckily their orders had been not to drive the nails home but merely to secure the lid temporarily apparently the body was to be transferred to something a little more elegant or anyway commensurate with its purpose when it reached paris so they could draw them without difficulty which they did and removed the lid and then recoiled from the thin burst gout of odor which rushed up at them almost visibly like thin smokeone last faint thin valedictory of corruption and mortality as if the corpse itself had hoarded it for three years against this moment or any similar one with the gleeful demonic sentience of a small boy then the old woman returned clasping two bottles against her breast still running or at least trotting panting now shaking almost as though from physical exhaustion because she couldnt even climb the steps when she reached the door so that two of them dropped to the ground and lifted her bodily into the carriage a third one took the bottles from her though she didnt seem to notice it for a second or so she couldnt even seem to see the coffin then she saw it and half knelt half collapsed at the head of it and turned the tarpaulin back from what had been a face theythe speakerhad been right she could have told nothing from the face because it was no longer man then they knew that she was not even looking at it just kneeling there one hand resting on what had been the face and the other caressing what remained of its hair she said yes yes this is theodule this is my son suddenly she rose strongly now and faced them pressing back against the coffin looking rapidly from face to face until she found picklock her voice was calm and strong too i must have him you said just to look at him picklock said he is my son he must go home i have money i will buy you a hundred bottles of brandy or the money itself if you want it how much will you give picklock said she didnt even hesitate she handed him the unopened reticule count it yourself she said but how are you going to get ithim away from here you cant carry it i have a horse and cart its been behind the station yonder ever since we heard yesterday what you were coming for heard how picklock said this is official business does that matter she said almost impatiently count it but picklock didnt open the reticule yet he turned to morache go with her and get the cart bring it up to the window on the other side make it snappy landryll be back any minute now it didnt take long they got the window up almost immediately morache brought the cart up the big farmhorse going at a heavy and astonished gallop morache snatched it to a halt already the others in the carriage had the sheeted body balanced on the window sill morache handed the lines to the old woman on the seat beside him and vaulted over the seat and snatched the body down into the cart and vaulted to the ground beside it at that moment picklock inside the carriage tossed the reticule through the window into the cart go on morache said to the old woman get the hell out of here quick then she was gone morache reentered the carriage how much was it he said to picklock i took a hundred francs picklock said a hundred francs another said with incredulous amazement yes picklock said and tomorrow ill be ashamed i took even that much but that will be a bottle apiece he handed the money to the man who had spoken last go and get it then to the others get that lid back on what are you waiting for anyway for landry to help you they replaced the coffin lid and set the nails in the old holes the absolute minimum of prudence would have dictated or at least suggested a weight of some kind any kind in the coffin first but they were not concerned with prudence the ganymede returned clasping a frayed wicker basket to his breast they snatched it from him before he could even get into the carriage the owner of the corkscrew opening the bottles rapidly as they were passed to him he said to bring the basket back the ganymede said take it back then picklock said and then no more of that either the hands snatching at the bottles almost before the corks were out so that when the sergeant returned about an hour later his outragenot rage outrageknew no bounds but this time he was impotent because they were indeed in coma now sprawled and snoring in one inextricable filth of straw and urine and vomit and spilled brandy and empty bottles invulnerable and immune in that nepenthe when toward the end of the afternoon an engine coupled onto the carriage and took it back to st mihiel and set it off on another siding and waking them only because of the glare of yellow light which now filled the carriage through the windows and the sound of hammers against the outside of it which roused picklock clasping his throbbing head and shutting his eyes quickly against that unbearable glare it seemed to him that there had never been so fierce a sunrise it was almost like electricity he didnt see how he could move beneath it to rise and even on his feet staggering until he braced himself he didnt see how he had accomplished the feat bracing himself against the wall while he kicked the others one by one into sentience or anyway consciousness get up he said get up weve got to get out of here where are we one said paris picklock said its already tomorrow oh christ a voice said because they were all awake now waking not into remembering since even comatose they had not really forgotten but into simple realisation like sleepwalkers waking to find themselves standing on the outside of fortystorey window ledges they were not drunk now they didnt even have time to be sick christ yes the voice said they got up staggering for balance shaking and trembling and stumbled through the door and huddled blinking against the fierce glare until they could bear it except that it was electricity it was still last night or perhaps tomorrow night for all they knew or for the moment cared even two searchlights such as anti aircraft batteries had used against nightflying aeroplanes during the war trained on the carriage and in the glare of which men on ladders were nailing long strips of black and funereal bunting along the eaves of the carriage to whomwhichthey paid no attention nor was it paris either were still in verdun another said then theyve moved the station around to the other side of the tracks picklock said anyway its not paris a third said ive got to have a drink no picklock said youll take coffee and something to eat he turned to the ganymede how much money have you got left i gave it to you the ganymede said damn that picklock said extending his hand come on with it the ganymede fumbled out a small wad of paper notes and coins picklock took and counted it rapidly it might do he said come on there was a small bistro opposite the station he led the way to it and insidea small zinc bar at which a single man stood in a countrymans corduroy coat and two tables where other men in the rough clothes of farmers or laborers sat with glasses of coffee or wine playing dominoes all of them turning to look as picklock led his party in and up to the bar where a tremendous woman in black said messieurs coffee madame and bread if you have it picklock said i dont want coffee the third said i want a drink sure picklock said in a calm and furious voice even lowering it a little stick around here until somebody comes and lifts that box let alone opens it i hear they always give you a drink before you climb the steps maybe we could find another a fourth began shut up picklock said drink that coffee ive got to think then a new voice spoke whats the matter it said you boys in trouble it was the man who had been standing at the bar when they entered they looked at him nowa solid stocky man obviously a farmer not quite as old as they had thought with a round hard ungullible head and a ribbon in the lapel of the coatnot one of the best ones but still a good one matching in fact one which picklock himself wore possibly that was why he spoke to them he and picklock watching one another for a moment whered you get it picklock said combles the stranger said so was i picklock said you in a jam of some sort the stranger said what makes you think that picklock said look buster the stranger said maybe you were under sealed orders when you left paris but there hasnt been much secret about it since your sergeant got out of that carriage this afternoon what is he anyway some kind of a reformist preacher like they say they have in england and america he was sure in a state he didnt seem to care a damn that you were drunk what seemed to fry him was how you managed to get twelve more bottles of brandy without him knowing how you did it this afternoon picklock said you mean its still today where are we st mihiel you lay over here tonight while they finish nailing enough black cloth on your carriage to make it look like a hearse tomorrow morning a special train will pick you up and take you on to paris whats wrong did something happen suddenly picklock turned come on back here he said the stranger followed they stood slightly apart from the others now in the angle of the bar and the rear wall picklock spoke rapidly yet completely telling it all the stranger listening quietly what you need is another body the stranger said youre telling me picklock said why not ive got one in my field i found it the first time i plowed i reported it but they havent done anything about it yet ive got a horse and cart here it will take about four hours to go and come they looked at one another youve got all nightthat is now all right picklock said how much youll have to say youre the one that knows how bad you need it we havent got any money you break my heart the stranger said they looked at one another without removing his eyes picklock raised his voice a little morache morache came up the watch picklock said wait now morache said it was a swiss movement in gold he had wanted one ever since he saw one first finding it at last on the wrist of a german officer lying wounded in a shell crater one night after he morache had got separated from a patrol sent out to try for a live prisoner or at least one still alive enough to speak he even saw the watch first before he saw who owned it having hurled himself into the crater just in time before a flare went up seeing the glint of the watch first in the corpseglare of the magnesium before he saw the mana colonel apparently shot through the spine since he seemed to be merely paralysed quite conscious and not even in much pain he would have been exactly what they had been sent out to find except for the watch so morache murdered him with his trench knife a shot here now would probably have brought a whole barrage down on him and took the watch and lay just outside his own wire until the patrol came back emptyhanded and found him though for a day or so he couldnt seem to bring himself to wear the watch nor even look at it until he remembered that his face had been blackened at the time and the german could not have told what he was even let alone who besides that the man was dead now wait he said wait now sure picklock said wait in that carriage yonder until they come for that box i dont know what theyll do to you then but i do know what theyll do if you run because that will be desertion he held out his hand the watch morache unstrapped the watch and handed it to picklock at least get some brandy too he said the stranger reached for the watch in picklocks hand whoa look at it from there picklock said holding the watch on his raised open palm sure you can have brandy the stranger said picklock closed his hand over the watch and let the hand drop how much he said fifty francs the stranger said two hundred picklock said a hundred francs two hundred picklock said wheres the watch the stranger said wheres the cart picklock said it took them a little over four hours youd have to wait anyhow until they finish nailing up that black cloth and get away from the carriage the stranger said and there were four of them two more will be enough the stranger said we can drive right up to ithimself and the stranger on the seat morache and another behind them in the cart north and eastward out of the town into the country darkness the horse itself taking the right road without guidance knowing that it was going home in the darkness the steady jounce of jogging horse and the thump and rattle of the cart a sound and a vibration instead of a progress so that it was the roadside trees which seemed to move wheeling up out of the darkness to rush slowly backward past them against the sky but they were moving even though it did seem to picklock forever the roadside trees ravelling suddenly into a straggle of posts the horse still without guidance swinging sharply to the left sector huh picklock said yeah the stranger said the americans broke it in september viennelapucelle yonder he said pointing it caught it it was right up in the tip not long now but it was a little longer than that though at last they were therea farm and its farmyard lightless the stranger stopped the horse and handed picklock the lines ill get a shovel im going to throw in a groundsheet too he was not long passing the shovel and the folded groundsheet to the two in the back and mounting the seat again and took the lines the horse lurching forward and making a determined effort to turn in the farmyard gate until the stranger reined it sharply away then a gate in a hedgerow morache got down and opened it for the cart to pass leave it open the stranger said well close it when we come out which morache did and swung up and into the cart as it passed him they were in a field now soft from plowing the unguided horse still choosing its own unerring way no longer a straight course now but weaving at times almost doubling on itself though picklock could still see nothing dud shells the stranger explained fenced off with flags until they finish getting them out we just plow circles around them according to the women and the old men who were here then the whole war started up again after that recess they took last may right in that field yonder it belongs to some people named demont the man died that same summer i guess two wars on his land only a week apart was too much for him his widow works it now with a hired man not that she needs him she can run a plow as good as he can theres another one her sister she does the cooking she has flies up here he was standing now peering ahead in silhouette against the sky he tapped the side of his head suddenly he swung the horse sharply away and presently stopped it here we are he said about fifty metres yonder on that bank dividing us there used to be the finest beech tree in this country my grandfather said that even his grandfather couldnt remember when it was a sapling it probably went that same day too all right he said lets get him up you dont want to waste any time here either he showed them where his plow had first exposed the corpse and he had covered it again and marked the place it was not deep and they could see nothing and after this length of time or perhaps because it was only one there was little odor either the long inextricable mass of light bones and cloth soon up and out and on and then into the folds of the groundsheet and then in the cart itself the horse thinking that this time surely it was destined for its stall trying even in the soft earth of the plowing to resume its heavy musclebound jog morache closing the hedge gate and having to run now to catch the cart again because the horse was now going at a heavy canter even against the lines trying again to swing into the farmyard until the stranger sawed it away using the whip now until he got it straightened out on the road back to st mihiel a little more than four hours but perhaps it should have been the town was dark now and the bistro they had started from a clump of shadow detaching itself from a greater mass of shadow and itself breaking into separate shapes as the nine others surrounded the cart the cart itself not stopping but going steadily on toward where the carriage in its black pall of bunting had vanished completely into the night but it was there the ones who had remained in town had even drawn the nails again so that all necessary was to lift off the top and drag the groundsheeted bundle through the window and dump it in and set the nails again drive them in picklock said who cares about noise now where is the brandy its all right a voice said how many bottles did you open one a voice said counting from where why should we lie when all youve got to do to prove it is to count the others the voice said all right picklock said get out of here now and shut the window then they were on the ground again the stranger had never quitted his cart and this time surely the horse was going home but they didnt wait for that departure they turned as one already running clotting and jostling a little at the carriage door but plunging at last back into their lightless catafalque as into the womb itself they were safe now they had a body and drink to take care of the night there was tomorrow and paris of course but god could take care of that carrying the gather of eggs in the loop of her apron marya the elder sister crossed the yard toward the house as though borne on a soft and tender cloud of white geese they surrounded and enclosed her as though with a tender and eager yearning two of them one on either side kept absolute pace with her pressed against her skirts their long undulant necks laid flat against her moving flanks their heads tilted upward the hard yellow beaks open slightly like mouths the hard insentient eyes filmed over as with a sort of ecstasy right up to the stoop itself when she mounted it and opened the door and stepped quickly through and closed it the geese swarming and jostling around and over and onto the stoop itself to press against the doors blank wood their necks extended and the heads fallen a little back as though on the brink of swoons making with their hoarse harsh unmusical voices faint tender cries of anguish and bereavement and unassuageable grief this was the kitchen already strong with the approaching middays soup she didnt even stop putting the eggs away lifting for a moment the lid of the simmering pot on the stove then placed rapidly on the wooden table a bottle of wine a glass a soup bowl a loaf a napkin and spoon then on through the house and out the front door giving onto the lane and the field beyond it where she could already see themthe horse and harrow and the man guiding them the hired man they had had since the death of her sisters husband four years ago and the sister herself moving across the lands panorama like a ritual her hand and arm plunging into the sack slung from her shoulder to emerge in that long sweep which is the second oldest of mans immemorial gestures or acts shemaryarunning now skirting among the old craters picketed off by tiny stakes bearing scraps of red cloth where the rank and lifeless grass grew above the unexploded shells already saying crying in her bright serene and carrying voice sister here is the young englishman come for the medal there are two of them coming up the lane a friend with him the sister said not a friend marya said this one is looking for a tree a tree the sister said yes sister cant you see him and themselves in the lane now they could see them bothtwo men obviously but even at that distance one of them moving not quite like a human being and in time nearer not like a human being at all beside the others tall and shambling gait but at a slow and terrific lurch and heave like some kind of giant insect moving erect and seeming to possess no progress at all even before marya said hes on crutches the single leg swinging metronome and indefatigable yet indomitable too between the rhythmic twin counterstrokes of the crutches interminable yet indomitable too and indubitably coming nearer until they could see that the arm on that side was gone somewhere near the elbow also and quite near now that what they looked at was not even a whole man since one half of his visible flesh was one furious saffron scar beginning at the ruined homburg hat and dividing his face exactly down the bridge of the nose across the mouth and chin to the collar of his shirt but this seemed to be only outside because the voice was strong and unpitying and the french he addressed them in was fluid and good and it was only the man with him who was sicka tall thin cadaver of a man whole to be sure and looking no less like a tramp but with a sick insolent intolerable face beneath a filthy hat from the band of which there stood a long and raking feather which made him at least eight feet tall madame demont the first man said yes marya said with her bright and tender and unpitying smile the man with the crutches turned to his companion all right he said in french this is them go ahead but marya had not waited for him speaking to the man on crutches in french we were waiting for you the soup is ready and you must be hungry after your walk from the station then she too turned to the other speaking not in french now but in the old balkan tongue of her childhood you too you will need to eat for a little while longer too what the sister said suddenly and harshly then to the man with the feather in the same mountain tongue you are zsettlani what the man with the feather said in french harshly and loudly i speak french i will take soup too i can pay for it see he said thrusting his hand into his pocket look we know you have money marya said in french come into the house and in the kitchen now they could see the rest of the first man the saffroncolored scar not stopping at the hats line but dividing the skull too into one furious and seared rigidity no eye no ear on that side of it the corner of the mouth seized into rigidity as if it was not even the same face which talked and presently would chew and swallow the filthy shirt held together at the throat by the frayed and faded stripes of what they did not know was a british regimental tie the stained and soiled dinner jacket from the left breast of which two medals hung from their gaudy ribbons the battered and filthy tweed trousers one leg of which was doubled back and up and fastened below the thigh with a piece of wire the englishman propped on the crutches for a moment yet in the center of the kitchen looking about the room with that alert calm unpitying eye while his companion stood just inside the door behind him with his ravaged insolent peaceless face still wearing the hat whose feather now almost touched the ceiling as though he were suspended from it so this is where he lived the man with the crutches said yes marthe said how did you know how did you know where to find us now sister marya said how could he have come for the medal if he didnt know where we were the medal the englishman said yes marya said but have your soup first you are hungry thanks the englishman said he jerked his head toward the man behind him he too is he invited too of course marya said she took two of the bowls from the table and went to the stove not offering to help him nor could the sister marthe have moved fast or quickly enough to help him as he swung the one leg over the wooden bench and propped the crutches beside him and was already uncorking the wine before the whole man at the door had even moved marya lifting the lid from the pot and halfturning to look back at the second man saying in french this time sit down you can eat too nobody minds any more minds what the man with the feather said harshly we have forgotten it marya said take off your hat first i can pay you the man with the feather said you cant give me anything see he reached into his pocket and jerked his hand out already scattering the coins flinging them toward and onto and past the table scattering and clinking across the floor as he approached and flung himself onto the backless bench opposite the englishman and reached for the wine bottle and a tumbler in one voracious motion pick up your money marya said pick it up yourself if you dont want it there the man said filling the tumbler splashing the wine into it until it was overfull already raising the tumbler toward his mouth leave it now marthe said give him his soup she had moved not quite enough to stand behind the englishman but rather over him her hands resting one in the other her high severe mountain face which would have been bold and handsome as a mans looking down at him while he reached and poured from the bottle and set the bottle down and raised his glass until he was looking at her across it health madame he said but how did you know marthe said when did you know him i never knew him i never saw him i heard about himthemwhen i came back out in then i learned what it was and so after that i didnt need to see himonly to wait and keep out of his way until he would be ready to do the needing bring the soup the man with the feather said harshly havent i already shown you enough money to buy out your whole house yes marya said from the stove be patient it wont be long now i will even pick it up for you she brought the two bowls of soup the man with the feather did not even wait for her to set his down snatching and wolfing it glaring across the bowl with his dead intolerant outrageous eyes while marya stooped about their feet and beneath and around the table gathering up the scattered coins there are only twentynine she said there should be one more still holding the tilted bowl to his face the man with the feather jerked another coin from his pocket and banged it onto the table does that satisfy you he said fill the bowl again she did so at the stove and brought the bowl back while again he splashed the wanton and violent wine into his tumbler eat too she said to the man with the crutches thanks he said not even looking at her but looking still at the tall coldfaced sister standing over him only about that time or during that time or at that time or whenever it was afterward that i woke up i was in a hospital in england so it was next spring before i persuaded them to let me come back to france and go to chaulnesmont until at last i found that sergeantmajor and he told me where you were only there were three of you then there was a girl too his wife the tall woman just looked down at him cold calm absolutely inscrutable his fiancée maybe yes marya said thats it his fiancée thats the word eat your soup they were to be married marthe said she was a marseille whore i beg pardon the englishman said but not any more marya said she was going to learn to be a farmers wife eat your soup now before it is cold yes the englishman said thanks not even looking at her what became of her she went back home home you mean back to theback to marseilles brothel the tall woman said say it you english the americans too why did your french boggle at that word being as good as it is with all the othersshe must live too she said thanks the englishman said but she could have stayed here yes the woman said but she didnt no the woman said she couldnt you see marya said she has an old grandmother she must support i think its quite admirable so do i the englishman said he took up the spoon thats right marya said eat but he was still looking at the sister the spoon arrested above the bowl nor did the man with the feather wait this time to demand to be served swinging his legs across the bench and carrying the bowl himself to the stove and plunging it hand and all into the pot before returning with the dripping and streaming bowl to the table where marya had made the neat small stack of his coins and where the englishman was still watching the tall sister talking you had a husband too then he died that same summer oh the englishman said the war the peace the tall woman said when they let him come home at last and then the war started again before he could even put a plow in the ground he probably decided that he could not bear another peace and so he died yes she said he had already taken up a spoon of soup he stopped the spoon again yes what what else do you want of us to show you his grave she just said his but they all knew whom she meant that is where we think it was so did the englishman merely say his what for he said hes finished finished she said in a harsh stern voice he didnt mean it that way sister the other woman said he just means that brother did the best he could all he could and now he doesnt need to worry any more now all he has to do is rest she looked at him serene and unsurprised and unpitying you like to laugh dont you he did so laughing strong and steady and completely with that side of his mouth still capable of moving opening to laugh the single eye meeting herstheirsfull and calm and unpitying and laughing too so can you he said to marya cant you why of course marya said now sister she said the medal so in the lane once more there were three of them now instead of the two he had brought with himthree bits of graved symbolic bronze dangling and glinting from the three candystriped ribbons bright as carnivals and gaudy as sunsets on the breast of the filthy dinner jacket as facing them he braced the two crutches into his armpits and with the hand he still had removed the ruined homburg in a gesture sweeping and invulnerable and clapped it back on at its raked and almost swaggering angle and turned the single leg once more strong and steady and tireless between the tireless rhythmic swing and recover of the crutches but moving back down the lane toward where he and the man with the feather had appeared even if the infinitesimal progress was out of all proportion to the tremendous effort of the motion moving unwearyable and durable and persevering growing smaller and smaller with distance until at last he had lost all semblance of advancement whatever and appeared as though fixed against a panorama in furious progressless unrest not lonely just solitary invincibly single then he was gone yes marya said he can move fast enough he will be there in plenty of time turning then the two of them though it was the sister who stopped as though it was only she who had remembered at last the other man the one with the feather because marya said oh yes there will be plenty of time for him too because he was not in the house only the stained table the bowl and the overturned tumbler where he had fouled and wasted their substance the stain of the wine and the soup making a little puddle in which sat the neat small stack of coins where marya had arranged them all that afternoon while the tall sister went back to the field the sowing and marya cleaned the kitchen and the soiled dishes wiping the coins neatly off and stacking them again in that mute still pyramidal gleam while the light faded until dark when they came back into the kitchen and lighted the lamp and he loomed suddenly cadaverous and tall beneath the raking feather from the shadows saying in his harsh intolerable voice what have you got against the money go on take it lifting his hand again to sweep fling it to the floor until the tall sister spoke she has picked it up for you once dont do it again here take it why wont you take it i worked for itsweated for itthe only money in my life i ever earned by honest sweat i did it just for thisearned it and then went to all the trouble to find you and give it to you and now you wont take it here but they only looked at him alien and composed cold and composed the one the other with that bright and pitiless serenity until at last he said with a kind of amazement so you wont take it you really wont and looked at them for a moment longer then came to the table and took up the coins and put them into his pocket and turned and went to the door thats right marya said in her serene and unpitying voice go now it is not much further you dont have much longer to despair at which he turned framed for a moment in the door his face livid and intolerable with nothing left now but the insolence the tall feather in the hat which he had never removed breaking into the line of the lintel as if he actually were hanging on a cord from it against the vacant shape of the spring darkness then he was gone too have you shut up the fowls yet the tall sister said of course sister marya said it was a gray day though not a gray year in fact time itself had not been gray since that day six years ago when the dead hero whom the quiet uncovered throngs which lined both sides of the champs élysées from the place de la concorde to the arch and the dignitaries walking humbly on foot who composed the cortege itself had come to honor had driven all adumbration from the face of western europe and indeed from the whole western world only the day was gray as though in dirge for him to whom it owed and would forever for the right and privilege to mourn in peace without terror or concern he lay in his splendid casket in full uniform and his medals the originals the ones pinned to his breast by the actual hands of the president of his own motherland and the kings and presidents of the allied nations whose armies he had led to victory were in the invalides these which would return with him to the earth he came from were replicas the baton of his marshalate lying on his breast beneath his folded hands on the gun caisson drawn by blackdraped and pompommed horses beneath the flag to which he in his turn and in its most desperate moment had added glory and eagles behind him in the slow and measured procession color guards bore the flags of the other nations over whose armies and fates he had been supreme but the flags were not first because first behind the caisson walked doddered rather in step with nothing as though selfimmersed and oblivious of all the aged batman who had outlived him in the uniform and the steel helmet still pristine and innocent of war the rifle through which no shot had ever been fired slung from the bowed shoulder in reverse and as gleaming with tender and meticulous care as a polished serving spoon or drawingroom poker or candelabrum carrying before him on a black velvet cushion the furled sabre his head bowed a little over it like an aged acolyte with a fragment of the cross or the ashes of a saint then came the two sergeantgrooms leading the charger blackcaparisoned too the spurred boots reversed in the irons and only then the flags and the muffled drums and the unrankable blackbanded uniforms of the generals and the robes and mitres and monstrances of the church and the sombre broadcloth and humble silk hats of the ambassadors all moving beneath the gray and grieving day to the muffled drums and the minutespaced thudding of a big gun somewhere in the direction of the fort of vincennes up the broad and grieving avenue between the halfstaffed grieving flags of half the world in pagan and martial retinue and rite dead chief and slave and steed and the medalsymbols of his glory and the arms with which he had gained them escorted back into the earth he came from by the lesser barons of his fiefhold and his magnificenceprince and cardinal soldier and statesman the heirsapparent to the kingdoms and empires and the ambassadors and personal representatives of the republics the humble and anonymous crowd itself flowing in behind the splendid last of them escorting guarding seeing him too up the avenue toward where the vast and serene and triumphal and enduring arch crowned the crest as though into immolation or suttee it lifted toward the gray and grieving sky invincible and impervious to endure forever not because it was stone nor even because of its rhythm and symmetry but because of its symbolism crowning the city on the marble floor exactly beneath the archs soaring center the small perpetual flame burned above the eternal sleep of the nameless bones brought down five years ago from the verdun battlefield the cortege moving on to the arch the crowd dividing quietly and humbly behind it to flow away on either side until it had surrounded and enclosed that sacred and dedicated monument the cortege itself stopping now shifting moiling a little until at last hushed protocol once more was discharged and only the caisson moving on until it halted directly before the arch and the flame and now there remained only silence and the grieving day and that minutes thud of the distant gun then a single man stepped forward from among the princes and prelates and generals and statesmen in full dress and medalled too the first man in france poet philosopher statesman patriot and orator to stand bareheaded facing the caisson while the distant gun thudded another minute into eternity then he spoke marshal but only the day answered and the distant gun to mark another interval of its ordered dirge then the man spoke again louder this time urgent not peremptory a cry marshal but still there was only the dirge of day the dirge of victorious and grieving france the dirge of europe and from beyond the seas too where men had doffed the uniforms in which they had been led through suffering to peace by him who lay now beneath the draped flag on the caisson and even further than that where people who had never heard his name did not even know that they were still free because of him the orators voice ringing now into the grieving circumambience for men everywhere to hear it thats right great general lie always with your face to the east that the enemies of france shall always see it and beware at which moment there was a sudden movement surge in the crowd to one side the hats and capes and lifted batons of policemen could be seen struggling toward the disturbance but before they could reach it something burst suddenly out of the crowdnot a man but a mobile and upright scar on crutches he had one arm and one leg one entire side of his hatless head was one hairless eyeless and earless sear he wore a filthy dinner jacket from the left breast of which depended on their barberpole ribbons a british military cross and distinguished conduct medal and a french médaille militaire which the french one was probably why the french crowd itself had not dared prevent him emerging from it and even now did not dare grasp him and jerk him back as he swung himself with that dreadful animallike lurch and heave with which men move on crutches out into the empty space enclosing the arch and on until he too faced the caisson then he stopped and braced the crutches into his armpits and with his single hand grasped the french decoration on his breast he too crying in a loud and ringing voice listen to me too marshal this is yours take it and snatched ripped from his filthy jacket the medal which was the talisman of his sanctuary and swung his arm up and back to throw it apparently he knew himself what was going to happen to him as soon as he released the medal and defied it with the medal uppoised in his hand he even stopped and looked back at the crowd which seemed now to crouch almost leashed and straining for the moment when he would absolve himself of immunity and laughed not triumphant just indomitable with that side of his ruined face capable of laughing then turned and flung the medal at the caisson his voice ringing again in the aghast air as the crowd rushed down upon him you too helped carry the torch of man into that twilight where he shall be no more these are his epitaphs they shall not pass my country right or wrong here is a spot which is forever england then they had him he vanished as though beneath a wave a tide of heads and shoulders above which one of the crutches appeared suddenly in a hand which seemed to be trying to strike down at him with it until the converging police there were dozens of them now converging from everywhere jerked it away other police rapidly forming a cordon of linked arms gradually forcing the crowd back while rite and solemnity gone for good now parade marshals whistles shrilled and the chief marshal himself grasped the bridles of the horses drawing the caisson and swung them around shouting to the driver go on the rest of the cortege huddling without order protocol vanished for the moment too as they hurried after the caisson almost with an air of pell mell as though in actual flight from the wreckage of the disaster the cause of it now lay in the gutter of a small culdesac side street where he had been carried by the two policemen who had rescued him before the mob he had instigated succeeded in killing him lying on his back his unconscious face quite peaceful now bleeding a little at one corner of his mouth the two policemen standing over him though now that the heat was gone their simple uniforms seemed sufficient to hold back that portion of the crowd which had followed to stand in a circle looking down at the unconscious and peaceful face who is he a voice said ah we know him one of the policemen said an englishman weve had trouble with him ever since the war this is not the first time he has insulted our country and disgraced his own maybe he will die this time another voice said then the man in the gutter opened his eyes and began to laugh or tried to choking at first trying to turn his head as though to clear his mouth and throat of what he choked on when another man thrust through the crowd and approached himan old man a gaunt giant of a man with a vast worn sick face with hungry and passionate eyes above a white military moustache in a dingy black overcoat in the lapel of which were three tiny faded ribbons who came and knelt beside him and slipped one arm under his head and shoulders and raised him and turned his head a little until he could spit out the blood and shattered teeth and speak or laugh rather which is what he did first lying in the cradle of the old mans arm laughing up at the ring of faces enclosing him then speaking himself in french thats right he said tremble im not going to die never i am not laughing the old man bending over him said what you see are tears end december oxfordnew yorkprinceton november editors note a fable was conceived in during a discussion in wartime hollywood among faulkner producer william bacher and director henry hathaway about a film on the unknown soldier one proposal was that the unknown soldier might have been jesus christ returned to earth to give humanity one last chance an idea faulkner was enthusiastic about they never made a film on this theme but the basic idea was to consume faulkner for over a decade with brief stints away from it to work on filmscripts the compson appendix intruder in the dust the stories that would make up knights gambit and requiem for a nun there exist several hundred pages of preliminary typescript and manuscript some of it dated as early as and the typescript setting copy is itself composed of typescript pages from several different versions of various passages typed on at least two different typewriters and clearly representing materials dating from throughout the decade of its composition faulkner took the typescript of a fable to random house on november and soon after left for four months in europe where he visited friends and worked on a film for howard hawks while reading proof in rome in april he wired random house that he had forgotten to include the judas misery material in the chapter titled tomorrow and he supplied that material when he returned to new york random house published the book on august in a text altered in hundreds of major and minor ways by editorial intervention faulkners typescript is the setting copy for the polk text reproduced here except for the judas misery sequence for which the first edition is the only extant text american english continues to fluctuate for example a word may be spelled more than one way even in the same work commas are sometimes used expressively to suggest the movements of the voice and capitals are sometimes meant to give significances to a word beyond those it might have in its uncapitalized form since standardization would remove such effects this volume preserves the spelling punctuation capitalization and wording of the text as established by noel polk which strives to be as faithful to faulkners

that is there was really no place for them in the culture in the economy yet they were there at that time and everyone knew that they wouldnt last very long which they didnt that they were outside the range of god not only of respectability of love but of god too in pylon faulkner set out to test their rootless modernity to see if there is any place in it for the old values of the human heart that are the central concerns of his best fiction sanctuary a powerful novel examining the nature of evil informed by the works of ts eliot and freud mythology local lore and hardboiled detective fiction sanctuary is the dark at times brutal story of the kidnapping of mississippi debutante temple drake who introduces her own form of venality into the memphis underworld where she is being held three
