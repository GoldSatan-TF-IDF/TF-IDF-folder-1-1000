anne perry dorchester terrace it was midfebruary and growing dark outside pitt stood up from his desk and walked over to turn the gas up on the wall lamps one by one he was becoming used to this office even if he was not yet comfortable in it in his mind it still belonged to victor narraway when he turned back to his desk he half expected to see the pencil drawings of bare trees that narraway used to keep on the walls instead of the watercolors of skies and seascapes that charlotte had given him his books were not so different from narraways there was less poetry fewer classics perhaps but similar titles on history politics and law narraway had of course taken with him the large silverframed picture of his mother today pitt had finally put in its place his favorite photograph of his family in it charlotte is smiling beside her stands thirteenyearold jemima looking very grownup and tenyearold daniel still with the soft face of a child after the fiasco in ireland at the end of last year narraway had not been reinstated as head of special branch though he had been exonerated of all charges of course instead pitts temporary status as head had been made official even though it had happened several months earlier he still found it hard to get used to and he knew very well that the men who had once been his superiors then his equals and now his juniors also found the new situation trying at best rank in and of itself meant little his title commanded obedience but not loyalty so far they had obeyed him without question but he had had several months of very predictable events to deal with there had been only the usual rumblings of discontent among the various immigrant populations particularly here in london but no crises none of the difficult situations that endangered lives and tested his judgment if such a crisis were to occur it was then he suspected that he might find his mens trust in him strained and tenuous pitt stopped by the window staring out at the pattern of the opposite rooftops and the elegant wall of the nearby building just able to discern their familiar outlines in the fading light the bright gleam of streetlamps was increasing in all directions he pictured narraways grave face as it had been when they last spoke tired and deeply lined the effect of his difficult escape from total disgrace and from the emotional toll of his experiences in ireland pitt knew that narraway had accepted at last the existence of his feelings for charlotte but as always victors coalblack eyes had given little away as they talked you will make mistakes he had said to pitt in the quietness of this room with its view of sky and rooftops you will hesitate to act when you know it could hurt people or destroy a life do not hesitate too long you will misjudge people youve always thought better of your social superiors than you should have for gods sake pitt rely on your instincts sometimes the results of your decisions will be serious live with it the measure of your worth is what you learn from the errors you make you cannot opt out that would be the worst mistake of all his face had been grim shadowed by memories it is not only the decision you make that counts but that you make it at the right moment anything that threatens the peace and safety of britain can come under your jurisdiction narraway had not added god help you though he might as well have then a dry humor had softened his eyes for a moment pitt had seen a flicker of compassion there for the burden that lay ahead and also a hint of envy regret for the excitement lost the pounding of the blood and the fire of the mind that narraway was being forced to give up of course pitt had seen him since then but only briefly there had been social events here and there conversations that were polite but devoid of meaning beyond the courtesies the questions as to how each of them was learning to bend to adapt and alter his stride to a new role remained unspoken pitt sat down again at his desk and turned his attention to the papers in front of him there was a brief knock on the door come in he said the door opened at once and stoker entered thanks to the events in ireland he was the one man in the branch that pitt knew for certain he could trust yes he said as stoker came to stand in front of pitts desk he looked worried and uncomfortable his lean face more expressive than usual got a report in from hutchins in dover sir seen one or two unusual people coming over on the ferry troublemakers not the usual sort of political talkersmore like the ones who really do things hes pretty sure at least one of them was involved in the murder of the french prime minister the year before last pitt felt a knot tighten in his stomach no wonder stoker looked so worried tell him to do all he can to be absolutely sure of their identities he replied send barker down as well watch the trains we need to know if any of them come up to london and who they contact if they do it may be nothing stoker said without conviction hutchins is a bit jumpy pitt drew in his breath to say that it was hutchinss job to be overcautious then changed his mind stoker knew that as well as he did still we should keep our eyes open weve enough men in dover to do that with barker yes sir thank you stoker turned and left pitt sat without moving for a moment or two if it really was one of the french prime ministers assassins would the french police or secret service get in touch with him would they want his help or prefer to deal with the man themselves they might hope to get information about other anarchists from him or on the other hand they might simply contrive for him to meet with an accident so the whole matter would never reach the public eye if the latter were the case it would be better if the british special branch pretended not to be aware of the situation pitt would have to make the decision about whether to involve the special branch and to what extent later when he had more information it was the type of decision narraway had referred to a gray area fraught with moral difficulties pitt bent back to the papers he had been reading there was a reception that evening a hundred or so people of social and political importance would be gathered ostensibly to hear the latest violin prodigy playing a selection of chamber pieces in truth it would be a roomful of people attempting to observe and manipulate any shifts in political power and to subtly exchange information that could not be passed in the more rigid settings of an office pitt walked through the front door of his house in keppel street just after seven oclock with plenty of time to get ready for the reception he found himself smiling at the immediate warmth a relief after the bitter wind outside the familiar smells of baked bread and clean cotton drifted from the kitchen at the far end of the passage charlotte would be upstairs dressing she was not yet used to being back in the glamour and rivalry of the high society into which she had been born she had found it shallow when she was younger and then after marrying pitt it had been out of her reach now he knew although she had never once said so that at times she had missed the color and wit of it all however superficial it was minnie maude was in the kitchen preparing welsh rarebit for him in case the refreshments at the event were meager her hair was flying out of its pins as usual her face flushed with exertion and perhaps a certain excitement she swung around from the big stove as soon as she heard his footsteps oh mr pitt sir ave yer seen mrs pitt she looks a proper treat she does i never seen anyone look so she was lost for words so instead held out the plate of hot savory cheese on toast then realizing the need for haste she put it on the kitchen table and fetched him a knife and fork ill get yer a nice cup o tea she added kettles boiled thank you he said hiding at least part of his amusement minnie maude mudway had replaced gracie phipps the maid who had been with the pitts almost since they were married he was still not entirely used to the change but gracie had her own home now and he was happy for her minnie maude had been hired on gracies recommendation and it was working out very satisfactorily even if he missed gracies forthright comments about his cases and her loyal and highly independent support he ate in silence with considerable appreciation minnie maude was rapidly becoming a good cook with a more generous budget at her disposal than gracie had ever had she had taken to experimentingon the whole with great success he noticed that she had made enough for herself although her portion was much smaller however she seemed unwilling to eat it in front of him please dont wait he said gesturing toward the saucepan on the stove have it while its hot she gave an uncertain smile and seemed about to argue then changed her mind and served it almost at once she was distracted by a stack of clean dishes waiting to be put away in the welsh dresser and her meal went untouched pitt decided he should speak to charlotte about it perhaps she could say something to make minnie maude feel more comfortable it was absurd for her to feel that she could not eat at the kitchen table just because he was there now that she had taken gracies place this was her home when he had finished his tea he thanked her and went upstairs to wash shave and change in the bedroom he found jemima as well as charlotte the girl was regarding her mother with careful appreciation pitt was startled to see that jemima had her long hair up in pins as if she were grownup he felt proud and at the same time felt a pang of loss its wonderful mama but you are still a little pale jemima said candidly reaching forward to straighten the burgundycolored silk of charlottes gown then she flashed pitt a smile hello papa youre just in time to be fashionably late you must do it its the thing you know yes i do know he agreed then turned to look at charlotte minnie maude was right of course but it still caught him by surprise sometimes how lovely charlotte was it was more than the excitement in her face or the warmth in her eyes maturity became her she had an assurance now at almost forty that she had not had when she was younger it gave her a grace that was deeper than the mere charm that good coloring or straight features offered your clothes are laid out for you charlotte said in answer to his glance fashionably late is one thing looking as if you mistook the arrangements or got lost is another he smiled and did not bother to answer he understood her nervousness he was trying to counter his own anxiety over suddenly being in a social position that he had not been born into his new situation was quite different in nature from being a senior policeman now he was the head of special branch and except in the most major of cases entirely his own master there was no one with whom to share the power knowledge or responsibility pitt was even more aware of the change in his circumstances as he alighted from the hansom and held out his arm for charlotte steadying her for an instant as she stepped down the night air was bitterly cold stinging their faces ice gleamed on the road and he was careful not to slip as he guided charlotte over to the pavement a coach with four horses pulled up a little ahead of them a coat of arms painted on the door the horses breath was visible and the brass on their harnesses winked in the light as they shifted their weight a liveried footman stepped down off the box to open the door another coach passed by the sound of ironshod hoofs sharp on the stones charlotte gripped his arm tightly though it was not in fear that she might slip she wanted only a bit of reassurance a moment to gather her strength before they ventured in he smiled in the dark and reached over with his other hand to touch hers for an instant the large front doors opened before them a servant took pitts card and conducted them to the main hall where the reception had already begun the room was magnificent scattered columns and pilasters stretching up to the painted ceiling gave it an illusion of even greater height it was lit by four massive dazzling chandeliers hanging on chains that seemed to be solid gold though of course they werent are you sure were in the right place pitt whispered to charlotte she turned to him with a wideeyed look of alarm then saw that he was deliberately teasing her he was nervous but he was also proud that this time she was here because he was invited rather than because her sister emily or her aunt lady vespasia cumminggould had been it was a small thing to give her after all the years of humble living but it pleased him charlotte smiled and held her head a little higher before sailing down the small flight of steps to join the crowd within moments they were surrounded by a swirl of color and voices muted laughter and the clink of glasses the conversation was polite and most of it meaningless simply a way for everyone to take stock of one another while not seeming to do so charlotte appeared perfectly at ease as they spoke to one group then another pitt watched her with admiration as she smiled at everyone affected interest passed subtle compliments there was an art to it that he was not yet ready to emulate he was afraid he would end up looking as if he were trying too hard to copy those born into this social station and they would never forget such a slip some junior minister of the government spoke to him casually he could not remember the mans name but he listened as if he were interested someone else joined in and the discussion became more serious he made the odd remark but mostly he just observed pitt noticed an acute difference in the way people behaved toward him now as compared to a few months ago although not everyone knew who he was yet he was pleased to be drawn into another conversation and saw charlotte smile to herself before turning to a rather large lady in green and listening to her with charming attention complete ass if you ask me an elderly man said heartily he looked at pitt raising an eyebrow in question no idea why they promoted the fellow to the home office must be related to someone he laughed or know a few secrets what pitt smiled back he had no idea who they were referring to i say youre not in parliament are you the man went on didnt mean to insult you you know no im not pitt answered him with a smile good job the man was clearly relieved my names willoughby got a little land in herefordshire couple of thousand acres he nodded pitt introduced himself in turn hesitated a moment then decided against stating his occupation another man joined them slim and elegant with slightly protruding teeth and a white mustache evening he said companionably rotten business in copenhagen isnt it still i dare say itll blow over usually does he looked at pitt more carefully suppose you know all about it ive heard a thing or two pitt admitted connections willoughby asked hes head of special branch the other man said tartly probably knows more about either of us than we know about ourselves willoughby paled oh really he smiled but his voice rasped as if his throat were suddenly tight dont think theres much of any interest to know ol boy pitts mind raced to think of the best way to reply he could not afford to make enemies but neither would it be wise to belittle his importance or allow people to assume that he was not the same master of information that narraway had been he made himself smile back at willoughby i would not say you are uninteresting sir but you are not of concern to us which is an entirely different thing willoughbys eyes widened really he looked mollified almost pleased really the other man looked amused is that what you say to everyone he asked with the ghost of a smile i like to be courteous pitt looked him directly in the eye but i cant deny that some people are less interesting than others this time willoughby was very definitely pleased and made no attempt to hide it satisfaction radiated from him as he took a glass of champagne from a passing footman pitt moved on he was more careful now of his manner watching but speaking little learning to copy the polite words that meant nothing it was not an art that came to him easily charlotte would have understood the nuances within what was said or unsaid pitt would have found direct openness much more comfortable however this form of socializing was part of his world from now on even if he felt like an intruder even if he knew that beneath the smiles the smooth selfassured men around him were perfectly aware of how he felt a few moments later he saw charlotte again he made his way toward her with a lift of spirits even a pride he thought was perhaps a little silly after all these years but nevertheless was quite real there were other women in the room with more classic beauty and certainly more sumptuous gowns but for him they lacked warmth they had less passion less of that certain indefinable grace that comes from within charlotte was talking to her sister emily radley who was wearing a pale bluegreen silk gown with gold embroidery emilys first marriage had been a match to make any mother proud lord george ashworth had been the opposite of pitt in every way handsome charming of excellent family and in possession of a great deal of money after his death it was held in trust for his and emilys son edward a suitable time later emily had married jack radley he was another handsome man even more charming but with no money at all his father had been a younger son and something of an adventurer it was emily who had persuaded jack to enter politics and aspire to make something of himself perhaps some of emilys hunger to affect other peoples lives had come from her observation of charlotte and her involvement in several of pitts earlier cases to be fair at times emily had also helped charlotte with both flair and courage the sisters had exasperated and embarrassed pitt driving him frantic with fear for their safety but they had also very thoroughly earned his respect and gratitude looking at emily now the light from the chandeliers gleaming on her fair hair and on the diamonds around her neck he thought back with a little nostalgia to the adventure and emotion of those times he could no longer share information about his cases even with charlotte it was a loss he felt with surprising sadness now his assignments were not merely confidential but completely secret emily saw him looking at her and smiled brightly good evening thomas how are you she said cheerfully well thank you and i can see that you are he responded emily was naturally pretty with her golden hair and wide dark blue eyes more important she knew exactly how to dress to complement the best in herself whatever the occasion but perhaps because it was his job to watch people and read the emotions behind their words he could see at once that emily was uncharacteristically tense could it be that she was wary of him too the thought chilled him so much that he could barely gather himself enough to acknowledge jack radley my lord may i introduce my brotherinlaw thomas pitt jack said very formally as pitt turned automatically toward the man with whom jack had been speaking thomas lord tregarron jack did not mention tregarrons position presumably he considered the man important enough that pitt should have been familiar with his title it was then that pitt remembered charlotte telling him of jacks promotion to a position of responsibility within the government a position that finally gave him some real power emily was very proud of it so perhaps it was defensiveness then that he could see in her quick eyes and in the slight stiffness of her shoulders she was not going to let pitts promotion overshadow jacks it came to pitt suddenly tregarron was a minister in the foreign office close to the foreign secretary himself how do you do my lord pitt replied smiling he glanced at charlotte and saw that she too understood emilys tension lord tregarron was telling us about some of the beautiful places he has visited emily said brightly especially in the balkans his descriptions of the adriatic coast are breathtaking tregarron gave a slight shrug he was a dark stocky man with thick curling hair and a highly expressive face no one could have thought him comely and yet the strength and vitality in him commanded attention pitt noticed that several women in the room kept glancing at him then looking away that a cornishman admires anyone elses coast has impressed mrs radley greatly tregarron said with a smile as so it should we have had our share of troubles in the past between shipwreck and smuggling but i have no time for separatists life should be about inclusion not everyone running off to his own small corner and pulling up the drawbridge half the wars in europe have started out of that type of fear the other half out of greed dont you agree he looked directly at pitt liberally helped with misunderstanding pitt replied intentional or not well put sir tregarron commended him instantly he turned to jack right radley a nice distinction dont you think jack signaled his approval smiling with the easy charm he had always possessed he was a handsome man and wore it with grace emily shot pitt a swift glance and there was a distinct chill in it pitt hoped jack had not seen it lest it upset him pitt knew he himself would dislike it if charlotte were so defensive of him in his experience you do not guard anyone so closely unless you fear they are in some way vulnerable did emily doubt that jack had the steel in his natureor perhaps the intelligenceto fill his new post well and had tregarron chosen jack or had emily used some connection of her own from her days as lady ashworth in order to obtain the position for him pitt could not think of anyone emily knew who was powerful enough to do that but then the whole world of political debt and preferment was one he was unfamiliar with narraway had been excellent at figuring out the truth in this type of situation it was a skill pitt needed to arm himself with and quickly he felt a sudden powerful empathy with jack they were both swimming with sharks in unfamiliar seas but jack was used to using his charm and instinctive ability to read people perhaps he would manage to survive and survive well the conversation had moved from the adriatic coast to a discussion about the austrohungarian empire in general and from there went on to berlin and finally to paris that city of elegance and gaiety pitt said little content to listen the musical interlude for the evening began much of its exquisite beauty was wasted on the audience who were not so much listening as waiting in polite silence until it was over and they could resume their own conversations but charlotte heard the haunting beauty of the pieces and wished the musician could play all evening however she understood the rhythm of such gatherings this break was to allow a regrouping of forces it was a time in which to weigh what one had observed and heard and to consider what to say next whom to approach and what gambit to play next she was sitting beside pitt a hand resting lightly on one arm she could see emily seated in a goldpainted chair several rows in front of her between lord tregarron and jack charlotte had known jacks promotion was important but she had not realized until now how steep a climb it had truly been and tonight she had recognized that under emilys usual charming manner lurked fear for jack in his new position was it because emily knew jack too well was aware of a fundamental weakness in him that others did not see or could it be that she did not know him well enough and so was unable to see the strength of will beneath his easy manner his charisma that seemed so effortless charlotte suspected that the real truth was that after a decade of marriage emily was finally realizing that she was not only in love with jack but that she also cared about his ability to succeed not just for what it might bring her but also for what it could give jack emily had been the youngest and prettiest of the three ellison sisters and the most singlemindedly ambitious sarah the eldest had been dead for fifteen years her death now seemed a lifetime ago the fear and pain of that time had receded into a distant nightmare one charlotte seldom revisited their father had also died about four years ago and some time later their mother had remarried this was another subject fraught with mixed emotions though charlotte had completely accepted her mothers choice and emily largely so only their grandmother remained horrified but then mariah ellison had made a profession out of disapproving carolines second husband joshua fielding belonged to an acting troupe was carolines junior by many years and was jewish to boot carolines marriage to him gave grandmama more than ample opportunity to express all her pentup prejudices that caroline was thoroughly happy with joshua only added insult to the injury it made charlotte happy to think that emily seemed to be learning how to love in a different more unselfish way a way that was more protective more mature it meant she herself was becoming more mature not that the ambition was gone it was very much present woven into the fiber of emilys character charlotte also understood the defensive posture emily had adopted earlier charlotte felt the same tigresslike instinct to protect pitt but she also knew that in his new position there was little with which she could help he was on far more unfamiliar ground than even jack was though jacks family had had no money it did have aristocratic connections in half the counties in england pitt was the mere son of a gamekeeper but if charlotte were to attempt to protect him she would not signal it as clearly as emily had done earlier charlotte knew pitt would hate that she wasnt sure whether jack would too when the performance was over and the applause died down the conversations resumed and charlotte soon found herself talking to a most unusual woman she was probably in her late thirties like charlotte herself but in all other ways she was quite different she was dressed in a hugeskirted gown the color of candlelight through brandy and she was so slender as to look fragile the bones of her neck and shoulders appeared as if they might break if she were bumped too roughly there were blue veins just visible beneath her milkwhite skin and her hair was so dark as to be nearly black her eyes were darklashed and heavylidded above her high cheekbones her mouth soft and generous to charlotte it was a face that was instantly likeable she felt the moment their eyes met that the mysterious woman had a great strength she introduced herself as adriana blantyre her voice was very low just a trifle husky and she spoke with an accent so slight that charlotte had to strain her ears to make certain she had really heard it adrianas husband was tall and dark and he too had a remarkable face at a glance he was handsome yet there was far more to him than a mere balance or regularity of feature once charlotte had met his eyes she kept looking back at him because of their intelligence and the fierceness of his emotion there was a grace in the way he stood but no ease she felt pitt watching her curiously as she looked at the man and yet she did not stop herself evan blantyre was an exdiplomat particularly interested in the eastern mediterranean a marvelous place the mediterranean he said facing charlotte and yet speaking almost to himself part of europe and yet at the gateway to a world far older and civilizations that prefigure ours and from which we are sprung such as greece charlotte asked not having to feign interest and maybe egypt byzantium macedonia and before that troy he elaborated the world of homer imagination and memory at the root of our thoughts and the concepts from which they rise charlotte could not let him go unchallenged not because she disbelieved him but because there was an arrogance in him that she was compelled to probe really i would have thought judea was the place at the root of our thoughts she argued he smiled widely seizing on her interest judea certainly for the roots of faith but not of thought or if you prefer philosophy the love of wisdom rather than commanded belief i chose my words with care mrs pitt now she knew exactly what he meant and that he had been deliberately baiting her but she also saw that there was intense conviction behind what he said there was no pretense in the passion of his voice she smiled at him i see and which of our modern civilizations carry the torch of that philosophy now it was a challenge and she meant him to answer ah now he was ignoring the others in their group what an interesting question not germany all brightly polished and looking for something brave and brash to do not really france although it has a uniquely piquant sophistication italy has sown the seeds of much glory yet it is forever quarrelling within itself he made a rueful and elegant gesture and us charlotte asked him her tone a little sharper than she had meant it to be adventurers he replied without hesitation and shopkeepers to the world so no presentday heirs she said with sudden disappointment austrohungary he replied too quickly to conceal his own feelings it has inherited the mantle of the old holy roman empire that bound europe into one christian unity after the fall of rome itself charlotte was startled austria but it is ramshackle all but falling apart isnt it unless all we are told of it is nonsense now he was amused and he allowed her to see it there was warmth in his smile but also a bright and hard irony i thought i was baiting you mrs pitt and i find instead that you are baiting me he turned to pitt i underestimated your wife sir someone mentioned that you are head of special branch if that is indeed true then i should have known better than to imagine that you would choose a wife purely for her looks however charming pitt was smiling now too i was not head of special branch at the time he replied but i was ambitious and hungry enough to reach for the best with no idea of my own limitations excellent blantyre applauded him never allow your dreams to be limited you should aim for the stars live and die with your arms outstretched and your eyes seeking the next goal evan you are talking nonsense adriana said quietly looking first at charlotte then at pitt judging their reactions arent you ever afraid people will believe you do you believe me mrs pitt blantyre inquired his eyes wide still challenging charlotte looked at him directly she was quite sure of her answer im sorry mr blantyre because i dont think you mean me to but yes i do believe you bravo he said quietly i have found a sparring partner worth my efforts he turned to pitt does your position involve dealing with the balkans mr pitt pitt glanced at jack and emilywho had now moved farther away and were engaged in conversation elsewherethen back at blantyre with anyone whose activities might threaten the peace or safety of britain he replied the levity wiped from his face blantyres eyebrows rose even if in northern italy or croatia in vienna itself no pitt told him keeping his expression agreeable as if they were playing a parlor game of no consequence only on british soil farther afield would be mr radleys concern as im sure you know of course blantyre nodded that must be challenging for you to know when you can act and when you must leave the action to someone else or am i being unsophisticated is it actually more a matter of how you do a thing rather than what you do pitt smiled without answering does your search for information ever take you abroad blantyre continued completely unperturbed you would love vienna the quickness of wit and the music there is so much music there that is new innovative in concept challenging to the mind i daresay they are musicians you have never heard of but you will above all there is a breadth of thought in a score of subjects philosophy science social mores psychology the very fundamentals of how the human mind works there is an intellectual imagination there that will very soon lead the world in some areas he gave a slight mocking shrug as if to deny the heat of his feelings and of course there is the traditional as well he turned to look at adriana do you remember dancing all night to mr strausss music our feet ached the dawn was paling the sky and yet if the orchestra had played into the daylight hours we could not have kept still the memory was there in adrianas eyes but charlotte was certain she also saw a shadow cross her face of course i do adriana answered no one who has waltzed in vienna ever completely forgets it charlotte looked at her fascinated by the romance of dancing to the music of the waltz king you actually danced when mr strauss conducted the orchestra she asked with awe indeed blantyre responded no one else can give music quite the same magic it makes one feel as if one must dance forever we watched the moon rise over the danube and talked all night with the most amazing people princes philosophers artists and scientists have you met the emperor franz josef charlotte pursued they say he is very conservative is that true she told herself it was to keep the conversation innocuous but she was caught up in this dream portait of vienna the new inventions and new ideas of society it was a world she herself would never see butat least as blantyre had told itvienna was the heart of europe it was the place of the genesis of new ideas that would spread throughout the whole continent one day and beyond yes i have and it is true blantyre was smiling but the emotion in his face was intense there was a passion in him that was urgent electric a grim man with a devil on his shoulder he went on watching her face as closely as she was watching his a contradiction of a man more disciplined than anyone else i know he sleeps on an army bed and rises at some ungodly hour long before dawn and yet he fell madly in love with elisabeth seven years younger than himself sister of the woman his father wished him to marry the empress elisabeth charlotte said with even sharper interest there was a vitality in blantyre that intrigued her she was unsure whether he spoke with such intensity merely to entertain or possibly to impress or whether his passion for his subject was really so fierce that he had no control over it the very same blantyre agreed he overrode all opposition he would not be denied now the admiration in his face was undisguised they married and by the time she was twentyone she had given birth to her third child her only son a strange mixture of rigidity and romance she said thoughtfully are they happy she felt pitts hand touching her arm but it was too late to withdraw the remark she glanced at adriana and saw in her eyes an emotion she could not read at all a brilliance a pain and something she was trying very hard to conceal becoming aware of charlottes gaze on her she looked away no blantyre said frankly she is somewhat bohemian in her tastes and highly eccentric she travels all over europe wherever she can charlotte wanted to make some light remark that would ease the tension and turn the conversation away from her misjudged question but she thought now that such a thing would be obvious and only make matters worse perhaps it was a case of falling in love with a dream that one did not really understand she said quietly how very perceptive of you you are rather alarming mrs pitt blantyre said this with pleasure and a distinct respect and very honest i think you mean indiscreet she said ruefully perhaps we had better return to mr strauss and his music i believe his father was a noted composer as well ah yes he drew a deep breath and his smile was a little wry he composed the radetzky march at the farther side of the room was victor narraway newly elevated and a somewhat reluctant member of the house of lords he suddenly smiled as he saw lady vespasia cumminggould she was now of an age that it would be indelicate to mention but she still had the beauty that had made her famous she walked with the grace of an empress but without the arrogance her silver hair was her crown as always she was dressed in the height of fashion she was tall enough to carry off the huge puffed upper sleeves that were in style and she clearly found her great sweeping skirt no encumbrance he was still watching her with the pleasure of friendship when she turned slightly and saw him she did not move but waited for him to come to her good evening lady vespasia he said warmly you have just made all the trivialities of attending such an event worthwhile good evening my lord she replied with laughter in her eyes that is unnecessary now he felt selfconscious which was a very rare thing for him he had held extraordinary power discreetly for most of his adult life first as a member of special branch then for the last decade and a half as its head but it was a new experience for him to be given such social deference you will have to get used to it victor she said gently elevation to the peerage gains a different kind of influence their lordships deliberations are mostly a lot of pontificating he replied a trifle sourly very often for the sound of their own voices no one else is listening she raised her eyebrows have you just discovered that no of course not but now that no one is obliged to listen to me i miss the pretense of respect but far more i miss the knowledge of my own purpose she caught the pain in his voice even though he had tried to mask it with lightness he knew she had heard it and he was not sure if he wished he had been cleverer at concealing it or that she knew him less well but perhaps the comfort of friendship was of greater value than the privacy that came from not being understood you will find a cause worth risking something for she assured him or if none presents itself you will create one there is enough stupidity and injustice in the world to last us both the rest of our lives is that supposed to comfort me he said with a smile she raised her silver eyebrows certainly to be without purpose is the same as being dead only less peaceful she laughed very delicately it was a mere whisper of amusement but he knew she meant it passionately he remembered her speaking once only briefly of her participation in the revolutions against oppression that had fired europe almost half a century ago they had rocked the entire continent for a few short months hope of a new democracy freedom to speak and write as one chose had flared wild and bright people met together and talked all night planning new laws an equality that had never existed before only to see their hope snuffed out in france germany austria and italy all the old tyrannies were restored with barely any change the barricades were swept away and the emperors and kings sat back on their thrones i have grown used to being given my causes without the effort of looking for them he admitted i accept the rebuke it was not meant as a rebuke my dear she answered i would welcome your assistance in finding something worthy of doing myself nonsense he said very softly looking across the room to where pitt and charlotte were speaking with evan blantyre looking at charlotte caused a sudden catch in his breath a twist of his heart the memories of their time in ireland were still far from healing he had always known that it was his dream alone she had been there only to help him and in so doing to help pitt it was pitt whom she loved it always would be right now i am sure you are very much occupied in worrying about whether pitt is going to be eaten by the lions he said looking back at her oh dear am i so transparent vespasia looked momentarily crestfallen only because i am worrying about the same thing he told her pleased that she had not denied it it said something for their friendship that she had owned the concern now she met his eyes her anxiety undisguised are you afraid he will retain his respect for the upper classes and defer to them even if he suspects them of treason he asked her certainly not she responded without hesitation he has been a policeman far too long to do anything so idiotic he is painfully aware of our weaknesses have you already forgotten that miserable affair at the palace i assure you the prince of wales has not were it not for the queens own personal gratitude to pitt he would not have the position he does now nor very likely any position at all narraway pulled his mouth into a bitter line at the memory he knew his royal highness was still carrying a deep grudge about the whole fiasco it was not forgiveness that stayed his hand it was his mothers iron will and strong personal loyalty to those who had served her with grace and at the risk of their own lives but victoria was old and the shadows around her were growing ever longer does the princes anger concern you he asked vespasia she gave a shrug so slight it hardly moved the deep lavender silk of her gown not immediately by the time the throne is his he might have more pressing issues to occupy him he did not interrupt her brief silence they stood side by side watching the swirl and shift of the glittering party in front of them i am afraid that mercy will override the necessity for action vespasia said at last thomas has never balked from looking at the truth however harsh or tragic or compromised by blame in many places but he has not previously had to do more than present the evidence now he may have to be judge jury and even executioner himself decisions are not always blackandwhite and yet they must still be made to whom does he turn for advice for someone who will reconsider balance what might be a mistake find a fact he had not seen which may well change everything no one narraway said simply do you think i dont know that do you imagine that i have not lain awake all night staring at the ceiling and wondering if i had done the right thing myself or perhaps sent a man wholly or partially innocent to his death because i could not afford to hesitate vespasia studied him carefully his eyes his mouth the deepetched lines of his face the gray in his thick shock of black hair im sorry she said sincerely you wear your worries with sufficient grace that i had not seen the burden theyve created clearly enough he found himself blushing it was a compliment he had not expected from vespasia he was a little alarmed at how much it pleased him it also made him vulnerablesomething he was not used to except with charlotte pittand he knew that he must force it to the back of his mind again you must have thought me inhuman he replied then wished he had not been so open not inhuman vespasia said ruefully just far more certain of yourself than i have ever been i admired that in you even if it left me in awe and kept me at some distance now he was really surprised he had not imagined vespasia in awe of anyone she had been flattered by emperors admired by the tsar of all the russias and courted by half of europe dont be so silly she said sharply as if reading his thoughts privilege of birth is a duty not an achievement i admire those who have mastered themselves in order to be where they are rather than having been handed it by circumstance like pitt he asked i was thinking of you she said drily but yes like thomas and did you fear for me when judgment lay in my hands no my dear because you have the steel in your soul you will survive your mistakes and pitt i hope so but i fear it will be far harder for him he is more of an idealist than you ever were and perhaps more than i he still has a certain innocence courage to believe in the best was i wrong to recommend him narraway asked she would have liked to answer him easily reassure him but if she lied now she would leave them isolated from each other when perhaps they might most need to be allied and she had long ago given up telling lies beyond the trivial ones of courtesy when the truth served no purpose i dont know she said quietly we shall see two days after the reception vespasia received the news that a woman she had known and admired some time in the past serafina montserrat was ill and confined to her bed it is seldom easy to visit those who are not well but it is far harder when both you and they know that recovery is not possible what does one say that has any kind of honesty and yet does not carry with it the breath of despair vespasia had contemplated this while taking a bath perfumed with her favorite mixture of essences lavender rosemary and eucalyptus in bicarbonate of soda crystals which always invigorated and lifted the spirits now she sat in her dressing room before the looking glass while her maid arranged her hair before assisting with the tiny buttons of her dress today vespasia had chosen a gown of indigoshaded wool which was both flattering and warm she firmly believed that one should dress for the sick with as much care as for a party still she had not made up her mind about what to say whether to speak of the present which was so different for vespasia than for serafina perhaps remembering the pastrich turbulent filled with both triumph and disasterwould be a happier choice it was also difficult to know what to take as a small gift in february there were few flowers those that were available had been forced to grow in artificial circumstances and seldom lasted long there was hardly any fruit at all vespasia had then remembered that serafina liked good chocolate so a box of carefully selected and beautifully wrapped belgian chocolates with cream centers seemed a good choice she had considered a book of memoirs or foreign travels but she did not know if serafina was well enough to read she still lived in her house in dorchester terrace with her greatniece as a companion but was there anyone who would read to her with spirit and charm if she was not well enough to read for herself thank you gwen vespasia said as her maid finished dressing her hair kindness required that she make this visit generously and with good spirits it would be best that she do it quickly before her anxiety got the better of her mood the morning was brisk and cold but fortunately she did not have far to go her carriage was waiting at the door she gave the footman the dorchester terrace address and accepted his hand to step up seating herself as comfortably as possible in the chill she arranged her skirts around her so as not to crush them more than necessary she watched the tall houses pass by the few people out walking in the windy streets heads bent against the first spattering of rain and thought back nearly fifty years to her first meeting with serafina montserrat the world had been in a turmoil of excitement then the revolutions of had filled them with hope and the willingness to sacrifice everything even their lives for the chance to overthrow the old tyrannies it was illusoryperhaps it always had beenbut for a brief space their ideas were passionately alive before the barricades were destroyed the rebels were dispersed imprisoned or killed and everything was put back as before vespasia had come home again settled into an acceptable marriage and had children but never again had she felt so profoundly passionate about anything as she had then serafina had also married more than once but remained a fighter both physically and politically their paths had crossed since many times vespasia had traveled all over europe she used her beauty and intelligence to effect good where she was able to but with a degree of discretion serafina had never been discreet they had chanced across each other in london paris rome berlin occasionally madrid naples in the spring provence in the autumn when they met they had spoken with laughter and grief and exchanged new hopes and old memories this might be their last meeting vespasia found herself stiff her hands were clenched as if she was cold yet she was well supplied with rugs and the carriage was not uncomfortable they pulled up outside the entrance in dorchester terrace and vespasias coachman opened the door for her to alight she accepted his hand and took from him the ribboned box of chocolates thank you please wait for me she instructed him then walked across the pavement and up the steps it was early for a call and she was very aware of that but she wished to see serafina alone before any others might come at a more usual hour the door opened and she handed her card to the footman good morning lady vespasia he said with only mild surprise please do come in good morning she replied is mrs montserrat well enough to receive visitors if the hour is too early i can return not at all my lady she will be delighted to see you he smiled closing the door behind her she thought she detected something more than good manners in his voice perhaps even a thread of gratitude she walked into the wide hall with its beautifully parqueted floor and sweeping staircase she noticed that there was a very handsome lamp built into the newel post at the bottom im certain mrs montserrat will wish to see you but of course i will take the precaution of going up to ask her maid he explained if you would be good enough to wait in the withdrawing room where the fire is lit i shall return in a few moments would you care for a cup of tea thank you that would be most welcome it is inclement weather she accepted because it would make him feel less uncomfortable about leaving her if it should require several moments of assistance before serafina was ready to receive anyone the withdrawing room was warm and elegant in a most unusual manner the floor carpeting was pale blue and the walls were papered in the darkest possible green the somberness of it was brilliantly relieved by furnishings in indian red and warm amber brocade with cushions also in amber and green thrown carelessly across them were silk blankets with tasseled edges woven in the same beautiful colors the fire was low but had clearly been lit since early morning filling the air with the scent of applewood there were paintings of northern italian landscapes on the walls one of monte bianco gleaming white in a clear evening sky another of early morning light on isola san giulio catching the roofs of the monastery and making shadows in the clear water of lago dorta where half a dozen small boats lay motionless the decor was chaotically eclectic and full of life and vespasia smiled at a score of memories that crowded her mind she and serafina had sat at a pavement cafe in vienna and drunk hot chocolate while they made notes for a political pamphlet all around them had been excited chatter laughter at bawdy jokes voices sharpedged a little too loud with the awareness of danger and loss they had stood on the shore at trieste side by side the magnificent austrian buildings behind them and the sweeping adriatic skies above higharched with clouds like mares tails fanned out in the evening light serafina had cursed the whole austrian empire with a violence that twisted her face and made her voice rasp in her throat vespasia returned to the present with a jolt when the tea was brought she had nearly finished it by the time a young woman came in closing the door softly behind her she was in her midthirties darkhaired but with such unremarkable brows and lashes that the power of her coloring was lost she was slender and softvoiced lady vespasia how gracious of you to call she said quietly my name is nerissa freemarsh my aunt serafina is so pleased that you have come as soon as you have finished your tea i shall take you up to see her im afraid you will find her much weaker than you may remember her and somewhat more absentminded she smiled apologetically it has been quite some time since you last met please be patient with her she seems rather confused at times im so sorry please think nothing of it vespasia rose to her feet guilty that it had been so long since she had come to see her friend i daresay i forget things myself at times but this is nerissa started then she stopped smiling at her own mistake of course i know you understand she turned and led the way out across the parqueted hall again and up the handsome staircase she walked a little stiffly picking up the dark plain fabric of her skirt in one hand so she did not trip vespasia followed her up and across the landing andafter a brief knock on the doorinto the main bedroom inside it was warm and bright even in the middle of this dark winter day the fire was excellent the logs must be applewood here also from the sweet smell the walls were painted light terracotta and the curtains were patterned with flowers as if serafina wanted to carry the summer with her regardless of the iron rule of time and season vespasia looked across at the bed and could not keep the shock from her face serafina was propped almost upright by the pillows at her back her hair was white and dressed a little carelessly her face was devoid of any artificial color although with her dark eyes and wellmarked brows she did not look as ashen as a fairer woman might have she had never been beautifulnot as vespasia had been and still wasbut her features were good and her courage and intelligence had made her extraordinary beside her other women had seemed leached of life and predictable now all that burning energy was gone leaving a shell behind recognizable only with effort serafina turned slowly and stared at the intruders in her room vespasia felt her throat tighten until she could barely swallow lady vespasia has come to see you aunt serafina nerissa said with forced cheerfulness and brought you some belgian chocolates she held up the box with its beautiful ribbons slowly serafina smiled but it was only out of courtesy her eyes were blank how kind she said without expression vespasia moved forward smiling back with an effort that she knew marred any attempt at sincerity this was a woman whose mind had been as sharp as her own whose wit nearly as quick and she was no more than ten years older than vespasia but she looked empty as if her fire and soul had already left i hope youll enjoy them vespasia said the words hollow as they left her lips for a moment she wished she had not come serafina appeared to have no idea who she was as if the past had been wiped out and they had not shared the kind of friendship that is never forgotten serafina looked at her with only a slow dawning of light in her eyes as if shreds of understanding gradually returned to her i am sure you would like to talk for a little while nerissa said gently dont tire yourself aunt serafina the instruction was aimed obliquely at vespasia ill put another log on the fire before i leave if you need anything the bell is easy to reach and ill come straightaway serafina nodded very slightly her eyes still fixed on vespasia thank you vespasia replied there was no escape it would be inexcusable to leave now however much she wished to nerissa went over to the fire poked it a little which sent up a shower of sparks then carefully placed another log on top she straightened her back and smiled at vespasia it is so kind of you to come she said ill return in a little while she walked over to the door opened it and went out vespasia sat down in the chair next to the bed what on earth could she say that would make sense to ask after her friends health seemed almost a mockery it was serafina who spoke first thank you for coming she said quietly i was afraid that no one would tell you i have bad days sometimes and i dont remember things i talk too much vespasia looked at her her eyes were not empty anymore but filled with a deep anxiety she was desperately searching vespasias face for understanding it was as if the woman vespasia knew had returned for a moment the purpose of visiting is to talk vespasia said gently the whole pleasure of seeing people is to be able to share ideas to laugh a little to recall all the things we have loved in the past i shall be very disappointed if you dont talk to me serafina looked as if she was struggling to find words that eluded her vespasia thought immediately that without meaning to she had placed further pressure on serafina acting as if she was hoping to be entertained that was not what she had meant at all but how could she retrace her steps now without sounding ridiculous is there something you would particularly care to talk about she invited i forget things serafina said very softly sometimes lots of things so do i vespasia assured her gently most of them dont matter sometimes i muddle the past and the present serafina went on now she was watching vespasia as if from the edge of an abyss in which some horror waited to consume her vespasia tried to think of a reply but nothing seemed appropriate for what was clearly at least to serafina a matter of intense importance this was no mere apology for being a little incoherent she seemed frightened perhaps the terror of losing ones grip on ones mind was deeper and far more real than most people took time or care to appreciate vespasia put her hand on serafinas and felt the thin bones the flesh far softer than it ever used to be this was a woman who had ridden horses at a gallop few men dared equal who had held a sword and fought with it light flashing on steel as she moved quickly lethally and with beautiful grace it was a hand that so swiftly coordinated with her eye that she was a superb shot with both pistol and rifle now it was slack in vespasias grip we all forget vespasia said softly the young less so perhaps they have so much less to remember some of them barely anything at all she smiled fleetingly you and i have seen incredible things butchers bakers and housewives manning the barricades sunset flaming across the alps till the snow looked like blood weve danced with emperors and been kissed by princes i at least have been sworn at by a cardinal she saw serafina smile and move her head in a slight nod of agreement we have fought for what we believed in vespasia went on we have both won and lost more than the young today have dreamed of but i daresay their turn will come serafinas eyes were clear for a moment we have havent we thats what im afraid of what frightens you my dear i forget who is real and who is just memory serafina replied sometimes the past seems so vivid that i mistake the trivia of today for the great issues that used to beand the people we knew does that matter vespasia asked her perhaps the past is more interesting the smile touched serafinas eyes again infinitelyat least to me then the fear returned huge and engulfing her voice shook but im so afraid i might mistake some person now for someone else i knew and trusted and let slip what i shouldnt i know terrible things dangerous things about murder and betrayal do you understand frankly vespasia did not she was aware that serafina had been an adventurer all her life she had never let her causes die from her mind she had married twice but neither time had been particularly happy and she had no children but then she could outride and outshoot so many men she was not an easy woman to be comfortable with she had never learned to keep her own counsel about her political opinions nor to temper the exercise of her more dangerous skills but this was the first time vespasia had seen fear in her and that was a shock it touched her with a pity she could not have imagined feeling for such a proud and fierce woman are any of those secrets still dangerous now she asked doubtfully it was hard to sound reassuring without also sounding as though she was patronizing serafina implying that her knowledge was outdated and no one would still be interested it was a judgment so easy to mishandle vespasia herself would hate to be relegated to the past as if currently not worth bothering about even though one day that would assuredly be true she refused to think of it of course they are serafina told her her voice husky with urgency why on earth do you ask have you lost all interest in politics whats happened to you it was almost an accusation serafinas dark eyes were alive now with anger vespasia felt a flash of her own temper and crushed it immediately this was not about her vanity not at all she replied but i cannot think of anything current that might be affected by most of my knowledge of the past you never used to be a liar serafina said softly her mouth a little twisted with unhappiness or at least if you were you were good enough at it that i did not know vespasia felt the heat burn up her face the accusation was just of course some of the events she knew the acutely personal ones would still be dangerous if she were to speak of them in the wrong places she would never do so but then she always knew exactly where she was and to whom she was speaking those sorts of secrets you would keep she told serafina you would not mention them even to the people involved it would be such awfully bad taste suddenly serafina laughed a rich throaty sound taking vespasia back forty years in the time of a single heartbeat vespasia found herself smiling too she saw them both on the terrace of a villa in capri the summer night was heavy with the scent of jasmine across the water vesuvius lifted its double peaks against the skyline the wine was sweet someone had made a joke and laughter was swift and easy then a log burned through and fell in the fireplace with a shower of sparks vespasia returned to the present the warm bright room with its flowered curtains and the old frightened woman in the bed so close to her you had better ask miss freemarsh to be sure that certain people do not call on you vespasia said with absolute seriousness there cannot be so many of them left now give her a list tell her you do not wish to see them you must have a ladys maid who would help you oh yes i still have tucker serafina said with warmth god bless her shes almost as old as i am but what reason shall i give she searched vespasias eyes for help no reason at all vespasia told her it is not her concern who you will see or not see tell her so if she presses you invent something i shall forget what i said then ask her say what did i tell you if she replies by repeating it then you have your answer if she says she cant recall then you may start again too serafina lay back on her pillows smiling the look in her eyes far away that is more like the vespasia i remember they were great days werent they yes vespasia answered her firmly and honestly they were marvelous more of life than most people ever see but dangerous serafina added oh yes and we survived them youre here im here she smiled at the old woman lying so still in the bed we lived and we can share the memories with each other serafinas hand slowly clenched the sheets and her face became bleak with anxiety again thats what im afraid of she whispered what if i think its you but its really someone else what if my mind takes me back to the days in vienna budapest or italy and i say something dangerous something from which secrets could be unraveled and understood at last her frown deepened her face now intensely troubled i know terrible things vespasia things that would have brought down some of the greatest families i dare not name them even here in my own bedroom you see she bit her lip i know who you are now but in thirty minutes i might forget i might think it is the past and you are someone else entirely who doesnt understand as you do i might she swallowed i might think i am back in one of the old plots an old fight with everything to win or lose and tell you something dangerous a secret do you see vespasia put her hand on serafinas very gently and felt the bones and the thin knotted tendons under her fingers but my dear right now you are here in london in late february of and you know exactly who i am those old secrets are past italy is united except for the small part in the east still under austrian rule hungary is still lesser in the empire and getting more so with each year and the whole balkan peninsula is still ruled from vienna most of the people we knew are dead the battle has passed on from us we dont even know who is involved anymore you dont serafina whispered i still know secrets that matterloves and hates from the past that count even now it wasnt really so long ago in politics perhaps but not in the memories of those who were betrayed vespasia struggled for something to say that would comfort this frightened woman perhaps miss freemarsh will see that you are not left alone with anyone if you ask her she suggested that would not be unnatural in the circumstances serafina smiled bleakly nerissa she thinks i am fantasizing she has no idea of the past to her i am an old woman who enlarges her memories and paints them in brighter colors than they were in order to draw attention to herself and to make up for the grayness of today she is far too polite to say so but i see it in her eyes serafina looked down at the coverlet and she has other things on her mind i believe she might be in love i remember what that was like the excitement the wondering if he was coming that day or the next the torment if i thought he favored someone else she looked up at vespasia again laughter and sadness in her eyes and questioning of course vespasia agreed one does not forget perhaps one only pretends to now and then because the sweetness of it comes so seldom as one gets older we remember the pleasure and tend to forget the pain she drew her mind back to the present issue does nerissa have any idea who you are and what you have accomplished serafina shook her head no how could she the world was different then i knew everybody who mattered in one empire and you did in the other we knew too many secrets and i wonder if perhaps you still do vespasia was momentarily discomfited she did know far more of the present world and its political and personal secrets than she would tell anyone even thomas pitt how had serafina seen through her so easily and in a mere quarter of an hour the answer was simple because at heart they were alike believers who cared too much women who used their courage and charm to influence men who held power and could change nations a few vespasia admitted but old ones embarrassing possibly but not dangerous serafina laughed liar she said cheerfully if that were true there would be sadness in your voice and there isnt i hear no regret i apologize vespasia said sincerely i underestimated you and that was rude of me i forgive you i expected it one has to lie to survive my fear is that as i get worse i shall lose the judgment and possibly even the ability to lie anymore vespasia felt another even more painful wave of pity for her serafina had been magnificent a tigress of a woman and now she lay wounded and alone afraid of shadows from the past i shall speak to miss freemarsh she said firmly what about your tucker is she still able to hold her authority with the other servants oh yes god bless her i wouldnt have anyone else but she is seventy if she is a day and i cannot expect her to be here all the time sometimes i see how tired she is she stopped no more explanation was necessary perhaps it would be possible to get you a nurse who would be by your side all the time at least all day when people might call vespasia suggested someone who understands sufficiently to interrupt any conversation that might veer toward the confidential do such people exist serafina asked dubiously they must vespasia said although she had only just thought of it what happens to people who have been in high positions in the government or the diplomatic service or even the judiciary and know things that would be disastrous if spoken of to the wrong person they too can become old and illor for that matter drink too much again serafina laughed it was a light happy sound an echo of who she used to be you make me feel so much better she said sincerely i am growing old disgracefully shabbily in a way and becoming a liability to those i loved and who trusted me but at least i am not alone if you are not too busy doing great things please come and see me again i shall come with pleasure vespasia replied even if i should be fortunate enough to have some great thing to dowhich i doubt she rose to her feet now i must see miss freemarsh and tucker if i can then i will look for a nurse with intelligence and discretion thank you serafina replied her voice for an instant husky with gratitude and perhaps relief vespasia left the room and went farther along the corridor hoping to find tucker she could remember her as a young woman just starting out in serafinas service when they were all in italy when vespasia herself was not yet twenty she had seen her again briefly maybe a dozen times over the years but would she recognize her now she must be greatly changed there was a young laundry maid with a pile of freshly ironed sheets coming toward her excuse me will you tell me where i might find miss tucker vespasia asked the maid dropped a halfcurtsy yes mlady shell be downstairs can i fetch er for yer yes please tell her that lady vespasia cumminggould would like to speak to her tucker appeared within a few moments walking stiffly but with head held high along the passageway from some stairs at the farther end vespasia knew her without hesitation her face was wrinkled and pale her hair quite white but she still had the same high cheekbones and wide blue eyes which were a little hollow around the sockets good morning tucker vespasia said quietly i am grateful that you came so quickly how are you i am quite well thank you mlady tucker replied it was the only answer she had ever given to such a question even when she had been ill or injured i hope you are well yourself maam yes thank you the ritual civilities observed vespasia moved on to the subject that concerned them both i see that mrs montserrat is not well and am very anxious that she should not cause any ill feeling by her possible lapses of memory she saw instantly in tuckers face that she understood precisely what vespasia meant they were two old women an earls daughter and a maid standing in a silent corridor with more shared memories and common understanding than either of them had with most other people in the world and yet it was unthinkable especially to tucker that the convention of rank should ever be broken between them it might be advisable if you were to remain in the room as often as you may whether mrs montserrat thinks to ask you or not even if you do no more than assure her that she said nothing indiscreet it would comfort her a great deal tucker inclined her head very slightly yes mlady ill do my best miss freemarsh she changed her mind and did not say whatever it was she had been about to thank you vespasia knew she had no need to add more it is nice to see you again tucker good day good day mlady vespasia turned and went to the main staircase it was kind of you to call nerissa said when she met vespasia at the foot of the stairs by the lamp on the newel post nonsense vespasia replied rather more briskly than she had intended to the comfort of speaking to tucker the moment before slipped away from her she was deeply disturbed and it had taken her by surprise physical decline she was prepared forto a degree it was inevitablebut the slipping away of mental grasp even of identity she had not considered perhaps because she did not want to could she one day be as isolated and afraid as serafina was dependent on people of a generation who neither knew nor understood anything of who she was people like this cool young woman who imagined that compassion was no more than a duty an empty act performed for its own sake i came because serafina and i have been friends for more years than you are aware of vespasia said still tartly i am gravely remiss in not having come before i should have taken the care to know how ill she is she is not in pain nerissa said gently something in the patience of her tone irritated vespasia almost unbearably it was as if in her perception vespasia was also unable to grasp reality vespasia bit back her response with a considerable effort because she needed this young womans cooperation she could not afford to antagonize her so she assured me she said however she is in distress maybe she has not told you so but she is convinced that in her memory lapses she may be indiscreet and the thought of it troubles her profoundly nerissa smiled oh yes im afraid she is not always quite sure where she is or what year it is she rambles quite a bit but it is harmless i assure you she speaks of people she knew years ago as if they were still alive and frankly i think she romanticizes the past rather a lot her expression became even more patient but that is quite understandable when the past is so much more exciting than the present who would not want to dwell in it a little and we all remember things with perhaps more light and color than they really possessed vespasia wanted to tell this young woman with her indifferent face and healthy young body that serafina montserrat had a past with more vivid color than any other woman nerissa was likely to meet in her lifetime but her purpose was to safeguard serafina to remove the fear whether founded or not rather than put nerissa freemarsh in her place the reality doesnt matter she said ashamed of the evasion but knowing that it was necessary she could not afford to tell nerissa more than a suggestion of the truth since the young woman clearly did not consider it important enough to guard with discretion serafina is anxious that she may unintentionally speak of someone elses private affairs she continued would it not be possible to see that her visitors are limited and that someone is with her who would interrupt if she seems to be wandering in her mind such assurance might relieve her anxiety tucker is excellent but she cannot be there all the time i can look for someone suitable and suggest a few possible names nerissa smiled her lips oddly tight you are very kind but aunt serafina would dismiss such a person within a short while she hates to be fussed over her fantasy that she knows all kinds of state secrets and terrible things about the private lives of archdukes and so on is complete imagination you know the few people who call on her are quite aware of that it pleases her to daydream in that way and it does no harm no one believes her i promise you vespasia wondered if that was true in the past thirty or forty years ago serafina had certainly known all manner of things about the planned rebellions within the vast austrohungarian empire she had been part of some of them she had dined danced and very possibly slept with minor royaltyeven major for all vespasia knew but that was all long ago most of them were dead now and their scandals were gone with them along with their dreams nerissa smiled it is kind of you to care but i cannot limit aunt serafinas visitors it would leave her terribly alone to talk to people to remember and perhaps romance a little is about the only real pleasure she has and it is generous of you to consider another servant but that is not the answer i dont wish to tell aunt serafina but it is not economically wise at present vespasia could not argue with her it would be both impertinent and pointless she had no idea as to serafinas financial situation i see i hope you will come again lady vespasia you were always one of her favorites she speaks of you often vespasia doubted it but it would be ungracious to say so we were always fond of each other she replied of course i shall come again thank you for being so patient nerissa walked with her across the parquet floor toward the front door and the carriage waiting at the curbside the horses fretting in the wind victor narraway was already extremely bored with his elevation to the house of lords after his adventure in ireland and his dismissal from special branchwhich had stretched him emotionally far more than he had foreseenhe wanted something to occupy his time and his mind a position that had use for at least some of his talents but for narraway to interfere in special branch now that thomas pitt was head would imply that he did not have confidence in pitts ability it would undermine any action pitt took not only in pitts mind but also in the minds of those he commanded and those to whom he reported it would be the greatest disservice narraway could do him a betrayal of the loyalty pitt had always shown pitt had trusted in narraways innocence in the oneil case when no one else believed him and his guilt seemed clearindeed it was morally true that he was partly at fault still pitt had refrained from blaming him for anything so narraway was left bored and felt more acutely alone than he had expected to able to watch but unable to participate not that there was much to participate in in the months since pitt had been in charge nothing out of the ordinary had occurred nothing to challenge the imagination or the nerve narraway had considered foreign travel as an option and indeed had taken a late autumn trip to france he had always enjoyed its rich countryside he had walked around some of its older cities reviving his halfforgotten knowledge about them and adding to it however after a while it became stale because he had no one with whom to share it there was no charlotte this time no one elses pleasure to mirror his own that was a pain he still preferred not to think of he had had the time to attend more theater he had always enjoyed drama comedy was for him profoundly bereft without the presence of oscar wilde who had been stigmatized for his private life and whose work was no longer performed on the stage it was an absence narraway felt with peculiar sharpness there was always opera and recitals of music such as that of beethoven or liszttwo of his favorites but all these pursuits only stirred in him the hunger for something to do a cause into which to pour his own energy he sat in his booklined study with its few small watercolor seascapes the fire burning and the gaslamps throwing pools of light on the table and floor he had eaten a light supper and was reading a report of some politicians visit to berlin he was looking desperately and without success for a spark of intrigue or novelty in it so he was delighted to be interrupted by his manservant announcing that lady vespasia cumminggould had called he sat upright in his chair suddenly wide awake ask her in he said immediately bring the best red wine white sir surely the manservant suggested no she prefers red narraway replied with assurance and also bring something decent to eat thin brown toast and a little pate please yes my lord the man smiled rolling the title around on his tongue he was inordinately proud of his master he did not say so but he thought narraway was a great man underappreciated by his government a trespass for which he did not forgive it vespasia came in a moment later she was wearing a deep shade that in the gaslight was neither blue nor purple but something in betweenmuted like the night sky he had never seen her in anything jarring though she was always dressed subtly when she was in the room one looked at no other woman he considered greeting her with the usual formalities but they knew each other too well for that now especially after the recent fiasco in ireland and then with the queen at osborne good evening victor she said with a slight smile she had taken to using his christian name recently and he found it more pleasing than he would have admitted willingly there was no one else who called him by his first name lady vespasia he looked at her closely there was anxiety in her eyes though she maintained her usual composure what has happened its not thomas is it he asked with sudden fear she smiled no so far as i am aware all is well with him it is possible that what i have to tell you is nothing of importance but i need to be certain narraway indicated the chair opposite his own she sat with a single graceful movement her skirts arranging themselves perfectly without assistance you would not come unless it mattered to you he replied i have not made my boredom so obvious that you would come simply to rescue me at least i hope not she smiled with real humor this time and it lit her face bringing back all the grace of her beauty and the sharp realization of how radiant she could be oh dear i had no idea she murmured is it that dreadful tedious beyond belief he answered crossing his legs and leaning back in his chair comfortably nobody tells me anything of interest either they assume i already know itand very possibly i door else they are afraid they will be seen talking to me and people will assume they are passing me dark secrets the manservant reappeared with the wine and food he served it with only the barest questions as to its acceptability and then retreated narraway waited as vespasia sipped her wine do you know serafina montserrat she finally asked in a quiet voice he searched his memory is she about our age he asked that was something of a euphemism vespasia was technically several years older than he but it was of no importance she smiled the manners of their lordships are rubbing off on you victor it is not like you to be so oblique toward the truth she is somewhat older than i and considerably older than you ah yes i have heard of her but only in passing mostly in reference to certain european matters those brief sputters of revolution in the austrohungarian empire and italy he replied she would not like our efforts to be referred to as sputters vespasia observed drily there was amusement in her eyes but also pain indeed i apologize but why do you ask has something happened to her he asked time she replied ruefully and it has affected her rather more severely than it affects most of us shes ill vespasia it is not like you to be so evasive he leaned forward uneasily what is it that concerns you we know each other well enough not to skirt around the truth like this she relaxed slightly as if she was no longer bearing her great tension alone she is becoming very severely forgetful she said at last to the point of slipping back into the past and imagining she is young again and in the midst of all manner of intrigues with people who are no longer aliveor if they are are long since sunk into decent retirement he was still not sure why this would trouble her so much so he waited watching the firelight on her face she took a slice of toast and spread pate on it but did not eat she is afraid that she will accidentally betray some secrets that still matter she told him do you think that is possible her niece nerissa freemarsh feels that serafinas talk is largely fancy she did not say so in so many words but she implied that serafina is creating a daydream to make her essentially tedious life more exciting than it is and it is true that she would not be the first person to embroider the truth in order to gain attention she lowered her gaze as if she was ashamed of what she was about to say in her circumstances it would be easy enough to understand if i were bound to my bedroom alone and dependent upon others for virtually everything and those others were far more concerned with their own lives i might well retreat into memories of the days when i had youth and strength and could do what i wished and go where i pleased no one likes to be constantly obliged and to have to plead where they used to command narraway nodded he also dreaded such a fate he was still in excellent physical health and his mind was as sharp as it had ever been but here he was becalmed in a professional backwater perhaps a slow decline into complete obscurity was what awaited him and eventually even the helplessness vespasia spoke of with such pity what would you like me to do he asked she considered for only a moment i know something about serafina but what i know has mostly to do with the revolutions of and of course the italian unification and freedom from austrian rule but we have met seldom since then and when we have spoken it has been without details i know she fought hard and was physically extraordinarily brave far more so than i but does she really know secrets about anything that could matter now those revolutions were so long ago does anyone care anymore who said or did what at that time narraway thought about it for several minutes before answering her the coals settled in the fire and he took a pair of delicate brass tongs to replace them politically i doubt it he said finally but if she knew of some personal betrayal peoples memories can be long although as you say most of the people from that time are gone but i can ask a few discreet questions even if it is just to set your mind at rest and to confirm that there is no one left whose life she might jeopardize im afraid that is the best i can think of to do at present i wish i knew how we might persuade her that it is rather than whatever year she believes it to be vespasia smiled at him gratitude warming her face thank you it will be a beginning and perhaps all we can do is she afraid for her own safety he asked the question startled vespasia why no i dont think so no shes concerned that she might unintentionally betray someone else not being fully aware of who she is talking to or where she is he looked at her steadily across the low table with its tray of food the firelight winked on the dusty glass of the wine bottle are you sure her eyes widened no she said very softly i thought it was the confusion of not knowing that frightened her most the dread that she might betray all that she has been in the past by speaking too much now but maybe you are right perhaps she is afraid of someone trying to ensure her silence for some reason even at the cost of her life but why would she worry about such a thing i dont know he admitted picking up a slice of toast but finding out will give me something worthwhile to do i shall be in touch with you as soon as i learn anything beyond what you already know thank you victor i am grateful to you he smiled i can do nothing tonight have some more wine and let us finish the pate the following morning narraway began to search for any reference he could find to serafina montserrat in the past he would have had access to special branch files oreven more simplyhe could have gone to his predecessor and asked him for whatever information he could recall but now he had no authority no position from which to ask anything andperhaps more importantno ability to demand that whatever he said be kept private he could have gone to pitt but pitt had enough to be concerned with in his new command moreover he certainly would know nothing himself he was far too young he had been a child at the time of serafinas activities narraway began at his club on the strand approaching one of the oldest members quite casually he learned nothing at all a second inquiry gained him exactly the same result by midafternoon he had exhausted the obvious avenues which were certainly few enough he did not want to raise interest or suspicion so he had kept his questions very general he simply asked about the times and places that concerned serafina but mentioned no individual people the answers had been interesting memories of a year that had contained a brief hope for freedom a hope that remained elusive even now vespasias name had come up briefly but not serafinas if indeed she had known anything of danger or embarrassment to anyone she had kept her own counsel quite remarkably by late afternoon it was growing colder and he was beginning to believe that serafinas imagination was a great deal more colorful than the reality had been walking briskly across russell square under the bare dripping trees he accepted that he would have to go to a more direct source and ask his questions openly he smiled at his own inadequacy he should have more sympathy with serafina montserrat especially if she had been as dynamic as vespasia had said to lose power he thought is like watching yourself fade away pieces of you slipping out of your control and vanishing so that you grow ever smaller and more helpless until there is nothing left of you except a tiny heart that knows its own existence but can do little to affect anything else he should have more pity for the old treat them with the same dignity he would have given someone more powerful than he he made the resolution then and there to do so hoping he would always be able to keep it he came out in woburn place and hailed a passing hansom giving the driver his home address he climbed in with some relief the next day he telephoned lord tregarron at the foreign office an acquaintance from his days at special branch he arranged to call upon him that evening tregarrons father had been dead some years now but he had been an expert on the austrohungarian empire he had spoken both german and hungarian the predominant two of the twelve different languages spoken among the mass of peoples and nationalities that had been loosely joined in the empire narraway spent most of the day reading in the library of the british museum reminding himself of the history of the austrohungarian empire in the last fifty to sixty years the empire that claimed to be the descendant of the holy roman empire of medieval europe heir of the might and influence of rome itself he read about the various rebellions of each of its constituent parts their passion to gain more autonomy serafina was italian venice and trieste were swallowed up by austria losing their ancient culture and their ties to their own people venice had regained its freedom but trieste and its surrounds had not yet done so but he found little mention of serafinas name and even when he did it was oblique was she in fact making up her knowledge of dangerous secrets as vespasia half feared to color in retrospect a life that was rapidly slipping away from her it was after dinner when narraway reached tregarrons house in gloucester place he stepped out of his hansom into the first scattering of freezing rain the footman showed him immediately into the oakpaneled study where rows of bookcases were filled with leatherbound volumes and pictures of cornish seascapes hung in the panels free for such decoration tregarron himself came in a moment later evening narraway he said cheerfully can i offer you something brandy a decent cigar its a miserable night it must be a matter of some importance to bring you away from your own fireside at this hour he waved toward a large leather chair indicating that narraway should be seated no thank you narraway declined the offer but sat down comfortably i dont want to keep you longer than i need to it is gracious of you to spare me the time old habits tregarron said drily sitting in the companion chair opposite him and leaning back crossing his legs how can i help you now you said something about the austrohungarian empire pretty good shambles especially after that awful business in mayerling he pulled his face into an expression of regret and a certain unmistakable degree of disgust emperors only son heir to the throne commits suicide with his mistress in a hunting lodge if thats what it was of course he let his words hang in the air maybe it was just the best interpretation they could put on it under the circumstances i think its rubbish narraway said briefly unless he was insane no royal prince takes his own life because he cant marry his mistress his wife might have been any kind of a bore or a harridaneven then you just live separately its been done by more kings than ive had good dinners the old emperor himself has a mistress in spite of having married for love tregarron smiled widely showing strong teeth my father spent years in vienna he said franz josef was supposed to marry the empresss elder sister but he fell madly in love with sisi on sight and wouldnt have anyone else yes and your father probably wouldve been the man to know narraway agreed but that makes it even more unlikely that rudolf would have taken his own life simply because he couldnt possibly make her empress when the time comes i dont believe it was it the mayerling business you wanted to speak to me about tregarron asked curiously how does that concern our government or special branch for that matter no it has nothing to do with mayerling or rudolf narraway said quickly it goes back much further than that possibly thirty years or more forty even fifty good heavens tregarron looked startled and amused how old do you think i am narraway smiled i was actually thinking of your father you said he spent years in vienna there was a brief tap on the door and without waiting for a reply lady tregarron came in she was in her midforties but still extremely attractive in a quiet comfortable way her features were unremarkable her coloring quite ordinary but she carried with her a kind of serenity it was impossible to imagine her troubled by any sort of ill temper good evening lord narraway she said with a smile how pleasant to see you may we offer you something perhaps a fresh cup of tea i assume you have dined already but if not im sure cook could find you a good sandwich at the very least a cup of tea would be excellent narraway accepted its a miserable night are you sure thats all she asked with concern i dont want to disturb you for long in fact i can come to the point rather more quickly than i have been doing he turned to tregarron have you heard of a woman named serafina montserrat perhaps in some connection with austrian affairs there was a slight flicker across tregarrons face but it was impossible to read montserrat he repeated no i dont think so its the kind of name one would remember italian or spanish perhaps italian narraway answered from the north austrianoccupied territory tregarron shook his head im sorry i have no idea lady tregarron looked from one to the other of them then excused herself to ask the maid to bring tea narraway knew tregarron was lying the expression in his eyes the repetition of the name to give himself a moment to consider before denying gave him away but there was no point in asking again because he had already chosen his position he could not go back on it now without admitting he had lied and what explanation could there be for that if narraway had asked him with lady tregarron not present would the answer have been different was tregarrons denial due to a desire to remain uninvolved in something surely anything serafina knew was too old to affect anyone now and certainly couldnt affect any current government concern but could it affect someones reputation or a friend or was it simply that since narraway was no longer in special branch at all let alone head of it tregarron did not trust him but did not want to say so that thought was peculiarly painful which was ridiculous it had been months now since his dismissal he should be over it he should have found some new passion to consume his energy there were years of spare time stretching ahead of him he forced his voice to sound light free from emotional strain i dont suppose it matters he said lightly it was an inquiry for a friend something to do with informing those who might wish to contact her before its too late apparently mrs montserrat is getting very frail tregarron did not move at all do i take it from your remark that mrs montserrat is dying he asked narraway shrugged that was what i gathered i think she is of very advanced years tregarron blinked really i suppose it was all a very long time ago one forgets how the years pass he smiled ruefully but the expression stopped far short of his eyes narraway hesitated should he let tregarron see that he had observed the slip or might he learn more if he let it pass he decided on the latter yes he agreed with a sigh we were all a lot younger with dreams and energy that i at least no longer possess tregarron appeared to relax easing further into his chair indeed matters are always more complicated than the young suppose them to be perhaps thats just as well if they grasped all the reasons why things wont happen or cant be made to work nothing would ever be tried its certainly a hell of a mess now we dont need firebrands of any sort especially in austria they have got little enough grip on their crumbling empire as it is without harebrained idealists running amok he shifted a little and recrossed his legs before continuing the emperors son died in one of the ugliest scandals of the century and god knows there have been other bad ones weve had the odd few ourselves now his nephew the only heir left is wanting to marry a woman the old emperor considers beneath the position that will be thrust upon her the hungarian situation is bad and growing worse most of europe recognizes that the poor devils are secondclass citizens in their own land italy and the balkans are increasingly restless and im afraid all of that is to say nothing of the chaos in russia and the very considerable rising power of germany which united is now tasting its own strength he bit his lip and stared gravely at narraway we have more than enough to worry about let the past lie in whatever peace it can it wasnt important narraway lied a passing kindness i might have been able to do he smiled apologetically im a trifle bored with listening to their lordships in the house perhaps i should find myself a country pursuit except i am not a countryman apart from the odd weekend perhaps you should remain in london and listen more closely to their lordships im sure you could find something to argue about concentrate their minds now and then on a useful issue tregarron frowned slightly i i hate to ask this but are you confident in this fellow pitt that theyve put in your place in special branch i know he was a good policeman but this is not quite the same thing is it hell need judgment a keenness of perception that police experience wont have taught him he might be brilliant at solving mysteries and be able to unravel criminal activity and tell you exactly whos involved but can he see the larger picture the political ramifications has he actually mastered anything beyond the art of solving crime does he understand anything deeper than that narraway knew exactly what tregarron meant but he affected a slight confusion to give himself time to think tregarron leaned forward filling the silence in an abrupt way as if worried that he had offended narraway i know hes a good chap and probably as honest as the day is long and after that disaster with gower well destroy ourselves without honesty but for gods sake narraway we need a little sophistication as well we require a man who can see ten jumps ahead who can outwit the best against us not just put a hand on the shoulder of the actual perpetrator of a crime the fanatic with a stick of dynamite in his pocket i think one of pitts greatest assets will be that men who think they are clever will always underestimate him narraway replied tregarrons eyebrows shot up and a faint humor lit his face should i consider myself suitably rebuked he inquired narraway smiled this time with genuine amusement not unless you wish to he said smoothly i have every confidence in pitt and you may also but as he went outside into the rain half an hour later he was less certain than he had led tregarron to suppose was pitts own innate honesty going to blind him to the degree of deviousness in others pitt had been born a servant and had spent his boyhood with respect for the master of the estate sir arthur desmond a man of unyielding honor and considerable kindness might pitt at some level below his awareness expect others of wealth and position to be similar how would he cope with the disillusion when he discovered that it was very often not the case then narraway remembered the affair at buckingham palace and thought that very possibly his anxieties were unnecessary he lengthened his stride toward baker street where he would assuredly find a hansom to take him home pitts office was warm and comfortable the fire burned well and every time it sank down he put more coal on it outside the rain beat against the windows sharp with the occasional hail gray clouds chased across the sky gathering and then shredding apart as the wind tore through them down in the street passing vehicles sent sprays of water up from the gutters drenching careless pedestrians walking too close to the curb pitt looked at the pile of papers on his desk they were the same routine reports that greeted him every day but if he did not read them he might miss one thread that was different an omission or crossreference that indicates a change a connection not made before there were patterns that anything less than the minutest care would not disclose and those patterns might be the only warning of a betrayal or an attack to come he was disturbed in the rhythm of his reading by a sharp rap on the door he turned the page down reluctantly come he answered the door opened and stoker came in closing it silently behind him his face was difficult to read as usual pitt had learned to interpret his agitation or excitement by studying the way he moved the ease or stiffness in his body and the angle of his shoulders now he judged stoker to be alert and a trifle apprehensive what is it he asked gesturing toward the chair opposite his desk stoker sat obediently maybe nothing he replied if it was nothing you wouldnt be here pitt pointed out he trusted stokers instincts he was the only one who had believed in narraway when narraway had been accused of treason in the oneil case everyone else had believed only what the evidence seemed to show them stoker had had the courage to risk not only his career but also his life to work secretly with pitt against those who had corrupted and usurped the power it was stoker who had saved pitts life in the desperate struggle at the end stokers mastery of small observations was acute he heard the evasions that skirted around a lie saw the smile that indicated nervousness the tiny signs of vanity in a conspicuous watch chain a folded silk handkerchief a shade too bright the overly casual manner that concealed a far better acquaintance than that admitted to what is it pitt insisted stoker frowned down dover way there have been a few questions about railway signals and points railway points pitt was puzzled you mean where the tracks join or branch what specifically is being asked are you sure its not just routine maintenance stokers face was grim yes its a stranger asking about how the signals work where theyre controlled from can it be done by hand that sort of thing thought it might just be some fellow wanting to explain it to his son at first but there have been questions about timetables the freight trains and passenger trains from dover to london and branch lines as well as if someone wanted to figure out where they cross pitt thought for a moment or two some of the possibilities were ugly and youre sure its the same man asking thats a bit hard to tell extremely ordinarylooking except he had very pale clear eyes the man who asked about the freight trains had on spectacles couldnt see his eyes and the man who asked about the signals and points pitt asked a tiny knot of anxiety beginning to tighten in his stomach different hair as much as you could see under his hat doesnt mean anything anybody can put a wig on whats being moved in and out of dover on the lines he asked about pitt pressed i looked into that heavy industrial stuff mostly some coal fish nothing worth stealing not with a rail crash anyway pitt thought for a moment and you said he asked about passenger trains as well from dover to london think its some passenger they could be after stoker asked its a lot of trouble to go through for one passenger pitt replied it sounds more like some kind of anarchist thinking to create a major disaster just to show us that he can what for stoker was frowning puzzled couldnt even pretend theres any idealism or political motive in that thats what worries me pitt admitted it doesnt make sense we havent understood it yet but youre right theres something planned even if this is just a distraction something to keep us occupied so we miss the real thing but we cant ignore it and if as you say someone is prepared to cause a train crash just to kill one person then it has to be someone of overwhelming importance stoker moved his thin strong hands in a very slight gesture of helplessness whatever they are planning it would have to be soon they wouldnt want to risk a change in the timetables wrecking their plan pitt took a deep breath and suddenly the room felt colder even though the fire was still burning and the windows were still closed so who could it be he asked whos coming from dover to london in the next couple of months who would anarchists want to kill nobody that matters far as i can tell stoker shook his head some russian count is coming to stay for a private visit might be visiting some of our royal family at the same time i suppose one or two politicians but no one important a frenchman and an american cant see why any of them would be worth killing especially here probably far easier to do it at home if you wanted to oh one minor austrian duke duke alois but he doesnt hold any office and hed be easy enough to kill in vienna and whoever did it could escape there whole of europe to go to were an island a foreigner would stick out like a sore thumb unless he hid in one of the immigrant communities in london but why bother it makes no sense then this is to divert us from something else pitt answered something more important stoker nodded his jaw tight more important than a foreign count or duke being assassinated right here in london under our noses well if its a diversion thats the point pitt said grimly they cant hold our attention unless they do something drastic keep looking and tell me what you find stoker rose to his feet yes sir maybe its a dry run to see if we pick it up i thought of that pitt agreed learn everything you can but discreetly when stoker was gone pitt sat back in his chair and considered many cases in the past had begun as a whisper a rumor that seemed trivial at first a fact that didnt quite fit an alliance that was outside the usual pattern narraway had years of experience in seeing the anomaly that was the first indication of a new plot or an attack on a new target until his arrival at special branch pitt had been used to being called in only after a crime had been committed he then worked backward to unravel it the history the motives and the proof of guilt that would stand up at trial it was a new discipline for him to be faced with an event before it occurred and to be responsible for preventing it did those who had appointed him in narraways place really have any understanding of exactly the skills involved in this process had they misjudged pitts abilities because they had seen narraways successes and had known that pitt had contributed to most of the later ones could they be so naive he had a gnawing fear in the pit of his stomach that they could be his own judgment had sometimes been desperately flawed he had been taken in completely during the whole oneil affair he had been just as duped as the rest of them until close to the end and he had believed narraway innocent out of personal loyalty which had nothing to do with reason logic or ability he thought of narraways irish past the tragedies and compromises the things narraway had done that pitt would not have narraway was subtler more experienced and infinitely more devious than pitt a loose cannon whereas pitt was predictable and yet even narraway had come within an inch of being ruined despite all his skill and experience was special branch itself on trial now was that the crux of it was this all part of a larger plan to ultimately proclaim it a failure and get rid of special branch altogether pitt knew that even within the government not everyone wanted them to succeed pitt made it his first priority to learn whatever he could regarding possible assassination targets if the intended victim was indeed someone visiting a member of the royal family then the minister in the foreign office responsible for central and eastern europe would be a good person to begin his inquiries with accordingly he was at lord tregarrons office a little after halfpast two if there was anything in the rumor then foiling the plot was a matter of urgency an assassination on british soil would be one of the most acute embarrassments imaginable whoever the victim was he was still a trifle selfconscious announcing himself as commander pitt of special branch but he managed to hide it he was received with courtesy by a smart young man who was presumably a secretary of some sort and who invited him to wait in a very comfortable room the armchairs were of brown leather and there were newspapers and quarterly magazines on the table before a briskly burning fire he was even offered whisky which he declined the secretary made no move toward the tantalus on the sideboard when he offered as if he had expected pitt to refuse right sir he said smoothly well not keep you longer than we have to ten minutes later it was not the secretary who returned nor lord tregarron himself but jack radley he came in and closed the door behind him he was dressed in a black coat and striped trousers he looked extraordinarily elegant and slightly uncomfortable good afternoon thomas he said with a halfsmile i assume this must be important for you to have come here in person may i tell lord tregarron what it concerns pitt was a trifle taken aback he had not expected to have to explain his errand to anyone else but he had not called on tregarron before perhaps he should have foreseen it i urgently need some information on visitors any of the royal family may be expecting from overseas within the next month or so he replied a little stiffly jacks eyes widened curious but unconcerned anyone in particular i dont know that is what i have come to ask it might be either official or private is there some concern for her majesty now jack looked more anxious special branch doesnt usually bother lord tregarron with this sort of thing not so far as i know pitt replied a little coolly he had heard jacks implied criticism that he was wasting their time my information suggests that the danger may be to the visitor but it could be extremely unpleasant either way i need to speak to lord tregarron as soon as possible jack nodded ill inform him he turned and left closing the door behind him with a click pitt waited pacing back and forth across the deep red turkish carpet until jack returned several minutes later alone pitt started toward the door but instead of opening it for them both to leave jack closed it again this seems rather general jack said unhappily his finger was still on the handle his body blocking the way out what is it that makes you believe there is some threat you made it sound as if it could come from almost any quarter who do you suspect and of what precisely if i could take that information to lord tregarron he might be able to help you pitt was not easily ruffled years in the police had taught him the virtue of patience and also that when people are shocked or frightened they often react aggressively however this faintly patronizing tone from jack of all people was as abrasive as vinegar on a cut you make it sound as if im looking for some kind of personal favor to help me out of a predicament pitt said tartly it is special branchs duty to prevent any assassination attempts on british soil and doing so is as much in the interest of the foreign office as it is in special branchs jack paled and the skin across his cheekbones tightened an assassination attempt is that likely i dont know because i dont know whos visiting apart from the official government list jack stiffened exactly what do you know thomas ill see how it squares with the information we have after all the recent problems with special branch you must understand why lord tregarron is cautious there were spots of color on jacks cheeks but his gaze did not waver that is why i came in person pitt said between his teeth he was on the verge of adding that if tregarron didnt trust him then he had better ask the prime minister to have pitt replaced because nothing would ever get done then he realized how childish that would have sounded and how appallingly vulnerable had he heard someone else say such a thing he would have immediately seen their weakness he took a breath and spoke more levelly i am aware of the delicacy of the situation and special branchs one recent near failure he said faintly emphasizing the word near i would remind lord tregarron that in the end we succeededrather spectacularly jack stood motionless i will remind him he will still want to know the details behind your concern what shall i tell him pitt was prepared he had expected to answer to tregarron personally but he could see that it was going to have to be through jack he outlined what stoker had told him it doesnt seem like much jack said gravely by the time it does seem like much it will be too late to deal with it quickly and discreetly pitt pointed out you might mention that also special branchs job is not to stage dramatic rescues it is if possible to avoid the danger and embarrassment in the first place jack bit his lip ill go and tell him please wait again pitt was too restless to sit in any of the chairs comfortable as they were he stood by the window then paced then stared out the window again at the busy street below the blustering wind whipped at coattails caught umbrellas and endangered hats he could imagine the hiss and splash as the wheels of passing carriages sent arcs of muddy water up into the air behind them it was a quarter of an hour later when jack finally reappeared this time he looked distinctly embarrassed im sorry but we can offer no practical help lord tregarron says that he has considered the information you passed to us and he does not feel that it refers to any of the private visits of which we are aware nor does it seem connected to any of the anarchist groups in europe of which we know in his opinion it is no more than careless gossip and there is no need for you to be anxious he gave a bleak smile he asked me to convey to you his thanks for passing on your concern and for taking the trouble to come personally especially in view of recent past events he seemed about to add something further then changed his mind perhaps a glance at pitts face told him that he was already beyond the point of condescension pitt felt acutely like the policeman he had once been whom welltrained butlers would send to the servants entrance when he had been bold enough to knock on the front door as if they felt that the gamekeepers son was putting on the airs of a gentleman and needed to be put in his place what would narraway have done in this situation the answer was obvious he would not have been in this situation tregarron would have seen him regardless of what he thought of the evidence or would narraway have been confident enough to judge the entire situation more accurately and thus not needed tregarrons opinion was that where pitt had failed thank you for attempting to help pitt said coolly i shall have to acquire the information from some other source this has been a waste of time but it seems that neither you nor i have the power to avoid that good day jack started to say something then changed his mind he was pale but his cheeks were flushed he opened the door for pitt who went out and into the long corridor without looking back jack watched pitt until he was out of sight then returned to tregarrons office knocking lightly he was answered immediately tregarron looked up from his desk the question on his face jack closed the door behind him he found this embarrassing pitt was his brotherinlaw and he both liked and respected him but he knew something of the circumstances of pitts promotion to narraways position and how close the whole affair had come to disaster he knew that pitt must be nervous now perhaps leaning too far toward caution afraid of missing a clue and consequently overreaching himself and his authority if he became officious he would make enemies i think he was just being careful sir he said to tregarron tregarron smiled but it was tightlipped dont let him be a nuisance over this radley if people realize hes jumpy they may start to imagine that theres something real behind it we cant have europe thinking we dont know what were doing keep a tight rein on him will you jack stood very straight yes sir he considered adding something more then thought better of it he was new to his position too tregarron was one of the most dynamic figures in the foreign office he had clearly taken a liking to jack much to emilys delight he sincerely hoped emily had had no hand in his promotion it was extremely important to him to succeed on his own merit early in their marriage he had been content to live very comfortably on the wealth emily had inherited from george ashworth but as time had gone by he had become less happy with it possibly that was due in part to the sense of purpose he saw in pitt and charlottes confidence in him because of it he wanted emily to look at him with the same regard a regard born of belief not duty tregarron cleared his throat impatiently jack smiled yes sir ill see that he doesnt embarrass himself or us thank you tregarron said youd better look over those papers from the german ambassador after dinner that evening pitt sat in the parlor in the big chair opposite charlotte the gaslight was bright and the heavy velvet curtains were closed the fire burned well and the sound of the wind in the trees outside mixed with the faint spatter of rain on the glass was oddly comfortable they were discussing moving house but seemed to be deciding against it at least for the time being are you sure you dont want to he asked looking at her she was mending one of jemimas dresses the faint click of the needle against her thimble was the only sound from inside the room except for the whisper of the flames we could afford it he added i know she smiled the job is enough change for the moment you mean it might not last he interpreted recalling jacks stiff figure standing by the door relaying tregarrons dismissal should he tell charlotte about it not being able to discuss his concerns was the highest price of his promotion it left him alone in a way he had not been used to in fourteen years of marriage he tried to put the warmth back into his eyes to take the stingand perhaps the fearout of his words she was just as sharply aware as he was that if he failed he would not be able to go back into the ranks again that there was nowhere else for him he had no private means unlike narraway or radley no charlotte said firmly looking up and meeting his eyes i mean that i like this house and im not ready to leave it yetif i ever will be weve had a lot of good times here and bador theyve looked bad for a while victor narraway aunt vespasia gracie and you and i have sat up all night in the kitchen and fought some desperate battles she shook her head a little ignoring her sewing a new house would be empty in comparison and im not ready to let the old ones go are you no perhaps im not he smiled feeling the warmth blossom inside him every time i go down the corridor to the kitchen i see gracie standing on tiptoe still a couple of inches too short to reach the plates on the top of the dresser im not used to seeing minnie maude five inches taller but shes a good girl youre happy with her arent you ill always miss gracie but yes i am she said with certainty and daniel and jemima like her which is almost as important then she frowned aware that something was wrong she was uncertain whether he was not telling her because it was confidential or because he did not want to spoil the evening she could read the tension in him as easily as if he had spoken for more than fourteen years they had been friends as well as husband and wife he kept all manner of secrets from the government the police and the general population but he kept only the most specific confidential details from her she saw in his eyes that he had made a sudden decision i saw jack today he said after a moment charlotte waited watching his face reading the conflicting emotions i had to see tregarron about something or at least try to he went on but he sent jack for me to report to and relay his replies back jacks new promotion she said with a little tightening of her lips i think emilys prouder of it than he is did she push him into it he asked possibly a shadow crossed her face was he arrogant pitt relaxed at last allowing his shoulders to ease and his body to sink into the familiar shape of the chair not really i was annoyed because i was damn sure tregarron wouldnt have dismissed narraway like that but i think i went to them with too little information tregarron didnt believe there was any cause for concern and it may well be that he is right i need to know a lot more i should have waited narraway would have and you expect to walk in and be as good in your first year as he was after twenty she asked her eyebrows raised i need to be he said quietly or at least as near as makes no visible difference he failed sometimes as well thomas he wasnt always right i know he did know but that did not ease his anxiety or change the fact that he knew what failure would cost not just him but the entire branch charlotte left home at nine oclock the following morning stepping out onto the pavement feeling a trifle selfconscious in her new riding habit she looked extremely smart in it which she was happily aware of but it had been a long time since she had worn such a flattering and rather rakish outfit it had not been possible until lately money had been reserved for essentials which this most certainly was not especially when one had children who seemed to grow out of every piece of clothing within months a week ago she had agreed to meet emily in rotten row in hyde park to spend an hour or two on horseback accordingly she now walked briskly toward russell square where she was certain she could find a hansom cab the wind had dropped and there was a very slight frost in the air it was a perfect winter morning for a ride however when she alighted in hyde park she felt far less enthusiastic than she had expected to when the arrangement had been made she could not put from her mind pitts conversation about his meeting with jack in lord tregarrons office the trees of the park were bare a fretwork of black lace against the sky the earth of the long bridle path was already churned up by hooves and the grass beyond was the strange almost turquoise color that the frost crystals lent it in the distance there were at least twenty riders already out women sidesaddle graceful in perfectly cut habits men riding astride some of them in military uniform the sound of laughter drifted on the slight breeze she also heard the jingle of harnesses and the thud of hooves as a horse broke into a canter charlotte walked across the hard frosty earth toward the group of horses still held by their grooms and she wondered how much of the previous days encounter jack had relayed to emily did he consider his work also to be bound by secrecy more probably he had imagined that she would hear of it from charlotte today and would have prepared her for that regardless of protocol she saw emily standing by her horse she was easily distinguishable from the other women there by her slenderness and the gleam of winter light on her knot of fair hair visible beneath the brim of her exquisite riding hat which was like a shallower version of a gentlemans top hat its brim slightly curled charlotte estimated the cost of it and felt a flicker of envy she walked onto the gravel which crunched under her boots emily turned she saw charlotte and immediately started toward her good morning she said with a tentative smile her eyes searching charlottes are you ready to ride very much charlotte replied ive been looking forward to it it was a strangely stilted conversation nothing like the ease and good humor they usually shared side by side without meeting glances they walked back to the grooms standing with the animals they mounted and moved out at a walk they nodded to other riders they passed but did not speak to anyone as there was no one with whom they were acquainted the longer the silence lasted the more difficult it would be to break it charlotte knew she must say something even if it was completely trivial words often meant little it was the act of speaking that mattered weve been thinking about moving she began thomas asked me if i would like to but im fond of the house on keppel street a lot of important things have happened while weve been there memories i like to live with or at least i dont want to let go of yet emily looked sideways at her but wouldnt you like to live somewhere slightly larger perhaps on one of the squares or do you think its just a little early to move she meant was charlotte certain that pitt would measure up to the job for a moment charlotte did not answer she was the elder but she would always be socially the junior because of pitts humble beginnings and because emily had a wealth charlotte could never even dream of emily colored uncomfortably and looked away fussing with her reins as though she needed to guide her horse along this safe flat fine gravel and earthen path it is always a good idea not to take success for granted charlotte replied levelly then if one does fail one has so much less distance to fall she saw emilys expression tighten but actually i simply meant that i am not yet ready to leave a house so full of happy memories i have no intention of entertaining so we dont require the extra rooms surely youll have to entertain emily asked and anyway its such fun a smile flickered across her face yes we will have to entertain but only friends charlotte said quickly keeping her horse even with emilys and our friends are perfectly content with keppel street but in thomass new position he will be expected to entertain people who are not necessarily your friends emily raised her fair eyebrows there are certain social obligations with promotions you know head of special branch is a great deal more than just a policeman even a gifted one you will have to get used to speaking easily to government ministers ambassadors and all kinds of other ambitious and useful people i doubt we would ever be able to afford a house fit to entertain people like that charlotte said drily its a promotion not an inheritance emily winced i didnt realize you felt so badly about it im sorry charlotte reined in her horse it she questioned emily stopped too money isnt that what were talking about its what youre talking about charlotte corrected her i was talking about living in a house where im comfortable rather than buying a bigger one that i dont need and that is a strange place to me without familiarity or memories im not you emily and i dont want the same things dont be so pompous emily snapped back this is really about jack having to tell thomas he couldnt see lord tregarron isnt it her tone was challenging almost daring charlotte to deny it well if were speaking of pompous charlotte began it was not really charlotte cut across her well it seems you know far more about it than i do but then thomass work is secret he cant tell anyone even me she urged her horse on moving ahead of emily she hated quarreling especially with someone she cared for so deeply it left her feeling unhappy and oddly alone but she would not let jacks sudden promotion go to emilys head or jacks for that matter and allow them to thoughtlessly make worse pitts sense of being out of his depth perhaps she was being unnecessarily protective but then so was emily she reined in her horse again and waited until emily caught up with her without meeting emilys eyes she started again i dont want to move yet its taking things for granted that havent happened for certain i would have thought you of all people would understand that your social position is assured and your financial one but youve a long way to go before you can say the same politically is that thomass opinion emily was not yet mollified charlotte forced herself to laugh i have no idea he didnt mention it why do you think jack has very little further to go that would be a shame emily muttered under her breath and charlotte knew very well that what she said was distinctly impolite while charlotte was riding in hyde park pitt was already in his office at lisson grove asking for all the recent information special branch had gathered about any dissident groups in central or eastern europe particularly within the vast austrohungarian empire the empire stretched from austria itself eastward to include hungary south into northern italy and down the balkan peninsula encompassing serbia croatia slovenia and romania and north to bohemia moravia slovakia and parts of poland and ukraine within its borders twelve different languages were spoken and several major religions were observed including roman catholicism eastern orthodoxy and islam additionally there was a large number of jews in prominent and highly influential positions in vienna a place where antisemitism was deep ugly and growing unrest of one sort or another was normal there vienna might be the cradle of all sorts of new thoughts in politics philosophy medicine music and literature but it was also a city of sporadic violence with a shadow of unease as if there was some doom just beyond the horizon waiting for the moment when all the gaiety would end pitt had requested to see evan blantyre whom he had met at the recent musical evening evans knowledge of the austrohungarian empire was extensive and he might be able to offer the information and assistance lord tregarron had declined to provide he was pleasantly surprised when blantyre agreed to see him almost immediately less than an hour later pitt stood in a pleasant anteroom which had paintings of the austrian tyrol on the walls he was there only briefly before he was ushered into blantyres office this was a large comfortable room with a fire burning in the hearth and armchairs on either side of it there were worn patches on the carpet and the color was faded from age and sunlight the desk was old the wood gleaming like satin good morning commander blantyre said with interest holding out his hand good morning sir pitt replied accepting the greeting i appreciate your taking the time to see me so quickly it may prove to be nothing of importance but i cant let this matter go until i know for sure quite right blantyre said although i must say from the little you told my secretary it all seemed rather coincidental no real reason to suspect that any foreign visitor is the focus of an attack if indeed an attack is even being planned he indicated the chairs near the fire and they sat down opposite each other it is probably nothing pitt agreed but a lot of issues start out as a whisper one coincidence and then another too soon after it people showing an unexplained interest in something that appears to be harmless but then isnt blantyre smiled ruefully curiosity lighting his face well how the devil do you know which coincidences matter is there an intellectual formula for it or is it instinct a particular skill his eyes were steady and bright or something only experience can teach you and perhaps one or two very near misses pitt shrugged im tempted sometimes to think theres a hell of a lot of luck in it but i suppose to call it luck is just a different way of saying that it requires constant observation and the need to run down everything that strikes a jarring note he smiled and as you say one or two close shaves blantyre nodded in other words paying attention to detail and a lot of damned hard work tell me more about exactly what alarms you in these particular inquiries do you really think this is about some intended violence against whom for gods sake and if duke alois really is the target why here it sounds unlikely to me conspirators setting up an attack in a foreign country it would require them to go into a place where they have no network of friends nor many sympathizers every mans hand would be against them true pitt conceded but they would also be unknown to the general public fewer people here to recognize or betray them and there is the other possibility blantyre frowned whats that that they dont intend to escape if they feel passionately enough about their cause they may be prepared to sacrifice their own lives in the process blantyre looked down at the worn pattern of the carpet i hadnt thought of that he said grimly of course men do such thingsand women too i suppose patriots misguided or not come in all forms martyrs as well he looked up at pitt again i still dont find it very likely that sort of great sacrifice isnt something you offer in order to kill a nonentity in sheer practical terms the world doesnt take enough notice he pulled his mouth into a bitter smile and then let it fade tell me exactly what youve found and ill do all i can to learn if its part of a greater plot god knows the last thing we need is some austrohungarian duke blown to bits on our front doorstep pitt told him the core of what he had gathered from stokers reports and added the further information he had received since then as he spoke he watched blantyres expression grow darker and more troubled yes i see blantyre said as soon as pitt had stopped speaking he sat pensively with his strong hands held so the fingertips touched if there were substance to it it would be appalling but how seriously have you considered that it is a wretched string of coincidences making a few unconnected inquiries look sinister when in fact they are not at all or elseand this seems more likely to mesomeone deliberately concocting this stuff to take your attention away from something else that is serious and far more relevant blantyre raised his eyebrows pitt nodded and smiled bleakly i considered that as well that it could all be a bluff he thought for a moment or perhaps a double bluff blantyre let out a sigh of course you are right i really dont think there is any likelihood of an assassination here at the moment but i will look into it ask a few discreet questions at least about the possibility thank you pitt rose to his feet i cant afford to ignore it blantyre smiled and stood also he held out his hand and pitt took it returning the firm grip before he turned to go pitt left the office feeling relieved if only because blantyre had taken him seriously he had treated him as he would have treated narraway pitt smiled to himself as he went down the steps and out into the street and the heavy traffic two days later pitt was sitting alone in his office it was close to the end of february and the daylight faded all too quickly within the next quarterhour he would have to stand up and turn on the gaslight there was a knock on the door and stoker put his head around it mr evan blantyre here to see you sir he said his tone a mixture of surprise and respect says its pretty urgent pitt was surprised too he had accepted that blantyre for all his courtesy had still mostly seemed to think that the whole possibility of a threat to any visiting austrian dignitary was largely a misreading of the information show him in he said immediately rising to his feet a moment later blantyre came in closing the door behind him he shook pitts hand briefly and started to speak even before both of them were seated i owe you an apology pitt he said gravely hitching his trousers a little at the knees to preserve their shape as he crossed his legs i admit i didnt take this theory of yours very seriously i thought you were jumping at shadows a bit understandable after some of the recent tragedies pitt presumed he was referring to the gower case and narraways dismissal he said nothing it was ridiculous to have hoped that some of that wretched betrayal would have remained secret but it still hurt him that so many people seemed to know of it he waited for blantyre to continue blantyres face was very solemn i looked into the information you gave me he went on at first it seemed to be very superficial a series of odd but basically harmless questions unconnected to each other but then i examined them a little more deeply one at a time beginning with the tracing of the most likely route from dover to london which of course is by train pitt watched blantyres face and the intensity in it alarmed him he waited without interrupting it seemed to mean very little blantyre gave a slight shrug hundreds of people must make such a journey inquiries would be natural enough even several days in advance of travel then i looked at the signals you mentioned and the places where such trains would pass a junction on the track you are perfectly right of course freight trains also travel there regularly and a series of accidentssignals green when they should be red points changed and a freight train diverted onto the wrong trackcould create a disaster with enormous proportions you would have far more than just one man dead he drew his breath in slowly then let it out again but i thought i had better see if the route tied in with any known person of importance it did rather more than i supposed it turns out that you are right one of the minor austrian dukes is coming he is of no importance himself but hes still a member of the imperial family and grandnephew of our queen or something of the sort he is making a private visit to a grandson of the queens it is not a government matter at all but his coming and the time that the inquiries concern coincide precisely with the plans made for him to travel from vienna to paris then to calais and across the channel from dover he goes by train to london hell be staying at the savoy not the palace pitt asked in surprise it seems he wants to do a little entertaining himself blantyre said with a tight little smile but you see my point when i made a few inquiries of certain friends in europe they also investigated and found that questions had been asked about the entire route it seems he will be bringing only a few servants a secretary a valet that sort of thing he hesitated only a moment im sorry pitt your instincts were correct this is something you have to take seriously pitt was cold in spite of the embers burning in the grate only a few feet from him until now he had been allowing himself to think that he was probably imagining the danger as tregarron and even blantyre had said but blantyres news changed everything here blantyre held out a small bundle of papers they looked to be hastily scribbled notes perhaps half a dozen sheets in all you will need to follow up on it of course so i have given you the names of the people i spoke to the facts and references i checked i cannot oblige you to keep them secret but i would ask that you tell as few people as possible and only those you are certain you can trust absolutely not only their honesty but also their discretion usually i would not have committed anything to paper but i fear this is far too serious to bother with the usual protocol this is potentially at least a monstrous crime which would kill not only a member of the austrian royal family but also god knows how many innocent britons if we dont prevent it he held the notes out for pitt to take pitt met blantyres gaze then took the papers and looked down at them they were exactly as blantyre had said names places datesall the information pitt needed to check the routes and above all the names and descriptions of known anarchists involved in assassinations in europe and the methods they had used particular emphasis had been given to those who resembled the man who had inquired about railway signals and points he looked back up at blantyre im sorry blantyre said again gravely i know you would rather have been wrong but im afraid it seems that you are not something is planned that could at its worst set us at war with austria pitts mind raced he did not have enough military or diplomatic knowledge to understand why anyone would want to do such a thing if a british train was wrecked though feelings would be high in both countries accusations would be made things said that would be impossible to deny later grief and confusion would turn to anger each country could so easily blame the other god knows who or what is behind it blantyre said softly it may be no more than yet another petty uprising of one of the balkan nations wanting more independence and resorting to their usual violence it happens quite regularly but it may also be a far deeper plan intended to damage britain otherwise why do it here you mean someone prompting them to do it pitt asked quietly in order to accomplish what i dont know blantyre admitted the possibilities are considerable maybe there is some treaty these people wish broken and this is the easiest way to go about it thank you i shall look into all these pitt rose to his feet and offered blantyre his hand the following day pitt sent for stoker who came into the office looking unusually cheerful however his lightness of mood disappeared as soon as he sat down obediently and waited for pitt to speak youll remember that evan blantyre came here yesterday afternoon pitt said quietly id given him the information we had at first he thought it was all irrelevant but he looked into it anyway stoker sat up a little more stiffly and there are plans for duke alois habsburg to visit london from march sixteenth to nineteenth he is to travel first from vienna to paris then calais to take the steamer to dover lastly the train to london he wont stay at the palace but at the savoy hotel there are plans to throw a party at kensington palace for his friends he grimaced as he saw stokers face it is exactly the route we were concerned about and on the day for which inquiries were made stoker let out his breath with a sigh his eyes wide so its real it could be pitt answered or it could be something we have been very subtly allowed to know about in order to draw our attention away from something else but either way we cant afford to ignore it this is the information mr blantyre gave me he passed it over read it check each of the details and each of the names yes sir what are you planning to do learn all i can about duke alois habsburg and look into anyone who could have the slightest interest in assassinating him pitt replied stoker picked up blantyres papers looked at them and made very brief notes from the top two ill come back and get more tomorrow he said rising to his feet anything else pitt asked no sir stoker looked slightly surprised you looked unusually cheerful pitt answered leaving the question in the uplift of his voice stoker smiled yes sir he hesitated a faint color in his cheeks he realized pitt was waiting for him to elaborate had to follow someone yesterday evening he was a bit suspect and pitt pursued what did you catch him doing dont make me pull your teeth stoker he heard his own words and how much he sounded like narraway now the heat burned up his own face nothing sir actually turned out to be a blind alley and pitt snapped he went to a concert sir the music was rather good i thought id hate it but it was sort of beautiful he looked embarrassed but happy as if the memory still lingered with him what was it now pitt was curious even after all this time he knew nothing of stoker beyond his professional skills and his indisputable courage his personal tastes and his life apart from special branch were a complete mystery beethoven sir all piano pitt masked his surprise yes youre right he agreed it must have been good stoker smiled then excused himself and went out pitt bent to study the rest of blantyres notes he added to them a large sheaf of papers he had borrowed from the special branch files and began to study the history of the last ten years quickly moving forward to the present and the character and politics of duke alois habsburg two hours later his eyes stung and his head ached he had read a mass of facts opinions and fears the austrian empire was geographically enormous and a single entity as far as land was concerned it was nothing like the british empire which was composed of countries islands andin the cases of india australia and canadaparts of other continents half the earth away from each other austria was one large mass loosely held together by a dual monarchy one in austria one in hungary it included the best part of a dozen other countries and territories each with its own history language and culture and frequently its own religions as well it had always been an empire of unease its history was marked with plots protests uprisings suppressions the occasional assassination attempt and of course plenty of individual executions franz josef had been emperor for nearly fifty years in some ways he ruled with a light hand allowing a considerable degree of individuality to remain but in others ways he was rigid conservative and autocratic the very nature of the ramshackle empire meant that it was only a matter of time before it fell apart the question was which of all the many divisive elements was going to be the catalyst socialism and its reforms had raised their voices in vienna pitt was startled to learn that the dead crown prince rudolf the heir to the throne who had died at mayerling had believed in its principles so passionately that he had expressed his intent to declare the austrian empire a republic and to rule as its president upon his succession to the throne pitt sat motionless with the papers in his hands and tried to imagine what old franz josef had thought of that and what now of the new heir archduke franz ferdinand blantyre had written a long note about him apparently for all his radical differences with the old emperor ferdinand had no sympathies of the socialist nature he abhorred socialism and its reforms just as heartily as did his uncle blantyres conclusions were the only ones likely given the evidence there was a plot to assassinate duke alois habsburg when he was on british soil presumably in london since there had been anonymous inquiries about arrangements at the savoy hotel and kensington palace if it happened it would be a tragedy and an appalling embarrassment for britain and it would be a disaster for special branch the next morning pitt went again to see lord tregarron he must make the foreign office minister aware of the threat at the very least and possibly see if he could have the trip altered in time place or even route of travel at the last minute and duke alois himself must also be made aware of the danger as before he was met first by jack who was again very smartly dressed in a black coat and striped trousers he looked just as uncomfortable as he had previously when he came into the room where pitt had been asked to wait he closed the door behind him and took a deep breath good morning thomas how are you it was an obvious attempt at civility in a situation he already foresaw as being awkward pitt had anticipated resistance until jack made tregarron aware of the seriousness of the threat he was determined to keep his temper not only for charlottes sakeshe had told him of her encounter with emily at hyde parkbut also because the moment he lost control of himself he would lose control of the situation well thank you he replied but concerned he tried to keep his expression neutral i took the various pieces of evidence i have to evan blantyre as he is the best expert i know on the austrohungarian empire i asked him to evaluate the likelihood of it being linked to serious trouble in britain within the next couple of months he saw jacks face darken apparently duke alois habsburg is visiting one of our royal family in a few weeks time he plans to travel from vienna to paris then to calais by ferry to dover and lastly by train to london the obvious route jack interrupted i am aware of that pitt replied the exact timetable might be less obvious but people are making inquiries about it even so far as the savoy hotel where it is known he will stay and kensington palace where a party will be given a flash of anxiety crossed jacks face really is it austrian officials making sure the route is well planned and safe no the people who are checking are known agitators and anarchists pitt replied one or two of them are implicated in bombings in paris arrest them jack told him for what checking railway timetables exactly arent you being a bit alarmist alois is a very minor figure you know jack gestured with his hands as if appealing to reason or maybe you dont if somebody planned an assassination alois wouldnt be worth their time or the risk are you certain pitt asked very seriously yes jack responded immediately however his tone of irritation made pitt wonder if he really was certain or if he had actually not given the matter any thought until that moment either way he would defend his superiors opinion instinctively and ascertain the details later that was what a loyal secondincommand did pitt shook his head i think there is quite a lot about the austrian royal family and its difficulties that we do not know for example did you expect the suicide at mayerling jack was angry caught offguard by pitts question no of course not no one did he said with considerable annoyance but with hindsight we can see that perhaps we should have pitt pointed out it was a tragedy waiting to happen how do you know that jack demanded coming farther into the room pitt smiled its my job to know a certain number of things unfortunately i didnt piece together then what i now realize were signs and i doubt narraway did either or if he did then no one listened to him jack winced and his eyes became harder ill go and ask his lordship but honestly i think you are scaremongering thomas and i believe he will think so too there is no earthly reason to assassinate alois habsburg hes harmless a lightweight junior member of the austrian royal family of which there are hordes just as there are of ours without adding anything more he turned and went out of the room leaving pitt to wait again this time it was no more than five minutes before he came back into the room looking tense as if he now wanted to say far more than he dared lord tregarron will see you but he can only spare a few minutes he held the door open for pitt to go through he has a meeting with our ambassador to poland in a very short while thank you pitt accepted going out and following jack down a wide elegant corridor about thirty feet along jack stopped and tapped quietly on a large arched door tregarron greeted them stiffly but with the necessary courtesy then looked only at pitt as jack retired to the back of the room making himself all but invisible radley informs me that evan blantyre seems to believe there is some assassination attempt planned against duke alois habsburg when he visits london next month he spoke quickly giving pitt no chance to interrupt him i imagine you have to take notice of these things but in my opinion someone is trying to distract you from your more urgent business duke alois is as radley has told you a charming somewhat feckless young man of no importance whatsoever it would be completely senseless for anyone to waste their time harming him let alone to set up an elaborate plot to do it in a foreign country he shook his head with annoyance it is out of the question that we should admit to the austrian government that we cannot look after him or guarantee his safety in the capital city of our own empire i imagine they would find it impossible to believe we were so incompetent and so would see it as a rebuff if you think special branch cannot deal with it i will ask the home secretary to take care of the matter he has the ordinary police at his beck and call he smiled bleakly perhaps you should ask narraways advice im sure he would make himself available to you pitt was so angry he could think of no words he dared say his hands were shaking he could feel the color burn into his skin he knew jack was looking down at the floor too embarrassed to meet his eyes good day mr pitt tregarron said bluntly good day sir pitt replied and swung on his heel to go out he passed jack without even glancing at him nor was he aware of the rain in his face as he stepped into the street walking into his own house that evening was like walking into a warm embrace even before charlotte met him at the kitchen door she took a long careful look at his face and guided him away from the kitchens savory cooking smells and into the front parlor the fire was burning and the gaslamps were lit but turned low this enveloping comfort was new since his promotion and the ability to afford so much coal what is it she asked as soon as she had closed the door whats wrong with sitting in the kitchen he countered avoiding answering her thomas minnie maude is not gracie but shes far from unobservant you are the master of the house she watches you to see if all is well if the day is good or bad what she might do to please you this is her home now and it matters to her very much pitt breathed out slowly letting some of the anger ease from him he realized with selfconscious displeasure how little he had appreciated the effect his mood had on others he had been born in the servant class he should have known better without any warning he was whisked back to his childhood and saw his mother in the kitchen of the big house and remembered the look on her face the sudden anxiety that would descend when sir arthur desmond had been in one of his rare dark moods or when word had come down that he was not feeling well i saw lord tregarron today he told charlotte first jack of course who suggested obliquely that i am fussing over nothing then tregarron implied that if i cant manage my job i should ask for narraways help he could not keep the bitterness out of his voice she considered it for a moment before replying that is extremely rude she said at length i wonder what is bothering them that they should descend to such ill manners are you asking in a sideways fashion if i was rude first he said with a tight smile he knew every word he spoke was driving a further wedge between her and emily and yet he could not stop himself he felt horribly vulnerable i wasnt i told jack my information came from blantyre hes as good a source as there could be perhaps that is the problem she said thoughtfully are you sure you are right thomas no he admitted im just sure of the price if i am right and we do nothing vespasia returned to call again on serafina montserrat a week after her first visit it was a bright fresh day but surprisingly cold she was pleased to come inside the house even though it had an air of emptiness about it pale flowers were arranged carefully in a vase on the hall table but without flair as if whoever had done it was afraid to be criticized for individuality all the pictures were straight the surfaces dust free but it looked in some way as if the mistress of the establishment was not at home there were no small articles of daily use visible no gloves or scarves no outdoor boots on the rack below the coat stand no silver or ebonytopped cane she was waiting in the cool green morning room where the footman had left her when nerissa came in she closed the door so softly behind herself that vespasia was startled to see her there good morning lady vespasia it is so kind of you to call again nerissa began her unremarkable face was marred at the moment by tiredness and lack of color her plain dark dress did nothing to help in spite of a pale fichu at the neck vespasia felt something vaguely patronizing in the younger womans tone as if visiting an old lady was a thing one did out of charity rather than friendship it is not kind at all miss freemarsh she said coolly mrs montserrat and i are more than acquaintances we have memories in common of times of marvelous hopes and dangers and too few people with whom to share them and others to recall of friends we will never see again nerissa smiled im sure you do she replied but im afraid you will find aunt serafina somewhat less lucid than even a week ago she is failing very quickly she gave a brief apologetic smile her memory has become even more disjointed and she has longer lapses into complete fantasy she cannot now appreciate the difference between what she has read or been told and what has really happened in her own experience you will have to be patient with her i hope you understand of course i do vespasia assured her and even if i do not it hardly matters i have come to visit a friend not to crossexamine a witness i did not mean to offend you nerissa said lowering her eyes i only wished to prepare you for the deterioration you will see in her even in so short a time in case it causes you distress it really is rather serious and i hardly know how to put this delicately but she stopped as if unable to find the right words but what now vespasia was ashamed of herself for having been so cool the younger woman was clearly concerned perhaps other visitors had been tactless or had allowed their own embarrassment to show too plainly what is it that disturbs you miss freemarsh she asked more gently age and illness forgetting things is something that happens to most of us who are fortunate enough to have long lives it can be frightening to realize that we may all be affected one day but it is not something to be ashamed of there is no need for you to apologize nerissa looked up and met her eyes it is more than forgetting lady vespasia she lowered her voice to a mere murmur aunt serafina creates fantasies imaginings as to what she did in the past and it is embarrassing because her accounts are very colorful and some of them involve real people and events she chewed her lower lip until it was pink i wish i could protect her from anyone seeing her like this with no control over her mind and most of the time very little discretion with her tongue she turned away and lowered her gaze until she was staring at the floor she has a great admiration for you you know vespasia was startled she and serafina were not quite contemporaries serafina being a decade older and they were completely unalike vespasia had used her wit intelligence and extraordinary beauty to learn information and persuade men of great power to act as she believed either wisely or generously serafina had been an adventurer in the most physical sense brave skilled and with an iron nerve she had ridden with the insurgents in croatia and manned the barricades rifle in hand in the streets of vienna before the ignominious collapse of the revolution and the emperors return to power in vespasia had done that only once in rome far back in her youth their paths had crossed perhaps half a dozen times since then they had known of each other through allies in the common cause are you sure she asked quietly i think perhaps respect would be more accurate as i have for her and of course we have a friendship now in our later years born possibly out of the understanding of what we fought for then and the passion and the losses of those days you are very modest nerissa replied a very faint edge of bitterness in her voice but admiration is what i meant she looked at vespasia squarely even defiantly she will try to impress you im sorry it is humiliating to see it might be better if you simply left a card i will tell her you called when she was asleep and you did not wish to disturb her she will not believe you vespasia replied she will know perfectly well that you are keeping people from visiting her because you are ashamed of her i will not be party to that the color swept up nerissas pallid cheeks and her eyes were hot with anger but she was not yet mistress of the house and she dared not retaliate i was merely trying to save your feelings she said very quietly and to save aunt serafina from being remembered as she is now rather than as the proud and discreet woman she used to be im sorry if you do not see that i see it very well vespasia told her finding herself torn between pity and irritation and i assure you my feelings are of no importance i shall remember serafina as i knew her in the past regardless of what happens now i am well acquainted with the idea that as we grow older we change and it is not always either easy or comfortable you have not changed nerissa said with candor that bordered on resentment not yet vespasia was now embarrassed herself as if her health and good fortune were blessings she had not deserved but no one knows about the future in another ten years i may be profoundly grateful if my friends still remember me at all and call upon me even if i am tedious and ramble a little or lose myself in a time when i was more alive more able and still dreamed of great accomplishments nerissa did not reply but turned and led vespasia up the wide stairway to the landing and across it to serafinas bedroom door before she entered vespasia heard the footman open the front door to another caller good morning mrs blantyre how pleasant to see you please do come inside the weather is most inclement nerissa half turned and vespasia caught sight of the amazement in her face there was also an expression there that might have been resolve and then a flash of emotion quite unreadable i think aunt serafina has another visitor she said quickly i must go down and welcome her she tapped sharply on the door in front of them then without waiting for an answer she pushed it open for vespasia and excused herself again to go downstairs of course vespasia acknowledged her and went into the room alone tucker was standing near the door to the dressing room a silverbacked hairbrush in her hand the moment she saw vespasia she smiled and her face filled with relief good morning mlady how are you good morning tucker vespasia replied i am very well i am glad to see you with mrs montserrat how are you it was a purely rhetorical question a matter of good manners she smiled at tucker and nodded slightly then turned toward the bed serafina was sitting up her hair dressed she looked wide awake and as soon as she met vespasias eyes she smiled back only when vespasia was closer did she see a vacancy in her look an expectancy as if she had very little idea who her visitor was vespasia sat down in the chair beside the bed and for a moment felt exactly the embarrassment and distress she had told nerissa were unimportant unexpectedly they were overwhelming she had no idea what to say to this person in front of her helpless a spirit trapped not only in an aging body but also in a mind that had betrayed her serafina was waiting staring at her hopefully how are you vespasia asked she felt that it was completely inane yet how else could she begin my leg hurts serafina replied with a rueful little shrug but if you break bones you can expect that to happen ive broken enough i shouldnt be surprised vespasia felt a twinge of alarm was it possible serafina really did have a broken bone could she have tripped and fallen old bones break easily im sorry she said with sincerity i hope the doctor has seen it has it been properly cared for yes of course it has serafina answered her it was in a cast for weeks what an incredible nuisance i cant ride a horse with a cast on you know vespasias heart sank no of course not she said as if it had been a perfectly ordinary comment and it still aches serafina looked blank i beg your pardon after glancing at tucker who shook her head almost imperceptibly vespasia looked back at serafina and struggled for something to say surely adriana blantyre had called to see serafina and was even now on her way up or was it possible shed come to see nerissa they were not so very different in agesix or seven years perhaps but socially they were worlds apart adriana the wife of a man of privilege wealth and accomplishment nerissa a simple woman of no standing and past the usual age of marriage vespasia found herself listening for another footfall on the landing beyond the door expecting interruption at any moment knowing how vague and distracted serafina was today surely nerissa would thank adriana for calling but advise her to come again another day she turned to tucker i saw mrs blantyre arriving perhaps you might suggest to miss freemarsh that she call at a more fortunate time tucker was about to reply when there was a knock on the door a moment later adriana blantyre came in clearly nerissa had warned her that vespasia was already here good morning lady vespasia she said with a smile of pleasure then she turned to serafina how are you today i brought you some lilies from the hothouse i gave them to nerissa to put in water she perched on the edge of the bed far from where she would disturb serafinas feet im well thank you serafina replied blinking and looking puzzled in fact i cant think what im still doing in bed what time is it i should be up a look of alarm filled her face why are you here in my bedroom youve been unwell adriana said quickly you are recovering but its too soon to be out yet and the weather is very cold is it serafina turned to face the window is it autumn the tree is bare or winter winter but nearly spring adriana told her rather raw outside the sort of wind that bites through your clothes then it was nice of you to come serafina remarked do you know lady vespasia cumminggould yes we have met adriana assured her vespasia and i are old friends serafina said nodding a little we fought together adriana looked confused oh serafina gave a little laugh side by side not against each other my dear never against each other she shot a glance at vespasia a secret amused communication adriana looked at vespasia for confirmation or perhaps for help vespasia tried to keep the surprise from her face there was no possible course but to agree certainly she said with as much enthusiasm as she could each in our own fashion she must steer the conversation away from further trouble how much did serafina remember was she now recalling actual past events or was she about to start one of the rambling journeys of the imagination that nerissa had referred to it sounds exciting adriana said with interest and dangerous oh yes serafina leaned back a little against her pillows her dark eyes gazing far away in the distance of recollection very dangerous there were deaths deaths adrianas voice was a whisper the color fading from her face vespasia drew in her breath to interrupt there had been of course but it was long ago and there was no point in raking over tragedy now but serafina continued before she could break in brave people she said softly passions were very high men and women sacrificed their lives for the cause of freedom she frowned and studied adriana closely for several moments but you know that you are croatian you know all these things adriana nodded ive heard the stories her voice choked and she coughed to clear her throat and perhaps to give herself a moment to master her feelings i wasnt there myself now serafina seemed lost werent you why not dont you want freedom for your people for your language your music your culture do you want to wear the austrian yoke forever no adriana whispered of course i dont this time vespasia did interrupt politely but firmly that was all ages ago my dear mrs blantyre was hardly even born then those are old griefs much has happened since that time italy is united and independent at least most of it is serafina looked at her as if she had momentarily forgotten vespasias presence trieste she asked hope flaring in her eyes vespasia thought for an instant of lying but it was such a condescension such a denial of respect that she could not do it not yet but it will come she assured her what are you doing about it serafina asked she was puzzled as if raking her memory but there was also challenge in her question do you not think it wiser to discuss other things just now vespasia suggested fashion perhaps or the latest art exhibition or even politics here at home prince albert is german you know serafina said the saxecoburgs are everywhere everybody who is anyone at all has at least one of them in the family prince albert is dead vespasia assured her firmly is he oh dear serafina blinked who killed him and for heavens sake why he was a good man how terribly stupid what is the world coming to nobody killed him vespasia glanced at adriana and back again to serafina he died of typhoid fever it was many years ago now and yes you are quite right he was a good man perhaps next time i come i shall bring you the latest edition of the london illustrated news and you can look at the current gossip such as there is and some of the fashions for spring serafina turned her hands outward in a gesture of resignation perhaps that would be kind of you she closed her eyes her face looked pale and strained her brows a little wispy her eye sockets hollow vespasia rose to her feet staring at adriana i think perhaps we should leave mrs montserrat to have a little rest she seems tired of course adriana agreed reluctantly she looked at serafina ill come back and see you again soon serafina did not answer it appeared that she had drifted off to sleep adriana led the way out followed by tucker vespasia was at the door when she turned one more time to look at serafina the older woman was staring wideeyed suddenly very much awake her expression one of terror the next moment the look was gone and her face was completely blank again vespasia closed the door and leaving adriana outside on the landing with tucker she went back to serafina gently putting her hand over the stiff blueveined ones on the coverlet she asked what is it what are you afraid of the fear returned to serafinas eyes i know too much she whispered terrible things plans of murder the dead piled up plans about whom vespasia asked trying to keep the pain out of her voice my dear most of them are gone already these are old quarrels you are remembering they dont matter anymore its now there are new issues and they dont involve us as they used to i know its serafina said quickly but some secrets never grow old vespasia betrayal always matters brothers fathers and husbands sold to the executioner for the price of advancement blood money can never be repaid vespasia stared at her and saw the clear sharp light of intelligence in her eyes there was nothing blurred now nothing uncertain but she was afraid and she could not hide it perhaps that was what shocked vespasia the most in all the times they had metin london paris and vienna in the ballrooms or at a secret rendezvous in some hunting lodge or backstreet roomshe had never seen serafina white with terror who are you afraid of she whispered serafinas eyes filled with tears and one hand closed over vespasias her thin fingers desperate i dont know there were so many im not even sure which ones matter anymore and half the time i dont know what im saying tears filled her eyes im not sure who is allied with whom these days and if i make a mistake theyll kill me i know too much vespasia i thought of writing it all down and letting everyone know that i had but what good would that do only the guilty would believe me its all so vespasia held serafinas hand with both of hers are you certain there are still secrets that matter my dear so much has changed franz josef is a relatively benign old man now broken by tragedy i know and i know what that tragedy was more than you do vespasia mayerling vespasia asked with surprise how could you know more about that than what was public information they burned the place to the ground and all the evidence with it not all serafina said softly i know people ive only lost my wits in the last year she searched vespasias eyes but there are other secrets older ones i know who shot esterhazy and why i know who stefans father really was and how to prove it i know who betrayed lazar dragovic the tears spilled down her tired cheeks im so afraid ill forget who im talking to and say something to give it away vespasia realized that serafina was frightened not only of letting the secrets slip but also that whoever was involved would fear the revelations enough to kill her before that happened today she knew what year it was and she knew vespasia but when adriana blantyre had been there vespasia was uncertain whether serafina had truly been aware and was only pretending to be confused or whether she had actually believed it was a different time remembering the look in serafinas eyes the blank helplessness she feared it was the latter anyway what purpose could there be in trying to mislead adriana perhaps it would be a good idea to see fewer people for a little while she suggested it might even be possible to make sure the ones you do see are those who would know little of such things anyway so even if you mistook who they were what you said would be incomprehensible to them i know that could be terribly boring but at least it would be safe serafina understood that and sadness filled her face perhaps it would be smarter she agreed but will you come back again i embarrassment prevented her from finishing the request of course vespasia assured her we could talk of whatever you wish i would enjoy it myself there are too few of us left serafina nodded with a smile and sank back into the pillows her eyes closed and adriana she whispered take care of her for me but she gulped and her voice choked but perhaps i shouldnt see her again in case i say something she stopped unable to finish her thought vespasia remained a few minutes longer but serafina seemed to have drifted into a light sleep vespasia moved the sheets a little to cover her thin handsthe old get chilled very easilythen she walked softly from the room she went down the stairs and asked the maid in the hallway to send for nerissa so she might express her good wishes and take her leave nerissa appeared within moments her face shadowed with anxiety thank you for coming lady vespasia she said a little stiffly im sorry you had to see aunt serafina so so unlike the person she used to be it is distressing for all of us you will know now that i was not being alarmist when i said she is sinking rapidly no of course not vespasia agreed im afraid she is considerably worse even in the few days since i last saw her i think it might be wise in view of her imagination if you were to restrict her visitors rather more i suggested to her that it might be a good idea to see only those who are young enough to know little or nothing of the affairs with which she used to be concerned she was pleased with the suggestion it will ease her fears and of course as you say it would be very sad if people were to remember her as she is now rather than as she used to be i would much prefer not to have it so were i in her position she was uncertain exactly how to phrase serafinas request regarding adriana you might gently turn aside mrs blantyre if she calls again she began and saw the puzzlement in nerissas face she is of croatian birth which seems to awaken particular memories and ideas in your aunt she continued you do not need to give explanations nerissa bit her lip i cant ask mrs blantyre to call less often or to leave earlier she is an old friend it would be very discourteous i couldnt explain it without causing offense and saying more than i know aunt serafina wishes but of course i shall do my best to discourage anyone from staying very long tucker is already helping greatly with that she very seldom leaves my aunt alone thank you for your understanding and your help it was final she was not going to accept any advice if there is anything further please call me vespasia had no choice but to leave the matter i will nerissa promised vespasia walked down the steps to her carriage with her feeling of unease in no way lifted serafina had seemed so sure that she did not want to see adriana again but for whose sake there had been a tenderness in her when she spoke the younger womans name that was deeper than anything vespasia had ever seen in her before and adriana in turn had seemed to care more than casually more than a mere act of kindness would require was it simply because they were fellow exiles with a love of country or something else vespasia was in her carriage and more than halfway home when she suddenly changed her mind and rapped her cane against the ceiling to draw the coachmans attention he stopped and she asked him to take her instead to the home of victor narraway as she had expected when she arrived narraway was not in but she left him a note asking him to call her at his most immediate opportunity the matter was of some urgency and she required his advice and probably his assistance narraway came home in the late afternoon tired from the boredom of having sat most of the day in the house of lords listening to tedious and exhaustively repetitive arguments vespasias note gave him a rush of excitement as if at last something of interest might happen never in his life had vespasia disappointed him he put through a telephone call to her even before taking off his coat her invitation was simple and he accepted without hesitation he found himself sitting forward a little in his seat in the hansom as he watched the familiar streets go by his imagination raced as to what it might be that concerned her to this degree there had been a haste in her handwriting as though she were consumed by a deep anxiety and the tone of her voice on the telephone had confirmed it vespasia did not exaggerate nor was she easily alarmed his mind went back over other tragedies and dangers they had been concerned about together most of them involving pitt some had come very close to ending in defeat all had held the possibility of disaster as soon as he reached her house he sprang out of the cab and hurried up the steps the door opened before he had time to pull the bell the maid welcomed him in took his coat and showed him to vespasias peaceful sitting room its windows and french doors offering views of the garden thank you for coming so promptly she said rising to her feet it was an unusual practice for her he noticed that she did not quite have her customary composure there was something almost indefinably different in her manner she was as exquisitely dressed as always in a bluegray gown with deep decolletage pearls at her ears and throat and her hair coiled in a silver crown on her head i presume you have not eaten may i offer you supper she asked after you have told me what it is that troubles you clearly it is urgent he replied she gestured for him to be seated and resumed her own place beside the fire i visited serafina montserrat again today she told him i found her considerably worse her mind has deteriorated a great deali think she hesitated victor i really do not know at all quite how much she is losing her wits when i first arrived she seemed lucid but her eyes were filled with fear before i had the opportunity to speak with her for more than a few moments adriana blantyre called evan blantyres wife he was startled blantyre was a man of considerable substance and reputation courtesy or friendship he asked quietly friendship she answered without hesitation he watched the deepening anxiety in vespasias eyes and noted the presence of another emotion he could not read perhaps you had better tell me the heart of it he said quietly what is it you fear vespasia spoke slowly as soon as adriana came into the room serafina seemed to begin rambling as if she had no idea what year it was adriana was very patient with her very gentle but it was disturbing what year does she imagine she is in narraway was beginning to feel the same intense pity he knew vespasia was feeling even though as far as he was aware he had never met serafina montserrat i dont know vespasia replied possibly the fifties or early sixties not very long after the revolutions of and who does she believe adriana to be he asked puzzled she cannot be more than forty at the very outside i would have thought less thats what makes so little sense vespasia answered serafina took her for a croatian patriot which is not completely divorced from the truth but she was rambling her eyes were far away her hands clenched on the sheets and then when adriana left i remained behind for a few moments and suddenly serafina was completely herself again and the fear returned she took a deep breath victor she is afraid that someone may kill her in order to prevent her from revealing the truths she knows she spoke of betrayals old grudges and deaths that cannot be forgotten but as if they were all current and there was more violence to come she mentioned mayerling mayerling he was incredulous but serafina was living here in london at the time wasnt she he asked and she must have been well into her seventies and surely not privy to the inside circles of the austrian court anymore vespasia are you sure she isnt romanticizing no im not sure her face was full of grief but her fear is real that i have absolutely no doubt of she is terrified is it possible that there is something for her to fear her voice dropped something apart from loneliness old age and madness he felt the pain strike him to his shame not for serafina montserrat but for vespasia and for himself then the instant after it became pity probably not he said quietly but i promise that tomorrow i shall begin to look into it i had better do it discreetly otherwise if by any wild chance this is true i shall have given whoever she fears more to fear from her yes please be careful vespasia hesitated i am sorry if i am asking you to waste your time she seemed so sure and then the next moment completely lost as though she were alone in a strange place searching for anything familiar narraway brushed it aside he did not want her to feel obliged to him he told her the truth startled at how simple it was for him to confess to her im glad of something to do that is a challenge to my mind rather than my patience he told her even if it should prove that mrs montserrat has nothing to fear as i hope it will vespasia smiled and there was amusement in it as well as gratitude thank you victor i am grateful that you will do it so quickly now that that is decided would you like some supper he accepted with pleasure it would be very much more enjoyable to share the evening with her than to eat alone before the oneil business before going to ireland with charlotte on that desperate mission he would have considered dining at home a peaceful end to the day and the idea of company would have been something of an intrusion solitude a good book the silence of the houseall would have been comfortable now there was an emptiness there a deep loneliness he was incapable of dismissing no doubt it would pass but for the moment vespasias quiet sitting room held a peace that eased his mind narraway gave vespasias request a great deal of thought as he sat quietly in his own chair by the hearth after midnight still not ready to go to bed was he afraid of sleep of nightmares of waking in the dark in confusion for an instant not knowing where he was or perhaps for longer than just an instant would that time come would he be alone pitied no one remembering who he used to be physical changes were part of the tests of life and they included loss of the senses and perception it was not pathetic to lose some of ones awareness of the present and slip back to happier times he could recall his own youth with sharper detail than he had expected his early years in special branch long before he was head of it when he was only learning newer than pitt ever was because he had not had the decades of police experience he had had authority and traveled to some of the most exciting cities in europe and beyond he smiled now at the memories they seemed happy and exciting looking back even though he knew he had at times been lonely then and there had been failures some of them quite harsh now he thought of paris only for its grace the old quarters steeped in the history of revolution in his youth he had been able to stand in the cordeliers with his eyes closed and imagine that if he opened them he would see the ghosts of robespierre the giant danton and the raving marat hear the rattle of tumbrels over the stones and smell the fear the passion haunted the air he had been gullible then believed people he should not have believed one beautiful woman in particular mireille that had been a mistake that had nearly cost him his life he had felt a starryeyed pity for her that had bordered on love he had never been so stupid again thinking of that brought back sharp recollections of what herbert his commander at the time had said to him and with his memory of herbert he knew who he should seek for answers to vespasias questions he was at the railway station by half past seven the following morning and caught the train southward into the bleak rolling countryside of kent before eight oclock at bexley he alighted into a hard driving wind and walked along the main platform to look for a carriage by nine oclock he was knocking on the door of an old cottage just off the high street bare twisted limbs of wisteria covered most of the front walls but he imagined that in the summer they would be covered with soft pale lilac flowers he could smell rain in the wind and the bitter clean aroma of woodsmoke drifting from the chimney the door was opened by a middleaged woman wearing an apron over her dark skirt she looked startled to see him mornin sir she seemed uncertain what to say next good morning narraway saved her the trouble of finding the words is this the home of geoffrey herbert yes sir it is mr herbert is just eating his breakfast may i tell him who is calling she did not add that it was an uncivil hour to visit especially unannounced but it was in her eyes victor narraway he replied he will remember me mr victor narraway she repeated well if you would come in out of the cold sir and take a seat in the sitting room ill tell him youre here she grudgingly pulled the door open wider he stepped inside actually its lord narraway he was not used to the title himself but this was an occasion when the respect it might command would be of service she looked startled oh well ill tell him im sure would you like a cup o tea sir i mean your lordship narraway smiled in spite of himself that would be most appreciated he accepted the sitting room was architecturally typical of a cottage lowceilinged deep window ledges large open fireplace with heavy chimney breast but there the ordinariness ended one entire wall was lined with bookshelves the carpets were oriental with rich jewelcolored designs and there were arabic brass bowls on several of the surfaces it all brought back sharp memories of herbert a man of vast knowledge and eclectic tastes herbert himself came into the room twenty minutes later when narraway had finished his tea and was beginning to get restless he had not seen herbert in fifteen years and he was startled by the change in him he remembered him as upright a little gaunt with receding white hair now he was bent forward over two sticks and moved with some difficulty his clothes hung on him and his hands were blueveined his hair had receded no further but it was thin the pink of his scalp was visible through it lord narraway eh he said with a faint smile his voice was cracked but his eyes were bright and he maneuvered himself to the chair without stumbling or reaching to feel his way he sat down carefully propping the two sticks against the wall it must be important to bring you all the way down here dawson told me you are not in the branch anymore that true yes kicking up my heels in the house of lords narraway replied he heard the edge of bitterness in his tone and instantly regretted it he hoped herbert did not take it for selfpity he wondered what to add to take the sting from it herbert was watching him closely well if youre not in the branch what the devil are you doing he asked you arent here looking up old friends you dont have any you were always a solitary creature just as well head of the branch cant afford to be dependent on anyone you were the best we had hate to admit it but id be a liar not to narraway felt a surge of pleasure which embarrassed him herbert was a man whose good opinion was worth a great deal and had never been easily won so what do you want herbert went on before narraway could find any gracious way of acknowledging the compliment no need to explain yourself i wouldnt believe you anyway if you could afford to tell me it would hardly be worth the bother austriahungary narraway replied herberts sparse eyebrows shot up good god youre not still raking over mayerling and rudolfs death are you thought you had more sense poor bastard shot the girl then shot himself he was always a melancholy creature other than the occasional attack of good cheer on social occasions give him wine laughter and a pretty face and he was fine until the music stopped just like his mother he was always a disaster waiting to happen could have told you that years ago no narraway said succinctly its not about rudolf at all so far as i know then what you said austriahungary going back thirty years or more maybe to uprisings planned or actual narraway said plenty of them herbert nodded autocratic old sod franz josef relaxed his hold a bit recently im told but back then he ruled with a rod of iron he and rudolf never saw eye to eye chalk and cheese what about it he frowned leaning forward a little and peering at narraway why do you care why now thought you werent going to ask me narraway said pointedly herbert grunted of course there were uprisings you know that as well as any of us stop beating around the bush and tell me what it is youre really asking a major revolt drawing in other countries as well possibly a hungarian uprising a look of contempt flickered across herberts gaunt face you can do better than that narraway you know as well as i door you ought tothat the hungarians are content to be a safe secondrate power ruled by vienna while having a very comfortable life if not quite cock of the walk if they rose up against the austrians theyd lose a great deal and gain nothing they are quite clever enough to know that the croatians narraway suggested different kettle of fish altogether herbert agreed erratic unstable always plots and counterplots but nothing has ever come of them at least not yet thats not what all this is about is it foreign office thinks theres going to be another croatian problem of some sort do they not so far as i know narraway said truthfully blantyres your chap herbert observed evan blantyre knows the croatians as well as anyone lived there for a while wifes croatian beautiful woman but unstable so i hear delicate health always sick as a child not surprising family caught up in rebellions and things narraway leaned back in his chair ill ask him if things look like theyre heading that way what about the italians they still havent got some of their northern cities back trieste and that region for example herbert thought about it for a few moments italian nationalists he said thoughtfully could be trouble there disorganized though in spite of cavour and garibaldi and all the unification stuff still quarrel like cats in a bag thought theyd quieted down a bit perhaps narraway said dubiously do you remember in the past an italian woman by the name of montserrat he watched herberts face for even the slightest flicker of recognition herbert smiled a long slow curl of amusement his eyes bright well well he said with a sigh serafina montserrat why on earth are you asking about her she must be seventyfive at least if shes still alive at all i remember when she was thirty rode a horse better than any man i knew and fought with a sword used to be quite good myself but i was never in her class knew better than to try saved me from making a fool of myself italian nationalist narraway made it more a statement than a question oh yes herbert was still smiling but not averse to lending a hand to anyone who was against austria wherever they were from openly narraway asked herbert looked shocked good god no secretive as a priest and devious as a jesuit too you make her sound religious herbert laughed it was a purely happy sound bringing to his face for a moment the shadow of the young man he had once been she was as far from a nun as a woman can get although i didnt know most of that at the time how did you learn narraway asked perhaps more important to me when did you learn and from whom from many people and over several years herbert replied she worked very discreetly thats not what you implied narraway pointed out herbert laughed again although this time it ended in a fit of coughing sometimes narraway you are not nearly as clever as you imagine he said after several moments still gasping for breath you should have taken more notice of women a little selfindulgence would have helped you learn a great deal not only about women in general but about yourself as well and therefore about most men his eyes narrowed too much brain and not enough heart thats your trouble i think secretly youre an idealist its not pleasure you wantits love good god man youre a total anachronism serafina montserrat narraway reminded him sharply was she a wild woman riding and fighting beside the men and sleeping with a good few of them or was she discreet im not here simply because i have nothing to do and need somebody elses business to meddle in this could be important of course you need something to meddle in herbert said without losing his smile we all do id have died of boredom if i didnt meddle in everything i could the locals all loathe me or pretend they do but they all come to see me now and then because they think i know everybodys secrets and do you narraway inquired yes mostly serafina he prompted yes she was as tough and skilled as most of the men better than many herbert responded not really a beauty but she had so much vitality that you forgot that she was he seemed to be staring back into memory elemental he finished narraway could not help wondering how well herbert had known her himself that was a possibility he had not considered before was he asking for information about a past lover of herberts or was that merely imagination and a little wishful thinking you have not so far touched on anything remotely discreet about her he pointed out no herbert agreed she seemed to be so obvious in her support of italian freedom fighters that most people assumed she was as open about everything else she wasnt i deduced completely without proof that she knew a great deal about bulgarian and croatian plans as well and even had connections with early socialist movements in austria itself that last i am convinced of but i couldnt produce an iota of evidence to support it a clever woman narraway said ruefully bluff and double bluff exactly herbert agreed he leaned forward in his chair wrinkling his jacket narraway tell me why you want to know its all water under the bridge now you cant and shouldnt prosecute her for anything and if you ask me officially i shall deny it narraway smiled meeting the other mans eyes herberts thin cheeks colored very slightly she is ill and vulnerable narraway answered wondering even as he said it if he was wise to do so i want to make sure she is protected to do that i need to know from what directions attacks might come herberts face lost all its good humor attacks he snapped the threat may be more imagined than real that is why i need to know herbert sat still without answering for several moments staring past narraway to the rainswept garden with its sharply pruned roses and budding leaves fattening on the trees when at last he returned his gaze to the present his eyes were clouded ive realized how little i actually knew about her he said quietly she was a creature of intense passion everything done with a whole heart i assumed i knew why and what her loyalties were but since what you need now is far deeper than that i have only observations and beliefs to offer youfor what they are worth it will be more than the little i know now narraway replied immediately first is she image or substance in your belief at first i thought image herbert said with an honesty that clearly pained him then i came to believe there was substance i am still of that opinion what changed your mind a betrayal herbert said very quietly there is no point in asking me the full story of it because i dont know at the time i only knew of the execution and that it was for plotting an assassination narraway felt a sudden chill an assassination herbert looked at him sharply for gods sake man it was thirty years ago and it didnt happen anyway the whole thing was abortive the leader himself was captured beaten and shot most of the others escaped but serafina montserrat was involved narraway persisted how are you skirting around saying that she was the one who betrayed the leader herbert was horrified he glared at narraway as if he had blasphemed no she was all kinds of things willful reckless arrogant at timescertainly promiscuous if you want to call it thatbut she would have died for the cause it was only through a mixture of extreme skill and courage and the loyalty of others that she survived and a degree of luck fortune favors the bold was never truer of anyone than it was of her again narraway wondered exactly how well herbert had known her not that it mattered as long as what he was saying was the truth as far as he knew it so she could be in danger he concluded it was barely a question anymore i dont know herbert said honestly but there was more emotion in his eyes than narraway could ever recall having seen there before it was so long ago and from the standpoint of anyone in london far away who do you know who gives a damn about croatian independence now no one narraway admitted but betrayals always matter the time and place of them are irrelevant they do matter herbert agreed far too much to wait thirty years for revenge narraway could not argue with that almost certainly all the people concerned were dead or too old to execute revenge anymore just as serafina herself was thank you he acknowledged the point can you think of anyone else who might shed more light on the subject of why she is so afraid the current expert in that area of the foreign office is tregarron but you know that and of course for northern italy with which serafina was most concerned it is ennio ruggiero and for croatia pavao altabas narraway got to his feet im much obliged he held out his hand thank you again herbert smiled its good to see you narraway i always knew youd do well you taught me well narraway replied sincerely i hope to hell i taught my successor as much he hesitated why do you say that herbert asked did you worry about me narraway asked him whether i would succeed whether i had the steel and the judgment herbert smiled of course but i had more sense than to let you know it at the time thank you narraway said wryly wouldnt have done you any good herbert replied but you caused me a few sleepless nightsunnecessarily as it turned out narraway did not ask him about what narraway went to see ruggiero as herbert had suggested and spent over an hour without learning anything beyond what herbert himself had already mentioned ruggiero was an old man and his memory was clouded by emotions italy was now united and he wanted to forget the frictions and griefs of the past he especially wanted to forget the losses the sacrifices and the ugliness of fighting narraway thanked him also to have probed and argued perhaps caught the old man in lies not of intent but of wishful thinking facts covered over by dreams would have benefited no one next he went to visit pavao altabas and found only his widow he had died recently and herbert had been unaware of it the widow was much younger than pavao had been and she knew nothing of the uprisings the name of serafina montserrat meant nothing at all to her lastly he went to see lord tregarron not at the foreign office but at the club where both were members it was the end of the day and tregarron was tired and unwilling to talk however narraway gave him no civil alternative short of getting up very conspicuously and leaving they sat opposite each other in armchairs on either side of a huge log fire narraway ordered brandy for both of them the steward brought it with murmured words of apology for interrupting them although they were not as yet in conversation leave us to talk will you withers narraway asked him no interruptions if you please certainly my lord withers said calmly thank you he bowed and withdrew tregarron looked grimly at narraway waiting for him to explain his intrusion damned long day narraway he said quietly is this really necessary youre not in special branch anymore narraway was surprised how deeply the reminder cut him as if his position had defined his identity and without it he had no standing with those who had so recently treated him with something akin to awe he hid his hurt with difficulty if he had not needed tregarron he would have found a way to retaliate even though at the same moment he realized that any retaliation would betray his own vulnerability he forced himself to smile very slightly which removes the responsibility from me but does not take away the freedom to meddle if i can do it to the good he replied tregarrons dark face tightened a little am i supposed to deduce from your last remark that you are justifying some interference in foreign affairs that i otherwise might object to narraways smile grew bleaker i have no intention of interfering in foreign affairs justifiably or not but my concern is with information about the past that may prevent an action in the present of which i am uncertain and i need to know more tregarrons heavy eyebrows rose from me you must know that i cannot tell you anything do not keep obliging me to remind you that you are no longer head of special branch it is uncomfortable and illmannered of you to put me in a position where i have no choice narraway kept his temper with difficulty he needed tregarrons information and he no longer had any means of forcing it from him as tregarron knew it was this aspect of having lost power to which he was finding it hard to accustom himself i am not seeking any current information he said levelly he found himself suddenly reluctant to explain his reasons to tregarron it is the general climate of issues thirty or forty years ago thirty or forty years ago narraway what the devil are you playing at thirty or forty years ago where tregarron leaned forward a little in his chair what is this about is it something i should know if i should come to believe that it is i shall certainly tell you narraway answered so far it is only rumors most of which seem to me more like overheated imagination i wish to prove or disprove them before i bother anyone else with them tregarrons attention sharpened regarding what exactly now narraway had no choice but to either tell the truth or very deliberately lie certain whispers about a woman named serafina montserrat he answered a shadow crossed tregarrons face how on earth could she matter now narraway changed his mind about what to say next memories stories he said fairly casually if i know the truth or something close to it i can dismiss them safely tregarron tensed who is talking about mrs montserrat he asked this all sounds like gossip but it could be dangerous narraway damage can be done that is hard to reverse you did the right thing in coming to me i have looked into her past since we last spoke she worked mostly in the austrohungarian sphere she apparently knew a lot of people and was regrettably free with her favors but all years ago narraway pointed out he was surprised how much he resented tregarrons implication even though he had never met serafina himself she was vespasias friend he took a deep breath before he continued i imagine most of the men concerned are also dead and their wives who might have cared as well would you like it said of your father tregarron snapped narraway could not imagine it his father had been rather dry highly intelligent but remote not a man who would have been accessible to a woman such as he imagined serafina montserrat to have been he smiled at the thought and saw a flash of fury in tregarrons face it was gone again so rapidly that he was not certain if it had been real or his imagination the thought amuses you tregarron asked you surprise me would it have amused your mother too that was a sharp wound a territory narraway did not wish to explore of course not he said quietly his voice tighter than he had meant it to be it is so far from the truth of what i was inquiring into that it had an oblique humor no ones reputation in that area is in jeopardy so far as i am aware so what area is it to do with then tregarron asked his face now all but expressionless narraway chose his words carefully thinking of what exactly vespasia had said it is to do with political freedom old plots and current ones regarding croatia throwing off the austrian yoke and possibly northern italy perhaps you dont understand me tregarron said now allowing a faint smile onto his face serafina montserrat must be in her midseventies at least according to what i have heard she was reckless and something of a troublemaker she created an unfortunate reputation for herself although some of the stories about her are probably apocryphal if even half of them are true she was a highly colorful character and a passionate italian nationalist she would have been quite capable of planning an assassination and she had the steel in her nature to carry it out however so far as i know she never succeeded in actually doing so he crossed his legs easing back in his chair a little his eyes never leaving narraways face the only event anything like that he continued i heard as a story im not sure what truth there is in it narraway watched him intently tregarron assumed the air of a raconteur a group of dissidents plotted to assassinate one of the leading austrian dukes who was particularly vehement in his grip on the local government in northern italy it would be fair to say that he was oppressive and at times unjust the emperor franz josef has always been excessively military but he used to be less dictatorial than he is now nevertheless this dissident group planned the assassination of some dukei forget his nameand very nearly succeeded the plot was clearly thought out and very simple in essence no clever tricks to go wrong nothing left to chance but it didnt succeed narraway questioned him because they were betrayed by one of their own tregarron answered they fled it seems montserrat was among those who fought the hardest to save them but she couldnt she was wounded in the struggle that followed and the ringleader was taken summarily tried and executed it was the kind of bitter tale that narraway had heard often enough especially when he had been in ireland he thought of kate oneil and of the actions he had thought responsible for his own loss of office and then in spite of himself he thought of charlotte pitt of love loyalty and wounds that would ache eternally was this what it was about a retreat into ancient sorrows coming back to haunt one in old age was serafina going back in her mind to that time or another like it could she have been the one who betrayed the wouldbe assassin and now feared some final revenge or justice tregarron interrupted his thoughts what can this have to do with anything today narraway i cant help you if i dont know what on earth youre really looking for or why from what you say i rather think it has nothing to do with anything today narraway lied as you point out she must be in her seventies at least that is if she is still alive at all of course he rose to his feet smiling very slightly thank you for your time and your candor but that was far from what narraway thought as he rode home in a hansom through the wet streets glancing every now and then at the cobblestones gleaming in the reflected lamplight tregarron had lied to him if not in words then in intent there was something tregarron feared but narraway was not sure if it was an old danger resurfacing some past error that would jeopardize tregarrons present reputation or relationships or if it was some totally new issue of which narraway was unaware but then if it concerned the austrian empire even had he still been in special branch he might not have been informed regular diplomatic affairs had nothing to do with special branch if serafina believed she had made lasting enemies then it was certainly possible that she was right the idea of such a oncemagnificent woman lying old and broken fearing for her life deeply and painfully aware that she could no longer protect herself hurt him with a disturbing depth was he becoming soft no longer able to judge an act impartially yes he did love charlotte it was time to admit that to himself in fact after ireland it would be absurd to deny it he had always despised selfdelusion in others and he had come very close to practicing it himself that she would never care for him as more than a friend was something he had to accept if he did so with grace then he could keep her friendship at least had that devastating vulnerability changed him yes perhaps it had for one thing it had given him a tenderness toward vespasia he had not felt before a greater understanding of her as a woman not merely her formidable courage and intelligence she too could be hurt in ways she would never have allowed him to see had he not also newly experienced personal pain surprise and selfdoubt it was a frightening change but not entirely a loss he was determined to learn a great deal more than the very general picture he had of austrohungarian affairs particularly in reference to the dictatorial emperor franz josef whose only son crown prince rudolf had died so tragically at mayerling the old mans heir was now his nephew archduke franz ferdinand a man of whom franz josef did not approve for one thing ferdinand had chosen to love a woman inappropriate to become the wife of the heir to the empire the poor creature was merely some countess or the other that made ferdinand in the old mans opinion of unsound judgment and lacking in the dedication to duty necessary to succeed him but he had no choice the laws of heredity could not be argued with or the legitimacy of the entire monarchy would be destroyed should narraway tell vespasia the little he had learned perhaps so it would be a courtesy to serafina then she would know that at least one person believed her next time he saw vespasia he would do so it would be a good reason to see her again and should he speak to pitt not unless anything he learned about presentday austrian affairs indicated that there could be an assassination attempt on some visiting royalty pitt had more than enough to do without chasing the current danger of that if any existed as well as all the usual special branch fears of anarchist bombings and the constant rebellions in ireland there were russian dissidents in london fleeing from the everincreasing oppression and grinding poverty at home additionally there were britishgrown socialists who believed that the only way to improve life for the poor was to commit outrages against the establishment pitt did not need to hear rumors about a betrayal that happened thirty years ago and a thousand miles away narraway had done the job himself long enough to know the importance of leaving alone what did not matter telling vespasia would be sufficient it was the last day of february bright gusty and cold stoker came into pitts office looking grim pitt waited for him to speak more bits of information keep coming in that look like theyre about this assassination attempt he was ill at ease his shoulders stiff were fairly certain as to the identity of the man asking about train signals near dover and we have at least a possible identification of one of the men asking about how points are changed who are they pitt asked the man who asked about the signals was bilinsk we think the french are pretty sure about it theyve been following him for a while in connection with an assassination in paris he was seen at least once with lansing our lansing pitt asked sharply stokers face tightened yes sir thats the worrying part we thought lansing was in prison in france but they let him go pitt felt a sudden chill lansing was english a cold clever man with allegiance to no one andas far as they could tellto no cause why the french had released him was irrelevant now but pitt would find out later it could have been some technicality of the law a good lawyer could often find one and lansing would be both willing and able to employ such a man or worse someone else might have paid for his lawyer just to get him loose pitt looked up at stoker and lansing was the one who asked about the points and the freight trains yes sir stoker answered word is that hes an expert on transport especially trains signals altering the switches on lines diverting trains blowing the couplings that sort of thing exactly what mr blantyre said any others not yet but were still working anything else about alois habsburg nothing i cant see any reason at all anyone should want to assassinate him stoker admitted except to embarrass britain and special branch in particular pitt replied which it most certainly would stoker nodded thats what it looks like the queen thinks well enough of us after the business at osborne house but there are plenty who dont and most people dont even know about osborne house and never will i know pitt pushed his hands deeper into his pockets his shoulders tense there are quite a few who think our power is a threat to their freedom and to their privacy a few decades ago people thought the same of the police idiots stoker said under his breath they send for the police fast enough if theres a burglary a riot or even a kidnapping were like the army nothings too good for us if theres a war and then when its over they want us to become invisibleuntil the next time the contempt in his face carried an uncharacteristic bitterness pitt could not help but agree with him even if he chose not to voice it we need more information he replied who is duke alois habsburg exactly what sort of entourage is he bringing with him i dont care if thats a breach of his privacy or not stoker pulled a sour face difficult to find out anything much about him except the usual superficial things where he was born his parents where he is in reference to the successionwhich is nowhere hes not really a politician more of a philosopher and a dabbler in science very clever fellow by all accounts but a dreamer he might invent something brilliant one day or maybe write a couple of books about existence or identity or something at least thats what his own people say so far hes never done anything that makes any difference and hes related to our queen pitt pursued by marriage yes distantlyso is half of europe stokers face still reflected his exasperation alois may be a favorite of hers ill find out but he doesnt sound the sort hes nice enough but she doesnt go in for a lot of heavy thinking he stopped abruptly a faint pinkness in his cheeks aware that he had expressed his opinion rather too freely he could just be looking to impress her and perhaps he also feels like a trip to london pitt replied with a faint smile but he may just be pretending to be an academic dreamer when hes really a brave man doing an important job i suppose thats true stoker conceded with obvious reluctance i hadnt thought of that whos coming with him pitt asked how many of the entourage are actually guards of one sort or another stoker sighed from what were told theyre mainly domestic servants valets and butlersthat sort of thing probably couldnt tell a stiletto from a fire iron he blinked doesnt the palace supply servants for guests pitt found himself smiling butlers of course valets are different each gentleman wants to have his own who knows his likes and dislikes probably carries all the remedies he might need and is fully aware of his weaknesses its another life isnt it stoker observed smiling thinly as are ours to many of the people we meet pitt noted stoker shook his head but he was still smiling weve got to protect this man sir whoever he is if hes killed anywhere in our territory its going to get very ugly indeed some bastards going to come out of the woodwork and blame us he winced not to mention however many of our own people get killed or crippled at the same time i know pitt agreed thinking of blantyres warning that could even be the purpose of the whole thing poor duke alois might simply be the means stokers face paled he said something under his breath but would not repeat it aloud when pitt looked up at him pitt returned to the foreign office that afternoon knowing he had no possible alternative as before the first person he was directed to was jack radley they stood facing each other in the luxurious but impersonal waiting room with its formal portraits of past ministers on the walls i hope this is about something different jack said he shifted his weight very slightly from one foot to the other it is about new coincidences pitt replied also unable to relax neither his professional responsibility nor their personal relationship allowed him any ease he knew how deeply it would affect charlotte if this new situation divided her from emily all the past experiences they had shared the family memories and the adventures would be shadowed by the present tearing of loyalties jacks face had tightened turning the corners of his mouth down i have much more information regarding the probability of an assassination attempt against duke alois habsburg pitt began the duke may be only a minor relation of the queen but you dont have to be in the foreign office to imagine what it would do to britains reputation in europe and everywhere else if the man was shot while he was here visiting her majestydo you he was a little more sarcastic than he had intended his own fear lending an edge to his voice i imagine lord tregarron would not be indifferent to such an event or to his own position in the matter if it should occur he added jack stared at him in silence but his face was distinctly paler for several seconds he weighed the new situation youre sure you are not being unnecessarily alarmed he asked the job is about thinking ahead jack if you mean am i jumping at shadowsno i think theres enough evidence now to take the threat seriously am i certain im not being distracted by a deliberately manufactured plot in order to draw my attention away from something else something more important no of course im not bluff double bluff i dont know is tregarron prepared to take the chance that a member of the austrian royal family will get killed in a train crash along with a few score of britons if he is then we should replace him with somebody who is a little less free with human life and our reputation someone who can see the scandal the outrage the reparations likely to be demanded if such an assassination were to happen not to mention someone prepared to explain it to her majesty with full inclusion of the fact that special branch told you details of the possibility and you decided it was not worth your trouble to listen jack took a deep breath then clearly changed his mind pitt smiled bleakly ill tell lord tregarron what you have said jack answered if you would wait here i shall come back as quickly as i can it proved to be a full quarter of an hour before jack returned the minute pitt saw his face he knew tregarron would see him but under a degree of protest pitt followed jack out of the waiting room and along the corridor to the arched door at the word of answer jack opened it commander pitt my lord he announced and stepped back for pitt to go inside this time he left them alone tregarron was standing behind his desk silhouetted against the late winter sunlight in the window beyond he turned to face pitt his face was shadowed and therefore difficult to read radley tells me that you have continued to pursue this idea of a potential assassination attempt on duke alois that you seem to be sure there may be something in it he said it almost expressionlessly he advised me that we should take it seriously at least insofar as if there was even a shred of reality behind it then it could be disastrous in its effect on our reputation as well as costing a great many british lives is this your view yes sir pitt replied grateful that jack had put the core of the matter forward so succinctly it is a threat we cannot afford to ignore even if the attempt is completely abortive we would look incompetent if we did not act and worse the austrian government might assume that we were indifferent to the situation or even complicit he was pleased to see the immediate concern in tregarrons face even though it was accompanied by considerable irritation that seems to be rather more decisive than when you first mentioned it to radley a few days ago he observed critically why on earth should any dissident faction in austria wish to cause such a disaster in order to assassinate a relatively harmless and may i point out powerless young minor aristocrat of no political interest at all it makes no sense pitt have you consulted narraway on this extraordinary idea of yours pitt felt as if the blood was burning in his face he hoped tregarron would not see it he made a supreme effort to keep his voice calm and level no i have not lord narraway is no longer privy to the information gathered by special branch and it would be a breach of my oath of discretion to discuss with him such matters as he does not need to know and as far as political knowledge and judgment of affairs in the austrohungarian empire are concerned i am advised that you are the expert and therefore the appropriate person for me to consult with sir tregarrons mouth tightened the irritation in his expression was clear as he turned slightly and walked over to the fireplace he sat down in the large comfortable chair facing the door still with his back to the light and waved for pitt to sit opposite him then i suppose you had better tell me the precise evidence that led you to this extraordinary conclusion he said reaching to poke the fire duke alois is a man of negligible importance in austrian affairs let alone european he is coming here solely because he has a certain charm and her majesty apparently likes himor to be more precise likes his mother who is no longer able to travel who on earth would possibly benefit from assassinating him and i would point out that if anyone did wish to they have had ample opportunity to do so in his own home without taking a trainload of innocent people with him he stared at pitt his heavy eyebrows raised disbelief written in every line of his face pitt swallowed the thought came to his mind that tregarron would not have spoken to narraway in this tone but he dismissed it not as untrue but as hampering his own ability to deal with tregarron with confidence he must not allow comparisons to cripple him he had weaknesses narraway did not but he had strengths too he sat a little more comfortably in his chair and crossed his legs if i had the answer to that question sir i would not need to ask you for anything more than confirmation of the fact possibly merely as a courtesy duke alois appears to be a pleasant young man with nothing to commend him except his royal connections that doesnt mean he is of no importance at all sometimes such men are the perfect pawns for others a shadow crossed tregarrons face but he did not interrupt however i think it seems likely that he would be a target not for who he is but simply because he is available pitt continued if he were to be killed while here in england it would be extremely embarrassing to her majestys government and there are always those who would find that to their advantage in austria tregarron said with open disbelief there is nothing to prove that the plan is specifically austrian pitt pointed out seeing the surprise in tregarrons eyes with sharp satisfaction clearly that thought had not occurred to him it could be german french italian even russian he added our power makes it inevitable that we have many enemies tregarron leaned a little forward the whole attitude of his body altering details pitt i am perfectly aware of our position in europe and in the world most of what you say has always been true why now why this particular young man you had better tell me the precise facts and observations that have come to your notice and leave the interpretation of them to me pitt remained silent his mind was racing the mans arrogance was breathtaking he was treating pitt like some junior policeman reporting a burglary but incapable of seeing it in the context of a larger plan narraway would have had a response to wither tregarron so that he never presumed to override him again in such a way but the words the confidence even the composure to do so eluded pitt and he felt like the gamekeepers son he used to be called up before the master of the house except that sir arthur desmond had never treated him with such contempt if pitt refused to offer the details now it would imply that he did not have them it was on the tip of his tongue to offer sarcastically that all special branch junior staff would report in writing to tregarron but he dared not he could not function if he made an open enemy of this man with the difficulty of it almost choking him he replied how much detail would you like sir there are regular sources up and down the country who give us information and we have connections in france germany and austria with relation to this particular event we have our own people and we also have relations with the equivalent to special branch that most european countries have in one form or another he watched tregarrons face and saw a flash of anxiety perhaps it was a sudden realization that pitt was better informed than he had supposed most of what we hear is merely observation of people we know altering their habits or movements he continued people they talk to places they frequent such changes can be indicative of planning dont treat me like some policeman in training pitt tregarron snapped i have neither the desire to become a detective nor the time for gods sake man do your job you are supposed to be commander of the branch not some young constable on the beat pitt clenched his teeth i am giving you my opinion based on the evidence lord tregarron you asked me for the details they are a collection of small observations made of changes in habit of people asking unusual questions new alliances between people who have no known past in common people spending money for no obvious reason unusual patterns of travel information about known dissidents meeting each other and dealing with new people evidence of guns or dynamite being moved people disappearing from their usual haunts and turning up elsewhere even on occasion people dying unexpectedly in accidents or murdered do you want me to continue tregarrons face was slightly pink i wish you to tell me why you think any of this points to the attempted murder of some wretched minor prince of the austrian empire while he is traveling on one of our trains on his way to visit our queen i cant understand why it is all so plain to you you seem to expect me to put this man off without any other reason beyond the uncertainty perhaps the jitters of our very new head of special branch there was a slight curl of contempt on his lip which he did not bother to hide it looks to me as if youve lost your nerve man he went on promoted beyond your ability i told narraway that at the time youre an excellent secondincommandthe best ill give you your due but you are not born or bred to lead im sorry you pushed me into the position where i am obliged to tell you so to your face he did not sound sorry as much as simply angry you may be right sir pitt said stiffly struggling to get his breath on the other hand lord narraway may be we had both better hope that his assessment of what abilities are required to lead special branch is better than yours he rose to his feet if not then we can expect some extremely unpleasant consequences beginning with an assassination in london a serious embarrassment for her majesty and possibly an icy relationship with the austrohungarian empire with a demand for reparations good day sir tregarron shot to his feet how dare you he stopped suddenly pitt stood still his eyes wide waiting tregarron took a deep breath how dare you imply that i do not take this threat seriously he slammed his fist into the bell on his desk a minute later there was a brief tap on the door and jack came in closing it behind him and stopping just inside the room yes sir he said unhappily deliberately avoiding pitts glance come in tregarron barked jack walked a few steps closer and then stopped again yes sir tregarron stared at him pitt seems to believe that duke alois habsburg is the possible target of an assassination attempt albeit an ignorant messy and pointless one he doesnt know who the wouldbe assassin is nor the purpose of the exercise only that the outcome would be very ugly indeed it would be sir jack agreed and it would also give austria an enormous weapon to use against us for years to come for gods sake i can see that tregarron snapped the point is we cant jump at every shadow we have to exercise our critical judgment not dance around like puppets on strings to the tune of every fear real or not likely or not even possible or not what is your assessment of this one radley do you agree with pitt on the basis of this host of minor alterations in behavior of informants spies and general hangerson or do you think that they are part of the climate at large and that we should hold steady and not lose our nerve pitt was seething i certainly did not recommend losing our nerve sir he said hoarsely tregarrons glance did not waver from jack you recommended telling duke alois not to come he retorted that is losing our nerve pitt that is telling the emperor franz josef and the rest of the world that we cannot manage to protect visiting princelings from mass murder in a train wreck so they had better stay in vienna or budapest or wherever the devil it is they come fromwhere they have the ability to keep their trains safe where it is not britains responsibility if they are killed or not pitt countered jacks face went white he still avoided pitts eyes then what do we do tregarron demanded do we make him welcome or do we tell her majesty that we cannot protect her greatnephew or whatever he is and she had better tell him to stay at home we would be the laughingstock of europe my lord jack replied very quietly i think we should give commander pitt all the extra men he may need regardless of the cost and the inconvenience in order to protect duke alois tregarron looked at him with surprise and some disbelief you think this whole thing could be real no sir jack answered i think it is so unlikely as to be all but impossible but we cannot afford to ignore it commander pitt has twenty years experience with intrigue and murder and if we ignore his warnings we will be entirely to blame if something should happen our position then would be untenable but bloody unlikely yes my lord unlikely but not impossible im obliged for your advice tregarron turned to pitt looking at him sourly i suppose you have to come to me with what you judge to be some serious threats but i cant be secondguessing you at every turn youre supposed to make your own judgments as soon as you get a little more used to your position i expect you to do so good day pitt was too furious to speak he inclined his head very slightly then turned on his heel and strode out jack caught up with him in the corridor a dozen yards beyond tregarrons door im sorry he said in little more than a whisper but he does know what hes talking about and the evidence is pretty thin of course it is pitt said between his teeth people dont leave a trail that leads back to them if they did we wouldnt need police let alone special branch he did not slacken his pace and jack had to lengthen his own stride to keep up with him come on thomas he said reasonably you cant expect a man in tregarrons position to accept a story as basically unlikely as this one unless you have real evidence he knows austria and he gets regular reports from all the people we have there and a few others as well hes damned good at his job pitt stopped abruptly and swung around to face jack would you have said that in those words if it had been narraway whod come to you with suspicions or might you have given him the courtesy of assuming that he also was good at his job the color flushed up jacks face im sorry that was incredibly clumsy of me i pitt smiled bleakly no it was regrettably honest and that is not a quality you can afford to exercise if you hope to rise in the diplomatic corps one day you may also be damned good at your job but it isnt today he started to walk again thomas jack grabbed him by the arm hard forcing him to stop listen i think you are jumping at shadows and after the business in st malo and then ireland and what happened to narraway i dont entirely blame you but you cant force tregarron to go against his own knowledge of the people and the country if you really believe something is threatened then ill arrange for you to see evan blantyre at short notice ill tell him its a matter of urgency even that there could be very unpleasant consequences if we make a bad judgment he looked at pitt expectantly his eyes wide his stare direct pitt felt churlish it hurt that he had to be offered as if he had never met blantyre a meeting that would have been instantly granted to narraway was it his lack of experience and the fact that narraway was indisputably a gentleman while he was not or was it that narraway had amassed a wealth of knowledge about so many people that no one dared defy him whatever the case none of this was jacks fault and pitt knew he would be a fool to squander the few advantages he had the strength of family and the bonds of friendship which narraway had never possessed he forced the resentment out of his mind thank you he accepted thats an excellent suggestion jack went back to tregarrons office with sharply conflicting emotions he was certain he had done the right thing in promising to arrange for pitt to speak in depth with evan blantyre right away yet at the same time he believed that tregarron would not approve it he was not even sure why to some extent pitt was overreacting but that was better than reacting too little or too late belittling him and making him doubt his own judgment helped no one he reached tregarrons door again and tapped lightly on the command to enter he went back in tregarron was at his desk papers on a different subject were spread out in front of him he looked up at jack his expression still slightly angry id like you to look through these and give me your opinion radley he said pulling the papers together more neatly i think wishart is right but im predisposed to that view anyway do you know lord wishart good chap very sound no sir i dont jack replied holding out his hand and taking the papers must introduce you some time tregarrons smile lit his face giving it a unique charm youll like him thank you sir jack was flattered many people wanted very much to meet lord wishart and few did emily would be delighted he could picture her face when he told her then he had a sudden uncomfortable feeling that it was a sop for having been so abrasive toward pitt tregarron was quite aware that pitt was jacks brotherinlaw he wanted to say something further but he had no clear idea what it would be he looked down at the papers tregarron had given him they were to do with a proposed british diplomatic mission to trieste one of the italian cities still under austrian rule this matter was largely cultural with some mention of slovenia it was complicated as was every issue that dealt with the austrian empire he saw an opinion written in tregarrons flowing hand and read the first two sentences then he went back and reread it thinking he had made a mistake it was in direct contradiction to information tregarron had received only yesterday by this afternoon radley tregarron prompted jack looked up should he question what he had just read or would it be seen as exceeding his duty perhaps even criticizing tregarron himself he decided to say nothing there would be an explanation for it some additional fact of which he was not yet aware if he read the whole report it would explain the apparent anomaly yes sir he replied forcing himself to meet tregarrons eyes and smile briefly thank you tregarron nodded and bent his attention to the papers on the desk again word from blantyre came more rapidly than pitt had expected he had thought their meeting would be arranged the following day at the earliest but blantyre asked for him that same afternoon pitt grasped his coat and forgetting his hat went out to catch the next passing hansom he ran up the steps two at a time arriving a little breathlessly at blantyres office door uncharacteristically for him he straightened his tie eased his shoulders to help his jacket lie a little more gracefully and then raised his hand to knock the knock was answered almost immediately a secretary ushered him in and without any waiting at all he found himself in blantyres office they shook hands and then blantyre motioned for him to be seated sorry for the haste blantyre apologized i have another appointment i couldnt shelve and tomorrow i have one meeting after another tell me as briefly as you can and still make any sense of it what you know and what youve deduced pitt had already prepared what he meant to say during the hansom ride he began without a preamble we followed all the leads you gave us and we are almost certain of the identities of the men asking questions about the timetables signals and points there are various pieces of further information observations of new and unlikely alliances formed by people we know as troublemakers and sympathizers with anarchy or violent change such evidence as we have indicates that the intended target is duke alois habsburg as you said blantyre nodded what is the weight of the evidence now in your judgment too serious to ignore pitt said without hesitation it may be an extraordinary collection of coincidences but surely that happens once in a hundred times or less from my own experience of austrohungarian affairs which is considerable i still think its extremely unlikely but unlikely isnt good enough we must be sure its impossible i need more details and i havent time to get them now or to give this appropriate thought blantyre frowned and stood up can you come to dinner at my home this evening you and your wife would be most welcome we can allow the ladies to retire to the withdrawing room and we can talk at length and you can tell me all the details you are free to discuss bearing in mind that i also serve the government and her majesty i know how to keep a secret between us we should be able to judge the gravity of the threat so you may react appropriately pitt rose to his feet feeling as if a great weight had been taken from him he had found an ally perhaps the one man in england able to help him assess the value of his information thank you sir he said with profound feeling we would be delighted blantyre held out his hand no need to be particularly formal but well make a pleasure of it all the same eight oclock is a trifle early but we will need the time this matter may after all be very grave pitt took his leave and walked down the corridor rapidly smiling it had been more than a professional success a man of substance and high office had treated him with the same dignity as he would have treated narraway there had been no condescension in his manner for the first time in a while pitt was happy as he went down the stairs and out into the bitter wind knifing along the street while pitt was speaking with evan blantyre charlotte had decided that she should telephone emily no matter how awkward she felt though the quarrel had been primarily emilys fault one of them had to make the first move toward reconciliation before the rift became too deep since emily apparently was not going to do it then she must she was the elder anyway perhaps it was her responsibility when she picked up the receiver to put the call through she half hoped emily would be out making calls then she could satisfy herself with the virtue of having made the attempt without actually having to negotiate some kind of peace but the footman at the other end brought emily to the telephone within moments of charlotte being connected how are you emily asked guardedly very well thank you charlotte replied they could have been strangers speaking to each other the planned conversation disappeared from her head and you she asked to fill the silence excellent emily answered we are going to the theater this evening it is a new play supposed to be very interesting i hope you enjoy it have you heard from mama and joshua lately joshua fielding their mothers second husband was an actor it seemed a reasonable thing to ask at least it stopped the silence from returning not for a couple of weeks emily replied they are in stratford had you forgotten charlotte had but she did not wish to admit it there was a touch of condescension in emilys tone no she lied i imagine they have telephones even there not in theatrical boardinghouses emily replied i thought you would know that you have the advantage of me charlotte said instantly i have never had occasion to inquire about one since your mother frequents them and you seem to be concerned for her welfare perhaps you should have emily returned for heavens sake emily it was a simple questionsomething to say ive never known you to be at a loss for something to say emilys tone was still critical there is a great deal you have never known charlotte snapped i was hoping for an agreeable conversation clearly that isnt going to happen you were hoping i was going to say something to jack about helping thomas in his present predicament emily corrected her charlotte heard the defensiveness in emilys voice and hesitated for a moment then temper and loyalty to pitt got the better of her you overestimate my opinion of jacks abilities she said coldly thomas will get himself out of any difficulties there may be i am sorry i disturbed you this is obviously a conversation better held at another time perhaps some distance in the future when you are less defensive she heard emilys voice calling her name sharply but she had already moved the receiver away from her ear this was only going to hurt more the longer she continued talking she replaced the instrument in its cradle and walked away with a tightness in her throat it would be better to find something useful to do charlotte was delighted when pitt came home and told her of the invitation to dine with blantyre and his wife it was a social occasion that promised to be most enjoyable however of much more importance to her was the relief she saw in pitt over the fact that someone had finally listened to his concerns for years he had shared with her much of what he had done she had been of help to him in many cases especially those concerning people of the class into which she had been born and he had not to begin with he had considered it meddling and had been afraid for her safety gradually he had come to value her judgment especially her observation of people and her strength of character even if he still feared for her safety in some of her wilder interventions emily too had involved herself demonstrating both courage and intelligence but that was in a past that now seemed distant they were much further apart than they used to be she did not blame emily for feeling a greater loyalty to jack than to her sister she herself gave her first passionate and instinctive allegiance to her husband but the knowledge still carried a sense of loss a longing for the laughter and the trust the ability to talk openly about all kinds of things trivial or important which had always been part of her life and her relationship with emily there was no one else she would trust in the same way but she forced it from her mind and smiled at pitt that will be excellent it will be lovely and a decent excuse to wear a new gown i have bought for myself rather than one borrowed from emily or aunt vespasia i have a very fashionable one in a curious shade of blue it will be more than equal to the occasion she saw pitts amusement adriana blantyre is very beautiful thomas i shall have to do my best to not be constantly overshadowed is she brave and clever as well he asked with sudden gentleness or funny and kind he did not add the rest of what he implied she knew it and felt the blush of selfconsciousness creep up her cheeks but she did not lower her eyes from his i dont know i liked her i look forward to knowing her a little better then suddenly she was serious again thomas does blantyre matter to you is he going to help you i hope so he replied jack arranged it a hurt inside her slipped away good good im glad she wished he were free to tell her what troubled him apart from the burden of taking on narraways job she wanted to assure him that he was equal to it but such assurances would be meaningless because she had very little idea what it was that bothered him in the first place she did not know whether his skills matched narraways or even if they ever could they were very different from each other until their experience in ireland she had thought of narraway as intellectual and happy to be alone whether that was natural to him or he had learned it it had become his habit only when he lost his position in special branch had she seen any vulnerability in him any need at all for the emotional warmth of others how blind she had been it was something she thought of now with a dull ache of guilt she preferred to put it from her mind that would be easier for narraway too he would not wish to think she remembered every emotion in his face perhaps regretted now some things should remain guessed at but unspoken regardless of such moments there was a professional ruthlessness in narraway that she believed would never be natural to pitt indeed she hoped it would not that was part of the difficulty two of the things she loved most in pitt were his empathy and his love of justice which would make leadership and its terrible decisions more difficult for him she had not yet found any way in which she could help him blind support was all she could offer and it had a very limited value it was in some ways like the love of a child in the dangerous and painful decisions he was essentially alone she looked at him now standing in the middle of the kitchen as daniel came in with his homework and she saw the deliberate change of expression as he turned to his son she knew the effort it cost him to put aside his worry saw his hands clenched in frustration even as he smiled at daniel and they spoke of history homework and how best to answer a complicated question but how is that the holy roman empire daniel asked reasonably pointing to the map in his schoolbook rome is way down there he put his finger on the middle of italy it isnt even in the same country thats austria it says so and why is it holier than anywhere else pitt took a deep breath it isnt he said patiently have you got a map of where the old roman empire used to be ill show you where it became the eastern and the western empires i know that papa and it wasnt up there he put his finger on austria again why is all that bit part of the holy empire charlotte smiled and left pitt to do his best with conquest and imperial politics no one else had ever been able to give a morally satisfying answer and she knew daniel well enough to expect a long argument charlotte dressed for the dinner as she had done in her early twenties before her marriage when her mother had been trying desperately and unsuccessfully to find her a suitable husband she had chosen a color and style that flattered the warmth of her skin and the hints of auburn in her hair the cut of her dress showed the soft curves of her figure to their best advantage it was fashionable enough to feel up to date but not so much that in a few months it would be outmoded she had minnie maude help her coil and pin her hair so it had no chance of slipping undone to have ones hair falling out of its coiffure would be deemed just as disastrous as having ones clothing fall off and rather more difficult to put right again in the lamplight she was not sure if she observed one or two gray hairs or if it was only a nervous imagination her mother many years her senior had only a few and of course there was a remedy for it apparently iron nails steeped in strong tea for fifteen days make an excellent dye for darker hair rinsing the hair in tea was she considered good for it every so often anyway she wore very little jewelry this was not only as a matter of style but also because she owned very little a fact she did not wish to make obvious earrings were sufficient there was natural color in her face but she added a little rouge very very discreetly and put a tiny dab of powder on her nose to take away the shine once she was satisfied that it was the best she could do she would forget it entirely and focus on whoever she was speaking to listen with attention and answer with warmth and if possible a little wit they had hired a carriage for the evening to keep one all the time was an expense they could not afford nor was it needed if that day were to come in the future perhaps it would be after they had moved to a house with stables it would be exciting to make such an upward climb in society but it would also force her to leave behind a place in which they had known much joy charlotte was perfectly happy not to have such a burden at the moment she sat back in her seat smiling in the dark as they were driven through russell square its bare trees thrashing in the heavy wind they turned left up woburn place past tavistock square open and windy again then along the shelter of upper woburn place and into the flickering lamplight of endsleigh gardens the carriage stopped and they alighted at the blantyres house where they were welcomed in by a liveried footman he showed them immediately to a large withdrawing room where a blazing fire shed red and yellow light on leatherupholstered chairs and sofas and a carpet rich in shades of amber gold and peach the gaslamps were turned low so it was difficult to see the details of the many paintings that decorated the walls in a quick glance all charlotte noticed was their ornamental gold frames and the fact that they seemed to be mostly land and seascapes adriana blantyre came forward to welcome them a step ahead of her husband she was dressed in burgundy velvet its glowing color emphasized the fairness of her face and the amazing depth of her eyes she looked both fragile and intensely alive blantyre himself greeted charlotte with a smile but his glance returned to his wife before he offered his hand im so pleased you could come how are you mrs pitt very well thank you mr blantyre she replied good evening mrs blantyre it is such a pleasure to see you again that was not merely good manners on the brief occasions she had met adriana she had found her to be quite different from most of the society women she knew she possessed a sparkling energy and a dry sense of humor that lay more in what she did not say than in any quick ripostes they sat and talked casually light comments on the weather the latest gossip rumors that were of no serious consequence charlotte had time to look at the paintings on the walls and the very beautiful ornaments that graced the mantel and two or three small tables one was a porcelain figurine of a woman dancing it had such grace that it seemed as if at any moment it would actually move one of the largest ornaments was a huge statue of a wild boar it stood with its head lowered menacing yet there was a beauty in it that commanded admiration hes rather fine isnt he blantyre remarked seeing her gaze we dont have boar here anymore but they still do in austria when did we have them here charlotte asked not really because she wanted to know but because she was interested in drawing him into conversation his eyes opened wide an excellent question i must find out have we progressed because we no longer have them or regressed we could ask that question of a lot of things he smiled as if the possibilities amused him have you hunted boar charlotte asked oh long in the past i lived for several years in vienna the forests around there abound with them charlotte gave an involuntary little shiver i imagine you would greatly prefer the music and the dancing he said with certainty it is a marvelous city one where almost anything you care to dream of seems possible he looked for a moment at adriana and there was an intense tenderness in his face we first met in vienna adriana rolled her dark eyes and a flash of amusement lit her expression we first danced in vienna she corrected him we met in trieste i remember the moonlight on the danube he protested my dear she said it was the adriatic we didnt speak but we saw each other i knew you were watching me did you i thought i was being so discreet she laughed then turned away for an instant charlotte thought it was out of modesty because the look on blantyres face was openly emotional then she caught something in the angle of adrianas head the light catching a tear in her eye and felt that there was something she had missed entirely far deeper than the words conveyed a few minutes later they were called to the dining room and its lush oldfashioned beauty took all charlottes attention it was not the least bit english there was a simplicity to the proportions which lent an extraordinary grace and a lush warmth to the coloring do you like it adriana asked standing close behind her then she apologized im sorry if i ask how could you possibly say you did not she gave a rueful smile i love england but this room carried the memory of my home i want people here to like what i used to know and love as well without waiting for an answer she moved away to take her place at the foot of the table while blantyre sat down at the head the meal was served by footmen and a parlormaid silently and with a discretion born of long practice first there was a clear soup followed by a light fish and then the main course of lamb in red wine sauce the conversation moved easily from one subject to another blantyre was a highly entertaining host full of anecdotes about his travels especially his time in the capitals of europe watching his face charlotte saw an undisguised enthusiasm for the individuality and culture of each place but a love for austria that superseded all the others he spoke of the gaiety and sophistication of paris of the theater and art and philosophy but his voice took on a new intensity when he described the viennese operetta the vitality of it the music lyrical enough to make everyone wish to dance they have to nail the chairs and tables to the floor he said almost seriously he was smiling his eyes staring into the distance viennas always in my dreams one minute you cry there the next you laugh there is a unique richness in the blend of so many cultures adriana moved very slightly and the change in the light on her face made charlotte look toward her for a moment she saw pain in adrianas eyes and in the shadows around her mouth which was still too young for lines or hollows then it was gone but for a second adriana had seemed utterly lost her hand was on her fork and then she set it down with a clink as if she could not eat any more blantyre had seen itcharlotte was quite certain of thatyet he went on with his tale of music and color as if to avoid drawing attention to it the next course was served blantyre changed the subject and became more serious now his attention was directed toward pitt it has changed lately of course he said with a little grimace since the death of crown prince rudolf adrianas eyes widened in surprise probably that he should mention such a subject at the dinner table and with people they hardly knew instantly charlotte wondered if pitts real reason for being here could possibly be connected to the tragedy at mayerling but what concern could that be to british special branch she looked at pitt and saw a slight frown on his face the emperor is a martinet blantyre went on sleeps in an old army bed and rises at halfpast four in the morning to begin his work on the papers of state he dresses in the uniform of a junior officer and i wouldnt be surprised if he eats only bread and drinks only water charlotte looked at him closely to see if he was joking his stories had been full of wit and lighthearted mockery but always gentle now she saw no lightness in his face at all his nostrils were slightly flared and his mouth was pulled a little tight evan adriana began anxiously mr pitt is head of special branch my dear blantyre said very slightly criticizing her he has few illusions we should not add to them adriana went very pale but did not argue charlotte wondered where the conversation was heading how much of it was information that pitt was seeking and why had they come to learn it this way she turned to blantyre he sounds rather grim she observed was he always like that or is it the effect of grief over the death of his son blantyre replied im afraid he was pretty much always a bore poor sisi escapes whenever she can shes a trifle eccentric but who could blame the poor woman charlotte looked from blantyre to pitt she saw the mystified expression on his face before he could hide it the empress elisabeth blantyre explained eyebrows arched a little god knows why they call her sisi but they all do a bohemian at heart always taking off for somewhere or the other mostly paris sometimes rome charlotte plunged in hoping she was judging correctly that in some fashion this had to do with pitts current case which came first she asked innocently blantyre turned to her with a bright stare was that a ghost of amusement in his eyes first he inquired she looked straight at him her desire to escape his being a bore or his retreating into solitude because she was always off on some adventure he nodded almost imperceptibly neither so far as i know but crown prince rudolf was caught up in a considerable conflict between his fathers rigid military dictatorship and his mothers erratic flights of fancy both metaphorical and literal he was really rather clever you know when given half a chance to escape the straitjacket of duty he turned to pitt he wrote excellent articles for radical newspapers under a pseudonym of course pitt straightened his fork halfway to his mouth blantyre smiled you didnt know it doesnt surprise me not many people do he was of the opinion that an austrian invasion of croatia would be a cause for war with russia which austria would start against a completely antiaustrian balkan peninsula from the black sea to the adriatic he said not only the present would be at stake but also the whole future for which austria was responsible to the coming generation pitt stared at him there was complete silence at the table almost a direct quote blantyre said as closely as i can match the english to the german evan the poor man is dead adriana said softly we will never know what good he might have done had he lived there was intense sadness in her voice and her eyes were downcast charlottes mind raced she could think of no way in which a suicide pact between a man and his mistress however tragic could concern british special branch and yet it appeared that blantyre had introduced the subject very deliberately even though it was hardly polite dinner conversation among people who barely knew one another now blantyre was looking at adriana my dear you mustnt grieve for him so much he reached out a hand toward hers but the table was too long for them to touch still his fingers remained in the open gesture resting lightly on the white cloth it was his own choice and i think perhaps all that was left to him he was tired and ill and desperately unhappy ill she said quickly meeting his gaze for the first time since rudolfs death had been mentioned how can you know because now princess stephanie is also infected he replied the expression in adrianas face was unreadable surprise pity butmore complex than thatit seemed to charlotte to include a kind of hope as if a longstanding problem had at last been resolved so it would have been the archduke franz ferdinand anyway adriana said after a couple of seconds yes blantyre agreed did you think poor rudolfs death could have had something to do with the succession it wasnt political at least in that sense if rudolf had become emperor he had planned to make the empire a republic and be president of it with far greater freedom for the individual nations within would that have worked adriana asked dubiously he smiled probably not he was an idealist very much a dreamer but maybe pitt looked from one to the other of them is there any doubt that it was suicide blantyre shook his head none at all i know there are all kinds of rumors flying around but the truth is far beyond that which is known to the public but i believe that some griefs should remain the property of those who are the victims that is about the only decency we can offer them i am quite certain that his death and that of marie vetsera were by their own hands and there were no others involved who has blame for the patterns of their lives is not an issue for us pitt seemed about to say something then changed his mind and instead made some remark about one of the many beautiful paintings on the wall adrianas face lit with pleasure immediately the croatian coast she said eagerly thats where i was born she went on to describe it her words full of nostalgia charlotte noted blantyres face there was a lingering sadness in his eyes as he listened to his wife remembering her childhood the changing seasons the sounds and the touch of the past adriana said nothing more of vienna as if it were part of another world after dinner charlotte and adriana returned to the withdrawing room for tea and delicate prettily decorated sweets your country sounds very beautiful charlotte said with interest its unique she said smiling at least it was i havent been back for several years now surely you can go back at least to visit charlotte asked suddenly adriana was very still the delicate color of her skin became even lighter almost as if it were translucent i dont think i would like to evan is very protective of my feelings he keeps telling me that it would bring back old pain that is best left to heal and perhaps he is right charlotte waited believing an explanation would come even if it did not it would be clumsy to ask im sorry i am making no sense my father died a long time ago and my mother some time before that his death is something i still find hard to think about others loved him and grieved also but not as i did for some minutes she had difficulty keeping her emotions under control she looked at charlotte with startling trust as if there was clearly a friendship between them but she did not say anything more charlotte thought of her own elder sisters death the grief the fear the disillusionment that had followed it it was during that series of murders that she had first met pitt she had grown up during that time had learned to look more honestly at the people she loved she had tried to accept failure her own and theirs and learn not to blame them because they fell short of her idealistic and rather immature perceptions of them she had no idea how adrianas father had died but clearly it had been part of some complicated situation that had caused her much pain if even now she would not speak of it charlotte looked around the withdrawing room and chose a lovely very ornate piece of carving in wood to admire and ask about the tension was broken and adriana responded with a flush of gratitude giving an account of its history in the dining room the butler brought in port and cigars at blantyres request he left them alone then the serious conversation began blantyre offered no preamble i have looked more closely at the situation pitt i have been obliged to change my mind i admit i thought you were being a little hasty and had jumped to conclusions i was mistaken i now believe that you are right to consider the danger serious possibly even as catastrophic as it looks pitt was stunned blantyre leaned forward of course the indications are slight an inquiry about timetables which seems natural enough a desire to know how the signals work in more detail than the average person knows or wishes to a technical description of how the points work they do not indicate to the foreign office that there is anything amiss he gave a rueful selfdeprecating smile to me knowing the names of the men concerned it indicates that they plan something large and complicated enough to require the use of men who have killed before and are willing to cause any number of civilian casualties in order to succeed why duke alois pitt asked him does he actually have far more political significance than we realize blantyres face was very grave i am unaware that he has any significance at all but there may be a number of things that have changed since my last accurate bulletin but even if he does not this is a far bigger issue than the death of any one man whoever he is he spread his hands on the white cloth they were lean and strong the austrohungarian empire is pivotal to the future of europe i dont believe the government of britain fully realizes that perhaps no other government does either look at the map pitt the empire is enormous it lies in the heart of europe between the rising industrial strengths of the protestant countries in the west especially germany newly united and growing in power every year and the old fractured east which includes all the quarrelsome balkan states and greece macedonia and of course turkeythe sick man of europe pitt did not interrupt the brandy sat forgotten the cigars unlit and to the south is italy blantyre went on like germany it is newly united but still with that open wound in the north an austrianoccupied territory containing some of its most valuable cities and then there are serbia croatia montenegro and the other adriatic countries where the real powder keg lies small as they are if they explode they could eventually take the whole of europe with them his hands tightened a little and to the north lies the vast restless bear of russia slavic in its loyalties orthodox in its faith its ruled by a tsar in moscow who hasnt the faintest idea what really lies in his own peoples hearts never mind anywhere else pitt felt cold he began to understand where blantyre was going with this train of thought and austria lies in the heart of it blantyre moved his hand very slightly as if it lay on a map not the white linen tablecloth the empire has twelve different languages and a multitude of faithscatholic orthodox muslim and jewish although admittedly the antisemitism is ugly and rising still the general tolerance is there the culture is old and deeply sophisticated and the government is long practiced at holding the reins of power strongly enough to govern but lightly enough to give individual countries their breathing space he looked at pitt judging his reaction teutonic germany is impatient chomping at the bit of its own power bismarck said chaining the trim seaworthy frigate of prussia to the ancient wormeaten galleon of austria we have not taken enough notice of that the germans are dangerous and growing increasingly restless their young lions are waiting to take down the old but even that is only peripheral to the real danger austria is the heart where all the different interests meet safely remove it and there is no neutral core teutons and slavs are facetoface protestant catholic muslim and jew have no forum in which to speak familiarly there is no longer a single culture where all take part pitt could see the indisputable logic in what blantyre was saying but why kill a minor member of the austrian royal family and here in england what purpose does that serve he asked blantyre smiled his face tight eyes bleak it doesnt matter who it is the victim is incidental assassinate him at home and the authorities might be able to cover it up make it seem like some horrible accident do it in england where they have no control in the territory of one of the best secret services in europe and it cannot be hidden and no doubt when you catch whoever is responsible they will unmistakably prove to be croatian austria will have no choice whatsoever except to try him and execute him then to find all his allies and do the samedo you see pitt began to see and the vision was appalling blantyre nodded slowly it is in your face of course you see austria would then be at war with croatia croatia is slavic it will appeal to its mighty russian cousins who will weigh in on its side even if not invited to then germany will come in on the side of germanspeaking germancultural austria and before you can stop the landslide you will have war the likes of which we have never seen before no sane man would pitt began and trailed off no sane man blantyre repeated softly how many sane nationalist revolutionaries do you know how many dynamiters and assassins who see only a few days ahead of them instead of looking to the future to six months a year or a decade none pitt said almost under his breath god what a mess we must prevent it blantyre answered special branch may never have had a more important job to do any help i can give any service i can provide i offer it to you day or night pitt stared down at the table shoulders hunched all the muscles of his face and neck aching thank you the early afternoon was sunny but very cold when vespasia set out to visit serafina again she was not looking forward to it this time to see serafina in such confusion was distressing and the very obvious fear she felt was even more difficult as it made vespasia feel helpless and a poor friend unable to alleviate it the carriage passed through the longfamiliar streets vespasia noticed a woman almost knocked off balance when a gust of wind caught her skirts a hundred yards farther a man in gray held his hands up to keep his hat from being blown off the clip of horses hooves rang loudly on the ironhard stones then suddenly vespasia realized that the sound had vanished they were slowing down but still moving with a chill of horror she recognized the familiar hush of sawdust in the road and knew its meaning they were passing the home of someone very recently dead except that they were not passing they had stopped and the coachman was at the carriage door my lady he sounded uncomfortable yes vespasia knew the words he was reluctant to say i see what has happened i will still go in please wait for me here i do not imagine i shall be long yes my lady he held out his hand and helped her alight she walked over the sawdust to the footpath the curtains were drawn the dark blue dress she was wearing was no longer appropriate it should have been black but she had not known she knocked on the door and was about to knock again when it was answered by nerissa her face normally stressed and a little colorless looked completely bleached from shock her eyes redrimmed the lids puffy she drew in a breath to speak and let it out again in a gasp she looked on the verge of collapse vespasia mastered her own feelings and took nerissa by the arm gently propelling her inside she closed the door before turning to speak to her i can see what has happened she said quietly im very sorry it is always a shock no matter how well one imagines one is prepared i admit i had not thought it would be so soon or i would not have come so illprepared and perhaps intrusively early no nerissa gulped no you are not intrusive in the slightest you were so kind to come she gulped again vespasia felt a rush of pity for her she was an unattractive young woman not so much plain of feature as lacking in charm now she had lost perhaps the only relative she had and even if she had inherited the house it would do little to give her entree to desirable social circles certainly it would bring her no friends of true value in her sudden new loneliness she would be even more vulnerable than before vespasia hoped the lover she believed nerissa had was indeed real and in no way in pursuit of her inheritance from serafina perhaps a cup of tea vespasia suggested i am sure you would benefit from a chance to sit down for a few moments it must be a heavy burden for you is there anyone who will assist you in whatever needs to be done if not im sure i can recommend a suitable person and instruct them as to your wishes and of course serafinas thank you thank you nerissa seemed to compose herself a little more i have barely had time to think of it but certainly tea tea would be excellent im so sorry i did not offer it my good manners seem to have evaporated not at all vespasia assured her i daresay the kitchen is in a bit of a state servants need a firm hand at such times and something to do or they tend to go to pieces it is all very distressing they will be worrying about their own positions no doubt the sooner you can reassure them the better able they will be to assist you yes i hadnt even thought nerissa very deliberately steadied herself and turned to lead the way into the morning room it was bitterly cold as the fire was not lit she stopped in dismay perhaps the housekeepers sitting room vespasia suggested that is very often comfortable even when all else is in disarray nerissa seemed grateful for the suggestion ten minutes later they were in the small but very cozy room in the servants quarters from which mrs whiteside governed the domestic arrangements she was a short stout woman with a surprisingly handsome face at the moment she was clearly very distressed but grateful to have something useful to do nerissa disappeared to address the servants and mrs whiteside brought vespasia a pot of tea while she waited there was a brief knock on the door vespasia answered expecting mrs whiteside back again but it was tucker who came in closing the door behind her she looked suddenly older as if ten years had stricken her in one night but she stood straight head high she was wearing a black dress without a white apron and was completely without adornment of any kind her white hair was neatly dressed as always but her skin was so colorless it looked like wrinkled paper vespasia rose to her feet and went toward her she took tuckers hands in hers something she would normally never have imagined doing to a servant of any sort my dear tucker i am so sorry for all the warning one has of such an event one can never anticipate the sense of loss tucker stood rigid overcome by her emotions she had lost a lifetimes companionship she wanted to speak but she was painfully aware that she could not do so without losing her composure she might have come intending to say something but now was not the time would you care for tea vespasia asked gesturing toward the tray that had been prepared for her there was still plenty left in the pot all it required was another cup tucker swallowed no thank you my lady i just came she was unable to complete the sentence then please return to your duties vespasia said gently no doubt we shall have other opportunities to speak tucker nodded gulped and retreated to the door it was another five minutes before nerissa came back thank you she said with intense feeling it was kind of you to come she sat with her hands knotted in her lap her knuckles white it it seems much easier when there is something to do indeed vespasia agreed i gather from what mrs whiteside said that serafina died some time during the night and it was you who found her this morning it must have been extremely distressing for you yes yes we were not expecting it for weeks even months nerissa agreed we you mean you and her doctor yes he i we sent for him of course mrs whiteside and i he came almost straightaway of course there was nothing he could do it seemed she died quite early in the night she was gasping for breath her speech disjointed vespasia looked at the young woman sitting opposite her tense desperately unhappy perhaps even feeling guilty because she had not been there when her aunt had died that was natural but not reasonable there was nothing at all she could have done except make it so that serafina had not died alone but it was also true that serafina may have gone in her sleep and would not have known the difference nerissa was waiting for vespasia to speak perhaps to offer some words of comfort the silence between them had grown heavy vespasia gave a bleak smile the fact of death is always painful you are not alone nor should you feel so i am sure the doctor assured you that there was nothing you could have done to alter things or even to help yes yes he did say that nerissa agreed but one feels so helpless and as if one should have known it would not have comforted serafina to have you sitting up with her day and night on the assumption that at any moment she might die vespasia said drily nerissa managed a small smile would you care to go up to her room and say a last goodbye vespasia did not believe it was goodbye only a last au revoir but she was certainly curious to see if there had been any struggle any fighting for the last breath the final sleep it would be more of a relief than she had imagined if there had not thank you she rose to her feet and nerissa stood too vespasia followed her out of the housekeepers room back into the main hall then up the stairs to the room where only a few days earlier she had visited serafina vespasia went in and stood alone she looked at the body of the woman with whom she had never truly been friends yet with whom she had had so much in common the passion of their beliefs had separated them from others they knew day by day even from their own familiesperhaps especially from them now all the fear was ironed out of serafinas features the worst she could imagine had either happened or the danger of it had passed and she had moved beyond all earthly success or failure vespasia looked at her and saw nothing but the shell the spirit was gone what had she imagined she could learn whatever serafina had been afraid of must be discovered in some other way she turned and went back outside to thank nerissa and to offer her condolences once again then with increasing urgency she gathered her cape and went outside she was determined to visit thomas pitt she was kept waiting at his office at lisson grove no more than twenty minutes the young man named stoker knew who she was and insisted that pitt would wish to see her right away aunt vespasia pitt said with some alarm when stoker led her into the office he rose from his chair and came over to her as she closed the door behind her she did little more than glance at the pictures on the wall and the books but she noticed the difference from when victor narraway had occupied the room good afternoon thomas thank you for seeing me immediately i have just called at the home of serafina montserrat and found that she died unexpectedly some time last night im sorry he said gently i know that you knew her thank you she was a remarkable woman but it is not the loss of a friend that concerns me we were not especially close last time i visited her a few days ago she was profoundly afraidindeed i would say terrifiedthat her mind was affected to the point where she was lost in memory and might have forgotten where and when she was and to whom she was speaking that in itself is not a unique circumstance in old age she gave a small sad smile but in her case it was dangerous or so she believed she knew many secrets from her time as something of a revolutionary in the austrian empire many years ago she was afraid there were people to whom she was still a danger she saw the sudden sharp attention in his face i thought that at best she was romanticizing she continued but i took the precaution of asking victor narraway if perhaps it might be the truth he inquired into it at first it seemed that she was deluding herself but he did not give up easily and it transpired that she might have been understating her importance if anything how far in the past he interrupted a generation ago at least but she felt that some of her knowledge concerned people still alive or those whom they might have loved and wished to protect i can give you no names because i dont know any but she was very very frightened thomas he looked puzzled of betraying someone accidentally even now who did she tell you no to me she was very discreet i suppose part of what made me think she was romanticizing was the fact that she gave no names but victor said that she was even more involved in events at the time than she claimed and thomas i am not absolutely certain that she was mistaken in her fear one moment she was as lucid as you or i when we were alone then when someone else came in she seemed to lurch into near insanity as if she had no idea where she was she took a deep rather shaky breath and let it out with a sigh im afraid that someone may have frightened her to the point where she took her own life rather than continue with the risk of betraying a friend an ally in the cause pity overwhelmed her and a sense of guilt because she had done nothing to prevent this she had known about it and serafina had begged for her help now she was safe in pitts office talking about it too late and serafina was dead i feel like i shouldve done something more to help her what could you have done pitts voice gentle and urgent intruded on her thoughts she looked at him i dont know which is not a good enough excuse is it unless you were willing and able to move in and sleep in the room beside her or perhaps be certain that she saw no visitors without your being present there is nothing you couldve done i tried to have nerissa freemarsh do that i even asked her to engage a nurse vespasia said bleakly i did not try hard enough thomas waited a beat what else is bothering you he prompted she stared at him for long level seconds as i said there is the possibility that she was not afraid unnecessarily and if there was someone she could still have betrayed knowingly or not she saw the tension increase in pitt from the rigidity of his body he knew what she was going to say they could have killed her she finished in a whisper pitt nodded slowly her address fifteen dorchester terrace she replied just off blandford square it is only a few streets away you may need to hurry in case things are moved or hidden pitt rose to his feet i know pitt took stoker with him explaining as they went it was as vespasia had said no more than a quarter of a mile away and they walked at a rapid pace he barely had sufficient time to acquaint stoker with a little of serafinas history and the reasons her fears were realistic enough that special branch must make certain they had not come to pass stoker did not question his reasoning the mention of austria was sufficient the door was opened by a parlormaid who was grimfaced and clearly in mourning she was drawing in breath to deny them entrance when nerissa came across the hall behind her good afternoon miss freemarsh pitt said to nerissa i am thomas pitt commander of special branch this is sergeant stoker we are here regarding the very recent death of mrs montserrat may we come in please he said it in a manner that did not allow her to refuse and he took the first step across the threshold before she replied beneath the red blotches from weeping her face was ashen white why what what has happened she was shaking so badly that pitt was worried she might faint please let us come in miss freemarsh where you can sit down perhaps your maid might bring us tea or some other restorative it is possible that this is unnecessary but your aunt was a woman of great importance to her country and there are aspects of her death that we need to assure ourselves are in order what do you mean nerissa gulped she was old and ill her mind was wandering and she imagined things she put her hands to her mouth this is lady vespasias doing isnt it she said accusingly shes meddling miss freemarsh is there something about your aunts death that you wish to conceal from us no of course not i want only decency and respect for her notnot policemen tramping through the house and and making a spectacle out of our family tragedy it is not a tragedy that the old should die miss freemarsh he said more gently unless there is something about their death that is not as it should be and i am not a policeman i am the head of special branch unless you tell them so no one needs to think me anything other than a government official come to pay my respects to a muchadmired and valued woman stoker stepped in behind pitt and closed the front door nerissa backed a little farther into the center of the beautiful hallway with its sweeping staircase and newel lamp there is nothing for you to do she protested aunt serafina died in her sleep some time last night the doctor says it was probably early because because when i touched her this morning she was cold she shivered why are you doing this its brutal stoker fidgeted behind pitt shifting his weight from one foot to the other pitt did not know if his impatience was with pitt or nerissa freemarsh and he could not afford to care if i was in your place miss freemarsh i believe i would prefer to have my mind set at ease he said quietly but whether that is what you wish or not i am afraid i must be certain i would like to see mrs montserrat and then have the name and address of her doctor so i can see him and perhaps the name of her lawyer as well special branch will take care of the funeral arrangements according to whatever her wishes were nerissa was aghast can you do that i can do whatever is necessary to safeguard the peace and welfare of the nation pitt replied but it can all be dignified and discreet if you do not oppose it nerissa waved her hand reluctantly toward the stairs the doctor is upstairs with her now pitt swiveled around and went up the stairs two at a time he threw open the door of the first bedroom facing the front of the house and saw a young fairhaired man in black bending forward over the bed there was a gladstone bag on the floor beside him he straightened up and turned as pitt came through the door who the devil are you sir barging into a ladys bedroom like this he demanded his face was fair but his features were stronger than might have been suggested by the slenderness of his build pitt closed the door behind him thomas pitt head of special branch you i presume are mrs montserrats physician i am geoffrey thurgood the reason for my presence here is obvious what is the reason for yours i think our reasons are the same pitt replied coming further into the room the ashes were cold in the grate but the colors in the room still gave it a suggestion of warmth to be certain as to the cause of mrs montserrats death although i may need to know more about the exact circumstances surrounding it than you do she was of advanced years and her health was rapidly deteriorating thurgood said with barely concealed impatience her mind was wandering more with each day even with the most optimistic assessment her death could not have been very far away days pitt asked thurgood hesitated no i would have expected her to have lived another several months actually a year possibly what was the cause of her death exactly heart failure of course her heart failed pitt retorted impatiently everybodys heart fails when they die what caused it to fail probably her age she was an invalid thurgood too was losing what was left of his patience the woman was almost eighty being eighty is not a cause of death i have a grandmotherinlaw who is well over eighty regrettably she is as strong as a horse thurgood smiled in spite of himself then your motherinlaw may well have another thirty years there is nothing wrong with my motherinlaw except her own motherinlaw pitt pulled his face into an expression of pity and resignation thinking of charlottes grandmama mrs montserrat was not a fantasist dr thurgood she had done some remarkable things in her earlier years and knew a great many secrets that might still be dangerous it was not ghosts she was afraid of but very real people thurgood looked startled stared at pitt for a moment then went pale youre serious yes may i see proof that you are who you claim to be of course pitt fished in his untidy pockets and pulled out the proof of his identity and office along with a ball of string a knob of sealing wax and a handkerchief he gave the identification to thurgood thurgood read it carefully and handed it back i see what do you want of me complete professional discretion then the exact cause time and any other details you can give me about mrs montserrats death and whether it is what you expected or whether there are any aspects of it that surprise you or that are hard to explain i cant tell you that without a postmortem of course not pitt agreed i doubt the family will agree the family consists only of miss freemarsh pitt pointed out but im afraid it is not within her rights to prevent it if there is the possibility of a crime youll have to have the necessary legal thurgood began no i wont pitt interrupted him im special branch not police i will have no trouble ensuring that the law does not stand in our way this may turn out to be unnecessary but it is too important to ignore it thurgoods lips tightened i shall begin the arrangements immediately i leave it to you to inform the family solicitor who is bound to object miss freemarsh is sure to see that he does pitt nodded he was beginning to like thurgood thank you as thurgood had foretold the lawyer mr morton was less than obliging when pitt went to see him at his office he sputtered and protested and talked about desecration of the body but in the end he was forced to yield albeit somewhat ungraciously this is monstrous you overstep yourself sir i have always been of the opinion that the police force is a highly dubious blessing and the body that calls itself special branch even more so his chin quivered and his blue eyes sparked with outrage i demand the name of your superior lord salisbury pitt said with a smile you will find him at number ten downing street but before you leave to appeal to him i would like a very approximate figure as to mrs montserrats estate and information as to whom it is bequeathed to certainly not you trespass too far the old man folded his arms across his ample chest and glared at pitt defiantly if i have to find out by asking questions outside the family it will be a great deal less discreet pitt pointed out i am trying to deal with this as delicately as possible and to protect mrs montserrats heirs from unpleasantness and possibly danger danger what danger mrs montserrat died in her sleep i hope so what do you mean you hope so she was a woman of great distinction she deserves the best attention we can give her if there is something untoward in her death or in the property and papers she leaves i wish to keep it private indeed i intend to allow me to do it gently the lawyer grunted i suppose you have the power to force me if i refuse and from the look on your face and your taste for authority you will do so pitt forbore from speaking she left a nice bequest for her maid tucker the lawyer said reluctantly for whom she had considerable affection it will take care of her for the rest of her life apart from that the house in dorchester terrace and the balance of her estate go to her niece nerissa freemarsh it is several thousand pounds if she is careful it will provide an income sufficient for her to live quite comfortably thank you are there any papers other than the ordinary household and financial ones you would expect any diaries the lawyer looked at pitt with gleaming satisfaction no there are not pitt had expected that answer but it would have been remiss not to ask thank you mr morton i am obliged to you good day morton did not reply the following day thurgood sent a message to pitt telling him that he had completed his examination and was prepared to offer his report he was ready to give at least the exact cause of death but the circumstances he would leave to pitt to discern pitt had been to morgues before it had been a grim part of his duty for most of his adult life although rather less often since joining special branch the moment he stepped from the bright windy street into the building with its uncanny silence he could smell the odors of death and chemical preservation and feel a dampness in the air it was as if the constant washing away of blood prevented the building from ever being fully dry or warm to him the smells of carbolic vinegar and formaldehyde were worse than any other scent well he asked when he was alone with thurgood in the doctors office and the door was closed simply it was laudanum thurgood replied unhappily she took it regularly she found that sleep eluded her and often she would be awake all night hearing every creak in the timbers of the house imagining footsteps are you saying she finally took too much pitt asked with disbelief could that be accidental wasnt she given it by someone who knew what they were doing miss freemarsh or the ladys maid tucker had been with mrs montserrat most of her life she would never have made such a mistake it occurred to him then that tucker could have done it on purpose as an act of mercy to a woman living in such terrible fear she would only have been hastening something that was inevitable then he remembered how when he had interviewed tucker briefly before leaving for mr mortons office the previous afternoon he had seen only grief in her face the idea melted away no this was too large a dose to have been an accident thurgood replied his face betraying his unhappiness it was at least five times as much as she would have taken for sleep laudanum is not easy to overdose on because the solution is weak one would have to take a second or in time even a third dose within a short time to have it be fatal i deliberately prepared it that way precisely to avoid such accidents and i made sure that both tucker and miss freemarsh kept the supply out of the main bedroom or bathroom in a cupboard with a lock pitt was growing even colder and the key on a ring in a cupboard whose handle was higher than mrs montserrat could have reached thurgood looked as if he was chilled too he stood stiffly his hands clenched together the bloodless skin stretched over his knuckles if mrs montserrat had taken the same dose she was normally given at night before settling down to sleep even if she was awake she would have been too drowsy to have gotten up gone from her room across the landing to the chambermaids room and climbed on a chair to open the key cupboard and then a second chair to reach the medicine cabinet no the laudanum was administered to her by someone else what i cannot say is whether it was an accident but i find it hard to believe anyone could give so much accidentally he met pitts eyes im relieved to say that it is not my responsibility to find out i see thank you pitt was bitterly disappointed although in all honesty he had to admit that he had not wanted to think serafina was so far departed from reality as to have taken her own life in a haze of fear and confusionor even deliberately as an alternative to the mental disintegration that had already begun it wouldve been a humiliating end for a brave woman but this looked like murder was it a simple domestic tragedy fueled by greed and impatience nerissa unwilling to play companion and dreamerinwaiting another year or two or even three perhaps her lover was losing the will to wait for her or she was afraid he might soon perhaps it was just another wretched story of family misery turning into hatred for an imprisonment in loveless tedium how old would nerissa be midthirties perhaps how many more childbearing years did she have desperation was a strong force all but overwhelming perhaps it had nothing to do with serafinas past or special branch but he must be sure thank you he said thurgood smiled without pleasure ill send you a written report amounts and so on but there is no doubt as to what it is and i cant tell you anything more no marks on the body pitt asked scratches bruises anything to indicate her being held wrists a cut inside the mouth anything at all several thurgood said thinly she was an old woman and she bruised easily but if she had been forced to take it against her will i would have expected to find bruises all around her wrists it takes some strength to hold a person fighting for her life even an old woman would you know if you were drinking laudanum pitt persisted what does it taste like youd know thurgood assured him if she took that much believe me either she took it intentionally or under some kind of duress the only other alternative and ive been thinking about this is that she took the normal dose then when she was in a halfasleep state the rest was given to her if there were some spilled it could be mopped up perhaps with a little water and thered be no discernible trace he shrugged with an air of hopelessness even if there was it would prove nothing she might often spill things she was old and shaky sitting up in bed i see thank you pitt arrived back at dorchester terrace later that afternoon already the light was fading from the sky the footman admitted him and had him wait in the cold morning room until nerissa sent for him to come to the withdrawing room the curtains were drawn closed as they had been the previous day but she was rather more composed this time even if just as tense what is it now mr pitt have you not caused us sufficient distress she said coldly the doctor tells me that you have obliged him to perform an autopsy on my aunt i dont know what purpose you believe that will possibly serve it is a horrible thing to do a desecration of her body that i cannot protest against strongly enoughfor all the good it will do now it was necessary to know how she died miss freemarsh he replied watching her face her anger the clenched hands by her side and i regret to say that it was from an overdose of laudanum he stopped afraid she was going to faint she swayed and grasped the back of the settee to steady herself an overdose she repeated hoarsely i thought i thought laudanum was safe how could that happen it was not even kept in the same room with her we were so careful it was in an upstairs cupboard and tucker has the key even if my aunt felt that she was not sleeping well enough she could not have gotten up to dose herself that makes no sense what would make sense miss freemarsh pitt asked more gently i beg your pardon what do you think happened i i dont know how could i she must have she sat still unable to finish what he did not allow her to wait you have just told me that she could not have gotten up to find the laudanum herself then then someone must have her hand went to her throat someone must have broken in or is that possible i would not have thought so she was beginning to regain a little of her composure but i do not know the facts if you are quite certain that she died of too much laudanum then i dont see what other explanation there can be i did not give it to her and i cannot believe that tucker did she has been loyal to aunt serafina for years she was staring at pitt defiantly now she lowered her voice just a little aunt serafina used to speak rather a lot about her past i always believed she was making up most of it but perhaps she wasnt she was afraid someone would try to hurt her to keep her from revealing secrets if the doctor is rightand i have no idea if he isthen that may be the answer pitt waited still watching her i dont know what else you expect me to say she shook her head very slightly lady vespasia came to see her several times perhaps she may know who would wish my aunt harm aunt serafina trusted her she may have confided in her i really cannot help and i will not have you distressing the servants none of us knows anything i will ask them if they heard noises of any sort in the night and of course you may ask them if anything was found but i will not have you frightening them with the idea that we have had a murderer in the house do you understand me she shook herself a little and glared at him i will hold you responsible if you have them walk out in terror and leave me alone here it was not graceful but it was a reasonable statement if it was even remotely possible that someone had indeed broken in then she had a right to be afraid i will check the windows and doors myself miss freemarsh he promised there is no need for any of your servants to be aware that mrs montserrats death was anything but natural unless you choose to tell them thank you she gulped how am i supposed to explain your presence here mrs montserrat was a woman of great distinction to whom the country owes a debt he replied we are taking care of the arrangements for her funeral and you will not argue with us over this it will explain my continued presence perfectly she let out her breath with a sigh yes yes that will do i am obliged now what is it you wish to look at will it wait until tomorrow no it will not im sure your housekeeping staff is excellent they may unintentionally remove all trace of anyone having broken in if indeed such a thing happened i see then i suppose you had better look although it is more than possible that they have removed such a thing already pitt gave a very tiny smile of course but if he waited until the following day it would allow her time to create such evidence and he had no intention of permitting that now if you would be good enough to show me all the windows and doors i will examine them myself she obeyed without speaking again they went to every door and window one by one any place where anyone could possibly have gained entry as he had expected he found nothing that proved or disproved that someone might have broken in he examined the key to the cupboard where the laudanum was kept then the cupboard itself it was all exactly as he had been told he thanked nerissa and left outside in the lamplit street windwhipped and cold he hailed the first hansom he could find and gave the driver narraways address he climbed in and sat sunk in thought as they bowled along almost oblivious of where he was in spite of vespasias fears he had not expected the doctors findings suddenly the world that serafina had apparently hinted at had become real and he was not prepared for it when vespasia had told him everything it had sounded very much like the ramblings of an old woman who was losing her grip on life and longed to be thought important and interesting for just a little longer he had to admit he had assumed that vespasia was seeing in serafina a ghost of what might happen to herself one day and was exercising kindness rather than critical judgment now he needed narraways opinion something to balance the thoughts that teemed in his own mind narraway of all people would not be swayed by fancy it did not occur to him until he was almost at narraways door that at this time in the early evening he might very well not be at home he felt a sense of desperation rise inside himself and leaned forward as if traveling faster would somehow solve the problem he realized the stupidity of it and leaned back again with a sigh the hansom pulled up and he asked the driver to wait there was no purpose in staying here if narraway was out he could be gone all evening he was free to do as he wishedeven take a vacation if he cared to but the manservant told him narraway was at home as soon as he had paid the hansom pitt went in and was shown to the sparse elegant sitting room with its booklined walls the fire sent warmth into every corner and the heavy velvet curtains were drawn against the night pitt did not bother with niceties they knew each other too well and had long ago dispensed with trivia now the balance was more even between them though narraway was the elder the command was pitts serafina montserrat is dead pitt said quietly she died some time during the night before last i know narraway replied gravely vespasia told me what is there about it that concerns you is it not better that she went before her mind lost all its grasp and fear and confusion had taken over she was once a great woman the cruelties of old age are very harsh he waited dark eyes steady on pitts knowing that there had to be something else pitt would not have come simply to share grief did she say anything dangerous before she died i dont know pitt answered it seems possible even more so than i thought she died of an overdose of laudanum he saw narraway flinch but he did not interrupt according to the postmortem it was many times the medically correct amount pitt continued miss freemarsh said that the bottle was kept locked in a cupboard in the maids pantry and was higher than mrs montserrat could have reached even had she had the key i checked and she is right i questioned the ladys maid tucker and she agrees i searched the house and while it is not impossible that someone broke in there is nothing that indicates it narraway bit his lip his face troubled i assume there is no possibility she could have accidentally been given a large dose or that she deliberately took it no the doctor has assured me that it couldnt have been done unknowingly and she didnt handle the bottle herself which rules out deliberately too unless tucker helped her a killing performed out of mercy to hasten what was inevitable but before serafina betrayed all that she had valued narraway asked not a pleasant thought but imaginable in extreme circumstances his lips tightened into a bitter line i think i would be grateful if someone were to do that for me pitt considered it he tried to picture the frail elderly maid after a lifetime of service doing her desperate mistress the last kindness she could the final act of loyalty to the past it made perfect sense and yet thinking of tuckers face he could not believe it no after having spoken to tucker i dont believe that she would do such a thing not even to save serafina from having the same thing done to her by somebody else perhaps more brutally not a quiet going to sleep from which she didnt waken but perhaps strangling or suffocating with a quick hard pillow over the face narraway asked this would have been gentle if not tucker perhaps the niece miss freemarsh she could have done it as easily i thought of that pitt replied but i dont think the niece has any understanding of what serafina accomplished in the past or any profound loyalty to her the possibility that someone else coerced tucker into it is more likely but i dont believe that either reason instinct instinct pitt replied but they could have gotten to the niece thats possible and i think shes lying about the circumstances of mrs montserrats death at least to some degree there are two reasons i can see as to why she might lie one a certain amount of fairly natural resentment could blossom out of spending ones youth as a dependent a companion and housekeeper while childbearing years slip away narraway winced you make it sound pretty grim it is pretty grim but its better than not having a roof over your head pitt pointed out which may well have been her only alternative ill have it looked into just in case it matters and the other reason i think she has a lover narraway smiled so her life is not as grim as you painted it after all depends on who he is and what hes after pitt responded drily the thought flickered through his head that narraway seemed to know comparatively little about women it was a surprise to perceive how having a wife and also children was such a large advantage in that sense narraway was watching him his face grave an intense sadness in his eyes poor serafina he said softly murdered after all he rubbed the heel of his hand across his face damn if someone killed her it means she knew things that still matter she had all sorts of connections in the whole balkan area austria hungary serbia croatia macedonia and of course most of all in northern italy she was part of all the nationalist uprisings from onward if theres something brewing now she might have known who was involved connections old debts pitt did not have to weigh whether he should tell narraway about the current assassination threat it was never a possibility in his mind that narraway would betray anything we have word that there might be an assassination attempt on duke alois habsburg when he visits here in a couple of weeks he said very quietly he did not yet want to tell narraway what a bloody and violent plan it was alois habsburg narraway was stunned for gods sake why he took a deep breath is he far more important than we ever supposed what does the foreign office say that i have a severe case of inflated imagination pitt replied due in all likelihood to having been promoted beyond my ability narraway swore with a vocabulary pitt had not known he possessed but evan blantyre is taking it very seriously and has already given me a great deal of help pitt added blantyre good he knows as much about the austrian empire as anyone probably more than the foreign secretary if he thinks its serious then it is god what a mess but i dont understand why duke alois he bit his lip have you considered the possibility that special branch is actually the target and duke alois is incidental yes pitt said softly he may be simply a convenient pawn the man in the right place at the right time perhaps it doesnt matter whos killed as long as its done here but could he be a troublemaker like crown prince rudolf narraway asked doubtfully socialist sympathies does he write articles for leftleaning papers with dangerous philosophical ideas or subversive elements of any sort no pitt replied as far as we can find out hes a totally harmless dabbler in science and philosophy if he hadnt been distantly royal and with money he probably would have been a university professor narraway frowned theres a hell of a lot we dont know about this pitt and you need to find out damn quickly how much help is blantyre being and why pitt smiled bitterly i thought of that too but the answers fairly simple he sees the pivotal position of austria in europe and the increasingly fragile threads that hold the empire together one really good hole ripped in it such as would be caused by a major scandalsomething that say forced the austrians to react violently against one of the smaller member nations like croatiaand the whole fabric could unravel narraway looked skeptical croatia has caused trouble for years he pointed out and blantyre of all people knows that there is something new in it pitt argued blantyre pointed it out to me we now have a unified germany with the strong energetic power of prussia at the head if slavic croatia seems to be the victim of germanspeaking austrias aggression slavic russia will very naturally come to its aid newly unified germanspeaking teutonic prussia will come to viennas aid and we will have a european war in the making that we might not be able to stop god almighty narraway said in horror as the enormity of it dawned on him then guard alois with your life if necessary use blantyre use everybody ill do all i can starting with finding out what happened to poor serafina montserrat particularly whether she knew anything about this his face was ashen but there was a tension in his body as if every nerve in him had come alive his breathing was faster there was a tiny muscle jumping in his temple and his slender hands were locked rigidly together as he leaned forward we have to succeed i know pitt agreed quietly and serafinas death narraway asked then when pitt did not answer immediately he continued i have nothing to do at least nothing that matters let me look into that it may be important but even if it has nothing to do with politics and is merely some miserable domestic tragedy she deserves better than having it be ignored pitt stared at him for several seconds i assure you i have solved the occasional crime before now narraway said his eyes bright with amusement you will be challenging me no more to step into your shoes than i have you stepping into mine pitt drew breath to apologize then changed his mind and simply smiled of course she does deserve better charlotte reasoned that just because pitt could not tell her about his current case that did not mean that she could not use her own intelligence and considerable deductive powers to work out what she could do to be of use to him anyway it was perfectly obvious that evan blantyre was important to pitt at dinner at the blantyres house the men had spent the rest of the evening in the dining room with the door closed and had given instructions to the butler not to interrupt them unless sent for when they had finally emerged they had seemed in close agreement about something pitt had expressed a gratitude that was far deeper than the thanks one owes for a good dinner and a pleasant evening on the way home he had said nothing but charlotte had seen that the tension in him had eased somewhat certainly that night he had slept better than for over a week therefore she judged it a good idea to cultivate a friendship with adriana blantyre this was not in the least difficult since she had liked her instinctively and found her unusually interesting having grown up in croatia and then northern italy adriana had a different perspective on many things and she was certainly a very agreeable person in spite of the anxiety that was often in her face and the sense charlotte had that there were secrets within her that she shared with no one perhaps that was because those secrets were rooted in experiences an englishwoman could not even imagine so charlotte had invited adriana to visit an exhibition of watercolors with her that afternoon adriana had accepted without hesitation they met at two oclock on the steps of the gallery and went inside together they laughed a little as they clutched at their hats the wind picking up even the heavy cloth of winter skirts whose edges were dampened by rain adriana was dressed in a warm wine color which lent a glow to her pale skin it was a beautifully cut costume with a slightly sporty air which made one think of a hunting dress her hat was narrowbrimmed tipped well forward and had a towering crown it looked vaguely austrian charlotte saw at least a dozen other women glance at adriana and then look away their faces filled with disapproval and envy everyone else looked dull in comparison and they knew it adriana saw and seemed a little abashed too much she asked almost under her breath not at all charlotte said with amusement you may guarantee that at least three of them will go straight to their milliners tomorrow morning and demand something like it on some it will look wonderful and on others absurd hats are the hardest things to get right dont you think adriana hesitated a moment to make sure that charlotte was serious then her face relaxed into a wide smile yes i do but with hair like yours it seems a shame to wear a hat at all but i suppose you must at least out in the streetoh and in church of course she laughed lightly i wonder if god had the faintest idea how many hours we would spend in front of the glass rather than on our knees fussing over what to wear to worship him in what to be seen while worshipping him charlotte corrected her but if he is a man as everyone says then he probably did not think of it she smiled and walked side by side with adriana across the wide entrance hall and into the first display room but if he is a woman or had a wife then he would certainly know she continued softly so as not to be overheard presumably he invented our hair he must have at least some idea how long it takes to pin it up every picture i have seen of eve she has hair long enough to sit on adriana exclaimed to cover her womanly attributes i dont think mine would ever grow so long of course a number of gentlemen have very little hair at all especially in their advancing years charlotte replied you should feel free to have as wide a skirt and as large a hat as you please they went around the paintings slowly looking at each one with care oh look adriana said in sudden excitement that is just like a bridge i used to know near where i was born she stood transfixed in front of a small delicate pastoral scene it was simple a small river meandering over its bed and disappearing beneath a stone bridge the light shining in the water beyond cows grazed nearby so perfectly depicted that it seemed as if at any moment they would amble out of the painting charlotte looked at adriana and saw a range of emotions in her face she seemed very close to both laughter and tears its beautiful charlotte said sincerely you must find it very different here i sometimes wish i had grown up in the country but if i had i think i would miss it so terribly that i might never reconcile myself to paved streets and houses close to each othernot to mention noise and smoke in the winter oh theres mud in the country adriana assured her and cold and in the winter it can be unbearably tedious believe me and so much darkness everywhere it closes in on you in every direction almost without relief you would miss the theater and parties and gossip about famous people rather than just the talk of your neighbors mrs this about her grandchildren mr that about his gout miss soandso about her aunt and how bad the cook is charlotte looked at her closely trying to see how much she meant what she was saying and how much she was very lightly mocking after several seconds she was still uncertain that was invigorating it was a bore to always be able to read people perhaps one should have a city home for the winter to go to the theater and operas and parties she said with an answering halfseriousness and a country home for the summer to go for rides and walks to dine in the garden and whatever else one chooses to do but you are english adriana was close to laughter now so you spend the summer in town and go to your country estate for the winter where you gallop around the fields behind a pack of dogs and apparently enjoy yourself enormously charlotte laughed with her and they moved to the next painting charlotte only barely noticed adriana glance back once at the gentle bridge in the sun with the cows grazing nearby she must have loved blantyre very much to have left behind the country she clearly adored and come to england have you traveled to many places in europe she asked aloud i have never been to italy for instance but from the pictures i have seen it is very beautiful indeed it is adriana agreed but i have found that it isnt really places that matter it all comes down to people in the end she turned to look at charlotte dont you agree there was complete honesty in her eyes and almost a challenge yes i suppose i like london because the best things that have happened to me have happened here charlotte agreed yes of course it is all to do with people in the end it comes down to being with those you love beauty is exciting and thrilling you never entirely forget it but you still need to share it with someone adriana blinked and turned away i dont think i really want to go back to croatia it wouldnt ever be the same my family is gone she stopped abruptly as if she regretted having begun she straightened her back and shoulders and moved to another painting depicting a girl of about sixteen sitting on the grass in the shade of a tree she was wearing a pale muslin dress and the dappled light made her seem extraordinarily fragile as if not altogether real she had dark hair like adriana in fact the resemblance was remarkable adriana stared at her it was another world wasnt it sixteen she said at last yes charlotte agreed thinking back to being with sarah and emily in the garden at cater street every summer when they were young adriana moved a little closer to her she looks so delicate she said facing the painting she probably isnt i was ill a lot as a child but i have been well for years now evan doesnt always believe it he treats me as if i need watching all the time extra blankets another scarf gloves on dont step in the puddles or youll get your feet wet youll catch a cold she pulled her lips into a strange rueful halfsmile actually i hardly ever get colds it must be your bracing climate here i have become english and tough this time it was charlotte who laughed we get colds she admitted some people seem to always be coughing and sniffling but im very glad to hear that you have outgrown your ill health if you are strong now thats all that counts adriana turned away quickly tears slipping down her cheeks im sorry charlotte said instantly wondering what she had said had adriana lost someone to a simple illness perhaps a child how tragic and painful if that was the case adriana shook her head please dont be one cannot go backward there are always losses i dont think there is anyone in the world i ever loved as i cared for my father i wish he could know that i am well and strong here and that i she waved her hand impatiently i apologize i shouldnt even allow the memories to come to my mind we all lose people she looked back at charlotte you are very patient and gentle i had two sisters i lost one of them charlotte said quietly sometimes i think of her and wonder what it would be like if she were still alive if we would be better friends than we were then she forced her memory back to those dreadful days when the family the whole neighborhood looked at each other with fear when she had realized how little she knew of what the people closest to her really believed in loved or dreamed of she blushed now when she wondered if sarah had known that charlotte had been in love with dominic sarahs husband that was something she preferred not to recall everyone had embarrassing moments in their past pieces they would like to live over again to create a better outcome she linked her arm in adrianas come on lets go and get a hot cup of tea and maybe some cake or crumpets you mentioned where you first met mr blantyre the other evening it sounded far more romantic than london i first met mr pitt when he was investigating a fearful crime near where i lived and we were all suspect at least of having seen something and lying about it in order to protect those we loved it was all grim and awful you have to have a better tale to tell than that adriana looked at her with interest and then as their eyes met for longer with understanding certainly she said cheerfully tea and crumpets then ill tell you how mr blantyre and i met and more about some of the really wonderful places ive been the blue and green lakes in the mountains in croatia youve never even imagined such colors they lie like a necklace dropped carelessly by some great goddess of the sky and i wish i could really describe for you the forests of illyria she went on they are all deciduous trees and in the spring when the young leaves are just out it is as if the whole world were newly made charlotte tried to imagine it perhaps it was something like a beech forest in england but she did not want to put words to it or try to compare and we have the dinaric alps adriana went on and caves dozens of them seven or eight hundred feet deep really charlotte was amazed but mostly she was moved by the depth of emotion in adrianas voice the passion behind her words have you been in some of them adriana shivered only once my father took me and held my hand there is nothing on earth darker than a cave it makes the night sky even with clouds seem full of light but you should see istria and the islands there are over a thousand of them strung all along the coast those in the farthest south are almost tropical you know you must miss such beauty here i do adriana gave her a sudden smile of great warmth then she changed the subject abruptly as if the memories of her own country were too overwhelming to continue discussing vienna is marvelous she said cheerfully you have never really danced till you have heard a viennese orchestra play for mr strauss and the clothes every woman should have a dress to waltz in once in her life come charlotte obeyed falling into step with her the following day charlotte was in the parlor giving serious consideration to the matter of whether to buy new curtains possibly in a different color when she heard daniel shouting angrily he must have turned at the bottom of the stairs to go along the passage to the kitchen because his feet were loud on the linoleum the next moment jemima came after him i told you youd break it she shouted now look what youve done i wouldnt have if you hadnt left it there stupid daniel shouted back how was i to know youd go banging around like a carthorse jemima was at the bottom of the stairs now charlotte came out of the parlor jemima jemima stopped in the passage and swung around her face flushed with anger he broke it she said holding up the remnants of a delicate ornamental box she was close to tears from fury and disappointment charlotte looked at it and knew it was beyond mending she met jemimas eyes so much like her own im sorry i dont think theres anything we can do with that i dont suppose he meant to he didnt care jemima retorted i told him to be careful charlotte looked at her and imagined how tactful jemimas warning had likely been yes she said calmly youd better put it in the wastebasket under the lid so you dont keep looking at it ill go and speak to him jemima did not move go on charlotte repeated do you want to make it better or worse if i talk to him about it in front of you it will definitely make it worse that i can promise you reluctantly jemima turned around and climbed slowly back up the stairs charlotte watched her until she had disappeared up the next flight as well to her own bedroom then she went along to the kitchen minnie maude was peeling potatoes at the sink daniel was sitting on one of the chairs at the kitchen table swinging his feet and looking miserable and angry he glared at charlotte as she came in ready to defend himself from jemima if she was immediately behind did you break it charlotte asked it was her fault he responded she left it in the way did you mean to of course i didnt daniel are you sure yes thats not fair i didnt see it thats what i thought so what are you going to do about it he looked at her resentfully i cant put it together again he protested no i dont think anybody can she agreed i think youll have to find her another one his eyes widened i cant where would i get it you wont get one just like it but if you save up your pocket money you might find one nearly as nice she shouldnt have left it there he drew in a deep breath itll be all my money for weeks maybe months what if she puts in half charlotte suggested her half for leaving the box in the way your half for not looking where you were going and breaking it reluctantly he agreed watching to see if she was pleased good she smiled at him now minnie maude will get you a piece of cake then you will go upstairs and tell jemima you are sorry and offer to share pocket money with her to find another box what if she says no he asked if you ask nicely and she refuses then you are excused he was happy he turned to minnie maude and waited for the promised cake im going out for a little while charlotte told them both i may be an hour or two or even longer minnie maude please tell mr pitt if he comes home before i do that ive gone to visit my sister yes maam minnie maude agreed reaching for the cake charlotte did not bother to change she took her coat hat and gloves and left immediately before she could lose the conviction within herself that she must go to emily and make peace with her she walked briskly along keppel street to russell square where she caught a hansom during the ride she composed in her mind over and over what she would say how she would vary her answers according to emilys responses and how best to keep both of their tempers in check the weather was getting milder she passed several carriages bowling along briskly with ladies out visiting or simply taking the air another month and it would be a pleasure to go to the botanical gardens trees and shrubs would begin to show green leaves even flower buds there would be daffodils in bloom she arrived at emilys spacious handsome house and alighted she paid the driver then walked up to the front door and pulled the bell she waited only a few moments before the door was opened and a footman greeted her with apologies im sorry mrs pitt but neither mr nor mrs radley is at home you are welcome to come in and take a little refreshment if you would care to he held the door wide and stepped back to allow her to pass charlotte felt ridiculously disappointed it had never occurred to her that emily would be out at this hour but of course that was perfectly reasonable all her screwing up of courage her swallowing of pride was to no avail thank you she accepted going into the warmth of the hallway it was windy outside already the light was fading from the sky and dusk was in the air that would be very pleasant perhaps i may leave a message for mrs radley certainly maam i shall bring you a pen and paper unless you would prefer to use mrs radleys desk in the morning room that would be a very good idea thank you ill have your tea served here when you return would you care for hot crumpets and butter as well she smiled at him liking his thoughtfulness yes please she found the paper in emilys desk and wrote dear emily i came by on the spur of the moment because i quite suddenly realized how little i wish to quarrel with you there is nothing of such importance that i should allow it to make me unreasonable or illtempered she hesitated maybe she was taking rather too much of the blame for what had been at the very least quite as much emilys fault no better to continue in this vein she could always be a trifle sharper if emily took advantage and it was true none of the differences mattered in the end all that is good outweighs everything else and small differences must not be allowed to matter affectionately charlotte she folded the note and put it in her reticule then put the top back on the ink and laid the pen down she returned to the morning room and hot tea and crumpets were served to her a few moments later she gave her note to the footman thanked him and sat down to enjoy her treat before going back outside into the cold to look for a hansom to take her home again breakfast on keppel street on march the fifth was as busy as usual daniel and jemima had to get off to school homework packed in satchels boots on coats buttoned and with scarves and gloves that matched each other no matter how much care was taken the evening before there always seemed to be something to hunt for it was a sharp icy morning with a knifeedge to the wind scarves were tied tightly a button was found hanging loose charlotte hastily fetched a needle thread thimble and scissors to attach it more securely before she bundled them both out the front door at least there was now a tentative peace between them and they went down the pavement side by side pitt had been debating with himself whether to seek charlottes opinion about the next step he planned to take in the case of duke alois or not to trouble her with it if he was mistaken either way he would jeopardize his position and therefore the future of them all even minnie maude standing at the sink washing dishes would be without a job or a home did he want to tell charlotte because she might actually help or simply because it would be less lonely for him charlotte took a small piece of cheese out of the cupboard near the door have we got any more of this in the back pantry she asked minnie maude minnie maude took her hands out of the water ill go an look maam she said quickly no its all right youre busy ill see myself charlotte replied turning to do so no minnie maude dripped water on the floor in her haste then wiped her hands on her apron ill go im not sure where i put it she went almost at a run her heels clattering on the floor archie and angus the two cats curled up together in the wood basket by the stove opened their eyes archie spat with irritation charlotte shook her head glancing at pitt i dont know what it is with that girl she said with a sigh and a smile id think she was keeping a lover in that pantry if i didnt know better pitt was startled he put his empty cup down and stared at her in alarm oh dont be ridiculous she said with a laugh theres nobody there thomas its just her own little bit of space i think she goes out there just to sit and think sometimes coming here is a big change for her shes very aware of trying to fill gracies shoes you know as she passed him moving to the cupboard over the sink she touched him gently just brushing her hand over his hair you should understand that so she had seen his apprehension about trying to fill narraways place perhaps more keenly than he had wanted her to but why should he have doubted it she had known him longer and better than anyone else in his life hers was not a blind love nor one that chose to believe only what was comfortable it was openeyed which perhaps was the only type of love that was safe in the end and therefore infinitely precious shes good though isnt she he asked yes shes excellent charlotte answered but shes not gracie and i have to keep remembering that by the way gracie came by the other day she looks so happy i couldnt but be happy for her too you didnt mention it he said quickly you were rather occupied with jack and lord tregarron oh well i intend to see the prime minister today so that will probably make it even worse im sorry she bit her lip dont be emilyll get over it shes desperate for jack to succeed i hope he doesnt know how much i hope he has no idea how afraid she is that he might not i cant imagine living with that i dont think she needs to worry he began thomas im not talking about her she protested i mean him he would know she doubted him he drew in a deep breath arent you afraid for me at least sometimes he instantly wished he had not asked but it was too late youve already succeeded at enough things that i can live with a failure or two she said perfectly steadily nobody wins all the time unless what theyre aiming at is pretty easy for a moment emotion robbed him of any words at all his chest was so tight that he gulped in a breath he grasped her hand and pulled her toward him and held her until he heard minnie maudes footsteps in the corridor she came in holding a large wedge of cheese and charlotte took it from her with a wide smile pitt said goodbye and went into the hall for his coat pitt sent his request through the right channels but he refused to explain himself to footmen or secretaries i am commander of special branch and i need to advise the prime minister of an incident that if we do not prevent it could be disastrous to great britain he gave no more detail than that except that the matter was urgent it was a little after midday when he was received at downing street residence of the prime minister the marquess of salisbury good afternoon commander salisbury said grimly he held out his hand since it was the first time they had met in this present capacity i trust this is as grave as you imply there was warning in his tone that if he had been misled the consequences for pitt would be unpleasant if it takes place yes sir pitt replied sitting in the chair salisbury indicated i am hoping we can prevent it then you had better tell me what it is and quickly i have a meeting with the chancellor of the exchequer in forty minutes salisbury sat opposite him but was clearly not at ease pitt had already decided while walking here through the rising wind trying to keep his hat on that he would say nothing about the likelihood of the threat to european stability unless he was asked his answer should be clear no prevaricating or defending himself in advance the assassination of duke alois habsburg grandnephew of emperor franz josef of austria sir he is due to visit one of our own queens greatnephews here in london in eleven days time it appears as if the murder itself may be committed by causing a major rail crash between dover and london he forced himself to add no more salisburys expression of dismay told him that the foreign secretary had not relayed the earlier warning pitt had given him a rail crash good god salisburys long pale face went a shade paler i suppose you are perfectly sure of what youre saying he squinted at pitt as if it was his eyesight he disbelieved rather than his hearing pitt chose his words carefully the prime ministers reaction today and his future confidence in pitts judgment depended on them i am sure that such an attempt is being planned sir however i do not know by whom nor where it will take place so far i am certain only that the dukes route from vienna all the way to london is being checked by people we know as anarchists men with backgrounds of violence we cannot afford to take the threat lightly lightly what sane man would salisbury was irritated he had been caught on the wrong foot because no one had prepared him pitt tried to think what narraway would do pitt could not treat the marquess of salisbury as an equal as narraway might have but he needed to remain in control of the situation only someone who disbelieved it sir he said quietly and on the face of it there seems to be no reason to harm duke alois so the attempt makes little sense salisbury nodded pitt continued i need to find out if in fact someone else is the intended target or alternatively if duke alois is far more important than he seems all i can learn so far is that he is a quiet rather academically inclined young man who spends his time studying philosophy and science but at no one elses expense he is quite well liked has plenty of money of his own is unmarried so far and has no political affiliations that we can trace in other words he is perfectly harmless salisburys face was grim whose wife or daughter is he sleeping with he asked pitt grimaced that i dont know but if that were the case it seems an extreme way of dealing with itplotting such a violent assassination and in a foreign country you are right salisbury agreed quite likely he has political convictions we dont know aboutand thats not impossible crown prince rudolf certainly had he was a walking disaster waiting to occur according to my information after the fact of course pitt made no comment that was a diplomatic issue not special branchs it could be that either duke alois is very much cleverer than he pretends to be salisbury went on or the target is someone in his retinue alternatively the whole thing has another purpose such as to embarrass britain and put us at a serious disadvantage in some future negotiation you must prevent it whatever help you need get it what is it you want from me he frowned why arent you in the foreign secretarys office lord tregarron does not believe the threat is real sir pitt replied but mr evan blantyre does salisbury sat without moving for several moments i see he said finally well well go with your judgment pitt take whatever steps you need to make absolutely certain that when duke alois comes to england he has a safe and happy visit and leaves in peace if he is killed let it be in france or austria not here and please god not by an englishman he bit his lip and stared at pitt his voice suddenly husky you dont suppose that this rail crash is a diversion and it is actually the queen these lunatics are after do you that was a thought that had not even crossed pitts mind no sir i dont he said hoping to god he was right but far from sure although it might be advisable for her majesty not to visit this young man in kensington palace we have more than enough guards present to take care of her in buckingham palace he allowed himself the barest smile i am sufficiently acquainted with her majesty to know that advice for her safety will be received well salisbury grunted true and i have not forgotten your accomplishments at osborne that is principally why you are in the position you are and why i listen to you pitt felt the heat burn up his face he had not referred to that incident in order to remind the prime minister of his own success and now he felt extraordinarily clumsy to have mentioned it at all salisbury smiled you are not in an enviable position commander but it is my belief that you are the best man for the job i would be deeply obliged if you would prove me right pitt stood up his legs a little stiff yes sir thank you when pitt returned to lisson grove he found a message from blantyre waiting for him asking pitt to contact him as soon as possible pitt telephoned and they met at blantyres club for a late luncheon pitt had never been in such a place before except as a policeman investigating a case and thus coming to speak to one of the members now he was conducted by a uniformed steward who treated him with the respect hed show any other guest they walked through the oakpaneled corridors hung with hunting scenes and stubbss paintings of horses the mens feet were soundless on the carpet blantyre was waiting for pitt at the entrance to the dining room and together they went to the table and took their seats watched by lifesized portraits of the duke of wellington the duke of marlborough and a rather fanciful portrait of henry v at agincourt all a bit military isnt it blantyre said with an apologetic smile but the foods excellent and theyll leave us alone as long as we wish which is rather what i need at the moment i recommend the roast beefits really very goodwith a decent burgundy a trifle heavy i know but well worth it thank you pitt accepted his mind was too occupied with why blantyre had called this meeting to be concerned with what he might eat the steward came and blantyre ordered for both of them including the wine as soon as they were alone he started to speak this young man duke alois he said looking at pitt his dark brows puckered did you find out anything more about him i can find nothing that would make him worth anybodys time or energy to assassinate pitt replied if he is indeed the target then i have to assume that there is a completely different reason for killing him my thoughts precisely blantyre agreed i have called on friends in austria and in germany too all i can find is that he is a harmless young aristocrat who intends nothing more adventurous than to while away his life studying the subjects that interest him are you certain pitt pressed blantyre indicated the food just served them please eat you will enjoy it and yes i am certain my informants tell me he was offered a very agreeable post in diplomacy and declined it at least he was honest enough to say that he had no disposition to be restricted in such a way pitt was beginning to feel impatient with duke alois but he did not show it on the other hand blantyre went on beginning to eat his meal he also appears to listen with great attention to the music of gustav mahler and even schoenberg this new young composer who creates such odd dissonant sounds is he interested and looking for meaning or merely for a new experience i think the latter more likely there was a sadness in his voice and in his dark eyes a typical austrian one eye laughing the other weeping but i think it is better to do a small thing well than nothing at all however i am not a royal duke thank god nothing is expected of me pitt looked at him with a new appreciation of his sympathy and imagination he had raised as if perfectly natural to him issues that pitt had not considered it is peculiarly repugnant to kill someone so innocent of any harm or use blantyre said wryly there was no malice in his tone only a slight sadness is it a good thing or a bad thing not to be worth anyones effort to kill you he said it with a gentle droll humor looking at pitt very directly pitt answered with hesitation at times most comfortable and unquestionably safer but i think in the end i should regret it it seems like an opportunity wasted let slip through your fingers like dry sand blantyre sighed i suppose you sleep better for whatever that is worth but id rather not spend my entire life emotionally asleep however intellectually absorbing my pursuits pitt watched silently as the steward poured more of the dark burgundy into their cutcrystal glasses the light burned red through them but this is not why i asked you to come blantyre said his face emptying of all pleasure events seem to have taken a new turn a man named erich staum has been seen in dover apparently working as a road sweeper he stopped watching pitt closely he is known to certain political authorities in vienna as an assassin of unusual skill and imagination to give himself time to think pitt sipped more wine it was extremely good a quality he was totally unused to perhaps it would have been familiar to narraway i suppose you are sure about this he asked with a smile looking at the wine in his glass there is doubt blantyre admitted but very slight he has a face that is not easy to forget especially his eyes the man in question was dressed in illfitting and dirty clothes with a broom in his hands but if one imagines him upright and shorn of the submissiveness he is too like staum to ignore the probability he has used the guise of a railway porter before and also a hansom cab driver and a postman i see pitt said quietly dustmen pushed carts with their equipment and collected rubbish no one gave them a second glance it was the perfect disguise to carry explosives people take no notice of a road sweeper not to mention his cart why duke alois he asked looking up at blantyre again we still have not answered that staum is for hire blantyre shook his head very slightly barely a movement at all anarchists dont always select victims for any reason but you know that better than i do his hands clenched on his knife and fork things are getting worse pitt more dangerous every year violent socialism is rising national borders are moving around like the tide there seems to be unrest everywhere and wild ideas and philosophies multiplying like rabbits i admit i am afraid for the future there was no melodrama in his voice just a foreboding and the darkness of real fear it shadowed his face making his features pinched more ascetic because pitt respected him he felt the weight of his responsibility settle even more heavily on him well protect duke alois regardless of whoevers after him and whatever the reason he said grimly blantyre let out a sigh i know i know he reached out and poured the rest of the burgundy into their glasses he did not offer a toast pitt had no difficulty reaching the foreign secretary clearly salisbury had been as good as his word however as far as canceling duke aloiss visit nothing had changed im sorry the foreign secretary said grimly it would be quite impossible to cancel the visit now such a thing would signal to all europe that britain cannot guarantee the safety of a member of a foreign royal family visiting our own monarch his voice became even sharper it would be a flag of surrender to every predator in the world surely you see that it cannot even be considered reluctantly pitt had to agree he could imagine with horrible clarity the results that would follow yes sir i do see he said quietly i would very much like to know who is behind this i will not let it go until i do it was late and pitt was tired but he felt that he must speak with narraway however he was torn because to do so was a kind of yielding an admission that he needed advice he hesitated even as he walked along the cold street his breath making wispy trails in the air but not to speak with him was to set his own vanity above the lives of the men and women who would be killed if there really was a train crash not to mention the allbutcrippling damage to the service to which he was sworn he reached narraways door with no indecision left and when the manservant let him in he accepted the offer of supper and hot tea blantyres wine at luncheon had been more than he was used to any progress on serafina montserrats death he asked narraway as they sat by the fire pitt leaning toward it warming his hands after the cold walk not yet narraway answered but you didnt come just to ask me that pitt sighed and sat back in the chair no he conceded no it is something rather bigger than that pitt stop beating around the bush narraway ordered briefly pitt told him what he feared about a possible rail crash and what blantyre had said at lunchtime about duke aloiss visit if its staum narraway said quietly then theres a lot of money involved he has no loyalty to anyone and he is expensive if he has ever failed we dont know about it he thought for a few more moments in silence staring at the fire pitt waited staum has no loyalties no interests narraway said at last a rail crash with all the civilian casualties is very extreme even anarchists are not usually so indiscriminate this could kill scores of people i know either the target is someone so well guarded they cannot reach him any other waybut that profile doesnt fit duke alois at allor else it is a decoy ive thought of that pitt said more sharply than he had intended it was not anger speaking but fear any rumor of something else that might be happening however slight narraway asked what else is vulnerable pitt gave him a thorough update on every issuse even the most trivial and seemingly irrelevant they were all issues going back to narraways own time as head of the branch so there could be no question of confidences broken who else is traveling with the duke narraway asked when he had considered them all and come up with nothing no one who seems important pitt replied feeling the sense of helplessness twist even more tightly inside him and time is short we have little more than a week before he comes narraway sighed then my best guess is that the rail crash is a diversion because the assassination will happen before they ever reach the train staum will get duke alois somewhere in the streets of dover he wont know that we have anyone who can recognize him thats true in fact how did blantyre recognize him do you think pitt asked austrian connection i presume narraway replied staum has committed a few assassinations in europe but never here before so far as we know blantyre could be wrong pitt said of course he could are you willing to take that risk no we dont have enough men to guard all the streets in dover especially if it means drawing them back from the points and the signals which they are counting on narraway agreed if they blow up the main street of dover theyll kill scores of people and they might still miss duke alois they wont narraway cut across him theyll cause a diversion at the last moment an overflowing drain an overturned cart anything to force him to go down a side street or else stand around as a stationary target while they clear the way in those situations you must keep moving have several alternative routes never allow yourself to be cut off and have to stop narraways face was deeply lined almost haggard in the firelight you havent much time pitt find out who killed serafina and why pitt urged you really think that what she was afraid of telling someone had to do with this she was rambling do you know of a better reason someone is willing to go to this length to kill duke alois pitt asked or someone else in his retinue i think he could be incidental just the excuse narraway reminded him his voice gravelly with weariness and the tension of knowledge and fear special branch is important pitt its our defense against all kinds of violence from slow treason to anarchy that kills in minutes if i wanted to cripple england i would try to get rid of special branch first and if i can think of that so can others i know pitt stood up slowly surprised how his muscles ached from clenching them ill start again tomorrow morning early the next day at lisson grove pitt and stoker went over every detail of aloiss visit from the time he stepped aboard the steamer at calais until he boarded it again at dover to leave the office was warm the fire beginning to burn well in the clear air after the sluggishness of rain but there was no ease in the room hell be bringing just four men with him stoker said pointing to calais on the map spread across pitts desk what do we know about them pitt asked all part of his familys regular household retainers stoker replied as far as we can tell nothing we can find that would make them vulnerable to betrayal none of them gambles or has debts out of the ordinary no love affairs with anyone of suspicious background or politics no one drinks more than average which is pretty high he pulled his face into an expression of distaste pitt had no idea whether it was for what he imagined these men in particular to be like or for foreigners in general theyre just what youd expect of hangerson of a minor royal duke stoker went on decent enough in their own way i expect he looked up from the map to meet pitts eyes but his own were unreadable competent to guard him from an attack pitt asked stoker shrugged cant say because theyve never had to honestly sir hes not somebody anyone would bother to attack are we going to put someone in with them yes itll need to be someone who speaks german if possible he speaks good english stoker replied good but we need to understand what they say to each other as well pitt pointed out weve got beck sir and holbein theyre both pretty good well use them pitt agreed stoker raised his eyebrows both yes both we cant afford to fail you know that stoker stiffened yes sir whatever happens to the duke it bloody well wont happen while hes in england he bent to the map again intense concentration in his face the ferry leaves calais at nine in the morning weather permitting it should arrive in dover at noon hell be the first to disembark he has a special carriage set apart for his use he looked up at pitt what about this man staum sir are we sure its him how do we know it isnt someone who just looks a bit like him his face cant be that memorable or hed have been caught by now no were not certain its him pitt conceded but using such a man makes more sense than creating a train crash that kills scores of people depends what this person or people hope to gain stoker said bitterly anarchists dont usually make that much sense thats why theyre so damn difficult to predict i know and people who dont care whether they are caught always have a kind of advantage over those who do but i dont envy them who the hell wants to have nothing worth living for i cant imagine what thats like stoker shook his head his expression puzzled and sad i suppose thats why we find them so hard to catch we just dont understand them what about this duke sir do you think hes going to do pretty much what we tell him or will he want to show everyone how brave he is and behave like a fool i dont know pitt admitted im still trying to find out more about him and the rest of his men stoker swore gently and colorfully under his breath couldnt have put it better myself pitt agreed surprised at the width of stokers imagination stoker colored sorry sir dont be pitt smiled briefly i am thinking much the same but i cant put it as concisely as you do your vocabulary makes me think you spent some time in the navy but i didnt see it on your record at least not the one they showed me no sir stoker was clearly uncomfortable it was not quite official he stopped lost for an explanation learn anything pitt asked yes sir quite a lot he stood still waiting for the rest of the interrogation then it wasnt time wasted pitt answered he was determined to ask narraway one day what stokers story was it would be wise to know but it did not matter now sir stoker began doesnt matter pitt cut him off sir i was going to say that if you want me to go to dover and travel on the train with duke alois ill do that you dont have to pitt replied itll be dangerous arent you going stoker challenged yes i am then im coming too sir anyway i could use the bit of extra pay he smiled slightly really pitt spoke lightly saving for something are you yes sir stoker straightened his shoulders a little i want to buy a cello sir pitt could think of no possible answer to that but he felt inordinately pleased narraway sat by the fire in his study the gaslight turned low and thought about serafina montserrat pitt said he had asked the doctor to keep his own counsel regarding the conclusion that her death could not have been accidental he said he had given the doctor his word that the death would not be investigated by the police but by special branch because of its possible connection with a current case the possible plot against duke alois needed to occupy all of pitts attention he could not afford to be distracted by anything else but narraway was not certain if his promise to investigate serafinas death was wise detection was not a skill he had refined to anything like pitts degree however he still believed it possible that there was a direct link between serafinas fears and the proposed assassination of duke alois if there was it was imperative that he find it before it was too late if serafinas death was a political act by someone afraid she might reveal a longdead scandal or personal indiscretion surely it must have ceased to be embarrassing to anyone but the attacker himself he did not think from what vespasia had said of her that nerissa freemarsh had the nature to contemplate killing her aunt as an act of compassion to free her from the mental suffering of knowing that her own mind was betraying her tucker the ladys maid that was more likely she was devoted to serafina vespasia had told him that and he trusted her judgment without question she had certainly had enough maids to know and seen dozens of others but then tucker would also lose her position at serafinas death and she must know that she would be suspected before anyone else if an overdose was discovered after the years of looking after serafina no one would believe her capable of doing such a thing accidentally that left only the far uglier thought that nerissa freemarsh had killed her aunt for personal reasons possibly the inheritance of the house and whatever money serafina possessed before it was too late for her to enjoy itor perhaps before the money had been spent on serafinas care he would have to interview the household staff there was no one else who could answer the difficult probing questions he needed to ask he stared up at the firelight patterns on the ceiling and tried to think of facts physical evidence anything at all that could prove who had given serafina the extra laudanum nothing came to mind whoever had done it would have cleaned up after themselves the house would be dusted and polished every day the dishes washed everything put back into the cupboard or onto the shelf where it was normally stored all household staff would have access to all parts of the house though it was likely that only tucker and nerissa would spend time in serafinas bedroom and perhaps one of the housemaids had anyone else been there would they have been noticed and what reason would they have to harm serafina unless they had been paid by someone but no that thought was absurd by midnight the fire had burned down narraway stood up turned off the lights and went upstairs to bed he had not thought of any solution to his quandary except to investigate personal motives he had little more than a week before duke alois arrived in dover in the morning he decided to ask vespasias opinion he dressed smartly as was suitable for a visit to a lady for whom he had not only a deep affection but also a certain awe victor how pleasant to see you vespasia said with some surprise when he was shown into the withdrawing room a little after ten oclock she wore a highly fashionable dress of a pale bluegreen shade with white lace at the throat large sleeves and her customary pearls she was smiling she knew of course that he had come for a specific reason well she inquired when she had sent the maid for tea he told her briefly the thoughts he had entertained the previous evening she listened to him in silence until he had finished merely moving her head fractionally every now and then in agreement there is one thing you have apparently not considered she observed nerissa is not a particularly charming young woman and judging from her present position as companion to her aunt she has no great means of her own i know that he said maybe she decided not to risk serafina spending all of what would be her inheritance vespasia smiled my dear victor there is another consideration far more urgent in a womans mind than mere money she noted his expression with amusement nerissa is not plain in appearance but she is quite unaware of how to flatter or charm to amuse to make a man feel highspirited or at ease she is also rapidly coming toward the end of her childbearing years at the moment her prospects are good but if serafina were to have lived even another five years which she might have then it would have been a different matter her present lover may not be willing to wait so long for nerissa to come into her inheritance narraway froze her present lover are you certain yes but i am not certain if it is an affair that has any realistic hope of ending in marriage if it does not then privacy may be all that she desired but surely serafina montserrat would be the last woman on earth to interfere in an affair let alone disapprove of one he said reasonably perhaps but nerissa may not have realized that i am not sure whether she is fully aware of serafinas earlier life these are things it might be profitable for you to discover yes he agreed ceasing the conversation while the maid brought in the tea and vespasia poured it vespasia smiled at him tucker will know she remarked taking one of the tiny crisp cookies off the plate treat her with respect and you will learn all kinds of things he thought for a moment if this lover of nerissas is serious might he have killed serafina to preserve the money nerissa could inherit with the house it would make him very comfortable possibly vespasias face expressed her pity for such a thought and her contempt which is why it is important that you discover who he is her eyes softened with a deeper kind of sadness it is also possible that his reason was nothing to do with money or with nerissa at all except insofar as she gave him access to serafina and her disintegrating memory i know he agreed i will investigate that too after leaving vespasias home narraway rode in the hansom to visit serafinas doctor consumed in thought he was starting to realize how much more difficult detection was than he had originally appreciated he was guilty of having taken pitts skill very much for granted in the previous years he did not even notice the brilliant blue sky darken over or the people on footpaths hastening their steps he did not see the first heavy spots of rain he was unaware of the swift change in the weather until one man lost grip of his umbrella and it whisked into the street startling horses and causing a nearaccident dr thurgood was unable to give any further assistance there was nothing medical to add to the bare fact that serafina had died of an overdose of laudanum so huge that it was impossible that she had given it to herself accidentally he caught a hansom to go to dorchester terrace on the journey he turned over in his mind the practical facts which severely limited the number of people able to administer such a dose the most obvious person was nerissa freemarsh not that he seriously thought it was nerissa unless her lover had built up the nerve or the desperation to force her into it what could have caused that a sudden urgent financial need the longing to marry before it was too late for children then why now why not sooner was it really coincidental that serafinas death had happened just before duke aloiss visit it was not easy to believe he arrived at dorchester terrace alighted and paid the cabbie then walked up the pathway to the door he was admitted by the footman and gave him his card good morning he said quickly before the man could protest that the house was in mourning and would receive no callers i need to speak with miss freemarsh i hope she is still at home he was certain she would be she was very traditional in her manner and dress and so newly bereaved he was certain she would not leave the house for some time the man hesitated will you inform her that lord narraway is here on business to do with the recent death of her aunt mrs montserrat he did not pitch his voice to make it a request i shall also need to speak with the housekeeper the maids the cook yourself and miss tucker the man paled yes yes sir if you he gulped and cleared his throat if you would like to wait in the morning room my lord thank you but i would prefer to use the housekeepers sitting room it will make people more at ease the man did not argue five minutes later narraway was seated on a comfortable chair by the fire facing the plump pinkfaced housekeeper mrs whiteside she looked angry and bristling i dont know what you are thinking i can tell you that much she began refusing to sit even though he had asked her to you are in charge of the house mrs whiteside you can tell me about each of the servants employed here you cant imagine that any of them killed poor mrs montserrat she accused him im not standing here while you say wicked things like that about innocent people lordship or not whoever you are he smiled with amusement at her indignation and with quite genuine pleasure at her loyalty she looked like an angry hen ready to take on an intruder in the farmyard nothing would give me more pleasure than to prove that true mrs whiteside he said gently perhaps with some detail you can assist me in that then we widen the circle to include others who might have observed something of meaning even if they did not realize it at the time the one thing that seems impossible to deny is that someone did give mrs montserrat a very large dose of laudanum if you have any idea who that might be or even why then i would be obliged to you if you would tell me it was the last sort of response she had expected for several seconds she could not find words to answer him he indicated the chair opposite him again please sit down mrs whiteside tell me about the members of your staff so that i can imagine what they do when they are off duty what they like and dislike and so on she was thoroughly confused but she did her best a quarter of an hour into her description she began to speak naturally even with affection for the first time in his life narraway was offered a vivid picture of a group of people utterly unlike himself all away from the homes and families in which they grew up slowly forming a new kind of family with friendships jealousies loyalty and understanding that gave comfort to their lives and a certain kind of framework that was of intense importance mrs whiteside was the matriarch the cook almost as important the footman was the only man serafina not requiring a butler and therefore he had a place of unique privilege but he was young and not above bickering with the maids over trivia tucker as the ladys maid was not really either upstairs or downstairs her position was senior to the others and as narraway listened to mrs whitesides descriptions he came to the conclusion that tuckers position was an oddly lonely one i dont know what else you want she finished abruptly looking confused again narraway was quite certain that none of the staff had had anything to do with serafinas death their own lives had been sadly disrupted by it now even their home was no longer assured sooner or later nerissa might choose to sell the house or might have to and they would be separated from one another and without employment then again if she suspected them of disloyalty or of speaking out of turn to narraway she might dismiss them without even a reference and that would be worse he became suddenly sensitive to the fact that he must phrase his questions with care i would like to speak to them one at a time he responded and see if anyone has noticed anything out of the ordinary in the house something not in its usual place moved or accidentally destroyed perhaps she understood immediately you think somebody broke in and killed poor mrs montserrat her face was horrified the more you describe the people here the less likely i think it is that one of them could have gone upstairs found the laudanum and given mrs montserrat a fatal dose i must stay right in this room while you talk to the maids she warned him of course he agreed i wish you to but please do not interrupt his questioning proved fruitless as he had expected except to confirm in his own mind that serafinas staff was ordinary an artless group of domestic servants capable of occasional idleness gossip and petty squabbling but not of sustained malice or evil for one thing they seemed far too unsophisticated for the degree of deception required to poison someone and hide all traces for another they confided in one another too freely to keep such a secret mrs whitesides estimate of them was reasonably accurate he made a mental note that if he was ever involved in detective work again he would pay more attention to the observations of housekeepers tucker was a different matter she had been with serafina for decades she looked pathetically frail now and somewhat lost she would be cared for now but never needed in the way serafina had needed her she sat in the chair opposite narraway and prepared to answer his questions he began gently and was amused to find her observations of the other servants very similar to mrs whitesides if a trifle sharper but then she did not have to work with them anymore she no longer had a position to guard she was not without humor and he regretted having to move his line of inquiry to more sensitive areas miss tucker i have heard from lady vespasia cumminggould that mrs montserrat was losing her ability to remember exactly where she was and to whom she was speaking did you know that she was afraid of letting secrets slip that might affect other people very adversely she sighed and looked at him carefully of course i was aware if you had asked me five years ago id never have believed such a thing could happen to a lady like mrs montserrat she had difficulty controlling her grief and her eyes blazed at him through tears someone killed her miss tucker i am thinking it less and less likely that it was someone already in this house she blinked and said nothing who has visited mrs montserrat in the last three or four months she looked down not many people like to feel comfortable to be entertained or amused if you are of a certain age yourself seeing a living example of what can happen or what may yet happen to you is unpleasant narraway winced internally he had many years before he reached serafinas age but it would come soon enough would he bear it with grace then he realized with a chill like ice that perhaps he too would be terrified of what he might say and might even be murdered to ensure his silence suddenly serafina became of intense importance to him almost an image of himself in a future to come miss tucker someone killed her he said with a catch in his voice i intend to find out who it was and to see to it that they answer to the law the fact that mrs montserrat was old and had very little family is irrelevant whoever she was she had the right to be cared for to be treated with dignity and to be allowed to live out the whole of her life miss tucker now let the tears roll down her thin cheeks which were almost colorless in the late winter light no one here would hurt her my lord she said in barely more than a whisper but there were others who came into the house some to visit her some to visit miss freemarsh he nodded again of course who were they she pursed her lips slightly in concentration well there was lady burwood who came twice as i recall but that was some time ago to visit whom oh mrs montserrat although of course she was very civil to miss freemarsh narraway could imagine it lady burwood whoever she was being polite and indefinably condescending and nerissa hungering for recognition and receiving none except secondhand through her relationship to serafina who is lady burwood he asked miss tucker smiled middleaged married rather beneath her but happily enough i think she has a sister with a title and more money but fewer children she found mrs montserrat more interesting than most of her other friends did narraway nodded you are very observant as to the details that matter miss tucker he said sincerely why did she stop coming it was a cruel question and he knew it but the answer might be important tuckers face flushed with amusement not what you assume my lord she fell and broke her leg i stand corrected he said wryly who else she mentioned two or three others and a fourth and fifth who had come solely to visit nerissa none of them seemed to have the remotest connection with austria or past intrigues anywhere at all no gentlemen he inquired she looked at him very steadily she had kept decades of secrets and many of them were probably of a romantic or purely lustful nature a good ladys maid was a mixture of servant artist and priest and tucker had been superb at her job a maid to serafina montserrat would have had to be please he said gravely someone murdered her miss tucker i shall repeat nothing that is not relevant to the case i am good at keeping secrets until a few months ago i was head of special branch it was still painful to say that perhaps she saw it in his face i see she nodded very slightly you are too young to retire she did not ask the question that lay between them one of my own secrets came back and caught me he told her oh dear there was sympathy and the very faintest possible humor in her eyes who visited the house miss tucker he asked lord tregarron came to see mrs montserrat twice i think he did not stay very long she replied mrs montserrat was not very well on either occasion i did not hear their conversation but i believe it was not not amicable how do you know that miss tucker did mrs montserrat tell you mrs montserrat knew the first lord tregarron in vienna a long time ago tregarrons father yes do you know the circumstances of their acquaintance i surmise them but i do not know for sure nor will i imagine them for you did tregarron speak with miss freemarsh yes at some length but it was downstairs in the withdrawing room and i have no idea what was said i know it was some time only because sissy the housemaid told me i see anyone else mr and mrs blantyre both came separately several times to see mrs montserrat and miss freemarsh i imagine to discuss mrs montserrats health and what might be done to make her happier and more comfortable i think mrs blantyre was very fond of her she seemed to be mr blantyre also he is very fond of his wife and very concerned for her health apparently she is delicate or at least he is of that opinion and you are not he asked quickly she smiled i think she is far stronger than he appreciates he likes to think she is delicate some men are pleased to believe themselves protectors of the weak caring for some beautiful woman like a tropical flower that needs to be defended from every chill draft narraway had never thought of such a thing but it seemed obvious after hearing tucker say it so you believe blantyre came in order to ensure that adriana was not distressed by her visits to mrs montserrat i think that is how he wished it to appear she said carefully he noted the difference i see and miss freemarsh he asked would she say the same most certainly a tiny flicker of amusement touched her mouth miss tucker i think there is something of importance that you are deliberately not telling me observations she said quickly not facts my lord i think you do not know women very well he was now realizing this for himself i am learning he said ruefully a difficult question miss tucker and i ask you not from personal curiosity but because i need to know does miss freemarsh have an admirer tuckers face remained completely impassive you mean a lover my lord narraway watched her intently and still could not read the emotion behind the words yes i suppose thats what i mean yes she does but i know that because i have been a ladys maid all my life and i know when a woman is in love how she walks how she smiles the tiny alterations she will make to her appearance even when she is forced to keep the matter secret he nodded slowly it made perfect sense tucker would know everything those who had grown up with servants in the house came to look at them as furniture familiar useful to be looked after with care and treated as if they had neither eyes nor ears who is it miss tucker she hesitated miss tucker whoever it is may knowingly or not be behind the death of mrs montserrat tucker winced please it is either lord tregarron or mr blantyre she said in little above a whisper narraway was stunned his disbelief must have shown on his face because tucker looked at him with a disappointment that verged on a kind of hurt she started to speak again then changed her mind you surprise me he admitted i considered both men to be very happily married and i gather miss freemarsh is not attractive to men tucker finished for him quite he agreed tucker smiled patiently i have known of perfectly respectable middleaged men who have been uncontrollably attracted to the strangest women she answered sometimes very rough women laborers with their hands not even clean and most certainly ignorant i have no idea what it is that appeals but it is true with mrs montserrat men loved her courage her passion and her hunger for adventure and she could make them laugh narraway believed it briefly for a swift perfect moment he thought of charlotte and knew why he found her in his own thoughts far too often she had courage and passion too and she made him laugh but he also loved her so much because of her fierce loyalty and the fact that she would never betray pitt would never even wish to then he thought of vespasia and what made her so appealing curiously enough it was not her beauty even in her youth it had not been her beauty dazzling though she was it was the fire in her the intelligence and the spirit and more recently a vulnerability he would never have perceived in her even a year ago thank you miss tucker you have been extraordinarily helpful he said i promise you i will do everything i can to see that the truth of mrs montserrats death is discovered and that whoever is responsible is dealt with justly he did not say according to the law in this case he was not certain that the two were one and the same when narraway finally saw nerissa he had already been at dorchester terrace for three hours he had eaten a luncheon of cold game pie and pickles with a dessert of suet pudding and hot treacle sauce the same as had been eaten in the servants dining room nerissa came in and closed the door behind her she was wearing black with a brooch of jet her face was bleached of even the faintest color and she looked tired the skin around her eyes was shadowed narraway felt a moment of pity for her he tried to imagine what her daily life had been like and the picture he conjured up was monotonous without light or laughter without thoughts to provoke the mind or a sense of purpose had she been desperate to escape that prison wouldnt anyone but especially a woman in love please sit down miss freemarsh i am sorry to have to disturb you but there is no alternative she obeyed but remained stiffbacked in the chair her hands folded in her lap i assume you would not do so if you did not have to my lord she said with a sigh i find it very difficult to believe that any of the staff here would have contributed to my aunts death even negligently and i i cannot think of anyone else who might have done so but since you seem convinced that it was neither an accident nor suicide then there must be some other explanation it is distressing i have to ask you about visitors miss freemarsh he began since the laudanum was given directly to your aunt and had an almost immediate effect it must have been given by someone who came to the house that evening he looked down and saw that nerissas hands were gripping each other so tightly that the knuckles were white who could that have been miss freemarsh nerissa opened her mouth gulped air and said nothing he could see that her mind was frantically racing as she searched for the right words if she denied that anyone came then the only conclusion to be drawn was that it was someone already in the house either herself or one of the servants he knew from the servants themselves that after dinner had been eaten and cleared away they had taken their own meal and retired for the day unless at least two of them were in collusion with each other their time was accounted for nerissa had been alone he imagined the long solitary evenings one after the other every week every month stretching ahead into every year waiting for a lover who could come only rarely if he had called then nerissa herself would have let him in possibly at a prearranged time it might well have been their intent that the servants would be gone so as not to know of it mrs blantyre came nerissa said softly aunt serafina was fond of her and she enjoyed her visits but i cant she left the rest unsaid and she was alone with mrs montserrat yes i had some domestic business to deal with a slight problem with the menu for the following day im so sorry narraway could scarcely believe it if tucker was not mistaken and either blantyre or tregarron was nerissas lover was it even conceivable that adriana blantyre knew this how could any man prefer nerissa freemarshplain humorless desperate nerissaover the beautiful elegant adriana perhaps blantyre was weary of adrianas delicate health which might deny him the marital privileges he wished and felt that that was a good enough reason to stray but why on earth with a plain respectable woman like nerissa perhaps because she loved him and love was what he craved and perhaps because no one would imagine it what could be safer how had adriana learned of it had it been through some careless word from serafina could adriana really be jealous to the degree that she would murder an old woman in her bed why so blantyre would have no more excuse to come to dorchester terrace that was absurd but adriana was croatian and serafina had lived and worked in vienna northern italy and the balkans including croatia he must look more closely into their pasts before he leaped to any conclusions thank you miss freemarsh he said quietly i am grateful for your candor i dont suppose you could offer any reason mrs blantyre should wish your aunt any harm nerissa lowered her eyes i know very little except what aunt serafina said and she was rambling a lot of the time i am really not sure what was real and what was just her confused imagination she was very muddled what did she say miss freemarsh if you can remember any of it it may help explain what has happened especially if she also mentioned it in someone elses hearing nerissas eyes opened wide mrs blantyres you mean do you think so well we dont know who else she may have spoken to he was trying to suggest a further person someone nerissa could blame more easily he did not know what he was looking for but he could not assume it was adriana whatever the reason until he had exhausted all other possibilities and learned who serafina herself had feared nerissa sat silent for so long that narraway was beginning to think she was not going to speak when she finally did it was steadily and reluctantly she mentioned many names especially from thirty or forty years ago most of them were austrian i think or croatian some italian im afraid i dont recall them all it is difficult when they are not in your own language she said tregarron but it made no sense because lord tregarron could not have been more than a child at the time she seemed to believe it was it was all very muddled i understand who else he prompted again she considered for several moments digging into memories that were clearly painful narraway felt guilty but he had to see if there were any connections however oblique to the proposed assassination of alois and even if adriana had left croatia as a young woman family ties might still exist that could be relevant miss freemarsh she looked up at him she she spoke of mrs blantyres family the name dragovic i dont know what she said it was difficult to catch it all but mrs blantyre was distressed to hear it perhaps it awoke old tragedies for her i cant say naturally i did not speak of it to her i asked aunt serafina later but she appeared to have forgotten it im sorry but thats all i can tell you about it i see thank you very much he rose to his feet and allowed her to lead the way back to the hall he left her standing on the exquisite floor of the house that was now hers looking dwarfed crushed by the beauty of it see what you think of that radley lord tregarron said handing jack a sheaf of papers they were in tregarrons office and had been working on a delicate matter concerning a british business initiative in germany yes sir jack accepted the papers with a sense of acute satisfaction he knew that tregarron meant him to read them immediately such documents were never allowed to be taken from the building he left the room and went to his own smaller office sitting in the armchair in front of the fire he began to read it was interesting he was continually learning more about europe in general and the delicate balance between one nation and another most particularly the old ramshackle and crumbling power of the austrian empire and the new rising germany with its extraordinary energy germanys culture was as old as the land itself it had produced some of the worlds great thinkers and brilliant composers of music to enrich the human spirit but as a political entity it was in its infancy all the strengths and weaknesses of youth were very evident in its behavior the same could be said in many ways of italy on austrias southern border the country had been unified only in language and heritage but politically it remained the patchwork of warring citystates that it had been since the fall of the roman empire the more he read of all of it the more fascinated he became he was more than halfway through the pages when he came to a passage he did not fully understand he read the passage again made a note and then continued until he came to the end he went back and reread the page that had troubled him then he picked up the whole and took it back to tregarrons office he knocked on the door it was answered immediately and he went in ah what do you think tregarron asked he was smiling leaning back a little in his chair his powerful face relaxed eyes expectant then he saw jacks expression and he frowned a problem he asked without any anxiety but rather with a look of very slight amusement yes sir jack felt foolish but the matter troubled him too much not to raise it on page fourteen the phrasing of the second paragraph suggests that the austrians are not aware of the germans agreement with hauser and we know that they are the austrians would profit from this quite unfairly tregarron frowned and held out his hand jack passed him the papers tregarron read the entire page then read it again finally he looked up at jack his heavy brows drawn together you are quite right we need to rephrase that in fact i think it would be better if we omitted that paragraph altogether that would still mislead berlin sir jack said unhappily i dont know how vienna knows about the agreement but its quite clear from the dispatch we had yesterday that they do shouldnt that be stated here whatever austrian intelligence has learned it is not our concern to inform berlin of it tregarron replied his eyes hardened but you are perfectly correct to bring that to my attention the reference must be taken out good work radley he smiled showing strong white teeth you have saved us from what could have been a very considerable embarrassment thank you later that evening as jack escorted emily to a dinner party she very much wished to attend he found his thoughts returning to tregarrons explanation of the discrepancy in the document it seemed an uncharacteristic error to have made tregarron was not a careless man far from it he was meticulous in detail how had he not seen the anomaly himself emily was across the table from him dressed in pink an unusual color for her she had always said it was too obvious better suited to someone darker but this gown with its huge sleeves emphasizing her slender shoulders and neck and the white lace inserts in the low bodice was extraordinarily flattering she was enjoying herself this evening but he could tell by the carefully controlled pitch of her voice and the slight stiffness in the way she held her head that she was still troubled by her quarrel with charlotte though she was determined not to give in until she received a more specific form of apology his attempts to persuade her to answer charlottes letter had only made matters worse she had called him an appeaser in a tone of total contempt her anger was with charlotte not him but he knew very well not to interfere again at least not yet the chatter swirled around him he joined in politely his charm had always been effortless and he could give only half his attention and still seem as though he was thoroughly engaged tregarron was not at this particular function but someone mentioned his name jack saw the respect on emilys face and she spoke warmly of lady tregarron jacks mind returned again to the papers how had vienna known about germanys agreement if it was through their own intelligence service as tregarron had said that meant they must have an agent operating within the british foreign office and if that was true it should have caused far greater alarm than it had in tregarron surely that must mean there was some other explanation then he did not know what it was though so he put it to the back of his mind and turned to the woman next to him devoting his attention to her they did not call their carriage to take them home until well after midnight emily stifled a yawn with elegance i enjoyed that so much she said with a tired smile leaning her head against his shoulder he put an arm around her im glad she turned toward him although in the dimness of the carriage with the shadow and light from streetlamps moving across their faces through the windows she could not see him clearly what were you worrying about and dont tell me you werent worrying i know when you are giving someone your whole mind and when you are not he had never lied to her but discretion was an entirely different thing political papers i saw today he said perfectly truthfully you can manage the problem whatever it is she responded without hesitation tomorrow it will be clear enough ive long thought nothing much is ever well solved when you are tired you are quite right he agreed and leaned his head back but he did not forget it he had already made up his mind that tomorrow he would call upon vespasia good morning jack she said without concealing her surprise when he was standing in her morning room just after breakfast there must be some matter of concern to bring you so early she studied him more closely he had always been an unusually handsome man now he looked restless hiding unease with less than his usual skill may i speak to you in complete confidence lady vespasia he asked oh dear she sat down and gestured for him to do the same this sounds very grave of course you may what is it that concerns you in as few words as possible he told her about the agreement with berlin omitting the substance of it except for the one matter that concerned vienna then he explained the sentence that troubled him and watched for her reply never taking his eyes from hers i am afraid she said at length that if you are correct then someone in the foreign office is giving sensitive information to vienna that should be kept from it i suppose you have read this particular document very carefully and you cannot be mistaken i asked lord tregarron if there had been an error he replied he said that he would attend to it and thanked me for my diligence but that does not satisfy you or you would not be here telling me she pointed out he looked profoundly unhappy no he said almost under his breath have you mentioned this to emily he looked startled no of course not or thomas no i then please do not if you speak to thomas he is now in a position where he will have no choice but to act i shall deal with it how i dont expect you to do anything except advise me i suppose i was hoping you would say that i am starting at shadows and to forget the matter she smiled my dear jack you know perfectly well that you are not starting at shadows at the very least there has been a mistake of the utmost carelessness and at worst he asked softly she sighed at worst there is treason keep your own counsel behave as if you consider the matter closed and what will you do i shall speak to victor narraway thank you narraway listened to vespasia with increasing concern when she had finished she had no doubt that he regarded the matter with even more gravity than she had i see he said when she fell silent please dont speak of it to anyone at this point especially pitt we must not take his attention from duke alois at the moment we have only a little more than a week before he lands in dover is he really only a trivial person victor she asked if hes more i havent been able to find out at the moment it seems likely he is a victim of convenience it is the crime that matters i see and serafinas death another matter that is not yet concluded then i had better leave you to pursue whichever issue you consider most urgent i apologize for bringing you further concerns there was the faintest gleam of humor in her eyes he understood it perfectly just as he knew she understood him not at all he murmured rising to bid her farewell in other circumstances he would have asked her to stay but he was already turning over in his mind how he would pursue this new investigation which favor he would call in which debts he might collect upon whom to apply a certain type of pressure at the door she hesitated yes he said to her unasked question i shall tell you thank you victor good evening narraway lay awake a great deal of the night turning over and over in his mind what vespasia had told him and how it might fit in with serafinas death he reviewed all the people he had known in any context who might be of help who could he even ask regarding such a subject as the betraying of confidential information regarding german interests was it a deliberate sabotaging of an anglogerman agreement why was it an intended deviousness something the foreign office specifically tregarron had not thought that jack radley should know he was new to his position perhaps a trifle idealistic so perhaps not yet to be trusted with lessthanhonest dealings if that was tregarrons judgment then it was correct jack had been troubled and he had not been able to turn a blind eye narraway decided that the first thing he should do was find out more about tregarron the foreign office was certainly not above deceit as long as it was certain it could claim innocence afterward if it became known where should he begin so that his inquiries would never be learned of by tregarron himself the answer came to him with extraordinary clarity tregarron had gone to dorchester terrace probably to see serafina perhaps to see nerissa freemarsh had serafina still been alive and fully possessed of her wits and her memory she would have been the ideal person to ask but surely a great deal of anything she knew the excellent and loyal tucker might also know he debated whether to take her some gift as an appreciation of her time and decided that doing so would be clumsy perhaps afterward he would to begin with simple respect would be the subtlest and most important compliment when he arrived at dorchester terrace at midmorning the following day fortune played into his hands nerissa was out special branch thanks to pitt was paying for the funeral but it had left it to nerissa to deal with the actual arrangements which had been somewhat delayed because of the necessity for an autopsy i came to see miss tucker narraway informed the footman it is extremely urgent or i would not disturb you at such a time the footman let him in and fifteen minutes later narraway was again sitting before the fire in mrs whitesides room tucker was perched on the chair opposite him a tray of tea and thinly sliced bread and butter between them i am sorry to intrude on you again miss tucker but the matter cannot wait he said gravely she had poured the tea but it was too hot to drink yet it sat gently wafting a fragrant steam into the air how can i help you lord narraway i have told you all i know this is a completely different matter at least i believe it is i would have asked mrs montserrat were she here to answer me but as i was turning the matter over and over in my mind i realized that a great deal of what she knew you might also know she looked startled then very distinctly pleased he smiled only faintly he did not wish her to think him selfsatisfied what is it you think i might know she inquired picking up her cup and testing to see if it was cool enough to sip it was not and she took instead a slice of bread and butter he took one also then began this is of the utmost confidence i must ask you to speak of it to no one at all absolutely no one i shall not she promised i shall ask you as i would have asked mrs montserrat what can you tell me of lord tregarron it is imperative to britains good name to our honesty in dealing with other countries most particularly germany and austria that i know the truth she sat very upright in her chair a tired proud old woman at the end of a lifetime of service was now being asked by a mana lordto help her country the present lord tregarron my lord or his father she inquired narraway stiffened drew in his breath and then let it out slowly both i think but please begin with his father you were acquainted with him she smiled very slightly as if at his innocence mrs montserrat knew him intimately my lord at least for a while he was married you understand lady tregarron was a nice woman very respectable at times a trifle she searched for the right word tedious oh dear without realizing it he had exactly mimicked vespasias tone of voice i see he did see a vision of endless polite even affectionate boredom sketched before him was it love she made a slight move with her lips oh no just a romance a straying to pick flowers that belonged to someone else vienna has a certain magic one is away from home people forget that it is just as real just as good or bad and did mrs montserrat and lord tregarron part with ill feeling or not he asked enmity not at all but ill feeling she sipped her tea i think lord tregarron was very afraid that lady tregarron might find out and that would have troubled him greatly he loved her she was his safety not just the mother of his childrenthey had one son and several daughtersbut also she was socially very well connected she was a good woman just unimaginative andheaven help herrather humorless who else knew of the affair i dont know people are sometimes more observant than one would wish i see and the present lord tregarron i know less of him he thought well of his father but even better of his mother he is devoted to her but he wasnt devoted to his father he asked there was some estrangement between them she answered did mrs montserrat know why tucker hesitated please miss tucker it may be of some importance he pleaded i believe he learned of his fathers affair with mrs montserrat even though by that time it had been over for many years she said reluctantly thank you i am very grateful to you he picked up his tea it was at last cool enough to sip she frowned is it of use im not sure im not sure at all but an idea vague and illdefined as yet was beginning to form in his mind pitt felt uncomfortable sitting in the big carved chair behind the desk that used to be narraways and looking at narraway himself sitting opposite as a visitor it was only months since their positions had been reversed narraway was smartly dressed as always slim and elegant his dark suit perfectly cut his thick hair immaculate but he was worried the lines in his face were deeply etched his expression without even the shadow of a smile it was just a few days until duke alois would arrive at dover ive just come from dorchester terrace narraway said without hesitation its not impossible that serafinas murder was domestic but its extremely unlikely who was it pitt was saddened by the events at dorchester terrace but not yet concerned the infinitely deeper question of duke aloiss possible assassination engaged all his attention it seems most likely that it was adriana blantyre narraway replied his voice was low his face pinched with regret adriana blantyre pitt repeated as if saying it aloud would make narraway correct him explain that she was not really who he had meant im sorry narraway said gravely i know that you have had great help from her husband and that you like adriana herself but i can see no reasonable alternative there has to be pitt protested why in gods name would adriana blantyre murder mrs montserrat how well did they even know each other it makes no sense narraway sighed pitt youre thinking with your emotions use your brain there are a dozen ways in which it might make sense the most obvious connection is blantyre himself he is an expert on the austrian empire against whose dominion in italy serafina spent most of her life fighting they would have had a hundred acquaintances in common friends and enemies there could have been a score of causes on which they were on opposite sides causes that still matter now pitt asked with an edge of disbelief adriana was at least a generation younger than serafina true she was loyal to the country of her birth he had seen her face light up at the mere mention of it but she had been in england now for more than ten years and pitt had never seen her show more than a passing interest in politics nothing to suggest that she had ever been actively involved in them before or was now did nerissa suggest it perhaps she is trying to move suspicion away from herself to the only other person she could think of he said possibly narraway conceded but adriana was there at dorchester terrace the night serafina died and she was alone with her tucker confirmed that we will probably never know what serafina said that was the catalyst but she was rambling raking up all sorts of old memories in bits and pieces that made little sense we need to know a great deal more about adriana blantyres past and what serafina might have inadvertently given away about it im sorry i cant do it narraway went on a slight edge to his voice a selflacerating humor youll need to look at special branch records such as we have of old austrian and croatian plots things serafina might have been involved in or known about there isnt very much and i can tell you where its filed pitt was pleased not to see regret in narraways eyes or anything to suggest a sense of feeling excluded or isolated ill look he said quietly are we sure no one else could have been in the house not according to tucker but blantyre himself and tregarron were both there that week pitt stiffened tregarron whatever for to see serafina they would hardly have gone to see nerissa except as courtesy demanded at least on the surface the surface pitt raised his eyebrows there is still the question of nerissas lover narraway said drily so tregarron knew serafina pitt picked up the original thread or else he went because of the questions i asked him about duke alois presumably thank you narraway smiled and rose to his feet dont sidestep any part of this matter pitt he warned you need to have the truth whatever you decide to do about it pitt read all the files about the austrian oppression and revolts of the last forty years they were exactly where narraway had said they would be he learned very little of use except where to find a certain elderly gentleman named peter ffitch who had once served in special branch and had an encyclopedic memory he had retired twenty years earlier and was a widower now living quietly in a small village in oxfordshire pitt caught the next train and was in banbury just after lunchtime he then took a small branch line further into the country and after a stiff walk through the rain arrived at ffitchs steeply thatched house on a cobbled road off the main street the door was answered by a darkhaired woman of uncertain years a white apron tied over a plain brown skirt and blouse she looked at him with suspicion pitt introduced himself with proof of his identity and told her that it was extremely important that he speak with mr ffitch after some persuasion she admitted him ffitch must have been in his eighties with the mild features of a child and quite a lot of white hair only when pitt looked more closely into his eyes did he see the startling intelligence there and a spark of humor even pleasure at the prospect of being questioned at ffitchs request the woman mollified by his assurances brought them tea and a generous portion of cake and then left them alone well ffitch said with satisfaction it must be important to bring the new head of special branch all the way out here murder or high treason at the least how can i help he rubbed his hands together they were surprisingly strong hands not touched by age or rheumatism he reached forward and put several more pieces of coal on the fire as if settling in for the full afternoon what can i tell you pitt allowed himself to enjoy the cake and tea the cake was rich and full of fruit and the tea was hot he realized momentarily how long the train journey had seemed and how chilly the carriage had been he decided to tell ffitch the truth at least as far as serafina was concerned oh dear ffitch said when pitt was finished his seemingly bland face was filled with grief altering it completely what a sad way for such a marvelous woman to end but perhaps whoever killed her did not do her such a great disservice perhaps not pitt agreed but i still need to know who it was and why for justice ffitch said curiously because i need to know the players in this particular drama and what their ultimate goal is pitt corrected him there is very much on the table currently to win or lose well well ffitch smiled his body relaxing i am often reminded that not even the past is safe strange business we are in more than most people our old ghosts keep haunting us he frowned but you speak of present danger have some more tea and tell me what i can do thank you pitt accepted he glanced around the room ffitch may have lived in many countries but the room was english to the bone there were hogarth cartoon prints on the walls and leatherbound books on the five shelves on the far wall from what pitt could see they were mostly history and some of the great works of literature and commentary he saw the light flicker on the gold lettering of gibbons decline and fall of the roman empire and miltons paradise lost ffitch poured the tea and passed pitt back his cup serafina ffitch said thoughtfully i knew a lot about her but i only ever met her a few times he smiled the first was at a ball in berlin i remember it very well she was dressed in gold very soft like an evening sky still she looked like a tigress only temporarily made friendly by warmth and good food the smile of memory left his face the second was in a forest she came on horseback slim as a whip and lithe she dismounted easily and walked with such grace wearing trousers of course and carrying a pistol what is it you need to know if you are looking for whoever murdered her it could have been any of a hundred people for any of a hundred reasons now in pitt said skeptically ffitch bit his lip point taken sir no not now but some of those old victories and losses still matter at least to those who were involved it sounds as if youre looking for something that came to light only recently but from some old story looks like it pitt replied ffitch pursed his lips so something she remembered and let slip in her confusion of mind affects someone alive today so deeply that the betrayal of it still matters he nodded slowly interesting there were some bad things some treason against england in vienna but i never knew who was involved i tried very hard to find out because it was important quite a lot of information went from the british embassy to the austrians and it embarrassed us severely not being able to stop it was one of my worst failures he could not hide the distress in his face pitt hated embarrassing him but he pressed the matter further was it ever widely known within special branch ffitch looked at him bleakly no not when i retired if they had learned i like to think someone would have told me perhaps i delude myself as to either my own importance or the regard they had for me i doubt that pitt replied hoping it was true i think at least victor narraway would have spoken of it because if he had known he would not have agreed that it was good for me to come out here and trouble you now ah yes victor narraway always thought he would do well clever man ruthless in his own way wondered why he left would have thought he had many good years in him yet but i dont imagine youll tell me his eyes narrowed he looked at pitt closely quite openly assessing his ability and almost certainly also his nerve pitt waited taking another piece of cake ffitch sighed at last serafina might have known he said thoughtfully perhaps that was what she was afraid of he shook his head the firelight flushing his cheeks in her prime she could keep a secret better than the grave what a damn shame adriana blantyre pitt said softly ffitch blinked blantyre evan blantyre was young then but clever very clever always at the edge of things never in the middleat least thats how it looked from the outside what things pitt asked ffitch looked surprised plots to gain greater freedom from the austrian yoke what else italian plots croatian plots even the odd hungarian plot although most hungarians were willing enough to pay lip service to vienna and carry on with whatever they wanted to do in budapest not serafina certainly not you want to know about the ones that went badly wrong of course you do they all went wrong somehow most simply failed fizzled out or succeeded for a few months one or two ended really badly men shot before they could succeed tricked or trapped one way or another probably the best organized the bravest of the fighters was lazar dragovic fine man handsome funny a dreamer with intelligence and courage but he failed the conclusion was obvious ffitchs eyes were sad he was betrayed never knew by whom but yes he failed the rest of the people involved escaped but dragovic was summarily executed they beat him right there on the spot trying to get the names of the others but he died without telling them anything they put the gun to his head and shot him kneeling on the ground even so long after the misery of it pinched ffitchs face might serafina have known who betrayed him pitt asked quietly yes i suppose so but ive no idea why she wouldnt have done something about itshot whoever it was herself i would have she cared for dragovic perhaps more than for any of her other lovers if she knew and did nothing she must have had a devil of a good reason what sort of reason pitt asked ffitch considered for a few moments hard to think of one perhaps it wouldve affected the lives of others possibly several others a better revenge but serafina wasnt one to wait she wouldve taken whatever chance she could get at the time he turned and looked into the flames of the fire i did hear a storyi dont know if its truethat dragovics eightyearold daughter was there and saw her father executed they say serafina had to choose between going after the man who was behind dragovics betrayal or saving the child she did what she knew dragovic would have wanted which was of course saving the child he turned from the flames and looked at pitt eyes filled with sudden understanding the childs name was adrianaadriana dragovic the room was so quiet pitt heard the coals settle in the grate what did she look like he asked no idea but she had delicate health i dont even know if she lived pitt was already certain in his mind as to the answer she did he said quietly ffitch stared at him adriana blantyre i believe so but i will find out ffitch nodded and reached to pour them both a third cup of tea pitt looked through all the old records he could find dating back thirty years to the story of lazar dragovic his attempted uprising his betrayal and his death there was very little but it removed any doubt that adriana dragovic was his daughter and that she had later married evan blantyre there was also little room for doubt that it was serafina montserrat who had taken the child adriana from the scene of the execution and looked after her until she could be left with her grandparents what was conspicuously missing was any statement indicating who had betrayed dragovic to the austrians resulting in the failure of the uprising and dragovics own torture and murder had adriana found out who it was after all these years or had she listened to serafinas ramblings and imagined that she had learned the truth what damage had been done to her when she had seen her father killed what trust had been warped forever pitt had spent his professional life tearing the surface from secrets so well hidden that no one else had imagined them he had found scorching pain concealed by facades of a dozen sorts duty obedience faith sacrifice he had seen rage so silent that it had been completely overlooked until the dam burst and everyone in its path was destroyed all sorts of emotions can mask themselves as something else until they grow too unbearable that could be as true of adriana blantyre as of anyone pitt was too late getting home that evening to visit blantyre but he did so the following morning he could not afford to allow any more time to slip through his fingers he arrived at blantyres house early in case evan had intended to go anywhere other than to his office another development blantyre said with surprise when pitt was shown into his study he was busy answering correspondence notepaper and envelopes were stacked on the corner of the desk the cap was off the inkwell an elegant thing in the shape of a sleeping lion and there was a pen in his hand i apologize for disturbing you pitt began i assume it must be necessary blantyre put his pen down and recapped the ink something has happened more word of duke alois please sit and tell me he indicated a comfortable leatherpadded captains chair pitt obeyed it is the death of serafina montserrat that concerns me today he answered i dont know whether its connected to duke alois or not but i cant afford to assume that it isnt he hated having to tell blantyre this but there was no escape im afraid there is no question that she was murdered there is no other possible conclusion from the evidence he saw the surprise and dismay in blantyres face and dreaded the possibility that narraway was right was that why blantyre had seemed so protective of adriana because he knew she was so emotionally fragile that she could be capable of such a thing how does any man protect the woman he loves from the demons within herself blantyre was waiting his dark eyes searching pitts face the amount of laudanum in her body was far more than an accidental second dose could explain pitt went on knowing it was irrelevant i have to consider the possibility that she knew something that has bearing on the reasons for the attempt on duke alois and what she knew might tell us who is behind it blantyre nodded slowly of course poor serafina what a sad ending for such a brave and colorful woman he lifted his shoulders very slightly what can i tell you that would be useful if i had the faintest idea who was behind the attempt to assassinate duke alois i would have already told you i am still learning whatever i can but there are dozens of dissident groups of one sort or another within the austrian empire all of them are capable of violence i still dont know if alois is any more than he seems to be on the surface or if he is merely a pawn to be sacrificed in some cause we havent yet identifiedat least not specifically all i know is if it happens here no one will be able to cover it up or pass it off as an accident his expressive face reflected a sharp sad humor or a suicide he added are you suggesting that what happened at mayerling was a concealed murder pitt asked with surprise no blantyre did not hesitate i think they did what they could to keep it private perhaps mistakenly rudolf was always highstrung veering between elation and melancholy and his childhood was enough to turn anyone into a lunatic god knows his mother is eccentric to put it as gently as possible he grew up with literally dozens of tutors and no friends no parental support pitt did not interrupt blantyre spoke softly looking not at pitt but somewhere beyond him austrian politics are infinitely more complicated than ours the hungarians are afraid of both germany overtaking austria itself to their west and all the slavic parts of the empire backed of course by russia to the east the ottoman empire is falling apart and russia will surely pounce there wherever it can serbia and croatia could be the gateway to a slow erosion that will eventually eat into the heart of austria itself he smiled bleakly looking at pitt now and of course vienna is a hotbed of ideas about the socialism that is raging all over europe the ideas and philosophies that rudolf admired there was nothing of the autocrat in him he was a dreamer a man in love with the idealism of the future as he wanted it to be the ashes settled in the fire with a very slight sound but blantyre did not move to restoke it he was friendly with our own prince of wales he went on they were distantly related as most european royalty is but far more than that they were in extraordinarily similar positions like edward everything was expected of him but he seemed to be waiting for it indefinitely unlike edward he had a wife he couldnt abide cold critical boring but eminently suitable for a habsburg emperor and then he fell in love with marie vetsera pitt concluded no i think he just came to the end of the road blantyre said sadly there was nothing left for him to hope for he had syphilis among other things not a pleasant disease and of course incurable i have learned a great deal more about serafina montserrats past pitt said quietly wanting to turn the conversation back to the matter including her presence at the beating and execution of one lazar dragovic and her rescue of his eightyearold daughter adriana he saw blantyres face lose its color if any proof had been needed of adrianas identity the expression on blantyres face would have been sufficient apparently it is still not known who betrayed dragovic to the austrians he added unless of course serafina knew blantyre breathed in and out and swallowed his eyes met pitts without wavering but he did not speak in her rambling it is possible that serafina told adriana either directly pitt continued or enough in bits and pieces that adriana was able to piece it together and deduce the truth blantyre swallowed again with difficulty are you saying that adriana believed it was serafina who betrayed her father he asked why for gods sake serafina was an insurgent herself are you suggesting that she was secretly on the side of the austrians there was intense disbelief in his voice i dont know why pitt admitted it makes no political sense from what we know but there may be other elements that we know nothing about blantyre thought for several seconds personal he said at last perhaps pitt waited for him to say that dragovic and serafina had been lovers did blantyre know that if he had been involved in the uprisings himself on either side then he might or he might have deduced it from what others had said blantyres face twisted into a gesture of misery and contempt are you suggesting that they were once lovers and she took his rejection so bitterly that she was prepared to betray him and the cause to have her revenge i find that impossible to believe serafina had many lovers i never knew of her taking revenge for anything life was too short and sweet for that and dragovic was loyal to the cause pitt explored another line of thought blantyres eyes widened as far as i know but if he wasnt what has that to do with serafinas death now are you saying that she admitted to betraying him because he was a traitor himself thats nonsense no one would believe her dragovic was a hero everyone knew that he was willing to die rather than tell the austrians who else was involved there is no doubt about that because no one else was ever arrested i know that myself could he have been betrayed by one of serafinas other lovers out of jealousy over her pitt asked he hoped that was true it would remove suspicion from adriana and he wanted that very much for her sake for charlottes and above all for blantyre himself yes blantyre said slowly yes that makes more sense though god knows who someone who cares about their reputation enough to kill serafina in order to preserve it and is not only still alive but is here in london aware that serafina was rambling and could betray the truth accidentally pitt replied and of course the person would have to have had access to the house in dorchester terrace in order to poison serafina with laudanum that must restrict the possibilities to a very few indeed blantyre rubbed a hand across his face in a gesture of intense weariness he sighed nerissa freemarsh do you think so pitt asked with surprise she has a lover blantyre said though i doubt very much that you will get his name from her she is a a very desperate woman no family except serafina no husband no child such women can be very unpredictable he frowned pitt thought of lord tregarron and what tucker had told narraway about tregarrons visits to dorchester terrace he needed to know a great deal more about that absurd as it seemed what on earth could nerissa freemarsh offer a man in tregarrons position a hunger a need for his attention that perhaps his wife no longer had unquestioning praise a willingness to do anything he wished which again perhaps his wife would not maybe it was no more than simply a safe escape from pressure duty and fulfilling other peoples expectations the more he thought about it the more reasons there seemed to be had serafina somehow discovered that and raised a fierce objection considering her own past it would surely not be on moral grounds possibly a concern for nerissas reputation and the damage such an affair would do to it if discovered nerissa might misinterpret whatever serafina said as a moral judgment even a condemnation if she loved tregarron she would see it as her aunt ruining her last chance for love apparently lord tregarron called to see mrs montserrat blantyre stiffened tregarron are you sure yes there was no avoiding it any longer and mrs blantyre visited her often but you know that they have been in touch on and off since that time blantyre said quietly and the death of adrianas father is never spoken of i dont know how much adriana remembers i hope very little just confusion and pain and then of course the loss her mother was also dead serafina had no time for a child especially one with extremely delicate health adriana lived with her grandparents until i met her she was nineteen then and the most beautiful girl i had ever seen the shadow of tragedy gave her a haunting quality a depth other women did not have blantyre continued i would be grateful to you if you did not mention that time to her unless it is absolutely necessary for the safety of the country i can promise you that if she knew anything about duke alois or about tregarron for that matter she would have already told me and i would have told you of course i wont mention it pitt promised unless my hand is forcedand i can see no reason that should be but i may have to ask her about her visit to dorchester terrace on the night mrs montserrat died in case she saw or heard anything that can shed light on her death then you will do so when i am present it was said gently but it was not a request the power in blantyres voice the force of his emotion filled the room as long as you will not cause delays i cannot afford pitt agreed of course blantyre smiled very slightly but there was a warmth in it thank you i am obliged charlotte had had a delightful day with adriana their friendship had become much easier and more fluid and they laughed together often over the amusing and the absurd today they had been to an afternoon soiree the singing had been very pleasant but agonizingly serious they had looked at each other in the middle of the performance and had been forced to stifle giggles and pretend a sudden fit of sneezing had attacked them an elderly lady of a very sentimental nature had been concerned for adriana and she had then been obliged to pretend she had suffered an unfortunate reaction to some lilies charlotte had come to her rescue with a long and totally fictitious story about lilies at a funeral affecting her the same way she had added to the verisimilitude of it by weeping and everyone had praised her good nature and gentleness of heartqualities she was perfectly sure she did not possess as she admitted to adriana later she had accepted the elderly ladys admiration with a straight face and she and adriana had excused themselves hastily before they burst into giggles charlotte had arrived home still smiling she found minnie maude in the kitchen clearing away tea after daniel and jemima there was a pile of crusts on the plate she whisked them away very quickly when she heard charlottes footsteps swinging around to hide them with her body her eyes widened you do look lovely maam she said sincerely you should get another dress that same color of goldybrown theres not many as can wear that thank you charlotte said but in her head she was wondering why minnie maude was not making the children eat their crusts she would let it go today it would seem churlish to make an issue of a small thing after such a nice compliment but next time she would have to say something i shall be down for dinner but i must change out of this gown it is rather too much for the parlor i think she laughed and turned to leave can i elp yer maam minnie maude offered them back buttons any rate thank you that would be a good idea charlotte turned and allowed minnie maude to undo the top half dozen or so at the back of her neck then she started for the door again she had reached the bottom of the stairs when she recalled that she had not asked minnie maude to set the table in the dining room as she turned back she saw minnie whisk into the cellar with what looked like the dish of crusts in her hand she went up the stairs slowly was she not giving minnie maude enough to eat the girl should not have to pick at crusts there was plenty of food in the house and she was more than welcome to have as much as she wished she had settled in so well charlotte thought in the way she performed her duties and with her extremely agreeable nature she should make time to look into the matter more carefully but when pitt came home he was clearly worried and for the first time since the present case began he wished to talk to her about it after supper when they retired to the parlor she had barely begun to tell him about the soiree when he interrupted her you know adriana quite well now you must talk to each other about many things does she ever mention serafina montserrat he asked she saw the earnestness in his face this was not a question of polite interest only briefly she replied trying to read his expression she was very saddened by her decline and her death of course why are you asking thomas i need to know that means it has something to do with special branch the deduction was obvious so serafina knew something of great importance after all she was so used to asking questions that the old habit asserted itself before she could think she realized it too late im sorry i didnt mean to pry he smiled not at all charlotte i asked you in the first place i need to understand adriana a great deal more than i do who better to ask than you and i cannot expect you to give me the answers i need if i dont tell you what the questions are his eyes were gentle and there was an oblique humor in his face but she heard the emotion in his voice adriana was somehow tied into the case and he could not tell her about the issue that kept him at work late into the evenings and stopped him from sleeping through the night what do you need to know about her she asked she talks quite freely now i hate breaking confidences but you wouldnt ask if it was not necessary do you know when she first met serafina montserrat charlotte thought back to their conversations no she speaks as if she has known her as long as she can remember as a child yes i think their encounter was brief and at a time very painful to adriana they met again after adriana was married but i dont think she ever knew her as well as she did in the last few months why he ignored the question what does she say of her father charlotte felt increasingly uneasy quite a lot not so much directly but she mentions him in passing she adored him and she had already lost her mother when he died he seems to have been brave funny kind and very clever and to have been devoted to her he died when she was eight she still misses him terribly i suppose when you lose someone when youre that young you tend to idealize them a little but if even half of what she recalls is true he was a fine man certainly they were very close pitts face was bleak his lips pressed close together for a moment the sorrow his face showed worried her he was he answered his name was lazar dragovic he was a fighter for croatian freedom from austrian rule he was the leader of a spectacular plot which failed because he was betrayed by one of the conspirators all of the others escaped but he didnt he was beaten and then shot because he would not give away the names of the others involved charlotte was stunned even though she had known from the way adriana had spoken of it that her fathers death had been tragic im sorry thats terrible but it was thirty years ago and in austria why does it matter to special branch now serafina was there she rescued adriana from the scene he said simply adriana saw it charlottes stomach lurched and knotted inside her she thought of jemima at eight her face soft and innocent her eyes unafraid she ached to reach back in time and protect the child adriana had been pitt nodded it was serafina who took her away she left adriana with grandparents charlotte had known pitt long enough to make the leap of deduction did serafina know who betrayed adrianas father is that what you are afraid of she knew and she told adriana whether she meant to or not what im afraid of is that adriana thought that serafina herself did he admitted charlotte sat frozen in her seat she could see now why pitt had looked so wretched you think adriana killed her out of revenge she asked softly the poor old woman was dying anyway she wouldnt do such a thing thats horrible her fathers death was horrible charlotte he pointed out he was betrayed by his own andworse than thatfrom what my informant told me serafina and dragovic were lovers thats the worst kind of betrayal he was beaten and killed in front of his child i think that warrants final revenge she thought of her own father edward ellison she knew him only as a rather stern man affectionate but without the passion she believed was required in a revolutionary a man prepared to suffer appallingly in order to change an injustice but then how well had she known her father as a human being she had taken him for granted he was always there calm at the head of the table in the evenings walking to church on sundays sitting by the fire with his legs crossed and a newspaper spread open he represented safety the comfortable unchanging part of life the things you miss only when suddenly they are not there anymore adriana had lost that part of her life when she was only a child and in a horrible way soaked in blood and pain right in front of her yes she said softly i suppose i can imagine it easily enough but did adriana think it was serafina who betrayed her father pitt persisted she cant have known until very recently revenge like that is not content to wait thirty years think back was there a time when you could see a change in her did she speak of serafina at all even a chance remark in passing a change in attitude a shock of any sort she can hardly have learned something like that without it affecting her profoundly they sat still for several moments pitt glanced at the fire and put more coal on it there was no sound from the rest of the house charlotte went over every meeting in her mind and recalled nothing im sorry she meant it she was torn in her affection for adriana but she wanted to help pitt find the truth she didnt speak of serafina often and she didnt show any intense reaction to her at all except pity honestly thomas i dont think she remembers serafina as part of her fathers death pitt did not immediately reply are you certain she would remember any details about it after this length of time even if she knew them then she asked softly and if so wouldnt she have seen the fear in serafina the fact that she was helpless and slowly losing her mind as a far better revenge than a quick way out falling asleep painlessly in her own bed and never waking up possibly pitt admitted but im not adriana charlotte thought for several moments recalling every time she had seen adriana from the first meeting at the musical performance through the afternoons they had spent together talking laughing each sharing with the other memories of things that had mattered to them she did not believe adriana could have murdered an old woman whatever she might have been guilty of in the past she looked up at pitt i dont know im sorry i dont believe it but thats because i like her and i dont want to believe it but i know people who plan murder dont wear it in their faces before or after if they did we wouldnt need detectives we would all be able to solve crimes very easily i seem to remember that you were rather good at solving crimes he observed out of practice she replied ruefully i dont want to spy on adriana but ill try thank you he reached forward and held out his hand palm open she placed her hand in his and he closed it gently charlotte was in the kitchen a couple of hours later when the telephone rang in the hall she went to answer it emily was put through charlotte her voice was a little tentative how are you it was unquestionably time to accept peace even if she had no idea what had prompted it had jack said something to her she would not ask it did not matter at all im very well if a little tired of the cold charlotte replied how are you oh well i went to the theater yesterday evening and saw a new play it was very entertaining i though perhaps we could go see it together i think you might enjoy it that is if you and thomas have time there was a note of uncertainty in her voice that was out of character for her im sure we can make time charlotte answered it is very good to take ones mind from anxieties for a while i imagine it will run for another few weeks at the very least oh the disappointment was sharp in emilys voice now clearly she had hoped they would meet sooner and now she feared this was a rebuff yes im sure it will the silence was heavy how much could charlotte say without breaking thomass trust in her discretion but even if thomas cannot come at the moment i would like to she said quickly it seems to be one of those plays worth seeing more than once i can always take him to see it later she heard emily breathe in quickly yes yes it is just that type of play the bridge had been created good she went on aloud because thomas is so busy at the moment he is often away from home late into the evening thank goodness minnie maude is working out so well dont you miss gracie emily asked yes of course but im also happy for her they talked for a few moments about trivial things the latest word from gracie in her new home china she had bought and been proud to show charlotte none of the conversation mattered in the slightest but as they spoke charlotte became more and more certain that emily was afraid of something charlotte wanted to ask her outright but their newfound peace was still far too delicate for that so she ended the conversation cheerfully with a silly story about a mutual acquaintance she had emily laughing before she replaced the receiver on its hook after dinner when daniel and jemima had gone to bed charlotte told pitt about the call it was emily who telephoned me earlier while you were in your study she began she was very agreeable we didnt discuss our differences at all she didnt mention jack she went on not that she does always but dont look at me with that patient expression i think shes worried even frightened thomas does this thing you are investigating really have anything to do with jack is he making some kind of mistake i dont know he said quietly and im not being oblique i just really dont would you tell me if you did she asked uncertain what answer she wanted to hear he smiled he knew her so very well no then you would feel guilty because you wouldnt be able to warn emily better she blame me thomas charlotte i dont know he repeated i really dont perhaps i am the one who is mistaken and im not even sure what about you can tell emily we dont know anything and do it with a clear conscience she made herself smile and saw the relief in his eyes they laughed together but it was a little shaky they were too much aware of what could not be said stoker was pacing back and forth in pitts office his hands pushed hard into his pockets his outdoor scarf still wound around his neck the windowsill behind him was white with a dusting of snow and flakes were drifting past almost invisible against a flat leaden sky the street sweeper is staum all right he said stopping and facing pitt ive seen a photograph of him now what happened to the previous sweeper pitt asked took a vacation stoker replied came in and told the office hed come into a little money from some relative whod died and he was going away for a while staum was the first person to apply for the job and no one else showed up within a day or two so they gave it to him dont know what money changed hands he pulled his face into an expression of disgust might not have taken much he winced on the other hand i suppose from what i know of staum he wouldnt shrink from killing the man if it was necessary pitt felt the heaviness settle inside him then we can expect an attack in dover itself but i dont dare take men away from the signals and points just in case he slumped against his chair the dust cart was a brilliant idea he can wheel the thing anywhere and no onell be surprised or suspicious wear dirty clothes a cap keep his face down and hes practically invisible are we going to tell the local police stoker asked not yet once they know itll be public in hours they wont be able to hide it everyones behavior will be different and a man of staums skill will be watching for that hell change plans stokers face tightened a small muscle in his jaw flickered i know pitt said quietly and i still cant find out anything more useful about duke alois they say he has a nice very dry sense of humor and hes very fond of music especially the heavier sort of german stuff beethovens last works doesnt make any sense stoker was unhappy weve missed something perhaps thats the point pitt replied thoughtfully you cant guard against what you cant understand or foresee i want to arrest staum any reason at all but i know we need to have him where we can see him in case he leads us to other conspirators stoker said miserably his voice edged with anger yes we do pitt agreed sharply sitting up straight suddenly watch him hes probably too clever to give anything away but if he doesnt know were onto him he may slip up contact someone and then on the other hand he may know very well that were watching him and keep our attention from whats really happening stoker hunched his shoulders i want to get this man pitt smiled bleakly so do i but its second place to getting alois in and out of britain safely yes sir this time pitt was granted fifteen minutes with the prime minister without any difficulty he did not waste any of it anything further salisbury asked standing with his back to the fire his long face grave his fluff of white hair standing on end yes my lord pitt replied we know who is in place in dover and along the railway line but we dont know where they intend to strike some of the men are definitely decoys salisbury sighed what a bloody mess anything good in it at all such as who is behind it and why why duke alois and why here in england the more i learn about duke alois the more i believe he is of no tactical value himself salisburys eyebrows rose but he smiled really his expression gave nothing away but the amusement in his eyes conveyed his opinion of minor royal dukes europe was teeming with distant relatives to queen victoria and at one time or another he had had dealings with most of them so he would be an incidental victim he said yes sir most anarchists victims are one persons blood is as good as anothers to protest with as long as it isnt your own salisbury added a little acidly for some pitt agreed for others thats all part of it dying for the cause god almighty how do we fight madmen carefully pitt shrugged with knowledge observation and keeping in mind that they are mad so dont look for sanity in their intentions what do they actually want do you know im not sure that even they know what they want pitt answered except change they all want change so they can be the ones with power money and privilege it was a conclusion rather than a question probably yes but they are not thinking things through if they were theyd know that sporadic assassinations have never achieved social change if they kill duke alois theyll make him out to be a martyr and theyll make us out to be incompetent fools salisbury said bitterly which is probably what they are really after duke alois is just the means to an end poor devil yes sir as they see it to the greater good stop them pitt if they win not just britain but all civilized mankind is the loser we cant be held ransom to fear like this pitt decided to try one last time though he was fairly certain what salisbury would say are you sure there is no point in letting him know how serious the threat is and asking him to come at another time yes im quite sure salisbury replied pitt drew in his breath to argue but decided against it salisbury looked at him wearily im sure because i have already tried he insists he will be perfectly safe in your hands yes sir pitt replied his mind using many different and far less civil words salisbury smiled quite he said grimly charlotte was in the hall about to pick up the ringing telephone when she saw minnie maude come out of the cellar door and catch sight of her minnie maude colored unhappily brushed something off her arms gave a brief smile and turned away charlotte ignored the telephone something was troubling the girl and it was time charlotte learned what it was she followed minnie maude into the kitchen she was standing at the sink with a string of onions on the counter and a knife in her hand she had cut into the first onion and the pungent scent already filled the air the table was completely cleared away the dishes washed and dried and back on the dresser an uneaten slice of toast had disappeared was that why minnie maude had been in the cellar to eat it herself had she grown up in such poverty that food was still so treasured that she felt compelled to take scraps in secret minnie maude charlotte spoke gently minnie maude turned around her eyes were red perhaps from the onion but she looked afraid charlotte felt a tug of pity and of guilt the girl was only four or five years older than jemima and would possibly spend the rest of her life as a servant in someone elses home with only one room she could call her own and in their house she was the only resident servant so there was not even anyone else to befriend she knew she was replacing gracie who had been so beloved the loneliness the constant effort to be good enough must be a heavy burden at times and yet she had nowhere to go to escape it except the cellar minnie maude charlotte said again this time smiling i think it would be a good idea if you toasted some teacakes i know we have some lets have them hotbuttered with a cup of tea perhaps in half an hour you work hard a break would be nice for both of us minnie maudes shoulders relaxed yes maam ill toast em then clearly she had been expecting charlotte to say something else are you getting enough to eat minnie maude charlotte asked you may have as much as you wish you know if necessary please cook more and help yourself we have no need to restrain ourselves just dont waste it she smiled we have had our difficult times in the past and it is good not to forget them but now there is more than enough for you to eat as you like im im fine maam minnie maudes face colored pink with embarrassment but she said nothing more very slowly uncertain whether she had permission she turned back to continue cutting the onions charlotte knew she had not arrived at the truth perhaps the trips to the cellar had nothing to do with food maybe minnie maude just wanted to be alone that made no sense the cellar was cold minnie maude had a perfectly good bedroom upstairs which was properly furnished and warm the problem was something else temporarily defeated she went back to the hall she was almost beside the telephone when it rang she picked it off its hook and answered and adriana blantyre was put through her voice was a little altered by the machine but still perfectly recognizable with its huskiness and very slight accent how are you adriana asked i am sorry to call you so hastily this is all most improper but there is an exhibition in a private gallery that i am very eager to see and i thought you might enjoy it too have you ever heard of heinrich schliemann of course charlotte said quickly he discovered the ruins of troy through his love of homer he died a few years ago is something of his work on display it was not difficult to sound enthusiastic it was the perfect opening for her to see adriana again and perhaps learn something of the evidence pitt needed she hoped fervently that she could help prove adriana innocent yes adriana replied instantly excitement lifting her voice i only just heard of it ive canceled my other engagements and im going but it would be so much more fun if you were to come with me please dont feel obliged but if you can i can we shall make a journey through time and for a few hours today will disappear where shall we meet i shall come for you in my carriage in an hour is that too early no not at all i assure you i have nothing more pressing to do and anything else that arises can wait then i shall see you in an hour goodbye charlotte replaced the receiver she would tell minnie maude where she was going and then change into the smartest morning dress she had and prepare to be charming friendly and intelligent andif she found out a difficult truthbetray her friend to pitt she sat in front of her bedroom mirror but found it difficult to face her reflection she despised what she was about to do and yet she could see no alternative except refusing to help pitt which wasnt an alternative at all someone had murdered serafina lying frightened and alone in her bed terrified of the darkness that was closing in on her mind robbing her of everything she had been betraying her in a way against which there was no defense all she could hope was that her discoveries would prove adriana innocent not guilty as soon as they entered the doors of the exhibition the past seemed to close in around them and whisk them away the whole display was as much about schliemann himself as the objects he had discovered he had died in naples the day after christmas in but his energy and the power of his dreams filled the gallery a large portrait of him hung at the entrance a balding man with spectacles wearing a neat formal suit with a highbuttoned waistcoat he looked to be in his late fifties or early sixties thats not how i imagined him adriana said with a little shrug he should be fierce and magnificent a man who would not have been out of place at the time when troy still lived charlotte smiled just dont let us find out that helen of troy was really quite plain i couldnt bear it adriana laughed they burned the topless towers of ilium for her so the poets tell us her eye caught another portrait on the wall a few yards away it showed a darkhaired woman quite young wearing a gorgeous headdress with long trailing pieces at the ears and also a heavy necklace comprised of fifteen or more strands of gold charlotte walked over to it adriana immediately behind her shes rather beautiful charlotte said regarding her closely she read the inscription below sophie schliemann wearing the treasures discovered at hisarlik said to be the jewels of helen of troy she turned to adriana i wonder what helen was really like i cant imagine anyone being so beautiful that a whole city and all its people were ruined because of it not to mention the elevenyear war and all the death and despair it brought is any love worth that no adriana said without hesitation but i have often wondered about the connection between love and beauty to marry a woman because of the way she looks when you do not care about who she is inside that shell is no more than acquiring a work of art for the pleasure it gives you to look at it or to exhibit it to others if she is not a companion to you one with whom you share your dreams your laughter and pain is that not like buying food you cannot eat adrianas face was quite calm the skin unblemished across its perfect bones her eyes fathomless charlotte was left speechless such a life would be terribly empty was that how blantyre felt about adriana that she was a fragile exquisite possession what would he feel when the first lines appeared when the bloom faded from her cheeks when her hair thinned and turned gray when she no longer moved with such grace charlotte had always secretly wanted to be beautiful not merely handsome as she was but possessed of the kind of beauty that dazzles the kind aunt vespasia had had now she was almost dizzy with gratitude that she looked as she did pitt was not only her husband he was also the dearest most intimate friend she had ever had closer than emily or anyone else collecting herself she replied poor helen do you suppose that is all it was a squabble over possessions that a whole nation paid for no adriana shook her head the classical greek idea of beauty was as much about the mind as the face she must have been wise and honest and brave as well and gentle charlotte continued do you think that she had a wild and vivid sense of humor as well and that she was quick to forgive and generous of spirit adriana laughed yes and no wonder they burned troy for her im surprised it wasnt the whole of asia minor lets look at the rest of this she touched charlottes arm and they moved forward together marveling at the ornaments the golden masks the photographs of the ruins the walls that must once have kept out the armies of agamemnon and the heroes of legend how much of it do you think is true charlotte said after several minutes of silence she must not waste this opportunity to try to learn some information that could help thomas do you think they felt all the same things we do envy fear the hunger for revenge for wrongs we cant forget adriana turned from the photographs she was looking at and faced her of course dont you a flicker of fear crossed her face those things never change charlotte racked her brain for something relevant that could continue the conversation agamemnon killed his daughter didnt he a sacrifice to the gods to make the winds turn in his favor and carry his armies to troy and when he came home again eleven years later his wife killed him for it yes adriana agreed i can understand that mind she had married his brother in the meantime so there were a lot of different emotions there and then her son killed her and on and on it was a pretty nasty mess revenge often is charlotte said with a sudden change of tone as if they were speaking of something present adriana looked at her curiously you say that as if they were people you knew arent all good stories really about people we know adriana thought for a moment i suppose they are she gave a sudden brilliant smile i knew coming here with you would be more fun than with anyone else can you spare time to have luncheon as well there is a most excellent place near here where the chef is croatian i would like you to taste a little of the food from my country it is not so very different you will not find it too strong or too heavy i would be delighted charlotte said sincerely i know so very little about croatia i wish you would tell me more that is a dangerous request adriana said happily you may wish you had never asked stop me when it gets dark and you have to go home charlotte felt the guilt well up inside her but it was too late to turn back i will she promised now let us see the end of what mr schliemann found in troy and mycenae did you know he spoke thirteen different languages adriana asked he wrote in his diary in the language of whatever country he was in english french dutch spanish portuguese swedish italian greek latin russian arabic and turkish and german of course he was german her face was animated with excitement and admiration he actually wrote a paper on troy in ancient greek she went on he was an extraordinary man he made and spent at least two fortunes he named his children andromache and agamemnon he allowed them to be baptized but placed a copy of the iliad on their heads at the time and recited a hundred hexameters of it wouldnt life be so much emptier without the worlds eccentrics she was laughing as she said it but there was a ring of passion in her voice and a vividness in her face that lent her the sort of beauty that made others in the room turn to look at her as if she might for an instant have been helen herself charlotte thought back to the intensity of the emotion she had seen in blantyres face when he looked at adriana the protection the pride something that could have been lingering amazement that she should have chosen him when she had had perhaps a dozen suitors a score how much did her beauty matter to him would he still have loved her had she been ordinary to look at how much was her vulnerability and his need to protect her a part of his feelings for her charlotte knew she had to learn more about croatia about the past there about adrianas fathers death and above all about serafina montserrat they finished the tour of the exhibit and adrianas carriage took them to luncheon at the restaurant she had spoken of she was eager to share everything about her country and the culture with which she had grown up youll enjoy this she said as each new dish was brought i used to like this when i was a child my grandmother showed me how it was made and this was always one of my favorites it is mostly rice with tiny little shellfish and very delicate herbs the art is in cooking it to just the right tenderness and being careful with the seasoning too strong and it is horrible do the croatians eat a lot of fish charlotte asked yes i dont know why except that its easy to cook and not very expensive and like us you have a long coastline charlotte added adriana gazed at some vision inside her own mind ah she let out a sigh beautiful as england is youve never seen a shore like ours the air is warm and the sky seems so high with tiny drifting clouds in wonderful shapes delicate like feathers and bright the sand is pale no shingle and the water is colors you wouldnt believe charlotte tried to see it in her mind she pictured blue water bright in the sun warmth that seeped through the skin to the bones she found that she was smiling croatia is very old adriana went on not older than england of course we became part of the roman empire in ad and we had greek colonies before that in ad the roman emperor diocletian built a palace in split the very last emperor julius nepos ruled from there until he was killed in ad you see we too have great roman ruins she said it with pride our first king tomislav was crowned in ad she stopped and pulled her face into an expression of resignation in we entered a union with hungary that would be after you were conquered by william of normandy then in we chose a habsburg king and i suppose that was the beginning of the end at least that is what my father used to say pain laced through her voice and was apparent in her eyes she looked down quickly that was about the time of your queen elizabeth wasnt it yes yes it was charlotte said quickly struggling to remember elizabeth had died around so it must be close she felt brutal but she had no better chance than this she might betray adrianas guilt but on the other hand she might prove her innocence that would be infinitely worth all her efforts and discomfort the second course was a white fish baked in vine leaves with vegetables charlotte was unfamiliar with she tried them tentatively at first then aware that adriana was watching her with more relish their time was slipping away she must introduce the subject of serafina how could she do it without being appallingly clumsy i wish i could travel she said not knowing where that subject might lead you must miss your home i mean the one where you grew up adriana smiled with an edge of sadness sometimes she admitted do you know other people who have lived there beside mr blantyre of course not many im afraid perhaps i should seek a little harder but it seems so forced charlotte took a deep breath did you know mrs montserrat who died recently she lived in croatia once i believe adriana looked surprised did you know her you never mentioned it before her voice dropped poor serafina that was a terrible way to die charlotte struggled to keep from contradicting herself and letting too much of the truth into her questions was it she affected ignorance i know very little im sorry if i gave the impression that i knew her myself she was a great friend of my aunt vespasialady vespasia cumminggould lady vespasia is your aunt adriana asked with delight actually she is my sisters greataunt by marriage to her first husband but we hold her in higher regard and affection than any other relative we have so would i adriana agreed she is quite marvelous charlotte could not afford to let the conversation slide away from serafina im so sorry about mrs montserrat aunt vespasia said she died quite peacefully at least i thought that was what she said was i not listening properly or was she no aunt vespasia would never circle around the truth to make it meaningless adriana looked down at the table no she wouldnt she was a fighter for freedom too i believe like mrs montserrat charlotte agreed they knew each other long ago aunt vespasia said mrs montserrat was very braveand outspoken in her beliefs adriana smiled yes she was i remember her laughter and her singing she had a lovely voice she struggled for a moment trying to catch her breath and steady her voice before going on my father used to say she was the bravest of them all sometimes she succeeded just because no one expected a woman to ride all night through the forest and then be able to think clearly by daylight and even hold a gun steady and shoot he said tears filled her eyes and ran down her cheeks blindly she fumbled in her bag for a handkerchief finally finding it and blowing her nose gently there is no need to apologize charlotte assured her the loss of your father must have been terrible and i know that you still miss him very much did you say that serafina was there when he died adriana was surprised yes i i must have i dont talk about it because it always makes me lose my composure i apologize this is ridiculous everyone must be looking at me lots of people were looking at you anyway charlotte responded with a smile men look at beautiful women with pleasure women with envy and if they are stylish as well to see what they might copy or to see if they can find a flaw if they are particularly catty then i will have satisfied them adriana said wryly nonsense there is nothing wrong with a tender heart charlotte assured her she was losing her grip on the conversation did mrs montserrat talk to you about your father that must have been sweet as well as painful for you to have someone to remember with who could tell you stories of his courage or just the little things he liked and disliked adrianas eyes softened yes she told me about his love of history and how he could tell all the old tales of the medieval heroes porga who went to the byzantine emperor heraclius and had the pope send christian missionaries to the croatian provinces in ad and duke branimir and on and on serafina knew all their names and what they did even though she was italian she enabled me to recall the stories he told me when i had only bits of them in my mind charlotte tried to imagine adriana sitting beside serafinas bed waiting patiently as the old woman salvaged fragments from her wandering mind and pieced them together bringing back for a brief moment the presence of her beloved father did she remember that she had seen him beaten covered in his own blood and then forced to his knees and shot in the back of the head the sight of faces distorted with rage the gleam of light on gun barrels the cries of terror and pain then the stillness and the smell of gun smoke and then serafina coming grasping her holding her hurrying her away perhaps on horseback on the saddle in front of her as she rode like a wild thing to escape to protect the child adriana looking at her now so exquisitely dressed her skin paper white charlotte could see that the demons were still in her eyes if serafina had let something slip been careless in even a couple of words had she led adriana to believe that it was she who had betrayed lazar dragovic or had she given the name of someone else who had im so sorry shes gone she said to adriana but aunt vespasia told me it was peaceful as if she had taken much laudanum and simply gone to sleep was that enough it was a lie of course it was pitt who had told her but it was unimportant adriana stared at her would a double dose of laudanum kill you charlotte hesitated what should she say should she evade the truth or tell it and see how adriana reacted she had to know pitts case might rest on it no she answered levelly i believe it takes far more than that several times a single dose everyone else in the restaurant seemed as if they were moving in slow motion as adriana stared at charlotte she started to speak but her mouth was so dry her voice faltered she tried again several times charlotte nodded apparently then adriana did not finish the sentence but it was not necessary they both knew what the end was im sorry charlotte said softly perhaps i should not have told you would a lie or at least an evasion have been better no adriana sat motionless for a few more moments im sorry i cant eat any more i think i need to go home do you know who gave it to her was it nerissa freemarsh do you think serafina was so distressed by her failing memory her mind she did not complete the train of thought i dont know charlotte said honestly it might be considered an act of mercy by some but the law would regard it as murder all the same perhaps she took it herself adriana said desperately charlotte knew that was not possible care had been taken to prevent that but perhaps this was not the time to say so perhaps she agreed she was terribly afraid of being indiscreet and letting slip old secrets that might cause harm to someone who is still alive and vulnerable i have no idea who that could be or indeed if there even is such a person do you know no she said nothing about anyone to me i cant think of a person adriana spoke hesitantly as if she was raking her memory for anything serafina might have said no one at all charlotte pressed was she being deliberately and pointlessly cruel well serafina knew lord tregarron adriana said tentatively quite well it seemed from the way she spoke of it charlotte was puzzled there had been the faintest flicker of amusement in adrianas eyes gone again the next instant tregarron was at least twentyfive years younger than serafina if not more thirtyfive years ago that might have mattered less but then he would have been very young no more than a boy and she in her late thirties that was ridiculous adriana must be mistaken could it have been someone else whose name sounded like his she suggested someone austrian or hungarian for example no it was tregarron adriana insisted he visited her at dorchester terrace then she could not have known him far in the past no i must have misunderstood that adriana looked at charlottes plate and the unfinished dessert oh ive had sufficient charlotte said quickly let us go it was a delicious meal i shall have to eat croatian food again i had no idea it was so very good thank you for all youve shown me and for the pleasure of your company adriana smiled her composure almost returned didnt your lord byron say that happiness was born a twin pleasures tasted alone lose half their savor let us go and find the carriage charlotte arrived home in the middle of the afternoon a trifle earlier than she had expected she had much more information to give pitt but no conclusions other than the growing certainty in her own mind that serafina had known who had betrayed lazar dragovic but for some reason had never spoken of it to anyone was that the secret she had been so afraid of letting slip it made sense at least to adriana dragovic it still mattered passionately and serafina had always tried to protect adriana whether out of love for lazar or simply human decency she would have known what that knowledge would do to adriana charlotte walked down the hall to the kitchen it was too early for daniel and jemima to be home from school but she was surprised to find the kitchen empty minnie maude was not in the scullery either nor was she in the dining room or the parlor could she be out shopping most of the household goods they required were delivered and those that needed to be bought in person were bought in the morning charlotte went up the stairs and looked for minnie maude without finding her now she was worried she even looked in the back garden to see if she could have tripped and been hurt she knew even as she did it that the thought was absurd unless minnie was unconscious she would have made her way back into the house even if she had been injured she must be in the cellar it was the only place left but charlotte had been home a quarter of an hour why on earth would minnie maude be in the cellar for that length of time there was nothing down there that could take so long to collect and it would be perishing cold she opened the door the light was onshe could see its dim glow from the top step had minnie maude slipped and fallen here she went down quickly now holding on to the handrail minnie maude was sitting on a cushion in the corner a blanket wrapped around her and in her arms was a small dirty and extremely scruffy little dog with a red ribbon around its neck minnie maude and the puppy both looked up at her with wide frightened eyes charlotte took a deep breath for goodness sake bring it upstairs into the kitchen she said trying to keep the overwhelming emotion inside her under some kind of control relief pity a drowning comprehension of minnie maudes loneliness and all the conflicting feelings for adriana and for serafina everything to do with need and loss churned in her mind and wash it she went on its filthy i suppose one cant expect it not to be living in the coal cellar minnie maude climbed to her feet slowly still holding the dog youd better give it some dinner charlotte added something warm its very young by the look of it are you going to put it out minnie maudes face was white with fear and she held the animal so tightly it started squirming around i daresay the cats wont like it charlotte replied obliquely but theyll just have to get used to it well find it a basket wash it in the scullery sink or youll have coal dust all over the place minnie maude took a long shuddering breath and her face filled with hope charlotte turned away to go up the stairs she did not want minnie maude to think she could get away with absolutely anything does it have a name she asked huskily uffie minnie maude said but you can change it if you want to uffie seems perfectly good to me charlotte replied bring her or is it him upstairs and dont put her down until you get to the scullery or youll spend the rest of the day getting coal dust out of the carpets and well all have no dinner ill carry er ter the kitchen minnie maude promised fervently an ill see she dont make a mess anywhere i promise shes ever so good she wont be charlotte thought not when shes warm enough and properly fed and realizes she can stay but maybe that is better shes your responsibility she warned as she held the cellar door open minnie maude walked through into the hall still holding the dog close to her her face shining with happiness when pitt returned home late and tired charlotte told him very briefly about the dog not as a question but simply so he would not be surprised when he found the little animal in the scullery daniel and jemima had both fallen instantly in love with it so no further decision could really be made in the evening alone with the parlor fire dying down and the embers settling in the hearth charlotte told pitt what she had learned from adriana are you sure she said tregarron he asked sitting a little forward in his chair yes but of course im not sure that is what serafina said or if it was that it was who she actually meant but i believe that serafina knew who betrayed lazar dragovic and that whether she meant to tell her or not somehow adriana realized who it was too well it couldnt have been tregarron pitt said reasonably he was too young to have been involved at all and was here in england at boarding school anyway he would have been about fourteen at the time and why would adriana have killed serafina even if serafina did tell her who would she be protecting that doesnt make any sense yes it does charlotte spoke so quickly her voice was almost lost in the crackle from the fire as another log fell apart in a shower of sparks it makes sense if it was serafina herself who betrayed dragovic serafina he was startled but she was on the same side as him and she rescued adriana my sources say she and dragovic were lovers at least for a while thomas dont be so naive charlotte said the most passionate lovers also make the bitterest enemies at times and who knows now or even then if they were really lovers perhaps either one of them was only using the other he started to argue but they were both fighting for the same he trailed off balkan politics are not so simple she said at least that is what i hear from those who know and love affairs hardly ever are he smiled with a flicker of ironic humor at least that is what you hear from those who know she blushed very slightly yes do you think adriana believed that serafina betrayed her father he asked all humor vanished i think its more likely than nerissa freemarsh murdering her aunt out of frustration because she didnt die quickly enough she said quietly and tregarron he asked what was he doing at dorchester terrace i dont know she admitted perhaps trying to make sure that serafina didnt tell any more secrets in her confused state ones we dont even know about they would be old but perhaps still embarrassing hes responsible for a lot of the british relations with the austrian empire and the countries around its borders maybe poland ukraine or the ottoman empire even if the people concerned are dead or out of office the matters might still be better left alone but who could she tell he asked thoughtfully not many people came to see her would he leave that to chance would you no he sighed and leaned back again tomorrow i had better go and speak to nerissa freemarsh and to tucker again i dont think it can have anything to do with present cases but i need to be certain thank you for what she was puzzled by his gratitude for questioning adriana he explained i know you didnt wish to oh no thomas you dont mind about uffie do you who the dog he laughed quietly no of course i dont in the morning pitt went to see narraway and told him about charlottes conversation with adriana blantyre and the conclusions he was forced to draw from it i was hoping the answer would be different narraway said quietly i was sure it had to do with this wretched duke alois threat but it seems the timing is coincidental after all im sorry what are you going to do go back to dorchester terrace and check on the exact amount of laudanum that was in the house pitt replied and whether anyone from the outside ever had access to it you think adriana learned the truth from serafina went away and thought about it then came back with laudanum thats coldblooded if serafina betrayed her father to his death perhaps i hope to be wrong narraway spread his hands in a small rueful gesture he said nothing for which pitt was grateful at dorchester terrace he spoke first with tucker and then with nerissa freemarsh he checked on the laudanum as he had told narraway he would the conclusion was inescapable whoever had given her the extra dosage had brought it with them killing her had been carefully planned tucker had nothing new to add yes mrs blantyre had called several times bringing flowers and once a box of candied fruit she was always kind yes she had seemed distressed the last time she had called on the evening of mrs montserrats death palefaced tucker noted that adriana had spent some time alone with mrs montserrat in the bedroom it had seemed to be what mrs montserrat had wanted with nerissa it was a different matter she was tense as she came into the housekeepers sitting room and closed the door behind her with a sharp snap she was still in black but today she had several rows of very fine jet beads around her neck and excellentquality jet earrings which added a fashionable touch to her appearance i dont know what else i can tell you mr pitt she said with a certain briskness being mistress of the house at last gave her a new air of confidence the slightly nervous demeanor was gone she stood straighter and somehow she looked taller perhaps she had new boots with a higher heel under the swirl of her black bombazine skirt it was not possible to tell but there was unquestionably a touch of color on her skin pitt had decided to be totally open did lord tregarron visit here often he asked lord tregarron she repeated she was playing for time it was a question she had not expected and she needed to think what to say is that something you find difficult to answer miss freemarsh he met her eyes challengingly why would that be surely he did not ask anyone to keep that fact hidden now there was an angry flush on her cheeks of course not that is absurd i was trying to recollect how often he did come and have you succeeded he came to visit my aunt because he had heard she was ill and he knew how much she had done for england in her youth particularly with regard to the austrian empire and our relationship with vienna how very generous of him pitt said with only the slightest asperity in his voice since as far as i can learn mrs montserrat was passionately on the side of the rebels against the habsburg throne was that not so or was she a spy for austria perhaps planted there to betray the freedom fighters now nerissa was really angry that is a dreadful thing to say and completely irresponsible but suddenly she stopped as if a new and terrible thought had filled her mind i i had not even she blinked i dont know mr pitt she always said again she stopped now i dont know perhaps that was what it was all about it would explain mrs blantyre her hand had flown to her mouth as if to stop herself from crying out now it fell to her side again i think perhaps i had better say no more i would not wish to be unjust to anyone he felt cold as if the fire had suddenly died though it was burning so hot and red in the hearth that the whole chimney breast was warm mrs blantyre visited your aunt quite often including the evening she died his voice sounded hollow yes but yes she did alone yes mr blantyre remained downstairs he thought it would be less strain on mrs montserrat she did not find it easy to speak to several people at a time and sometimes she and adriana would converse in italian which he does not speakat least not fluently i see does he speak croatian i have no idea her face was very pale she sat rigidly as if her bodice was suddenly constrictingly tight perhaps he speaks german i know he spent quite a lot of time in vienna i see thank you he was left with no choice he must go and question adriana blantyre there was nothing to be gained by delaying it not that he wished to if he went now blantyre himself might still be at home that would make it more difficult more embarrassing and emotionally wrenching but it was the right way to do it he thanked nerissa again and left dorchester terrace to walk the short distance to blantyres house he was admitted by the butler and blantyre himself met him in the hall has something happened he asked searching pitts face some word about duke alois no it concerns serafina montserrats death oh blantyre looked tired and his face was deeply lined he waved the butler away and the man disappeared obediently leaving them standing alone in the middle of the beautiful hall have you learned something further i am not certain but it begins to look like it pitt replied it was the worst part of his position as head of special branch and he could pass the responsibility to no one else blantyre had been more than a friend he had gone out of his way even taken professional risks to help pitt learn the reality of the threat to duke alois and to persuade the prime minister to take the issue seriously it made this investigation acutely painful but it did not relieve him of the necessity of pursuing it blantyre frowned when he spoke his voice was level and perfectly under control theres something i can do i know nothing about her death at all until you told me otherwise i assumed it was natural then when you mentioned the laudanum i thought perhaps she had dreaded the loss of her mind to the point where suicide had seemed preferable is that not the case is it possible that serafina was working for the austrian monarchy all the time and that it was she who betrayed lazar dragovic to his death pitt asked dear god blantyre gasped and swayed a little on his feet then he turned and strode across the floor to the foot of the stairs he grasped the banister hesitated a moment then started up pitt followed after him seized by a shadow of fear but with no idea why he was afraid blantyre increased his speed taking the steps two at a time he reached the landing and went to the second door he knocked then stood with his hand still raised he turned to pitt a couple of yards behind him there was a terrible silence blantyre lowered his hand and turned the knob he pushed the door open and walked into the room the curtains were still closed but there was sufficient daylight filtering through them to find their way across to the big bed and to see adrianas black hair fanned across the pillow adriana blantyre choked on the word pitt waited his heart pounding adriana blantyre cried out loudly he lurched forward and grasped her arm where it lay on the coverlet she did not move pitt looked and saw the empty glass on the bedside table and the small piece of folded paper such as holds a medicinal powder he would not need to taste it to know what it was he walked silently over to blantyre and put his hand on his shoulder blantyre buckled at the knees and collapsed onto the floor his body racked with pain his sobs hollow making barely a sound pitt was in his office looking yet again through the plans for duke aloiss visit when stoker knocked on the door pitt looked up as he came in stokers expression was anxious and he was clearly uncomfortable mr blantyres here sir he looks pretty bad like he hasnt eaten or slept for a while but he wants to see you sorry but i couldnt put him off i think its about staum ask him in pitt replied there was no way to avoid it assassins do not stop for private grief it might solve at least part of the problem if staum was connected to adriana but there was nothing to suggest it adriana had killed serafina in revenge for her father and then apparently in remorse or despair taken her own life there was no reason to think she had even heard of duke alois who would have been a child even younger than herself at the time of the uprising and the betrayal fetch brandy and a couple of glasses he added then seeing the look on stokers face i know its early but he may well have been awake all night its civil to make the offer poor man i dont know how he can bear it stoker said grimly wife killing an old lady who was dying anyway then taking her own life mind he looks as if hed be better off dead himself right now ask him in and dont be long with the brandy pitt told him yes sir blantyre came in a moment later he looked like a man stumbling blindly through a nightmare pitt stood to greet him it was impossible to know what to say pitt remembered charlottes grief when he had told her about adriana she had been stunned as if his words had made no sense to her then as understanding filled her followed by horror at the torment she imagined adriana mustve been feeling she had wept in pitts arms for what seemed like a long time even when they had finally gone to bed she had cried in the dark when he touched her her face had been wet with tears she and adriana had been friends for only a few weeks what blantyre must be feeling was a devastation imaginable only to those who had experienced it blantyre eased himself into the chair like an old man with brittle bones stoker came in almost on his heels with the brandy and blantyre accepted it he held the glass in both hands as if to warm the bowl and send the aroma up but his fingers were bloodless and shaking stoker said you had some news pitt prompted him after a few moments of silence blantyre looked up staum is no longer alone in dover he said quietly there is another man called reibnitz there elegant ineffectuallooking fellow very tidy humorless he looks like an accountant and you half expect his fingers to be stained with ink until he speaks then he sounds like a gentleman and you take him for some third son from a decent family the sort in england who would go into the church for the lack of something better to do reibnitz pitt repeated blantyres face tightened johann reibnitz so ordinary as to be almost invisible average height slender build light brown hair gray eyes pale complexion could be any one of a million men in austria or any of the rest of europe speaks english without an accent nothing to distinguish him pitt asked with growing alarm nothing at all no moles no scars no limp or twitch or stutter as i said an invisible man there was no expression in blantyres eyes he spoke mechanically so staum might be a decoy as we feared pitt said i think so he would be if i were planning it how do you know this the ghost of a smile crossed blantyres face but vanished so completely pitt wasnt sure he had actually seen it i still have contacts in vienna reibnitz has killed several times before they know but they cannot prove it it was pitts turn to smile and you expect me to believe that a lack of proof prevents them from removing him is vienna so squeamish blantyre sighed of course not you are quite right they use him also as it suits them he was one of their own originally they believe that he has gone rogue he looked at pitt with sudden intensity as if something alive had stirred within him again would you order one of your own shot simply because you believed he had become unreliable would you not want him tried given a chance to defend himself how could you be sure the evidence was good should he not face his accuser and would you detail one of your men to do it or would you feel that as head of the service it was your burden to bear pitt was startled it was a question he had avoided asking himself since the oneil affair it was one thing to defend yourself in the heat of the moment it was very different to order an execution a judicial murder in cold blood blantyre sipped his brandy you are a detective a brilliant one there was sincerity in his voice even admiration you uncover truths most men would never find you make certain you weigh evidence you refine your understanding until you have as much of the whole picture as anyone ever will you have intense emotions you empathize with pain injustice outrages you but you hardly ever lose your selfcontrol he made a slight gesture with his strong graceful hands you think before you act these are the qualities that make you a great leader in the service of your country perhaps one day you will even be better than victor narraway because you know people better pitt stared at him embarrassed he understood that there was a but coming and he did not want to hear it blantyre twisted his mouth in a grimace but could you execute one of your men without trial i dont know pitt admitted it was difficult to say the expression on blantyres face gave him no indication as to whether he respected pitts answer or despised it i know you dont blantyre relaxed at last perhaps your counterpart in vienna hasnt decided yet either or perhaps reibnitz is a double agent working for the head of the austrian secret service and betraying his other masters to them as the occasion arises well if he attempts to murder duke alois perhaps we can relieve them of the decision pitt said grimly is there anything more you can tell me about reibnitz where he has been seen habits dress any way we can recognize him anything known of his likes and dislikes any associates of course i have written down everything known blantyre pulled a folded piece of paper from his inside pocket and handed it to pitt the name of my informant is there separately i would be obliged if you would note it somewhere absolutely safe and show it to no one else except possibly stoker i know you trust him pitt took it thank you he said sincerely duke alois will owe you his life and we will all owe you for saving us from a national embarrassment which could have cost us very dearly indeed blantyre finished his brandy thank you he put the glass down on the desk and stood up he hesitated a moment as if to say something more then changed his mind and walked unsteadily to the door as soon as he was gone pitt sent for stoker and told him all that blantyre had said including the name of the informant regarding reibnitz it took them the rest of that day to follow it up but every fact that blantyre had offered was verifiable and proved to be true leaving stoker and the others under his command to check and double check all the arrangements from the moment the ferry landed in dover pitt went to see narraway it was the middle of the afternoon with rain sweeping in from the west pitt was soaked and put his hat gloves and scarf on the leatherpadded brass railing in front of the fire narraway put more coal and wood on the embers and settled in his chair gazing at pitt you are certain about reibnitz he asked gravely im certain that what blantyre told me is true pitt replied ive checked on the few austrian political murders we know about its difficult to pin them down too many are anarchists striking at anyone at all just as they are here or else the cases are unsolved reibnitz fits the description for a murder in berlin and one in paris as blantyre said theres no proof but hes here in dover narraway pressed pitt nodded there is an ordinaryseeming man answering his description calling himself john rainer just returned from bordeaux after apparently having been away on business for several months he has no friends or family who can confirm it only a passport with that name narraway pursed his lips he doesnt sound like an anarchist more like a deliberate and very careful assassin he could still be paid by anarchists pitt reasoned the rain beating on the windows sounded threatening as if it were trying to come in narraway looked at him steadily the shadows from the firelight playing across his face in case its all a misdirection i have put only four men on the duke alois case until he actually gets here everyone else is on their usual rounds watching for any movement any change that stands out weve got a socialist rally in kilburn but the regular police can deal with anything there an exhibition of rather explicit paintings in one of the galleries in piccadilly some protests expected there nothing else that i know of then youd better prepare for the worst narraways eyes were bleak his mouth pulled into a thin line you need all the allies you can find it might be time to exert a little pressure even call in a few favors this information from blantyre needs further checking it doesnt smell like casual anarchist violence it was what pitt had thought and feared i dont have any favors to call in he said grimly blantyre is crippled by his wifes death i still have no idea if any of it had to do with duke alois or not but i cant see any connection the duke is austrian and has no visible ties with italy or croatia he has no interest we can find in any of the other smaller parts of the austrian empire prussia poland narraway asked nothing narraway frowned i dont like coincidences but i cant think of any way in which serafinas rambling mind or the secrets she might have known forty years ago have anything to do with anarchists today or duke alois at any time tragically the connection with adriana and lazar dragovic is all too obvious although it surprises me i would never have thought of serafina montserrat as one to betray anyone but then i knew her only through other peoples eyes vespasias pitt asked i suppose so you have no doubt that it was adriana who killed her i wish i did but i cant see any she was there that night a deep painful heaviness settled inside him we know that serafina was one of dragovics allies and that she was there when he was executed she took adriana away and looked after her it was an appalling piece of duplicity whatever reason she did it for whoevers power or freedom was bought that way no wonder she was afraid when she knew that adriana as a grown woman was coming to see her that explains the terror that vespasia saw and when she realized you knew adriana killed herself narraway added he watched pitt steadily his eyes probing to see how harshly pitt felt the guilt pitt gave a bleak smile in return there is one other person to consider in all this he said not as an evasion but to move the conversation forward narraway nodded lips drawn tight be careful pitt dont create enemies you cant afford if youre going to use people be damned careful how you do it people understand favors and repayment but no one likes to be used he leaned forward and picked up the poker from the hearth he pushed it into the coals and the flames gushed up there are a few people you can set at each others throats if you need to shake things up a little see what falls out he added pitt watched him closely waiting for the next words dreading them tregarron narraway went on replacing the poker gently he is devoted to his mother but had a certain ill feeling toward his father wasnt his father a diplomat in vienna yes you might see if he knew anything about dragovic or serafina for that matter there are one or two others people i could he looked for the right word persuade to be more forthcoming but theyre heavy debts ones i can call in only once he looked up at pitt whose face was tense uncertain in the flickering light you tell me what you would like me to do pitt could not answer he wanted to ask someones adviceperhaps vespasiasbut he knew that it was his decision he was head of special branch i want to know if the betrayal of dragovic was the only secret serafina was afraid of revealing he said aloud and who nerissa freemarshs lover is if he exists at all freemarshs lover narraways head jerked up yes find that out find out if it was tregarron find out what he really went to that house for i intend to pitt went to one of the sources that narraway had mentioned he took the train on the great eastern line to just beyond hackney wick from there he walked threequarters of a mile through sporadic sunshine to plover road it overlooked hackney marsh which was flat as a table and crossed by narrow winding waterways there he found the man whose name narraway had given him an italian who had fought with the croatian nationalists when dragovic was one of their leaders he was well into his eighties now but still sharpwitted in spite of failing physical health when pitt had identified himself and proved to the mans satisfaction that he knew victor narraway they sat down together in a small room with a window overlooking the marsh beyond the glass flights of birds raced across the wide sky chasing sunlight and shadows and wind combed the grasses in everchanging patterns yes of course i remember serafina montserrat the old man said with a smile he had lost most of his hair but he still had beautiful teeth what man could forget her what about lazar dragovic pitt asked the old mans face filled with sadness killed he said briefly the austrians shot him executed pitt put in murdered the old man corrected him wasnt he planning to assassinate someone the old mans seamed face twisted with contempt a butcher of the people put there to rule he had no damned business being set on the throne there foreigner barely even spoke their language and he was brutal killing himnow that would have been an execution was dragovic betrayed by one of his own pitt asked yes the old mans eyes burned with the memory of course he was never would have been caught otherwise do you know who what does it matter now there was weariness and a sudden overwhelming defeat in his voice he stared out the window theyre all dead are they pitt asked are you sure must be it was a long time ago people like that are passionate vivid they live with courage and hope but they burn out serafina died only a few weeks ago pitt told him he smiled ah serafina god rest her she was murdered pitt said feeling brutal to deliver such news is that why you came that was an accusation english policeman with a murder to solve there have been three deaths counting lazar dragovic and more urgently there is the threat of more death to come pitt corrected him who betrayed lazar dragovic who else is dead you said three deaths but serafin and lazar makes two adriana dragovic tears filled the old mans eyes and slipped down his withered cheeks she was a lovely child he whispered pitt thought of adriana picturing her vividly in his mind beautiful delicate and yet perhaps far stronger than blantyre had imagined or was she had she killed serafina after all these years or not why did he still question it he had all the evidence the old man blinked when did it happen when a few days ago how was she ill she was fragile as a child lung diseases i think but he sighed i thought she was better its so easy to wish but you said only a few days ago was it her lungs still no she killed herself but i dont know why not for certain the old man blinked again what can i tell you all this time later that can help it was all long ago dragovic is dead so are those who fought with him and now you say serafina and adriana are dead too what could i know that matters anymore who betrayed dragovic pitt answered do you think if i knew that person would still be alive i wouldve killed him long ago the old mans voice shook with anger his face was crumpled his eyes wet did serafina know pitt persisted seconds ticked by and the silence in the room remained unbroken more cloud shadows chased one another over the marsh there would be rain before sunset pitt waited im not sure the old man said at last i didnt think so at first later i began to wonder werent she and dragovic lovers yes thats why i was sure at first that she didnt know shed have taken her revenge if she had i thought she grieved for him inside few people saw it but it was there im not sure it ever really healed you are certain of that of course i am i knew serafina now there was anger in the old mans voice a challenge pitt wondered how well he had known her had he been her lover too might dragovics betrayal have been nothing political at all but an oldfashioned triangle of love and jealousy did you know her well he asked the old man smiled showing the beautiful teeth again yes very well and before you ask yes we were lovers before dragovic but you dishonor me if you think i would betray the cause out of personal jealousy the cause came first always for everyone yes for everyone anger flared in his eyes against pitt because he was young and knew nothing about their passion and their loss then logically whoever betrayed dragovic was secretly on the side of a different cause pitt stated the only conclusion the old man nodded slowly yes that must be so but if serafina knew why wouldnt she expose that person she would have she cannot have known i was wrong when did you think she might have learned oh ten maybe fifteen years later how would she have found out so long after ive thought about that too and i dont know are you certain it was not serafina herself pitt loathed asking but it was unavoidable serafina the old man was shocked and angry again sitting more upright in his chair never then perhaps it was someone she loved it was the most obvious conclusion no men came and went there was no one she would have forgiven for betraying dragovic his voice was filled with cutting contempt pitt could imagine the young man he must have been slightly built but wiry handsome filled with passion are you certain he probed yes the only person she loved that much was dragovics child adriana adriana had been only eight when her father was killed could she have let something slip by accident something that ended up killing her father was that terrible realization what blantyre had been trying to protect her from if serafina had told her in one of her ramblings little wonder that adriana had gone home and killed herself except the timing made no sense if she had found out such a thing surely she wouldve been wild with distress on the day serafina told her driven to take her life then not several days and social engagements later and why would she kill serafina for that the old man was studying his face what is it he asked anxiously do you know something no i dont pitt replied what i was thinking makes no sense but serafina knew thats why she was killed to prevent her from telling anyone else that doesnt explain why adriana killed herself the old man said unless she killed serafina to silence her and then couldnt take the guilt of it but what reason could she have had to do that to protect her husband pitt had spoken the words before he realized the full impact of what he was saying her husband the old man was aghast evan blantyre pitt looked at him studying the fragile skin the deep lines the strength in the bones in its own way it was a beautiful face yesevan blantyre the old man crossed himself yes god forgive us all that would make sense that would be why serafina never told she didnt know it until later when blantyre returned and courted adriana he must have let something slip and serafina put it together and she let adriana marry him pitt asked incredulously how was she going to stop it they were in love passionately and completely adriana was beautiful but she had nothing no money no status she was the orphan daughter of a traitor to the empire an executed criminal and serafina probably had no proof only her own inner certainty he shrugged his thin shoulders not that proof would have made a difference blantyre would have been regarded as a hero by the viennese emperor no she would have kept her silence and let adriana be happy she was delicate needing someone to look after her to help her regain her health in poverty she would have been left to die young and alone serafina never had a child of her own adriana was the only thing left of the man she loved pitt tried to imagine it serafina watching the marriage of adriana to the man who had betrayed them both and perhaps that was it the depth of real love more powerful than the need for revenge and deeper infinitely more selfless than any kind of hate or hunger for justice he felt a pain in his chest and a tightness in his throat tears glistened in the old mans eyes the first drops of rain spattered against the windows if blantyre had betrayed lazar dragovic and serafina knew it then she might well have let something slip to adriana and if adriana had confronted blantyre with it what would he have done serafina was terrified that she would say something that sooner or later would lead to the truth that made perfect sense but blantyre must have also feared that it would happen so he killed her to prevent it then when adriana knew serafina had been murderedand realized she was about to be blamed for it by pittshe had killed herself in despair or blantyre thought that adriana would put together all the different things serafina had said and deduce the truth so with terrible agonizing regret he had killed her to protect himself everything suddenly crystalized in pitts mind the detail with which blantyre had explained to pitt and charlotte the crucial place of the austrian empire in european politics the passion he had shown while discussing the subject was he right was the empires survival necessary to the continued peace of europe perhaps it was it did not excuse the murder of serafina montserrat even less did it excuse the murder of adriana pitt rose to his feet thank you sir he said gravely you have saved the good name of two women who were murdered and defamed i will do all i can to see that that injustice is corrected but i may not be able to do it quickly believe me i will not forget or abandon it the old man nodded slowly good he said with conviction good on the train home pitt stared out the window even though it was streaked with rain and there was little he could see he ignored the other two men sitting in the carriage reading newspapers if blantyre had been with serafina long enough to hear that she knew the truth then he mustve spent quite a lot of time with her how often had he visited her why had neither adriana nor nerissa mentioned it the answer to the first was simple adriana might not have known the answer to the second was more complicated nerissa could not escape knowing unless blantyre had visited when she was out of the house possibly in the afternoons the more probable answer was that she did know and had chosen not to tell pitt had that been to protect herself because she had allowed him to see serafina without anyone else in the room ormore likelyto protect him from suspicion perhaps because he had asked her to ormost likely of allbecause he was her lover except what in heavens name would the brilliant charming evan blantyre see in a woman like nerissa freemarsh but then who knew what anyone saw in another person the outer appearance was trivial if one understood the mind or the heart perhaps she was generous easy to please uncritical maybe she listened to him with genuine interest laughed at his jokes never contradicted him or compared him with others it could be as simple as that she loved him unconditionally and asked nothing in return except a little time a little kindness or the semblance of it perhaps it was in defiance of the beautiful and maybe demanding adriana the rain beat harder on the carriage window now and it was growing dark outside the rattle of the train was rhythmic soothing the most likely explanation of all was that blantyre had visited dorchester terrace once with adriana realized how dangerously serafina was rambling and secured for himself an ostensible reason for returning again and again so he could figure out just how great the danger might be then a new thought occurred to pitt blantyre couldve learned from serafinas disintegrating mind any other secret she might know about anyone or anything else he might now have stored in his own mind all the secrets serafina was so afraid she would let slip names of men and women who had participated in indiscretions of all sorts over half of europe for the last forty years most of them were probably trivial affairs illegitimate children romantic betrayals as opposed to political ones possibly thefts or embezzlements purchases of office blackmails or coercions the list was almost endless what would blantyre do with them that was a troubling thought but it might have to wait until after duke alois had safely completed his visit but then had blantyre gained his knowledge about the assassination plot from serafina it did not seem possible serafina had been ill and confined to her bed for half a year it was far longer than that since she had been involved in any affairs of state in england or austria was it even conceivable that duke alois was connected with someone else from that time that seemed fanciful in the extreme pitt was skeptical of coincidences ordinary police work had taught him that even before special branch but on the other hand it was equally foolish to imagine that everything was connected or to see cause and effect where there was none he sat back and let the rhythm and movement of the train lull him into near sleep it was still at least half an hour before he would reach the station in london and then as long again before he was home pitt found charlotte waiting for him with the kettle on the burner and the fire still burning in the parlor he stood by the scrubbed table as she made tea and cut him a sandwich of cold beef and pickles he glanced at the basket beside the stove and saw the little dog uffie half asleep her nose twitching as she smelled the meat he smiled took a tiny piece from where charlotte had sliced it and offered it to the dog she snapped it up immediately thomas ive already fed her charlotte smiled he picked up the tray and carried it through to the parlor he had not realized how hungry he was or how cold he set it down and watched while she poured tea for both of them the room was warm and silent except for the slight crackling of the flames in the hearth and now and then the sound of wind and rain on the windowpanes beyond the closed curtains he glanced at the familiar pictures on the walls the dutch water scene he was so used to with its soft colors blues and grays calm as a still morning on the other wall was a drawing of cows grazing there was something very beautiful about cows a kind of certainty that always pleased him perhaps that was based on some memory from childhood charlotte was watching him waiting how much could he tell her he could fail to see something important something she might catch especially if it was based on something adriana had told her that she had not previously understood the relevance of on the other hand there were the promises of secrecy he had made regarding his office in special branch if he could not be trusted to keep them he was no use to anyone and no protection to charlotte herself he must choose his words carefully you dont believe that adriana killed serafina do you he made it more of a statement than a question no she said instantly i know you think serafina was responsible for lazar dragovics death but even if she wasand i dont know that youre rightadriana wouldnt have murdered her it would be stupid apart from anything else serafina was dying anyway and in some distress if you hate someone deeply you want them to suffer not to be let off lightly revenge is usually stupid he said quietly for an instant it feels wonderful then the fury dies away and youre left empty and wondering why it didnt make you feel any better what it was you were expecting that didnt happen she stared at him when did you ever take revenge on anyone ive wanted to he replied with a sense of shame some people ive arrested some people for whom i didnt have enough proof that they were guilty or simply couldnt catch them at the crime even recently people i just had to arrest calmly but whom i would like to have beaten with my fists the only thing stopping me was the fact that i wasnt alone with them i dont know whether i would have if id been certain of getting away with it she looked at him with amazement and a degree of curiosity youve never told me that before im not proud of it do you tell me only the things youre proud of she challenged no of course not he smiled ruefully softening the moment i would probably have told you if id actually done it because id find out no because it was a weakness i hadnt overcome she gave a little laugh but there was no edge to it no criticism what about adriana if she didnt kill serafina who did and why did she then kill herself her voice dropped or didnt she pitt avoided her question you spent quite a lot of time with her do you think you learned to know her at all i want your true opinion of her a great deal may depend on it even peoples lives whose she came back instantly blantyres among others but i wasnt principally referring to him it has to do with other people most of whom you dont even know he made a slight rueful gesture and my job as well the last vestige of amusement vanished from charlottes face her eyes were steady and serious i dont think she was fragile at all she had been hurt terribly seeing her father beaten and then executed but many people see very bad things its painful one never forgets them but they dont make you deranged nightmares maybe ive had a few sometimes if i sleep really badly or im worried or frightened i remember the dead people ive seen she did not move her gaze from his but he saw the sudden return of memory in her eyes one of the worst was the skeleton of the woman on the swing with the tiny bones of the baby inside her i still see that sometimes and it makes me want to weep and weep until i have no strength left but i dont pitt started to reach across to touch her then changed his mind this was not the moment adriana he said again she wasnt hysterical she said with conviction and i dont believe she would ever have killed herself who killed her thomas why wouldnt it have been the same person who betrayed her father did serafina know who that was she would have that was why she was killed too thats the only thing that makes sense i imagine so should he tell her did she have to know for her own safety or would knowing endanger her and even if he did not tell her blantyre might assume he had it was him wasnt it her voice interrupted his thoughts him blantyre she said sharply he was the only one who could have betrayed dragovic killed serafina and killed adriana she made it sound so simple thomas i dont care what secrets he knows or what kind of office he holds you cant let him get away with that its monstrous you want revenge he asked maybe yes i want revenge for adriana and for serafina she deserved better than to die like that but call it justice if you like it isand youll feel better justice can mean many different things to different people pitt pointed out then call it an act of necessity you cant have someone like that in a high office in the government such a man could do anything oh indeed and probably will some of it we will praise him for and some we will be glad enough not to know about charlotte said nothing he looked across at her and could not read what she was thinking first thing in the morning pitt went to see vespasia it was far too early to call but he disregarded courtesy and told the maid that it was urgent vespasias maid had become used to him his polished boots and crooked ties and above all the fact that vespasia was always willing to receive him he found her in the yellow breakfast room sitting at the cherrywood table with tea toast and marmalade the maid set another place for pitt and went to fetch fresh tea and more toast good morning thomas vespasia said gravely please sit down you give me a crick in my neck staring up at you he smiled bleakly and accepted the invitation he loved this room it always seemed as if the sun were shining inside it serafina montserrat knew who betrayed lazar dragovic he said without preamble vespasia inclined her head very slightly i thought she might she was seldom fooled and she loved him enough to not rest easily until she knew her fear makes perfect sense now if she had not told adriana already then it was because she did not wish her to know she was probably worried that she would ultimately let it slip you are right he agreed the maid returned with fresh tea a second cup and more toast she left without speaking and closed the door behind her which must mean it was evan blantyre vespasia concluded if it was anyone else serafina would not have gone to such lengths to bury the truth did she care about him he asked vespasia raised her eyebrows in exasperation dont be absurd thomas she must have found out after adriana was committed to marrying him that would have made it impossible for her to do anything she would have stifled her own feelings and kept silent for adrianas sake in the end it served neither of them pitt said unhappily poor serafina she paid a very high price for nothing not for nothing she corrected him simply adriana had many happy years she grew to be a strong beautiful woman and i think she always knew that serafina loved her like a mother and blantyre he asked bitterly perhaps in his own way he also loved her but not as he cared for his ideals and his beliefs in austria ill prove it one way or another he said grimly as if he were making an oath i daresay you will she poured a cup of tea for him and passed it over thank you he took it and then a piece of toast buttering it absentmindedly that is hardly your most urgent concern she observed he looked up at her my dear if evan blantyre spent long enough at dorchester terrace to realize that serafina knew he was the one who betrayed lazar dragovic then he must have listened to a great deal that she said what else was there do you suppose most of it may be irrelevant now but what about that which is not who does it concern i dont know he admitted that same thought occurred to me i could find out all the places where blantyre has served but it wouldnt tell me much except the extent of the possibilities and i can already guess that she spread more butter on her piece of toast all kinds of people have served in the embassies of europe at some time or another especially that of vienna vespasia said she passed him the marmalade and apart from government positions most of the aristocracy travels for pleasure to hunt to drink beer to exchange ideasphilosophy sciences to climb mountains in the tyrol or to sail on the lakes to visit venice and the adriatic especially the coast of croatia with its islands and always we go to the glory and the ruin of rome and imagine ourselves heirs to the days of its empire some of us go to naples to gaze at vesuvius and imagine the eruption that burned pompeii we see the sunlight on the water and dream for a little while that it always shines what does that have to do with austrias survival as an empire he asked very little she replied but a great deal to do with indiscretions with secrets that people might still wish to keep even forty years later the crisp toast and sharp marmalade lost their taste pitt could have been eating cardboard you mean serafina was in those places and would have known all sorts of things she was very observant it was part of her skill so there were likely many austrians she couldve blackmailed he concluded certainly britishers as well she was neither spiteful nor irresponsible vespasia said gently but she understood the weaknesses of people and now blantyre may know a great many things from serafinas confused mind and he may well have no moral boundaries in his crusade to preserve the power of the austrohungarian empire and all that he believes depends upon it pitt leaned forward slowly his hands pressed hard against his face it is time for some very difficult decisions my dear vespasia said after a moment or two when you have made sure that duke alois is safe you are going to have to deal with evan blantyre you have the heart of a policeman but you must have the brain of the head of special branch dont forget that thomas too many people are relying on you pitt sat in the housekeepers room at dorchester terrace waiting for nerissa freemarsh to come he had expected her to deliberately keep him waiting and he was not disappointed it gave him time to think very carefully about what he intended to say how much of the truth to tell her and how much pressure to exert he had felt a certain compassion toward her when they had first met at one time or another during his career in the police he had seen many single young women who were dependent upon a relative who made full use of them as unpaid servants occasionally a parent had intentionally kept one daughter home for precisely that purpose it was wretched for anyone being such a dependent an onlooker at life but never a participant nerissa had been one of those with very little choice she did not have the charm or the daring to have set out on her own she could not create adventure for herself as serafina had done perhaps serafina had secretly despised her for that if so nerissa wouldve realized it even if she could not have put a name to it or explained why was nerissa flattered that another womans husband had made advances to her professed a kind of love or had she genuinely cared for him probably far more than he had for her was pitt insulting her in assuming that blantyres interest was solely in serafina and that nerissa was merely the excuse to visit he felt a certain anger for a man who could use a womans obvious vulnerability in such a way the door opened without a knock and nerissa came in closing it behind her she stood facing him as he rose to his feet today she had a jetandcrystal brooch at her throat and matching earrings giving light to her face they were beautiful pitt wondered briefly if they had been serafinas good morning miss freemarsh he said quietly im sorry to disturb you again but several new facts have come to light and i need to ask you some further questions she seemed calmer today there was no sign of anxiety in her face as she heard this news indeed i am aware of mrs blantyres suicide she answered coolly facing him with her hands folded in front of her a tragedy and yet it appears to have been inevitable i gather that she held my aunt responsible for her fathers death or at least for his being caught by the austrians and executed for insurrection i was aware that she was she looked for the right word cutting but not overtly cruel fragile i was not aware that it was so very serious im sorry i know that suicide is a sin but in the circumstances perhaps it is better that she should have taken her own life rather than face arrest and trial and the shame of all that her face tightened and they might have locked her away in an asylum or even hanged her i suppose yes i i have to respect her for her choice poor creature pitt looked at her a well of pity disgust and revulsion building up inside him did she know that it was blantyre who had betrayed lazar dragovic killed serafina and then adriana too was she a party to it or ignorant of everything guilty of nothing but falling in love with another womans husband he did not know please sit down miss freemarsh im afraid the situation is not as simple as that she sat obediently hands folded in her lap and he returned to the housekeepers chair youre not going to make the case public are you she asked in dismay surely that is not in the governments interest it is simply the tragedy of a woman who suffered as a child and did not recover from it her scowled you would drag her husband through a mire of shame and embarrassment he does not deserve and to what purpose please do not say that it is justice that is complete nonsense and would be the utmost hypocrisy on your part my aunt caused the death of mrs blantyres father politically justified or not mrs blantyres mind was unhinged as a child because of it i believe she was actually there and witnessed the whole appalling thing she never knew who betrayed him until aunt serafinas own mind began to wander and somehow in her ramblings she gave herself away in a hysteria of revenge mrs blantyre killed her and then realizing what she had done took her own life justice has already been more than served he looked at her and wondered how much of that she truly believed and how much she had convinced herself of are you sure he asked as if he was seeking proof himself quite sure she replied and if you consider it you will see that it makes perfect sense there was no doubt visible in her no unease he could see no sign of real pity either she could not or did not wish to imagine herself in adrianas place when did your aunt tell you about lazar dragovics death he asked affecting only mild interest and when did you realize that dragovic was adrianas father nerissa looked startled i beg your pardon she was playing for time trying to understand what he was looking for and how to answer him you know about dragovic and that adriana witnessed his death herself as an eightyearold child he explained someone told you it is not recorded in any written history obviously or adriana would have known it all the time only those present knew the truth nerissa swallowed he could see her throat convulse oh yes i see her hands were knotted in her lap now her knuckles white so when did your aunt tell you this he persisted and why she cannot have wished you to tell anyone least of all adriana blantyre i i cant recall she took a deep breath i must have pieced it together from her ramblings she was very incoherent at times lady vespasia would tell you that bits and pieces jumbled not knowing who was with her and you realized from all those bits and pieces that adriana blantyre was actually lazar dragovics daughter that serafina had betrayed him to the austrians that she and adriana had witnessed his execution and that it had turned adrianas mind although she did not know who was behind the betrayal he kept the disbelief from his tone but barely and then adriana later pieced together the truth also from mrs montserrats ramblings and lost her mind so completely that she murdered her using the laudanum whose whereabouts she happened to know but you did not think to mention this to anyone when mrs montserrat was killed you are a brilliant complex and quite extraordinary woman miss freemarsh now he did not even attempt to keep the sarcasm out of his voice what little color was in her face was draining away leaving her almost gray i dont i dont know what you mean she stammered yes you do miss freemarsh you know a great deal about mrs blantyre and her past which you did not learn from her because she did not know it herself her whole motive for killing mrs montserrat wouldve been that she had just discovered this apparent betrayal and mrs montserrat was quite unaware that she had revealed it or she would have taken precautions to protect herself wouldve at least told miss tucker mrs blantyre also could not have told anyone because that wouldve immediately made her suspect in mrs montserrats death so again how did you know all of this i she gulped again as if starving for air i told you i learned it from aunt serafinas rambling the same way mrs blantyre learned why is it difficult for you to understand that because you would have me believe that she acted on it and yet you did not mention any of this to me even after we discovered that mrs montserrat was murdered nerissa was rigid now her muscles locked so tight her shoulders strained against the fabric of her dress she started to speak and then stopped staring at him defiantly so if i am to understand it you assume that mrs blantyre learned the truth from your aunts disjointed ramblings and was certain enough of what she pieced together to kill mrs montserrat without making any attempt to check the truth of it with anyone he asked patiently nerissas eyebrows rose check the truth of it with whom she demanded where would she find anyone who could do that are you saying she should have taken a trip to croatia and started searching for survivors of the rebels and insurgents of thirty years ago thats absurd she gave a little snarl of laughter and even if she succeeded aunt serafina could have been dead by the time she returned she added exactly he agreed no satisfaction in killing someone who is dying anyway in fact theres really very little purpose in that dont you think her eyes were like pinpoints then why are we having this ridiculous conversation croatia was your suggestion miss freemarsh i was not thinking of her going there or anywhere else i was thinking of her simply going home now she was sarcastic i beg your pardon i was supposing she would have asked her husband he explained after all he was involved with the insurgents at that time he was one of them or pretending to be i think actually he was always loyal to austrian unity and dominance in all the regions of its empire she said nothing if it had been me i would simply have gone home and asked him isnt that what you wouldve done he pressed she stared at him in angry silence as if his question did not merit an answer unless of course serafina did let something slip he went on relentlessly now but it was not that she was the betrayer and why would she be she was always an insurgent a fighter for freedomif not for croatia then for that part of northern italy that was under austrian rule what are you saying nerissas voice was hoarse that the betrayer was not serafina it was evan blantyre himself that is what adriana discovered she was struggling now to find a way to deny the truth that makes no sense she said sharply how dare you say such a thing if aunt serafina knew that or even believed it why didnt she say so long ago why did she ever let adriana dragovic marry him i wondered that myself pitt admitted then i realized that adriana was beautiful but poor the orphan daughter of a man who had been executed by the austrians she was in ill health she might very likely not bear children what were her opportunities she had met evan blantyre he was in love with her and could offer her a very good life serafina probably had no proof against him he had acted according to his own loyalties to austria because he believed passionately that the empire acted for the good of europea conviction he still holds serafina loved adriana enough to let her be safe and happy accidentally revealing the truth and giving her a burden she could not live with was the thing she was most afraid of when she knew that her control was slipping away and that she might forget where she was or to whom she was speaking nerissa breathed out slowly then it seems she was right to fear it since that was exactly what happened really he said with a disbelief she could not miss and when it did adriana killed her then waited several days before going home and killing herself why for gods sake nerissa started to shake her head pitt leaned forward a little his voice urgent now it was her husband who betrayed her father not serafina so surely if adriana was going to kill anyone it would have been him except she didnt know miss freemarsh serafina kept her secrets and died with them before she could tell anyone elseexcept perhaps mr blantyre he spent time with her didnt he he came here telling you it was to see you as your lover but he sat with her so it would look respectable only it was really the other way around he came to see serafina not you to find out how far her mind had disintegrated and what of the past she might betray to adriana no she cried out no thats horrible she made a swift movement with her hand as if to sweep the suggestion away yes it is he agreed but we are speaking of a man who believes in the value of the austrian empire above all else he betrayed his friend lazar dragovic to his torture and death he married dragovics daughter perhaps from guilt perhaps because she was beautiful and vulnerable maybe he felt safer knowing where she was and it would give him standing in the community of those who still seek to throw off the austrian yoke heaven knows the whole balkan peninsula is teeming with them thats she began but could not finish the sentence logical he said yes it is and you are just one more of his victims both emotionally and morally she stiffened but the tears were sliding down her face i have done nothing she stopped again i am prepared to accept that you did not know beforehand that blantyre would kill serafina and perhaps not immediately after he said more gently you may have willfully refused to think about adrianas death or to work out for yourself what the truth had to be at the moment i can see no purpose in charging you as an accessory but if you do not cooperate now that will change co cooperate how she started to deny her complicity even her knowledge but the words died on her tongue she had knownor at least guessedbut refused to allow the thoughts to complete themselves in her mind she knew that pitt could see as much in her eyes tell me who was in the house the day serafina montserrat was killed and the day before as well the day before her hands twisted around each other in her lap yes and please dont make any mistakes or omissions if you do and we discover them afterward it will point very powerfully to guilt on your partand probably to whoever you are attempting to protect she was trembling now you have no choice miss freemarsh if you wish to save yourself and i will naturally be speaking to at least some of the staff again it was several seconds before she spoke he waited for her in silence mr blantyre was here the day aunt serafina died she said at last he came often i dont remember all the days two or three times a week he spent some time with me and some with her and he was definitely here the day she died he persisted yes did he see her alone before mrs blantyre was here yes her voice was barely audible what reason did he give he pressed her what you said for the sake of appearance anyone else he was not even certain why he asked except that he sensed a reluctance in her i would prefer to have it from you rather than from the staff allow yourself that dignity miss freemarsh you have little enough left and by the way i would not let your staff go if i were you employed here they have an interest in maintaining some discretion if they leave it will make a great many people wonder why and they will most certainly talk no matter what threats you make you are not in a good position to do anything other than maintain silence yourself if you are not prosecuted for anything you will be in a comfortable financial situation and free to conduct yourself as you please her eyes widened a little who else was here he pressed lord tregarron it was little more than a whisper why i beg your pardon why was lord tregarron here to see you or to see mrs montserrat i assume it was both or you would not have been so reluctant to say so she cleared her throat yes why did he wish to see mrs montserrat were they friends she hesitated he did not ask again no she said at last speaking in gasps as if it caused her an almost physical pain his calling on her was an excuse im not certain if he was interested in mehe pretended to beor in aunt serafina and her recollections he spent time talking to her not much i she breathed in and out several times struggling to control her emotions i had the feeling that he did not like her but that he wished to hide it but not merely from good manners or to spare my feelings because she was my aunt thank you he said sincerely did he express any interest in mr or mrs blantyre not more than i would expect she trailed off again i understand thank you miss freemarsh i think that is all at least for the time being i would like to speak to miss tucker now tucker confirmed all that nerissa had said including several visits from tregarron over the period of the last four or five weeks pitt thanked her and left he walked back to lisson grove with his mind in turmoil the heart of this case was no longer anything to do with serafinas death or adriana but two other matters the first and most urgent was the question of evan blantyres loyalties had he given pitt the information regarding duke alois out of loyalty to the austrian empire which it seemed he had never lost in spite of working for the british government if that was so and his betrayal of lazar dragovic and the later murders of serafina and adriana were to preserve the unity at the heart of europe then his information would be safe for pitt to rely on he could deal with blantyres prosecution and conviction after duke alois had come and gone if on the other hand blantyre had some other purpose his information about duke alois was very far from reliable and then the other obvious question arose after duke alois left what was pitt going to do about blantyre what could he do what evidence was there he had no doubt now that blantyre had killed serafina and adriana but he doubted that there was sufficient proof to convict a man of such prominence and high reputation but that would have to wait it was two days until the duke crossed the channel and landed in england murder however tragic would pale beside the effects of a political assassination in london pitt checked in with stoker at lisson grove then after one or two items of urgent business he left again and took a hansom to blantyres office in spite of his bereavement blantyre had chosen to continue working duke aloiss visit could not be put off there were arrangements to make and details to be attended to and blantyre with his intimate and affectionate knowledge of austria was the best man for the job anything further blantyre asked as he sat down in his large chair close to the fire he poured whisky for both of them without bothering to ask in spite of it being the middle of march it was a bitter day outside and they were both tired and cold yes pitt answered accepting the exquisite glass but putting it down on the small table to his right without drinking from it i now know who killed serafina and why but then so do you he watched blantyres sensitive haggard face and saw not a flicker in it not even a change in his eyes and who killed mrs blantyre pitt continued but again so do you this time there was a twitch of pain which pitt believed was perfectly real blantyre must have hated killing her but had known that if he himself were to survive then he had no alternative adriana would never forgive him for her fathers death and maybe not for serafinas either even if she told no one he would never be able to sleep again if she was in the house perhaps not eat or drink he would always be aware of her watching him his mind would run riot imagining what she felt for him now and when she would lose control and erupt into action pitt went on levelly i also know who betrayed lazar dragovic to the austrians which of course was the beginning of all this it was necessary blantyre said almost conversationally they could have been discussing the dismissal of an old but ineffectual servant perhaps you dont understand that he went on you are a man of reason and deduction who comes to conclusions and leaves it for others to do something about those conclusions my father was like that clever and he cared but never enough to do anything that risked his own moral comfort bitterness filled his face and all but choked his voice whoever lived or died he must always be able to sleep at night pitt did not answer blantyre leaned forward in his chair still holding the whisky glass in his hand he looked steadily at pitt the austrian empire lies at the heart of europe we have discussed this before i tried to explain to you how complex it is but it seems you are a little englander at heart i like you but god help you you have no vision you are a provincial man britains empire covers most of the globe in patches here and there britain itself gibraltar malta egypt sudan most of africa all the way to the cape territories in the middle east india burma hong kong shanghai borneo the whole subcontinent of australia new zealand canada and islands in every ocean on earth the sun never sets on it pitt stirred temper flared in blantyres eyes austria is completely different apart from the austrian netherlands it stretches in one continuous landmass from parts of germany in the northwest to ukraine in the east south to most of romania north again as far down the adriatic coast as ragusa then west through croatia and northern italy into switzerland there are twelve main languages there the richest most original culture scientific discoveries in every field of human endeavor but it is fragile his hands jerked up and apart as if he were encompassing some kind of explosion with his strong fingers its genius means that it is also liable to be torn apart by the very nature of the ideas it creates the individuality of its people the new nations of italy and germany born in turmoil and still testing their strength are tearing at the fabric of order italy is chaotic it always has been pitt smiled in spite of himself germany is altogether a different matter blantyre went on with intense seriousness it is sleek and dangerous its government is not chaotic anything but it is highly organized and militarily brilliant it will not be contained against its will for long germany is not part of the austrian empire pitt pointed out it has a language in common and a certain culture but not an identity austria will never swallow it it will not allow that for gods sake pitt wake up blantyre was nearly shouting now if austria fractures or loses control of its possessions or if there is an uprising in the east that is successful enough to be dangerous vienna will have to make reprisals or lose everything if there is trouble in northern italy it hardly matters but if it is in one of the slavic possessions like croatia or serbia then it will turn to russia for help they are blood brothers and russia will not need more than an excuse to come to their aid and then teutonic germany will have found the justification it needs to take german austria his voice was growing harsher as if the nightmare was already happening hungary will secede and before you know how to stop any of it you will have a war that will spread like fire until it embroils most of the world dont imagine that england will escape it wont there will be war from ireland to the middle east and from moscow to north africa maybe further perhaps all of africa because it is british and then australia will follow and new zealand even canada perhaps eventually the united states as well pitt was stunned by the enormity of it the horror and the absurdity of the view no one would let that sort of thing happen he said soberly you are suggesting that one act of violence in the balkans would end in a conflagration that would consume the world thats ridiculous blantyre took a deep breath and let it out slowly pitt austria is the linchpin the glue that holds together the political body of europe he was staring intently it wouldnt be overnight but youd be appalled how quickly it would happen if vienna loses control and the constituent parts of the empire turn on one another picture a street riot you must have had to deal with them in your days on the beat how many men does it take before the crowd joins in and every idiot with a grudge or too much to drink starts swinging his fists all the old enmities under the surface smolder and then break out pitt remembered a time that was very similar to what blantyre had just described rage hysteria violence spreading outward until it took hold for no reason at all too late to regret it afterward when houses were in ruins and broken glass was everywhere among fireblackened walls and blood blantyre was watching him he knew pitt understood what he was saying there will be a vacuum at the heart blantyre went on and however much you like to imagine that britain is the center of europe it isnt englands power lies in pieces all over the globe we have no army and no presence at the core of europe there will be chaos the austrian and german part of europe will be at the throats of the slavic northern and eastern parts there will be a paneuropean war economic ruin and in the end possibly a new and dominant germany is the peaceful death in her sleep of one old woman so important to you in the face of that that is not the point pitt said quietly facing blantyre across the two untouched glasses of whisky i have no intention of pursuing serafinas death right now what concerns me is the validity of the information you have given special branch regarding duke alois and the apparent threat of his assassination blantyre raised his eyebrows why should you doubt it surely you can see that i of all people do not want an austrian duke assassinated why the hell do you think i turned dragovic over to the austrians he was planning the assassination of a particularly brutal local governor he was a pig of a man but the vengeance for his death would have been terrible he leaned forward his face twisted with passion think damn it use whatever brain you have of course i dont want alois assassinated pitt smiled unless of course he is another dissident then it would be very convenient if he was killed while he was here in london not the austrians faultits all down to the incompetent british with their special branch led by a new man wholl swallow any story at all blantyre sighed wearily is this all about your promotion and the fact that you dont think you are fit for the job pitt clenched his jaw to keep his temper its about the fact that most of the information we have on the assassination planned here came from you and that you are a murderer and a liar whose principal loyalty is to the habsburg crown and not the british he replied carefully keeping his voice level if duke alois was your enemy rather than your friend you would be perfectly capable of having him murdered wherever it was most convenient to you blantyre winced but he did not speak or alternatively there is no plot at all pitt continued you wanted to keep special branch busy and the police away from investigating the murder of serafina montserrat and then most regrettably of your wife you had to kill serafina once you knew she was losing her grip on her mind and might betray you to adriana and you need to survive now or else how can you be of service in helping austria keep control of its rapidly crumbling empire after the suicide of its crown prince and his replacement by franz ferdinand who the old emperor despises blantyres jaw was tight his eyes hard a fair estimate he said between his teeth but you will not know if i am telling the truth or not will you you have checked all the information i gave you or you should have if you havent then you are a greater fool than i took you to be dare you trust it he smiled thinly you damned well dont dare ignore it pitt felt as if the ground were sinking beneath him yet the fire still burned gently in the hearth the flames warming the whisky glasses which shone a luminous amber be careful pitt blantyre warned consider deeply what you do after alois has been here and gone assuming you manage to keep him alive dont entertain any ideas of arresting me or bringing me to any kind of trial he smiled very slightly i visited serafina quite often and i listened to her a good deal of that time she had no idea who i was but then you know that already you will have heard it from lady vespasia if nothing else of course i know that pitt said tartly if you were not afraid of her talking candidly again to others you would not have taken the risk of killing her quite i regretted doing it blantyre gave a slight shrug she was a magnificent woman in her time she knew more secrets about both personal and political indiscretions than anyone else pitt was aware of a change in the atmosphere a warmth in blantyre a chill in himself blantyre nodded his head fractionally she rambled on about all manner of things and people some i had already guessed but much of it was new to me i had no idea that her circle was so wide austrian hungarian croatian and italian were all what i might have imagined but the others the french for example the german and of course the british there were some considerable surprises he looked very steadily at pitt as if to make certain that pitt grasped the weight of what he was saying pitt thought of tregarron also using nerissa freemarsh to disguise his visits to serafina what did he fear that could be so much worse than being thought to have an affair with a plain single woman of no significance and almost on his own doorstep it was a despicable use of a vulnerable person whose reputation it would permanently ruin the british special branch and various other diplomatic and intelligence sources have a record of some very dubious actions blantyre continued his voice dropped a little some have made them vulnerable to blackmail with all its shabby consequences and of course there are also the idealists who set certain values above the narrow love of country serafina was another little englander like you she kept silent he left the suggestion hanging in the air it was not necessary to spell it out pitt stared at him he had no doubt whatsoever that blantyre meant everything he was saying there was a confidence in him an arrogance that filled the room blantyre was smiling broadly victor narraway would have killed me he said with almost a kind of relish you wont you dont have the courage you may think of it but the guilt would cripple you i like you pitt he said with intense sincerity his voice thick with emotion you are an intelligent imaginative and compassionate man you have quite a nice sense of humor but in the end you havent the steel in your soul to act outside what is predictable and comfortable you are essentially bourgeois just like my father he took a deep breath now you had better go and make sure you save duke alois you cant afford to have him shot in england pitt rose to his feet and left without speaking there was no answer that had any meaning outside he walked along the windy street he was chilled and shivering in spite of the sun which sat low in the sky giving off a cleanedged late winter light was blantyre right would narraway have shot blantyre would he find himself unable to do the same standing with a pistol in his hand unable to kill in cold blood a man he knew and had liked he did not know the answer he was not even certain what he wanted the truth to be if he could do such a thing what would he gain and what would he lose his children might never know anything about it but it would still be a barrier between them and him and what ruthlessness would charlotte see in him which she had not seen before and had not wanted to or vespasia or anyone above all these what would he learn about himself how would it change him from who he was now was blantyre right that his inner comfort was what he cared about most in the end he was walking rapidly not certain where he was going he was less than half a mile from the part of the foreign office where jack worked there were no secrets left about blantyre pitt knew the worst but the resolution as to what to do was lost in the turmoil of his own mind vespasia knew from the moment victor narraway came into her sitting room that he had serious news his face was pinched with anxiety and he looked cold even though it was a comparatively mild evening without realizing she was doing so she rose to greet him what is it victor what has happened his hands were chill when he took hers briefly but she did not pull away i have learned something further about serafina which i am afraid may be more serious than i had supposed tregarron visited dorchester terrace several times i thought at first it was primarily to see nerissa nerissa for an instant she wanted to laugh at the idea then the impulse died really it seems an eccentric idea are you sure no im not sure men do sometimes have the oddest tastes in affairs but now i believe that nerissa was the excuse and serafina the reason she was at least a generation older than he and there is no proof in fact not even a suggestion that they knew each other she pointed out but his father knew serafina narraway said grimly watching her face very well oh oh dear yes i see and you are assuming that perhaps serafina was indiscreet about that too or perhaps others were able to deduce that the present lord tregarron was visiting for fear of her saying something unfortunate who is he protecting though his fathers reputation is his mother still alive yes she is very old but apparently quite clear in her mind his expression was sad and gentle what a devil of a burden it is to know so many secrets how much safer it would be to understand nothing to see all manner of things before you and never add it up so you perceive the meaning it was not necessary for either of them to say more each carried his or her own burden of knowledge differently gained but perhaps equally heavy they sat by the fire for a few more moments then he rose and wished her good night but when he left going out into the mild blustery wind vespasia remained sitting beside the last of the fire thinking about what he had said of course tregarron would rather his mother never heard of her husbands affair with serafina on the assumption that she did not already know but it did not seem a sufficient motive for tregarron to make quite so many visits to see serafina surely there was something else possibly something about that affair uglier and more dangerous than just unfaithfulness she must make her own inquiries the day after tomorrow duke alois habsburg would land in dover there was no time to spare for subtlety it was not a thought she wished to face but she knew who she must ask for this possibly dangerous piece of knowledge she had reached the point where the price of evasion would be greater than that of asking vespasia alighted in cavendish square the next morning at a quarter to ten it had been a long timeover two decadessince she had last seen bishop magnus collier he was a little older than she and had retired several years earlier the footman who answered the door had no idea who she was she offered her card telling him that she was an old acquaintance and the matter was of extreme urgency he looked doubtful his lordship would not be amused should you leave me standing on the step in the street she said coldly he invited her in and in a manner no more than civil showed her to a morning room where the fire was not yet lit it was fifteen very cool minutes before he returned pinkfaced and conducted her into the bishops study there the fire was burning well and the warmth in the air wrapped around her comfortingly she accepted the offer of tea and occupied herself looking at the rows of bookshelves many of the titles she was familiar with from long ago though they were works she had never read herself she found the writings of most of the very early church fathers more than a trifle pompous she heard the door open and close and turned to find bishop collier standing just inside a curious smile on his lean face he was very thin and far grayer than when they had last met but the warmth in his eyes had not changed all my life it has been a pleasure to see you he said quietly but i am concerned that you say it is a matter of such urgency it must be to bring you here after our last parting what can i do to help im sorry she said softly and she meant it the impossible feelings they had once had for each other were no longer there but it had still been wise for them to decide not to meet again they had to consider the perceptions of the outside world he gestured toward the chairs near the fire and they both sat she arranged her skirts with a practiced hand in a single graceful movement perhaps you read that serafina montserrat died recently she began time is catching up with us rather more rapidly than i expected he said ruefully but perhaps that is its nature and ours is to be taken by surprise by what was utterly predictable but im sure you did not come to discuss the nature of time and its peculiar elastic qualities i hope her passing was easy she was a remarkable woman she would have faced death with courage i would be surprised if it had the temerity to inconvenience her overmuch vespasia smiled in spite of herself she was reminded sharply of what it was in him that she had liked so much and why they had decided to stay apart i think it was simply a matter of going to sleep and not waking again she replied the part of it that brings me here is that the sleep was the result of having been given a massive overdose of laudanum all the light vanished from his face he leaned forward a little are you saying that it was given to her without her knowledge or that she took it herself intending to die i find the latter very difficult to believe no that isnt what i am saying she rambled in her mind sometimes forgot what year it was or to whom she was speaking which caused her profound anxiety she was worried she would accidentally let slip a confidence that could do much damage she recalled the terror on serafinas face with acute pain she did make such slips and she was murdered because of it he shook his head are you certain beyond doubt yes but that is not why i have come my concern is with one of the secrets she let slip and the damage it could cause now what can i do to help he looked puzzled the secret concerns an affair she had very many years ago with the late lord tregarron she stopped seeing the change in his face the sudden darkness it would be impossible now for him to deny that he was bitterly aware of what it was she was going to ask i cannot repeat to you things that were told to me in confidence he said surely you know better than to ask there is a very slight deviousness in you magnus she said with a curve of her lips that was almost a smile anything tregarron might have told you may be confidential although the man has been dead for years what serafina told you though i doubt was in the nature of confession is keeping confidence about an old affair really so very important that we can allow it to cost a man his life now and if the worst comes to pass it may be more than one life at stake surely you are exaggerating he demurred but there was no conviction in his eyes this time she did smile you are not built for deceit magnus what is it that you imagine i am hiding vespasia he asked a truth that is a great deal uglier than a mere indiscretion she replied he was married he pointed out reasonably it was a betrayal of his vows to his wife would you excommunicate him for it she raised her silver eyebrows curiously of course not and i daresay he repented i do not have the right to assume that he did not of course you dont she agreed so we may dispense with the fiction that it had anything to do with that but it did i assure you he said immediately a sophistry magnus i gather it sprang from that by having an affair with serafina he laid himself open to blackmail he may have wished profoundly at the time to keep the matter secret he was in a senior diplomatic position in vienna it would have made his discretion severely suspect his gaze wavered for an instant i cannot tell you vespasia you do not need to my dear i can deduce it for myself now that i know where to look i can inform the appropriate people i believe victor narraway is no longer in office he observed this time meeting her gaze squarely that is true his place has been taken by thomas pitt who is married to my grandniece i have known thomas for years his brotherinlaw is jack radley who is assistant to the present lord tregarron vespasia please he began then stopped i assume it was treason of which his father was guilty she said so quietly it was almost a whisper i cannot say he answered but his face showed that she was right she stood up slowly im sorry you deserved better from me than this were it not now a matter of treason and more murder yet to come i would not have asked he rose also you always had the better of me in the end it was not a battle magnus i understood you more than you did me because your beliefs were never hidden it is a good way to be i am glad you have not changed that is your victory dont regard it as anything else he smiled but his eyes were still grave be careful vespasia although i suppose that is a foolish thing to say you havent changed either vespasia had no doubt now what she must do she would have liked to have seen jack at his rooms in the foreign office but she could not go there without tregarron being aware of it instead she would have to speak to emily and hope to impress on her the desperate urgency of what she had to say as it transpired emily was not at home vespasia had to either wait for her or leave and return again in the late afternoon she went home and used her telephonean instrument of which she was becoming increasingly fond however on this most urgent occasion it did not help her she failed to contact victor narraway or charlotte and she did not dare spark curiosity or alarm by trying to reach jack so in the end she returned to emilys home at five oclock she had only half an hour to wait before emily herself arrived aunt vespasia she was instantly concerned the butler tells me you called this morning as well is everything all right what has happened it it isnt jack is it now she was afraid no not at all as far as i know jack is perfectly well at least so far vespasia replied but there is a situation of which he is unaware which may endanger him very badly unless he acts now it will not be easy but i am afraid circumstances may not allow him the luxury of waiting what emily demanded what is it when do you expect him home emily glanced at the ormolu clock on the mantel in half an hour maybe a little more can you not tell me what it is not yet perhaps you would care for a cup of tea while we wait vespasia suggested emily apologized for her oversight in hospitality and rang the bell for the maid when she had requested the tea she paced the floor unable to relax vespasia thought of asking her to desist and then changed her mind when jack got home the butler informed him of the situation he stopped only to hand his overcoat to the footman before he went to the withdrawing room he saw emily at the window she swung around to face him as soon as she heard the door vespasia was sitting on the sofa before the fire the remnants of cookies and tea were on the tray emilys undrunk is it something serious jack said as soon as he had greeted them both i am afraid it is vespasia replied if emily is to remain then she will have to give her word that she will repeat no part of this to anyone at all not even charlotte or thomas and in my opinion it would be better if she left im staying emily said firmly you are not jack responded if i think it is wise i shall tell you afterward thank you for keeping aunt vespasia company until i arrived emily drew in her breath to argue then she looked again at his face and obediently left the room on the way out she instructed the footman to see that no one intruded into the withdrawing room for any reason briefly and with as few explanations as she could manage vespasia told jack what she had learned he stood by the fire his mind racing his whole body feeling battered he wanted to cry out that it was impossible only a collection of circumstances that did not fit together and in the end meant nothing at all but even as the words formed in his mouth he knew that it was not so there were other things that vespasia did not know but that fit into place like the last pieces of a jigsaw the way tregarron had dismissed pitt the contradictions in the reports that jack had tried not to see the small items of information that had turned up with people who should not have known them im sorry vespasia said quietly i know you believed that tregarron was a good man and that it was a considerable promotion for you to assist him as closely as you do but he will be brought down jack sooner or later you must see to it that you do not go down with him treason is not a forgivable offense but jacks mind was already elsewhere tomorrow alois habsburg was due to arrive in dover pitt would go there tonight to be on the train with him when he came up to london tregarron had left the office at midday there was no decision to be made of course tregarron had denied that there was going to be an attempt on aloiss lifehe was the one who was going to make it im going to warn thomas he said his voice shaking i must go immediately well leave for dover tonight please tell emily he turned and strode toward the door jack vespasia called after him i have no time to stay im sorry i know you dont she replied my carriage is at the door take it thank you he said over his shoulder he ran out onto the footpath and looked for the carriage it was only a few yards away he called out to the coachman and gave pitts home address then he stopped should he go to lisson grove sir the coachman waited for his confirmation noright keppel street jack scrambled into the carriage and it pulled away from the curb he sat whiteknuckled while they raced through the streets it was not far but it seemed as if they mustve crossed half of london they skated to a stop he flung the door open and strode over the pavement he knocked on the door which was opened by minnie maude yes sir is commander pitt at home no sir im afraid yer just missed im has he gone to lisson grove no sir es gone ter the railway station how long ago quickly quarter of an hour sir mrs pitts at ome if youd like to see her no thank you he swung around and went back to the carriage he was too late there was nothing he could do now but go home and get money and perhaps a swordstick from the library and go down to dover himself pitt woke up in the morning with a jolt taking a moment to adjust to his strange surroundings and remember where he was it should not have been difficult he had spent enough of the night lying awake staring at the unfamiliar streetlamp patterns on the ceiling of his hotel room in dover this was the day alois habsburg was to land and take the london train from the moment he set foot on english soil he was pitts responsibility he had gone over the plans in his mind trying to think of anything more he could do to foresee the attack exactly where it would come and how if it would even come at all but doubt nagged him had they been carefully misdirected here to dover and duke alois when in reality the crime waiting to be committed was something entirely different in the small hours of the night he thought of the bank of england the tower of london and the crown jewels even the houses of parliament pitt had fallen asleep without any answers now he rose quickly washed shaved and dressed there was time for a quick breakfast and it would be stupid not to eat the best decisions were seldom made on an empty stomach he found stoker in the dining room but they sat separately to draw less attention to themselves they left a few moments apart too it was probably completely unnecessary but better than being careless they were close to the docks anyway it took them only ten minutes to be at the pier where the crosschannel ferry was already approaching pitt stood with his hands in his pockets watching the outlines of the boat as it came closer across the choppy gray water he hunched his shoulders and turned his collar up against the chill of the wind he liked the smell of salt even the tar and oil and fish odors but somehow sea wind was colder it crept through every crevice in clothing no matter how carefully one dressed he knew where stoker was and the other three men he had brought but never once did he look at them he had not asked assistance from the dover police they were there as a courtesy knowing from the austrian embassy of duke aloiss visit but he had weighed the issues and decided it was better not to let them think there was any particular danger he was standing in the wind part of the crowd when he felt a nudge next to him and halfturned jack was standing beside him palefaced cold his coat collar turned up you were right jack said before pitt could speak its tregarron im sorry serafina seduced his father into an affair then because of it he was blackmailed into committing treason it was all a long time ago and obviously hes dead now but the present lord tregarron was desperate to conceal it for his own protection and his mothers too i imagine it it explains a few other things he was doing i should have seen it earlier i didnt want to pitt looked at him with surprise and a sudden warmth of affection you came down here to tell me of course thank you be careful jack warned urgently pitt smiled i will you should get back home before youre missed cant i help you just did we may need you back home yet if tregarrons at the party this evening jack smiled and moved off into the crowd the ferry was nosing in gently in a few minutes the gangway would be lowered the port authority had told pitt that duke alois would be disembarking first it would have been better had he come amid the other passengers less conspicuous but it would have been contrary to protocol and thereby would have signaled that special branch felt unable to protect him under normal circumstances it was a debate pitt had had with himself and he was still not sure if he had come to the right answer he watched as the docking procedure took place it seemed infinitely slow and yet when the slender elegant figure appeared at the top of the gangway dark hair blowing in the wind pitt felt a leap of alarm his mind raced to think of anything he might have missed failed to do or not thought of and what reibnitz if he was really here would have prepared for alois came down the steps slowly giving a slight salute and smiling at the dignitaries waiting at the bottom to welcome him he was followed by four casually dressed very fashionable men around his own age none of them was in uniform pitt was seized with a sudden conviction that they didnt have the faintest idea that there would be any danger they were on a foreign vacation to a country where they had no enemies no rivals and no one who could be anything but delighted to see them the mayor of dover stepped forward and the welcome began it was a long highly formal affair pitt watched the small crowd of people gathered to observe the event or who were simply here to meet their own friends and family he tried to appear as if he was looking for some family member himself he saw stoker and his other men come a little closer as duke alois moved away with the mayor and his officials looks as if he has no idea of danger stoker said quietly as they walked side by side from the dock along the street toward the railway station i suppose somebody did tell him pitt did not reply salisbury had said he had informed the dukeso perhaps the dukes nonchalance was an act he wasnt sure stoker grunted and increased his pace pitt was tense as duke alois and his men stepped up into a carriage and the horses moved off at a walk the general traffic had been held back to allow them passage pitt looked down and across the street but he saw no dust carts no sweepers where was staum he and stoker followed after the carriage on foot watching every movement occasionally glancing up at higher windows above shops and offices the wind was gusty with a light spatter of rain and as far as he could see none of the stores were open still he was nervous he glanced at stoker and saw the same anxiety in his face in the stiff tightmuscled way he walked if there was no attack in dover did that mean it was going to be on the train after all a diversion a crash the station was in sight two hundred yards to go a dust cart trundled by wheels bouncing on uneven stones pitt and stoker stared at the man wheeling it but he was very old and wizened and was steering the cart in the opposite direction fifty yards and then they were there duke alois and his men alighted the mayor of dover conducted them inside pitt and stoker gave a last look around saw nothing suspicious and followed them in the railway station was large and busy a porter pushed a trolley weighed down with trunks and cases its wheels rumbling over the platform a few yards away a family was arguing excitedly children jumping up and down a small boy wailed with frustration a man waved his arms and shouted a greeting half a dozen carriage doors slammed in the nearest train and ahead of them the engine blew out great clouds of steam and smut pitt brushed it off his face unintentionally smearing the dirt across his cheek to stokers amusement for an instant the tension was broken pitt wiped away the smut and they pushed their way past other passengers they reached the train where the mayor was bidding duke alois goodbye his escort seemed far more attentive now standing on the platform looking first one direction then the other eyes searching as pitt drew closer he saw that one of them had a hand out of sight under his coat pitt knew it rested on the grip of his revolver pitt stopped and looked straight at the mans face commander pitt special branch he introduced himself if you will allow me i shall show you my identification before the man could reply alois turned from the mayor and stepped toward pitt smiling he had a pleasant face ascetic and filled with a kind of lopsided amusement he held out a hand how good of you to come he said cheerfully quite unnecessary im sure but a damned decent gesture he spoke english with no trace of an accent pitt offered a hand and met a firm surprisingly strong grasp how do you do sir he replied it probably is unnecessary but it might still be a good idea to get into the carriage anyway if you dont mind certainly cold out here always damned cold railway platforms dont you think with alacrity duke alois gave the mayor a small salute and disappeared into the very handsomely decorated firstclass carriage pitt a step behind him duke alois looked around approvingly oh very comfortable he said with satisfaction plenty of room he looked at his own escort standing to attention waiting for his orders you chaps can busy yourselves doing whatever you do looking out of carriage windows or watching doors or whatever the commander here will have a cup of tea he looked at pitt wont you it was a question but the look in his light blue eyes was level and unflinching in its own discreet way it was an order id prefer to make sure of the rest of the carriage sir if you dont mind pitt answered duke alois laughed for heavens sake man have your fellow here do it he gestured toward stoker im sure hes excellent if you brought only him you cant really imagine that theres anything to worry about there are others pitt told him very good then we shall have a cup of tea and leave them to it come he opened the compartment door and pitt was obliged to accept the duke closed the door sat down in one of the very comfortable seats and crossed his legs indicating the seat opposite for pitt pitt sat down awkwardly narraway might have been versed in the art of conversation to entertain an austrian duke but pitt was very definitely not they could not have had less in common pitt had no interest whatsoever in philosophy or the more abstract sciences he had been told duke alois devoted his time to very good duke alois repeated with a smile stretching out his long legs now we can talk pitt swallowed this was the one nightmare he had not foreseen and he had no idea how to deal with it what possible excuse could he make to escape i was hoping you would come alois continued rather overplayed the bit about staum he went on nasty little swine but actually hes one of ours reibnitz too have to use them now and then i expect you have such men yourself i beg your ppardon sir pitt stammered duke alois looked amused his face radiated a pleasure that made him look more relaxed less studious and far more like a man on vacation was it possible he was even in some way enjoying this had he no conception of danger pitt drew in his breath and tried to speak levelly courteously for all duke aloiss divorce from realityand heaven knew the habsburgs had bred more than their fair share of imbecileshe was still a royal duke sir we cannot afford to take any threats lightly he began i dont alois assured him i am quite aware that it is serious which is why we should have our conversation immediately just in case we should be disturbed sir pitt began duke alois held up a hand please dont interrupt he requested it is the whole purpose of my journey he saw pitts bewilderment a brief wry smile lit his face for a moment then disappeared you find that absurd good that means at least so far i am succeeding pitt gritted his teeth the duke leaned forward now his face was totally earnest you have a traitor in your government commander pitt in your foreign office to be precise i am happy to give you all the details i have which are considerable pitt swallowed he was out of his depth but he did not wish alois to know it and why would you do this sir he asked with what he hoped was an expression of polite interest because i wish to establish a good working relationship with british special branch alois replied i believe we may turn this particular gentleman into a double agent to both our advantages a wild idea occurred to pitt he looked at aloiss face at his level intense stare it was suddenly very apparent that the man had a depth of political intelligence he chose to mask pitt took a deep breath and plunged in you are speaking of lord tregarron i presume his heart pounded so hard it almost choked him slowly alois smiled ruefully like a child whose game has been spoiled he let out a sigh damn i thought i had something worth trading have i tipped my hand for nothing more wild ideas chased across pitts imagination not necessarily he replied i have only just realized tregarrons treason i assume it has to do with his father and serafina montserrat at least to begin with indeed rather before my time even before my predecessors alois replied your predecessor pitt questioned as victor narraway was yours alois answered the difference between your position and mine is only that i prefer to allow everyone to presume that my only interests are science and philosophy intellectual hobbies that are of no practical use it allows me a much greater freedom everyone of importance to your position knows exactly who you are that also must have its advantages but then our systems are different we alas are an empire very much in decline and our emperor is less checked by any parliament than your queen isor perhaps i should say empress since she is empress of india i believe for what purpose might tregarron be turned to both our advantages pitt managed to ask stunned by this revelation alois gave a slight shrug i am head of my countrys special branch as you are of yours i do what i think is in our best interest it is not always exactly what my government would do but then i have knowledge that it does not and perhaps i can see a little further ahead than it can i am sure you will find yourself in the same position occasionally it would be to my advantage if tregarrons information came directly to me doesnt it anyway pitt asked drily unfortunately not it is dictated by mr blantyre the only one who is aware of tregarrons late fathers treason and his adultery with mrs montserrat the present lord tregarron is particularly concerned that his mother who is still very much alive should not learn of it i think she was probably perfectly aware of it at the time pitt observed of the affair probably alois conceded the treason is an entirely different matter how did you know of it by the way i deduced it pitt replied wanting to keep jacks name out of the matter duke alois waited his clear blue eyes steady searching pitts face it was the only answer that fit with certain other information i had pitt told him then he smiled to indicate that that was all he was going to say on the subject i see a pity that i had no opportunity to tell you sooner it is not something i would like known any more widely it would destroy its possible usefulness alois made a slight gesture of regret but he did not evade pitts gaze leaving the question open pitt wanted to weigh every possibility and discuss them with narraway but knew that was impossible he tried to think of any comparable arrangement in the past and could remember none if it had ever happened it was not recorded but then if he accepted duke aloiss offer now he would make no written record of it at least not for general special branch availability he must decide within the next few minutes was he giving alois a weapon to use against him making an agreement perhaps useful to both of them earning a favor that might be reclaimed at some future time were such favors repaid duke alois was waiting fine he said tregarron is a man in an extremely awkward position but he is not a fool duke alois smiled with wry regret and perhaps a touch of pity i know what you mean and of course you are right excellent we shall both prosper from it if we are careful pitt was far less certain but he did not want alois to know that it would make him appear indecisive he tried to keep the doubt from his face and how will you know if the information i give to tregarron is true or false in the first place he asked a gentlemans agreement duke alois said dryly meeting pitts eyes you are a gentleman pitt responded im not you are a gamekeepers son alois said which means you have a good servants sense of honor i am a prince which means i have very little sense of honor at all only such as i choose pitt was startled that alois knew so much about him then realized that he should have expected it he also appreciated that aloiss comments were at least half ironic i imagine that after the affair at buckingham palace you are little inclined to trust princes alois went on whereas i am much inclined to trust a man raised by a good gamekeeper gamekeepers are men who nurture the earth and the creatures on it nature forgives no mistakes nor does special branch yours or mine pitt told him precisely one might say the same of the tides of history alois was very serious now there was no amusement in his eyes only intense emotion pitt could not look away from him social change is coming in all of europe whether the house of habsburg wants it or not alois went on if we release our grip voluntarily it may come without bloodshed if we try to prevent change using oppression then the end will be bloody and the hate will remain emperor franz josef does not agree with you pitt said grimly i know a flash of bitter humor crossed aloiss face there is little i can do about that but what i can do i will which is why i would find it very useful to be more aware of tregarrons information and perhaps have a few more he hesitated more managed details going in both directions pitt understood very well even if he was not as certain of aloiss motives as he would like to be yes he said relaxing just slightly we might think of a few ideas that would be profitable to one or the other of us perhaps even to both duke alois held out his hand without hesitation pitt leaned forward and took it then he excused himself and went to check with stoker fifteen minutes later he was in the hall outside the compartment standing at the window watching the wooded countryside slip by suddenly the train slowed abruptly as if the driver had jammed on the brakes pitt stiffened then turned and sprinted back the dozen yards to duke aloiss compartment stoker he shouted above the screech of the wheels on the iron track the connecting door to the next carriage flew open and stoker was there immediately followed by one of the dukes men the compartment door opened and alois looked out what is it he asked his voice steady but his face tight and pale farm cart on the rails stoker answered looks like its load of hay fell off and it got stuck he looked from pitt to duke alois sir its probably nothing but get back in and keep your head down pitt finished for him he made it sharp an order are you sure it was a farm cart duke alois questioned stoker took a step toward him maybe just an accident sir but maybe not he stopped close to alois as if to push him back inside the compartment the duke glanced at pitt the train jerked to a halt one of duke aloiss men tall thin and darkhaired like the duke himself came down the corridor what the devil is he began a shot smashed the glass of the window the man staggered backward and fell against the compartment wall then slumped to the floor a slow red stain spreading across his chest stoker lunged toward alois and forced him down onto the floor one of the other men kneeled beside the fallen man but pitt knew without bothering to look again that he was beyond help he turned and ran along the corridor toward the end of the carriage throwing open the door on the opposite side he leaped down onto the track his hand already on his gun if he had gone onto the same side as the marksman he would have been a perfect target even an expected one this gave him the cover of the train but it also meant that he had the length of at least one carriage to run before he could get anywhere near the man would the assassin want to take another shot or was he certain he had hit duke alois and so would make his escape immediately who was it tregarron or one of the austrian factions he had believed it was from the beginning tregarron would be alone but if it was a political assassination attempt simply to draw attention or any of the minor nations rebelling against habsburg rule by shooting a member of the ruling family then there could be half a dozen men was stoker staying to guard duke alois he hoped so he was still a target he reached the end connection and dropped to his hands and knees he peered beneath and saw nothing but a narrow strip of woods on the other side was the marksman waiting just out of sight ready to pick off anyone who appeared there had been no second shot he probably knew he had hit someone but he could not be certain it was duke alois he would surely know that someone either british austrian or both would come after him would the marksman retreat a little to a point from which he would see the train but not be easily seen himself whoever he was he had chosen a farm cart to stop the train and a wooded area from which to attack perhaps he was a countryman he was an excellent shot possibly a hunter pitt had grown up in the country as well he had followed sir arthur desmond on pheasant shoots even deer hunts once or twice he knew how to stalk to keep low to stay downwind to move silently he had only a handgun to the other mans rifle which perhaps even had a telescopic sight on it judging from the shot that had killed duke aloiss man pitt must take very great care he went the length of the next carriage as well then dropped to his hands and knees again and peered under no one in sight he scrambled through the gaps quickly and stayed low rolling down the embankment into the underbrush and then up onto his feet again as soon as he was within the copse of trees which way would the man go after making the shot probably to the high ground where he would have a chance of still seeing the train and also of seeing anyone who might come after him a slight hollow would hide him better it was instinctive but how long would he watch the train to make sure he had killed the right man pitt wished he had told stoker to make it appear that they were flustered and in some way to indicate that it was alois who was dead it was too late now but perhaps he would think of it anyway pitt moved forward through the thickest part of the trees the ground was damp he was leaving footprints that meant the other man would also if pitt could find the tracks he could follow him but the assassin would realize that pitt moved as quickly as he could toward where he judged the shot to have come from trying to move silently looking down to avoid snapping sticks or getting tangled in the long winding branches of brambles every now and then he glanced up but all he could see was underbrush and tree trunks with glistening wet bark a lot of them birch hazel and black poplar and here and there a few alder he looked backward once the train was out of sight except for the engine which was stopped a few yards short of the huge hay wagon still splayed across the track its load now largely moved onto the embankment from the way the whole thing listed it seemed that one of the wheels had broken or come off but if it was off somebody would have found a way to put it back on again there were half a dozen men working to clear the track when they did surely the train would go whether pitt had returned or not stoker would see to that or the duke pitt stopped and stood still he strained to hear movement anywhere ahead of him how long would the marksman wait even if he had not seen pitt through his scope he would likely assume his presence or the presence of someone else coming after him why had he not shot at pitt at least when he was on the embankment had he been concentrating on what was going on inside the train pitt could hear nothing except the steady drip of water off the branches onto the wet leaves which by this point in march almost moldered down into the earth was there any water here yes a stream along the lower ground that would be the place to hide tracks what would a clever man do go to the stream leaving footprints easy enough to follow then walk along the bed of the stream leaving no trace at all and then step wherever he would leave the fewest marks perhaps he would even create a false trail and go back into the water again upstream or downstream from his entry how did the assassin get here how would he leave not by train perhaps not by roadat least for the nearest few miles horseback it was the obvious way perhaps the only way in this part of the countryside faster and easier than walking then where was his horse he would have left it tied somewhere the last thing he needed was to come back and find that it had wandered off if pitt could find the horse then the man would come to him and where was the main road from london he turned and started to make for the high ground himself perhaps it would even be a good idea to climb a sturdy tree and look around the horse would be at some point close to the road he increased his pace at the top of the next rise he selected a strong wellgrown alder putting his revolver in his pocket he began to climb it was awkward it must have been at least twenty years since he last climbed a tree it took a few moments to reach a satisfactory height where he could see at least a couple of miles in all directions as he twisted his body the trunk swayed better not to risk going any higher if it broke it would not only send him crashing down to possible injury it would also make a considerable noise and tell the marksman exactly where he was holding the trunk hard with his left arm he looked around as widely as he could searching for the road in the distance it was not hard to see after a moment or two he could trace it from south to north swinging away to the west eventually surely the marksman would have left his horse near it for once he reached the road again he would have escaped pursuit no one on the train had a horse or any way of communicating with the outside world to call for help pitt climbed down carefully and set off as rapidly as he could without making noise in the direction of the road if he was wrong he would lose his quarry completely but he had no way of knowing where the marksman was anyhow every now and then he stopped to listen but he heard nothing more than bird calls and the whir of wings now and then a dog barked somewhere far in the distance a few times and then fell silent he came out on the road about a mile away from the train perhaps a little more he kept to the trees at the side when he had made certain of his bearings he went back into the woods again and started moving very carefully looking for a clearing where someone could leave a horse unseen he had to be quick once the marksman had made certain of his kill and was back here and mounted it would be impossible for pitt to stop him except by shooting him pitt was good with a gun he had learned from his father but a handgun is very different from a rifle or a shotgun he knew his chances of hitting a man astride a fastmoving horse would be pretty poor there would be no time to even make sure he had the right person it could be some innocent rider in the wrong place at the wrong time and the marksman would know all this too pitt moved as rapidly as he could sprinting through the few open patches he came to he was deeper into the woods now he realized it and swerved back toward the road the marksman would have left the horse only far enough in to be hidden from passersby when he found it he almost stumbled into it a beautiful creature moving quietly cropping the grass in as wide a circle as its long tethering rope allowed it it heard him at the same moment he saw it it raised its head and looked at him curiously pitt drew breath to speak then realized the man could be close so he stepped silently back into the shadow of the trees the horse lowered its head again pitt did not have long to wait less than four minutes later he heard the faint crack of a twig a man dressed in brown and green stepped out of the shadows and walked toward the horse which lifted its head again and blew through its nostrils taking a step toward him the man had a rifle with a telescopic sight fixed to it it was lord tregarron pitt stepped forward his revolver raised high pointing at tregarron if you move any closer to the horse i will shoot you pitt said very clearly not to kill but enough to hurt very much indeed tregarron froze pitt moved farther out of the shadow of the trees tregarron had killed a man he would inevitably learn that he had not hit duke alois could he be charged with attempted assassination there would have to be a trial it would inevitably expose the dukes secret position was the bargain duke alois had proposed still useful it was a risk but then it always had been pitt came farther forward angling closer to the horse so tregarron could not get behind it and spoil his clean shot the revolver was pointed at tregarrons chest tregarron smiled pitt knew its cruel twist was out of fear failed didnt you he said with malice edging his voice you let duke alois be killed not likely to remain in your position much longer especially when the austrians tell london who he really was you didnt know did you alois pitt raised his eyebrows is that who you were aiming at he saw a moments doubt in tregarrons eyes id like to let you think you succeeded but youll know soon enough that you didnt tregarron blinked not sure if he was being lied to or not but you did kill someone pitt went on poor chap was one of aloiss men resembled him certainly tregarron was standing stiffly the rifle still in his hands put it down pitt told him or what youll shoot me how would you explain that im out for a ride in the country thought id shoot a few rabbits youre a fool good idea shooting rabbits pitt lifted the barrel of the revolver an inch higher might shoot a few myself dont be so damn stupid tregarron snapped youre supposed to be on a train guarding the head of the austrian special branch not strolling through the woods shooting at small animals youre right pitt agreed i wasnt shooting at small animals i was shooting at the man who killed one of aloiss companions didnt see his face never realized it was one of our own foreign office staff a little of the color drained from tregarrons skin you cant try me in court even if you imagine that you could find proof youd create a scandal but his voice was hollow this will look like an accident tragic but no ones fault not even mine for incompetence pitt asked sarcastically shouldnt i have foreseen that we would have one of our aristocratic ministers wandering around the woods shooting at rabbitsat head height roosting in the trees were they the blood surged up tregarrons face and his grip tightened on his rifle till his knuckles were white but as it happens pitt went on i dont wish to try you i have a much better idea you will pass me your rifle then i will take your horse and ride to the nearest public transport back to london you will walk to wherever you wish i will say that i did not find the man who murdered our unfortunate austrian visitor and in return for that favor at whatever time i wish in the future you will pass on certain information that i will give you to your connections in the austrian government tregarron stared at him as if he could not believe what he had heard then as he studied pitts face he realized with horror that he really meant it and if i should hearand i would hearthat you have passed it incorrectly then you will be exposed as the traitor you are pitt continued and your fathers treason would become equally public as would his regrettable affair with serafina montserrat you filthy bastard tregarron spat im a bastard because i would rather use a traitor than shoot him in cold blood and create a scandal i could not control pitt asked the sarcasm back in his voice i suppose thats a matter of opinion mine is that you have betrayed your country rather than allow your fathers treason to be exposed or your mother to be embarrassed you had better make your choice quickly i am not going to wait and what is to force me to keep my word tregarron asked fear of exposure pitt replied succinctly pass me the rifle slowly as if his limbs hurt to move tregarron obeyed pitt took the rifle still keeping his revolver pointed at tregarron then he moved very carefully to untie the horse and walk it beyond tregarrons line of sight before he mounted it slinging the rifle over his shoulder he urged the horse into a trot along the road at home at keppel street charlotte awaited pitt with intense nervousness she kept telling herself that there would be no attack in dover that the train journey to london would pass without incident she busied herself with household tasks but would stop halfway through pace around then forget what she had been doing and start something else ave yer lost summink minnie maude asked anxiously charlotte swung around oh no thank you im just wondering if everything is all right which is quite stupid because i cant help even if it isnt the telephone rang and she was so startled she flinched and let out her breath in a gasp instead of allowing minnie maude to pick it up she dashed into the hall and did it herself yes i mean good afternoon there was a pause while the exchange made the connection then charlotte it was pitts voice and she was overwhelmed with relief where are you are you all right when will you be home she asked im still in kent i am fine and i shall be home late he replied please make sure you go to the reception with aunt vespasia or with jack and emily and stay with them the whole time i shall come when i can why are you still in kent she demanded are you sure youre all right is duke alois all right and stoker we are perfectly fine and you will like the duke when you meet him and ill explain later please just go with aunt vespasia or emily i am not hurt in the slightest really oh thank heaven for that yes ill go with emily and jack already she knew what she meant to do it was the opportunity she needed ill see you there she replaced the receiver with a smile then immediately she picked it up again and asked to be connected to emilys number she had only a few moments to wait before emily herself was at the other end emily its me thomas has been held up and cannot accompany me to the reception at kensington palace may i come with you please i i would like to she said it gently it mattered very much there was a moments silence then emilys voice came back over the wire filled with relief of course that would be excellent it will be like it was years ago going together she stopped not sure how to finish what are you going to wear charlotte filled in the silence i want to wear black and white its the only new really grand gown i have emily laughed oh thats wonderful i shall wear the palest possible green that is your best color charlotte said sincerely then we shall take them by storm emily agreed we shall call for you at halfpast seven she laughed it was a light happy sound goodbye goodbye charlotte replaced the receiver and went upstairs overwhelmed with relief smiling all the way minnie maude i think perhaps it is time i prepared for the evening she called from the landing jemimas door opened on the next floor she would want to help too offer advice and dream of the day when she would attend such events charlotte arrived at kensington palace with emily and jack it was a trifle tight inside their carriage but both sisters looked superb emilys gown was huge in the crown of the sleeve the nilegreen silk gleamed like sunlight on still water and the huge skirts when swept around revealed a silver lining underneath it was slenderwaisted and low at the neck diamonds shone at her neck and ears and on a bracelet over her elbowlength white kid gloves charlottes choice was entirely different it was a fine sheer silk black overdress with a gleaming white gown beneath the effect was all light and shadow and when she moved it had a most extraordinary grace the ribbon of black satin around the waist accentuated the natural curves of her body and she wore pearlandjet jewelry with crystals that also caught the light in momentary fire she knew that as she followed emily in she drew more eyes and she held her head a little higher feeling the warmth flush her cheeks she did not normally consider herself beautiful but perhaps for this occasion she would make an exception the queen herself was not attending she came to very few functions these days only those where her absence would have been a serious dereliction of her duty as monarch the prince and princess of wales were traveling abroad sofortunately for pitt considering the affair at buckingham palacethey were not here either the atmosphere was relaxed with plenty of laughter amid the clink of glasses somewhere just out of sight a small orchestra was playing lush lilting viennese music so that one could not help but wish to dance vespasia arrived escorted by victor narraway she was always beautiful but it seemed on this occasion that she had paid more attention to her appearance than usual she wore a gown of soft violet its skirt was not as large as many and the narrowness of it was very flattering especially to someone of her height who walked as if she could have balanced a pile of books on her head without losing a single one she wore a tiara a very slender thing a mere suggestion of amethysts and pearls watching her charlotte found herself smiling at what a striking pair vespasia and narraway made and knew that jack who was beside her with emily on his other arm was wondering why she looked so delighted they moved on talking politely making conversation about anything and nothing she missed pitt it was odd to be here alone in spite of the magnificence of the palace with its great highceilinged rooms and its sweeping marble staircases in spite of the wit glamour and ceremony surrounding her there was an emptiness charlotte thought of adriana blantyre and for a moment she felt tears prick her eyes would his love of austria be enough to bring evan blantyre here in spite of all that had happened she scanned the room to see if she could find his familiar figure twice she thought she saw him but when she looked more closely it was someone else she had been in the palace over half an hour when she was introduced to duke alois habsburg he was tall and a trifle thin with dark hair and an agreeable slightly absentminded expression but the moment his attention focused on her she saw the bright intelligence in his eyes how do you do mrs pitt he asked with a smile how do you do your highness she replied with a very slight curtsy she would not have wished him harm but she wondered why pitt had to risk his life to defend a man who played at academic pursuits for pleasure and served no actively useful purpose someone made a joke and duke alois laughed but he did not move from standing almost in front of her a young woman in pink was staring at them both clearly waiting for alois to notice her at least that was clear to charlotte the duke appeared not to have realized it i imagine your husband will arrive soon he said to charlotte yes sir she replied forcing herself to smile back at him he has been held up i dont know why i apologize dont you alois raised his eyebrows his expression was agreeably interested they stopped our train put a hay wagon across the track he said it as if he was commenting on something as trivial as the weather she barely saw the shadow of grief in his eyes unfortunately they shot my friend hans your husband went straight after the marksman without hesitation charlotte was stunned suddenly the hubbub of laughter and music drifting from the other room seemed to fade away im so sorry how is your friend she asked quietly i am afraid he is dead he replied only his voice changed not the bland look on his face i think he may not have suffered it was a perfect shot straight through the heart she could not think of anything to say she felt foolish he looked like me he said there was a catch in his voice that he could not hide your husband is a good man i look forward to knowing him better perhaps you will come to vienna one day you would enjoy it it is a beautiful city full of music ideas and history she took a deep breath i look forward to it thank you sir he smiled then turned away to make polite and meaningless conversation with the young woman in pink at the farther side of the room emily was standing beside jack they also finished a courteous discussion and drifted from one group to another where is thomas jack said very quietly to emily why isnt he here i dont know emily replied but wherever he is charlotte isnt worried about him are you sure he asked anxiously she wouldnt show it if she were of course im sure emily said with an elegant shrug of exasperation shes my sister id know if she was pretending he looked at her with a raised eyebrow you havent read her very well over the last few weeks she flushed i know and im sorry about it i thought she was being very selfimportant she took a deep breath i was she did not add that she had been afraid that jack was out of his depth with his promotion to tregarrons assistant that was something he might guess but she would rather that he did not know it for certain charlotte and i understand each other better now she added she knew he was still looking at her so she flashed a quick confident smile and saw him relax now she wondered how worried he had been and decided she would prefer not to know either it would be a good thing for them both to have the chance to deny things and for each to be able to pretend to believe the other she tucked her arm in his lets go and be polite to the duchess of whatever it is shes a fearful bore it will take some concentration all you need to do is listen he replied he placed his hand momentarily over hers in a quick gentle gesture then removed it again instantly and walked forward with her beside him thats not enough she whispered leaning closer you have to smile and nod in all the right places and try not to fidget or let your eyes wander to other people almost under the great chandelier narraway was standing next to vespasia for a moment or two they were not engaged in conversation with anyone else where is pitt he asked quietly charlotte doesnt look worried but he should be here with duke alois ive seen stoker dressed like a footman but that isnt enough she looked at him closely you think something could happen here in the palace its unlikely he replied almost under his breath but it isnt impossible she was alarmed she turned to face him studying his eyes his mouth trying to read whether it was fear or merely caution that moved him his eyes were shadowed nearly black the lines around his mouth scored deep such a scandal here she whispered he put his hand on hers his fingers warm and strong oh nothing so melodramatic my dear far more likely to be a quick scuffle in the shadows of a corridor and then a body behind the curtains to be found in the morning she searched his eyes and saw no laughter at all nothing beyond the wry gentle irony that softened his words i dont know where thomas is she answered his first question i think something might have happened that we are not yet aware of duke alois looks as if he is mastering his emotions with some difficulty and i have not seen lord tregarron have you no please dont inquire for him he stopped uncertain how to continue i wont she promised at least not yet this time he did laugh so quietly it was almost soundless of course you will he said ruefully but please be careful i have an awful feeling that this threat is not over yet my dear victor our concern with threats will never be over at least i hope not and so do you you would rather go out in a blaze of glory than die of boredom as would i but i am not ready to do so yet he took a deep breath and i am not ready for you to either she felt a distinct warmth of pleasure then i shall endeavor to see that my next blaze of glory is not an exit line pitt arrived at kensington palace just under two hours after the reception had begun he had been home to keppel street and washed shaved and changed into his evening suit leaving tregarrons rifle locked in the wardrobe he had then eaten a cold beef sandwich and drunk a cup of tea then with his revolver in his pocket which felt lumpy and conspicuous he had caught a hansom cab paying extra to the driver to take him with the greatest speed possible he remembered the jolt of the train stopping and then the shot the splintered glass and the blood as the dukes man fell the devils luck or a brilliant shot he thought the latter had the victim been chosen to accompany duke alois because he looked so much like him had he known that and still been prepared to take that risk had pitt made the right decision in turning tregarron rather than arresting him for hanss murder he might never have proved it and even if he had what would have been the result a major scandal a foreign policy embarrassment of considerable proportions possibly the loss of his own position for political clumsiness or alternatively it would never have come to court anyway that would have left an impossible situation yet it galled pitt that the man had attempted to murder duke alois had instead murdered the dukes friend and would now walk away from it with neither injury nor blame he entered the glittering reception hall feeling absurdly out of place and yet he did not look outwardly different from the scores of men standing around talking to each other and to the gorgeously gowned women in their brilliant colors their jewels sparkling like fire in the light of the huge chandeliers pendent from elaborate ceilings his eyes searched the crowd for charlotte he saw emily he recognized her fair hair with its diamond tiara and the pale liquid shade of green that suited her so well she looked happy he also saw vespasia but then she was usually easy to see in any crowd she was beside narraway and they were talking to each other heads bent a little what could charlotte be wearing blue burgundy some warmer color that flattered the rich tones of her skin and hair lots of women were wearing such shades all the skirts were enormous the sleeves high and almost winged at the shoulderit was the fashion he saw duke alois briefly laughing at some joke or other and smiling at a duchess he looked exactly the pleasant absentminded sort of academic he affected to be the serious and idealistic man who was willing to risk his life to carry a dangerous burden of secret office the man who had seen his friend shot to death only this afternoon seemed like something pitt had dreamed it was small wonder tregarron had tried to kill duke alois what man would not want to rid himself of such mastery by another such power to manipulate or destroy what he had done he had done to protect his fathers name and his mothers feelings not a bad motive most people would understand it pitt still could not see charlotte he gave up trying from this vantage he went down the steps slowly and into the crowd hardly anyone knew him so he had no need to stop and acknowledge people how had alois known of tregarrons vulnerability that was something that could not have come from serafina montserrat she had been active long before duke aloiss time and he had not been to london before yet pitt could not rid himself of the belief that it was serafinas crumbling memory that had fired this whole complex series of events it was serafinas memory of lazar dragovics death that had driven blantyre to kill her and then to kill adriana blantyre also knew about tregarron he had said as much so had blantyre told duke alois about it that made no sense at all blantyre might have cooperated with duke alois within limits but he would never have given him or anyone else control of his own means of power the secret knowledge that enabled him to manipulate tregarron then like the sun rising on a hideous landscape the whole picture became clear in his mind blantyre would want duke alois dead now as long as he was alive he could also control tregarron with duke alois dead no one but pitt knew the secrets and blantyre discounted pitts courage to act perhaps he also believed that if duke alois was murdered while under pitts protection in london pitt might be disposed of surely it would not be too difficult a task pitt was now the head of special branch but he had not proven himself yet he was still something of an experiment a man risen from the ranks of the police rather than a gentleman from the military or diplomatic services kill alois and blame pitts incompetence and blantyre would be the only man left with the power to manipulate tregarron into telling vienna whatever blantyre wished and learning whatever he wished in return he needed both duke alois and pitt out of the way for tregarron to be of use to him it had to have been blantyre who had sent tregarron to kill duke alois today it would have worked perfectly pitt would like to have seen blantyres face when the duke arrived this evening very clearly alive and well where was blantyre was he here he started to look more earnestly he would have to find charlotte later he pushed through the gaps in the crowds excusing himself brushing past turning from right to left searching for blantyre he ought to be able to spot him he was a little taller than average and he stood and moved with a unique kind of elegance a trifle stiff he carried his head in a characteristic way pitt glanced over to where duke alois had been talking to a duchess or whoever she was she was still there but now she was speaking with a large middleaged man pitt turned around slowly taking a deep breath and letting it out between his teeth he could not see the duke one of his men was standing over near the wall but there was a slight frown on his face and he too was looking from side to side pitt started to look for emily her fair hair and the pale green of her gown might stand out yes there she was and jack was still beside her excuse me pitt said hastily brushing his way past a woman in a mulberrycolored silk gown she glared at him but he barely noticed he walked right between two elderly gentlemen excusing himself again he must not lose sight of jack here i say a young man protested as pitt bumped him he in turn trod on a womans skirt which was a fraction too long for her im sorry pitt said over his shoulder and kept going jack he called just as jack appeared about to begin a conversation with a young man wearing lush side whiskers jack jack turned startled thomas whats wrong excuse me pitt said to the young man something of an emergency he took jacks arm and pulled him to the side several steps away from the nearest group there was an incident on the train this afternoon one of duke aloiss men was shotkilled outright jack looked appalled the blood drained from his face his eyes swept down pitt to reassure himself that he was unhurt then a flash of relief filled his eyes im sorry the duke himself is putting a hell of a good face on it or is he too stupid in his studies for physical reality to touch him he does know i presume yes and hes anything but out of touch i promise you do you know who it was yes but this is not the time to explain the duke was here a few minutes ago but i cant see him now blantyre was behind the shooting and i cant see him either i think hell try to finish the job here for gods sake thomas the place is full of women and where better pitt cut across him no one will be expecting it duke alois and his men will think hes safe i nearly did until i realized exactly why blantyre has to kill him he cant afford to let him get back to vienna jack gulped what do you want me to do find the duke tell him youre my brotherinlaw and keep him in the middle of a crowd any crowd what about you im going to find blantyre and do what for gods sake arrest him but if he forces me to ill shoot him as soon as he said it pitt was not certain if he would do itif he could he was not even certain if he could prove that blantyre had murdered serafina jack stood motionless for an instant then he gave a very slight nod and turned on his heel disappearing into the crowd immediately where would blantyre have gone one of two places he could hide in the crowd where he would be concealed among hundreds of other men dressed in exactly the same fashion however his face was known so people would stop to speak to him to express condolences over adrianas death the alternative would be to stay out of sight almost altogether in the darker narrower passages any place where he would not be expected change his attitude his grace of stance or movement andfrom the back at leasthe would appear like anyone else even a servant the footmen were in livery but there were always others a butler a valet even a messenger of some sort and if he really meant to kill duke alois he would have to do that when he had privacy he would not intend to be caught pitt went back up the stairs taking them rapidly they were too wide and shallow to take two at a time unless he drew attention to himself by doing it at a run at the top he stopped looking for more private rooms corridors anterooms galleriesanything away from the crowd if he could find stoker he would ask for his help but he had no time now to look for him he too could be anywhere there was a door to his left it was as good a place as any to begin he had opened it and gone inside when he realized how much better it would be to get some order into his search blantyre would not wait forever for the duke he would stalk him go where he knew the duke would be and sooner or later get him alone where the room where the orchestra was playing a gallery beyond that a corridor a lavatorythe one place where a man could spend a few minutes and expect quite reasonably to be alone blantyre could close a door and be there indefinitely unseen pitt walked away from the room toward one of the footmen standing at the bottom of the stairs excuse me he said calmly can you direct me to the gentlemens lavatory please the most convenient if there is more than one just the one available to guests sir the footman replied if you go along there to your right he gestured discreetly so no onlooker would have been aware of where he was pointing it is the third door along that passage sir thank you pitt accepted and walked quickly in the direction the man had indicated he came to the door hesitated a moment then turned the handle and went inside it was beautifully appointed with half a dozen stalls each with its own door only one was occupied was blantyre in there waiting until duke alois came surely in the course of the evening it was certain that he would pitt stood silently with his back against the wall his heart pounding seconds ticked by there was no sound from the occupied cubicle perhaps alois was already there already dead or unconscious and dying while pitt stood out here like a fool there was a noise outside footsteps mens voices pitt turned his back to the room and pretended to be drying his hands on a towel behind him two men came in he glanced around neither was alois he went to the basin and washed his hands slowly as if he had something under a fingernail after several minutes first one man left then the other the door at the far end remained locked there was no sound from within was it someone ill someone dead if it was blantyre waiting for alois why had he not even looked out to see who had come in more minutes went by another man came in and left was pitt standing here incessantly pretending to wash his hands while outside blantyre was stalking alois and perhaps catching him was the duke already stabbed and bleeding to death behind some curtain pitt went to the outside door and pulling it open abruptly slipped out he closed it then waited how had alois walked upright but not like a soldier with grace a sort of lanky elegance as if nothing troubled him he tried to picture it exactly a slight swaggera very slight limp as if his left leg was just a little stiff he walked away a few steps turned and walked back trying to imitate alois he put his hand on the door and opened it then went in walking casually dragging his left foot so slightly he was not even certain it was enough he swallowed gulping air the last door opened and he was looking at evan blantyre a long curved knife in one hand for a silent burning second they stared at each other then pitts fingers closed around the revolver in his pocket and he lifted it out slowly blantyre smiled you dont have the courage he said slowly pitt did not take his eyes from blantyres you killed serafina adriana and lazar dragovic blantyre added he was a traitor to austria but you cant prove any of it austria is not my territory pitt told him london is austria is the heart of europe you provincial fool blantyre said between his teeth get out of my way and london is the heart of england pitt replied which is irrelevant except that it is my responsibility you blackmailed tregarron into trying to kill duke alois and only ended up killing his friend instead but one dead man is as important as another you cant prove that either without exposing tregarron and his father and the whole sordid mess of treason and youll expose duke alois as well of course blantyre said so there isnt a damn thing you can do now get out of my way and dont oblige me to hurt you pitt stood still his heart beating so violently he felt certain he must be shaking his hand ached gripping the revolver blantyre moved the knife a little so the light caught its blade what are you going to do stab alois pitt asked his voice roughedged blantyre paled a little because you cant afford to leave him alive pitt added there was a flash of understanding in blantyres eyes perhaps of the knowledge that he couldnt afford to leave pitt alive either for an instant he moved the knife a fraction then let it fall again you cant arrest me youd only make a fool of yourself and you dont have the nerve he said very softly im walking out of here and ill find duke alois another time perhaps ill follow him back to vienna no reason i shouldnt youre out of your depth pitt pity because i liked you he gave a slight shrug and took a step forward everything that blantyre said was true pitt raised the revolver god forgive me he said to himself and fired the sound was deafening for an instant blantyres eyes were wide with amazement then he staggered backward against the cubicle door and it crashed open behind him he fell his chest soaked in red he slithered to the floor and lay still pitt forced himself to walk over to the cubicle and look down blantyres eyes were still open and sightless pitt felt his stomach twist violently with regret hours seemed to pass before he heard shouts and footsteps along the corridor he put the revolver back in his pocket and took out his identification he had it in his hand when two men in dinner suits flung the door open and stopped abruptly narraway was immediately behind them jack radley on his heels god almighty the first man exclaimed his face ashen staring first at pitt then past him to the open door and blantyre covered in blood lying on the tiled marble floor narraway pushed past him then stopped pitt started to speak cleared his throat and started again i am thomas pitt head of special branch i regret to say that there has been an unpleasant incident but there is no danger now you might be civil enough to inform duke alois habsburg that the immediate danger to his life is over the first man gaped then turned very slowly to narraway narraway looked at him his eyebrows slightly raised quite right ponsonby he said he is precisely who he says he is and the facts are as he states be a good chap and get everyone out of here while we have someone clear this up will you when they were gone too numb with shock to argue narraway closed the door well done pitt he said quietly itll hurt like hell youll dream about it as long as you live but thats the price of leadership making the gray decisions blackandwhite ones are easy any fool can deal with those youll have to live with it but if you hadnt done it you would have had to live with every grief that followed because of it he smiled very slightly i always knew youd do it no you didnt pitt replied his voice hoarse narraway shrugged i believed it more than you did thats good enough then he smiled and held out his hand pitt took it and held it hard thank you simple words but he had never meant them more
