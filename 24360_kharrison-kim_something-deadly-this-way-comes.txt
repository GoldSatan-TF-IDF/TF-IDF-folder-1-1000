something deadly this way comes the third book in the madison avery series a novel by kim harrison prologue im madison avery dark timekeeper in charge of heavens hit squad and fighting it all the way funny how timekeeper never popped up on my careers good for you when i did the test at school the seraphs say i was born to the position and when the choice was take the job or die well i took the job fate the seraphs would say bad choice if you ask me even now i dont believe in fate and so im stuck working with a confused dark reaper who is trying to understand and a light reaper twice fallen from heaven who thinks my ideas are a lost cause instead of just following orders sent down from above i want to do things my own way which involves trying to convince people to change my only hope is to locate my real body so i can give the amulet back and forget the entire thing happened because convincing heaven that i can save lost souls is looking impossible itd be a lot easier if my own people werent working against me chapter one the hot sun seemed to go right through me reflecting off the aluminum bleachers to warm me from my feet up as i stood beside nakita and cheered josh on he was running the twomile in an invitational and they were doing the last bit right on the track the front three runners had begun to pick up the pace for the last hundred yards josh was ahead but the guy behind him had saved some push for the last bit too go josh run run nakita yelled and surprised i lowered my camera to look at her the dark reaper didnt especially like joshshed almost killed him onceand her excitement was unusual her pale face was flushed and her eyes usually a faded blue were bright as she leaned forward and grasped the chainlink fence between us and the track she was wearing a pink top with matching pink nail polish to hide her naturally black nails opentoed sandals and capris helped her blend in and she looked nothing like one might imagine a dark reaper capable of smiting lost souls i was dressing down todayat least for mein jeans and a black lacy top my hair though was its usual purpletipped cut hanging around my ears and i still wore my funky yellow sneakers with their new black laces with skulls on them they matched my earrings hes right behind you the angel in disguise shouted and her matteblack amulet sparked violet at its core more evidence she was excited shaking my head i turned back to the race bringing my camera up and focusing on the finish line i snapped a picture for the school paper as josh squeaked over the finish line my smile was full of a quiet satisfaction that hed won he won he won nakita exclaimed and i gasped when she pulled me into jumping up and down with her i couldnt help but give her a hug back breathless as i caught my balance she certainly wasnt acting like one of heavens hit squad as excited as if she was joshs girlfriend which she wasnt i might be maybe barnabas nakita shoved his feet where he reclined two rows above us josh won say something the former light reaper pushed his hat up and gave her a dry look whoopee he said sarcastically then pulled his long legs closer and sat up squinting in the sun madison you were going to work with me today on hiding your amulets resonance grimacing i looked down at the jetblack stone cradled by silver wires that i wore around my neck besides giving me the tactile illusion of a makebelieve body hiding me from black wings and giving me my connection to the divine my amulet sang sort of mimicking a natural aura the black stone rang like a bell that only the divine could hear anyone who knew how to listen could find me in a secondbe they friend or foe which might be a problem if i was out trying to keep my own people from killing someone and which was why i needed to learn how to hide it after hanging out with josh of course she can do that later nakita said primly he won i felt a twinge of guilt i had promised to work with him after school but id forgotten id also promised ms cartwright id take pictures of the track meet for the school paper sorry i said softly and he shrugged making no effort to hide his boredom for all his sour attitude barnabas had been on earth longer than nakita and therefore had all the subtle nuances of human behavior to fit in with the track moms and cheering girlfriends better than nakita his lanky build and faded tshirt only added to his sighworthy looks but barnabas truly didnt have a clue how good he looked nakita didnt know why guys followed her around looking for dates either that the two of them hung out with me had the popular cliques crosseyed this was his only race i offered hesitantly and barnabas leaned back stretching out on the warm bleacher to put his hat over his face turning back to the track i snapped a picture of josh as he accepted the congratulations of his teammates sweat made patterns on his shirt and his blond hair was dark with it he was the only one apart from barnabas and nakita who knew i was technically dead not only had he been there as i had died but he had held my hand during the whole thing yep i was dead no heartbeat unless i got excited or scared no need to eatthough i could do it in a pinch to fit in and i hadnt had so much as a nap in months it had been fun at first but now id give just about anything to enjoy a juicy hamburger and crispy fries everything sort of tasted like rice cakes i didnt know you liked sports i said to nakita as josh waited for the runners to pass before crossing the track to talk to us through the fence we have contests she said this has the same appeal her gaze went from the runners to the moms chatting among themselves barely conscious of the meet at all i came in third once with the blade she added barnabas snickered his face still hidden under his hat real good with that scythe eh he muttered and she smacked his foot and where did you place she asked him hotly sitting up barnabas watched josh his eyes not seeing him but the past they didnt have contests when i was in heaven i winced barnabas had been kicked out of heaven before the pyramids had been built sorry nakita said surprising me with her downcast eyes she usually took every opportunity to needle barnabas about his fallen status according to nakita barnabas had been kicked out of heaven because hed fallen in love with a human girl hi josh i said as he scuffed to a halt behind the chainlink fence almost lost that one he said breathing heavily when he smiled at me i felt warm inside wed been dating for a while and his smile still hit me hard and his kisses even more but you didnt nakita said back to her serious self again it was a good run josh gave her a quizzical look probably wondering at her earnest expression thanks he said then wiped the sweat from his neck i hadnt sweated in months not since id died is that your last race i asked already knowing yup josh waved to the guy calling him from the finish line i gotta go but do you want to go to the low d with me later the low d was the local hangout short for the lowest common denominator three rivers was a college town and the students got the joke even if no one else did his eyes rose to take in nakita and barnabas all of you he added somewhat sourly it was hard to find the time to be alone with josh between school my dad my job at the flower shop and dont forget being the dark timekeeper stealing every free moment of my day and night one might think that not needing to sleep would give you tons of time but it didnt already guessing my answer barnabas sighed from under his hat it was likely going to be after sundown before i practiced shielding my amulets resonance but a quiver went through me and my heart or at least the memory of it gave a hard thump and went still sure i said smiling small word heavy in significance josh stuck his fingers through the mesh and i touched them josh and i had been through a lot together especially considering our rocky start when i was his pity date at prom we were doing good now even with the dark timekeeper stuff butting in smiling with half his face and looking charmingly beguiling josh pulled back finally turning to face his friends as he walked away nakita was scowling when i turned around you promised barnabas youd practice she said surprising me its okay to put off practice to watch josh run but its not okay if i want to socialize a little i asked absolutely it was reaper logic and i knew i couldnt win sad thing was she was probably right turning away i sat on the bleachers to wait for josh barnabas was behind me smelling of feathers and the back of cloudsand yes the back of clouds do have a smell ignoring me nakita went to stand at the fence watching the stragglers come in i wondered if she ought to go out for crosscountry then squashed the idea she was here to protect me from myself not learn how to run the twomile but all thoughts of practice and the low d left me when without warning a blue ink seemed to pour from the sun hitting the earth and boiling up like smoke it bled across the ground washing over people oblivious to it turning me cold in the time it took to pull my head up the blue had risen to encompass everything puppy presents on the rug im going to flash forward my heart gave a pound and stopped as a quick wash of fear slid into me the last time id flashed forward to see the future i had cried at the stars and felt like i was going to die then i fell into someone elses mind and lived out the ugly moment when they began to kill their own soul that had been almost a month ago and i didnt know what scared me more that i might have to live through that hell again or that the seraphs were giving me another chance to prove that killing a person wasnt necessary to save their souland i might screw it up according to gracemy annoying often missing guardian angel and heavenly liaisonalthough the seraphs didnt cause my flash forwards they could stop them or make them come early sort of screen them to make my transition to a fully functioning dark timekeeper easier it wasnt like i had a real teacher having been dumped into the position youd think that the seraphs themselves would take on the job of assigning reaps permanently but apparently angels had a hard time figuring out what was now what was then and what was to be and it took a human to understand time i happened to be in charge of the bad guys the ones who killed people before they killed their souls id rather be in charge of the light who tried to stop the killing but thats not what had happened voices faded in and out through the blue mist as i waited for the future to take me madison you can practice at the low d nakita said kicking the fence to make it shudder the distraction will be good barnabas its no wonder she never learns anything with you teaching her at midnight on her roof i clutched at my knees terrified that if i moved id find myself convulsing on the ground the moment when a soul begins to die is traumatic and it rings through the time lines and into the future causing the flash forwards the deeper into the future the hazier the vision is ranging from a crystal clarity to a murky nothing that only voices could penetrate which meant that if i was the first timekeeper to flash forward i didnt necessarily have the advantage ron the light timekeeper might flash later but clearer and pull the reap right out from under me guys i whispered and then gasped when the entire track with its runners coaches and blue lawn chairs was suddenly superimposed with a scene that was possibly a hundred miles distant and probably days into the future and though i clutched at the ribbed heat of the aluminum bench i also stood on a chalkdecorated sidewalk staring at a threestory apartment building with old cars out front and a busy road behind me traffic at a standstill there was fuzzy blue haze at the edges of my vision and around every person like a second aura the night was an awful mix of orange and black as the building burned flames leaping high to show clusters of neighbors huddled together dogs barking and people screaming fire trucks spewed air scented with diesel fuel to the curb which billowed up and warmed my ankles roaring everything was roaring and then i realized it was the blood in my head as heartache gripped me johnny is still in there the thought echoed in our shared mind terror that belonged to the girl whose body i was in filled me and i felt myself stand wobbling on the bleachers i was flashing forward living someone elses nightmare this was when her soul started to die when something so bad happened that she forgot how to live i was the only one who might be able to save her johnny i shouted and nakita turned to me i could see her shock and the image of a burning building grew behind her and melted into the reality of the track meet shes flashing i heard barnabas say and his hand clamped over my arm keeping me from running forward as the girl whose mind i was in bolted in my vision i ran through the cars dodging firefighters trying to stop me the blue haze rising from people like a fog in reality i felt my heart pound as i locked my knees and swayed so i wouldnt run as well i left johnny alone he was asleep i waited until he was asleep after mom left for work oh god mom is going to kill me when she finds out i dont understand how can there be a fire johnny i whispered as the girl screamed then jumped when a heavy hand clamped onto my arm and both the girl and i turned i blinked wavering when i saw barnabas behind the frightening image of a fireman in full gear his breath hissing as he tried to keep me from going in the crowd in the bleachers was standing cheering on the last of the runners fighting it out in my vision the fire screamed a surreal counterpoint to the terror filling me barnabass hand was on my arm and he peered at me in sympathy johnny is in there i said and the fireman stared his expression hidden behind the face mask let me go let me go i have to get in there as one the girl and i twisted in barnabassthe firemans grip and as one we were hoisted into their arms i tried not to fight knowing it wasnt real but the girls terror was mine i had no heart to beat in my solid makebelieve body but memory is a funny thing and i felt the echo of a pulse as barnabas carried me taking the jarring steps down the bleachers and to the cooler shade below the night bathed my heated cheeks scorched by sun and fire as barnabas set me on the ground and the blue haze that clouded the image of the distant future billowed from the fireman but not the angel im sorry both barnabas and the fireman said for two different reasons behind the fireman i could see an ambulance the lights were off and i felt my life end when they put a small covered body into it the sheet was pulled over it all the way for an instant she didnt know what that meant but id been in a body bag before and somehow when nothing i was thinking could reach her this did oh johnny we sobbed as the reality hit her in my vision i started to cry as i watched the flames eat the roof of my room but my tears were for johnny he was gone and i cried for both johnny and his sister as i had a vision of his round face and transformer pajamas hed had fish sticks for dinner i had been so mean eating the last one when i knew he wanted it im so sorry im so sorry i sobbed my throat tight as i hunched against the bleacher supportside of the fire truck nearby was a fireman giving me half his attention so i wouldnt run away nakita was superimposed on him making sure no one came close enough to know what was going on behind her the blue sun shone down on the track meet they were preparing to set up the next race amid the blaring of loudspeakers and the honking of trucks as a new water tanker came in my brother was dead it was my fault i shouldnt have left him alone i got up or at least i did in my vision i was starting to find the way to dissociate myself from it so i could just watch making the heartache in the girl easier to bear barnabas holding me might have had something to do with it too my fingers traced the name of the city on the fire truck baxter ca my gaze rose and i saw the street sign coral way my heart pounded as i realized i had some control of this memory that had yet to be lived here you go tammy a smokesmudged man said draping a blanket smelling of too much fabric softener over my shoulders i shivered unable to speak but i had a name now and that would help your mom is coming he added and tammys panic slid through me anew oh god mom i turned to the fire in a panic i wanted to undo this but i couldnt johnny was dead it should be me there not him not him madison nakita said and i blinked at the man as his features melted into hers are you all right i had to run away leave facing this was too awful and the guilt made it hard to breathe i should be dead not johnny he was my brother and now he is dead because of me it should have been me it should have been me madison barnabas was calling my name and i gasped as the two realitiesone real one yet to be livedclashed violently the blue tint flashed red and then the future vanished the echo of my heart pounded and i stilled it as i stared up at barnabas nakita and josh above me people cheered the last runner to cross the line it was over i had flashed into someone else lived the foretold deathstrike of her soul and survived i swayed trying to shake the guilt and heartache over the girls brothers death tammy her name was tammy her belief that she caused her brothers death still rang in me a despair so heavy that it crushed all else and denied her soul the love it needed to survive she would run mentally if not physically from those who would help her live again and her soul would wither and die long before her body did fate the seraphs called it but i didnt believe in fate the old dark timekeeper kairos would have sent nakita to kill tammy without a thought taking her soul to save it at the expense of her life ron the current light timekeeper would in turn send a light reaper to stop the scything saving her life at the cost of her soul gambling that she would somehow learn to live again but i wasnt the old dark timekeeper and i was going to use the opportunity to prove to the seraphs that fate could be sidestepped and we could save her life as well as her soul all we needed to do was show tammy a different choice smiling weakly i extended my hand josh took it pulling me to my feet i brushed off my butt and shivered in the shade i gazed across the track remembering the vision of billowing smoke and fire leaping as if it was a living thing silent they waited i looked at them seeing barnabass knowing resignation that this was not going to be as easy as i wanted it to be nakitas fear that i was going to ask her to do something she didnt understand and joshs eagerness to do something anything different you guys up for a field trip i asked as one they all exhaled josh grinning widely and how chapter two the gravestone i was standing behind came up to my chest and i rested my arms across the top the dry hot breeze shifted the purple tips of my short hair in and out of my eyes as i waited for barnabas to come back from his onfoot reconnaissance nakita was taking shots of the tombstones with her camera always ready in her little red purse and josh was trying to keep from throwing up after his first angelassisted flight nakita insisted shed chosen to land in this graveyard because the school was directly across the busy street but i thought that it might be a dry sense of humor developing in the otherwise humordeficient and deadly dark reaper id admit the graveyard was probably a better choice than the fastfood place next doorespecially with josh still hyperventilating i glanced at joshs hunched shaky outline as he leaned against a nearby grave marker his gym bag at his feet and his back to me as he recovered it probably hadnt helped that we hadnt just been flying but flinging as well the awful nothingness of traveling between space was frightening at best and the first time nakita had wrapped her wings around me and flung us from indiana to a greek island on the other side of the earth had been awful i suppose kaiross island was mine now since i had his job and he was dead but whether we were there to give josh a chance to catch his breath or because of nakitas idea of a joke the graveyard was quiet and out of the way with a good view of the buses lining up on the far rightcar pickup on the left wed crossed a couple of state lines to get here and it was only three in the afternoon school was just now letting out smelling lightly of sweat and tennis shoes josh wobbled his way over to me i gave him a smile and shifted down to make room and together we leaned on the stone our elbows touching i was glad he was here do you see her he asked his blue eyes finally starting to show his excitement no i said mentally thanking beatrice whose stone we were leaning on i never saw tammys face i figured i was lucky to see the name of the town and her street and that the fireman knew her name but im sure shes in there i indicated the school with my chin and he eyed me your timekeepersense tingling eh he kidded me and i gave him an embarrassed look uh yeah actually i said not wanting to admit that id felt an odd sort of shiver through my aura when we had flown over the school the same thing had happened on my last prevention and i was going to trust it this time so how are we going to find her josh asked watching the kids just now starting to file out in threes and sixes nakita who was taking sideways pictures of a pollutionstained statue dark with smoke and mold said without looking at me i could find her with a street address and a description of her aura but if you flashed forward then ron probably has too we need to move fast before he puts a guardian angel on her and we cant do anything we have at least a day i said and nakita looked at me from around her camera the flash forward was fuzzy around the edges i explained you only get the clear visions when its just hours ahead grimacing i looked from her to the school i think the seraphs sent this one to me early knowing im not good at this yet though why they wanted to help me was a mystery maybe they didnt like ron my timekeeper opposite i knew i didnt or maybe they hoped that once i got better at this that id start to believe in fate not free will whatever the reason i was sure that we were at least a day ahead of rons natural seraphunassisted flash forward and i wasnt going to squander it nakita glanced at barnabas and when he shrugged she looked at the school through the lens snapping a few shots the school is still the best place to look she said standard reap stuff go where the humans are the shutter clicked and she straightened frowning at the back of the camera one of her pictures in our schools expo at the mall had won top honors and nakita had been taking shots ever since ron i thought scuffing my yellow sneakers against the stone and wishing the annoying man would ignore me like most adults did ron worked for the light instead of the dark and though we both believed in the same thingthat choice was stronger than heavens fatehed rather slap a guardian angel on someone than try to get to the root of the problem and change their life which was exactly why i was causing trouble with the seraphs gods mucketymuck high angels and trying to change things even after having already saved one persons life and soul i knew no one but barnabas believed i really had a chance and most times i wondered about barnabas if we cant find her here well just go to her apartment and wait i said scanning the skies past the shifting leaves for black wings the mindless dripping sheets of black always seemed to congregate when a scything was about to occur in the hopes of snitching a bit of unattended soulwhich sometimes made me wonder if the creepy things could read the time lines as well as a timekeeper dark reapers on the hunt brought them in faster than crows on carrion that they werent here was a good omen i hadnt seen one in months partly because nakita hid her resonance much of the time and partly because she wasnt hunting josh turned to sit with his back to the stone digging in his gym bag he brought out his phone im going to text my mom tell her ill be home later if anyone asks im with you i looked at my watch and added two hours good idea where are we supposed to be the low d okay so i lied to my dad i didnt feel that good about it but he wasnt going to believe i was somewhere in california much less dead and trying to change heavens policy on culling lost souls the soft scent of feathers drew my attention and i smiled as barnabas strode across the graveyard hands in his pockets and eyes roving no light reapers no black wings and no grace he said running a hand over his frizzy loosely curling hair and squinting at the buses you want me to go check tammys apartment no grace i couldnt help but wonder why hed brought grace into question but i nodded glancing at nakita as the snap on her purse clicked shut shed put her camera away refusing to let barnabas be involved in anything she wasnt you remember the address i asked coral way he said then touched the top of my hand ill come back and tell you if shes there echoed in my thoughts and i jumped blinking i stared at him nakita had been shielding my resonance since leaving three rivers so ron wouldnt know where we were if he checked up on us and i hadnt known it was possible to touch thoughts while shielded but barnabas had been touching me physically so maybe thats how he was able to bypass the shield hey nakita said eyes flashing a divine silver for an instant no passing notes josh closed his phone and looked up at us in question relax barnabas said sourly as his fingers slipped from the top of my hand i was just making sure that it was possible he paused then said see she didnt hear that because im shielded i said and barnabas nodded his gaze across the street and on the cars lining up i figured his sudden sour mood wasnt coming from nakitas mistrust but from his ability to talk to me silently at all it meant he wasnt a light reaper anymore he was moving toward the dark side toward me that a light reaper had abandoned his millenniumlong beliefs to follow me into the enemy camp was a sobering thought if i could get nakita and him to work together to save a marked persons body and soul then i might be able to convince the seraphs to do things my way and the early scythings would stop for good if if if and if i couldnt then as soon as i found my body hidden somewhere between the now and the next i was giving up my amulet and going back to being normal alive and knowing nothing about reapers timekeepers and guardian angels but the thought lacked the thrill that it once had i wanted this to work bad josh got to his feet his gym bag in hand shifting awkwardly at the tension between nakita and barnabas hey um im going to go behind the mausoleum and change okay ill be right back he turned and walked away to the small building nearby gray with age and neglect i watched him go thinking he looked good confident two kids passed him on their bikes cutting through the cemetery as a shortcut school was out and i turned back to the buses hearing kids yelling at each other beside me nakita fidgeted i was starting to feel the tension too and i leaned back from the grave marker brushing the bits of old stone off my shirt as i looked for black wings this felt like a real reap i had flashed forward i had found the place i was trying to find the mark if i wasted my head start a light reaper would show up to stop me it didnt matter that our goals were the samesave the marks lifebecause if i couldnt nakita would be there to kill tammy sacrifice the body to save the soul it was a sucky reason to die barnabas i said still wondering about grace do you think i should call grace i liked grace but she was my contact with the seraphs and if she wasnt here it might mean they wanted to see if i could do this without her help she was too close to the divine for me to see more than the glow of her wings most of the time nakita barnabas and i could hear her chimelike voice but no one else could grace thought she was a poet which might be why josh seemed to be the only one glad when she was around i wouldnt barnabas said his expression closed and worrying me all the more ill go check the apartment thanks i said softly and he walked away to find a quiet place to find his wings and then the air i thought hed never leave nakita said oh come on i coaxed walking backward to the high fence between us and the street barnabas is okay admit that youre mad hes turning into a dark reaper and get over it him she laughed the day barnabas becomes a dark reaper is the day that ill kiss his amulet silently we watched the kids pouring out of the school each seeming to know exactly where they were going whether she knew it or not nakitas own views of the world were changing when we had first met she had been a typical dark reaper ready to scythe people at a moments notice to save their souls to her the body wasnt important life wasnt important the soul was it had taken me ages to get a grasp of that dark for heavens fate unseen light for humans choice to glean technically speaking it was the light reapers who were the bad guys in heavens sight having been kicked out and banding together to protect those the dark reapers targeted they saved lives at the expense of the soul so who was doing the most good i didnt know anymore nakita was silent beside me scanning faces i wasnt sure if tammy was going to be picked up by her mother or if she was going to ride the bus home maybe trying to find her at the school isnt such a good idea i said maybe we need to get closer i added when nakita said nothing why dont you try to use the time lines to find her she finally said kairos always showed me the marks aura in the time lines so i could recognize him or her by that i winced tammys aura huh i offered thats great except i cant see auras i can nakita said kairos would show me the time line where he flashed and the aura that mixed with his was the one we were looking for we can do this madison her brow furrowed we can find her before barnabas does i bet a knot of tension eased in me and i smiled barnabas the rivalry was that bad even now worth a try i said cheerfully then turned my back on the school and sat down the bars of the fence pushed into my back and the grass tickled my ankles dappled sun made a cool wash of light on me taking a breath i didnt need other than to speak with i exhaled trying to settle myself using the technique that barnabas had taught me my hand crept up and i grasped the stone that was at the center of my amulet the silver wires cradling it were warm and i closed my eyes it was my amulet that let me see the time lines and if i could use it to see auras it would be a very good sign that i was becoming better at this finding the time lines was easy and with hardly any effort i found the bright glow of the present shifting off into infinity now all i had to do was find tammy on it everyones life had a different color or aura i couldnt see auras but barnabas had gone over them countless times as we sat on my roof and waited for the sun to rise for most people the color was a reflection of their age and state of mind and could change with the seasons but for reapers it was a reflection of what side of the fate or freewill fence they were on light reapers tended to be a dark red in color and dark reapers violet and those in the middle a neutral greenish yellow when id first met barnabas his amulet had been a respectable dark red now though it was clearly moving up the spectrum showing more certainly than actions that he was starting to doubt his own beliefs doubt in an angel was a scary unexpected thing like finding out rocks were really made of water my original aura had been blue or so barnabas had once told me now it was violet so dark it was basically black thanks to my timekeeper amulet it was easy to find my aura in the bright time line looking almost like a sinkhole beside me was nakitas cheerful violet glow her thoughts weaving among mine barnabas was absent but if i looked down the fabric of time into the past i could see where he had been with us josh too as i settled myself joshs aura jumped from somewhere else joining mine and nakitas he was back from the mausoleum and i didnt need to open my eyes to know it is she flashing forward again i heard him whisper no nakita said softly shes searching the time lines for the marks uh tammys aura really josh said and i heard him drop his gym bag what color is my aura blue she said tersely shhh as soon as she said it my entire thinking realigned given a name the resonance i was seeing from josh suddenly made sense blue joshs resonance was blue i could see it in my mind so much clearer feeling more confident i left the bright glow of josh and nakita to scan back a few hours earlier to the tangle of lines where i flashed forward at the track meet i could feel nakitas presence beside me and together we looked to where my past twined with another the weight of it seeming to make a dip in the fabric the aura with mine was a sort of sick greenish color with a flash of orange at its center beside it was a bluish yellow one slightly smaller her brother it had to be and i eagerly opened my eyes josh was staring at me having crouched to put us eye to eye and i grinned right back at him i couldnt decide but there might have been a soft blue glow around him until the sun washed it out maybe i had a chance after all if i was really able to see auras was that her nakita asked impatiently the greenish orange one you saw i said relieved and she nodded smirking almost as i let go of my amulet and the last visage of the time line vanished from my thoughts tammy has issues she said suddenly a lot more interested in the kids filing into buses or getting into cars but most seventeenyearolds do seventeen same as me or would be if i was alive josh stood extending a hand to help me up i took it feeling a tingle between us the glow about him seemed to strengthen and i could see a red striation running through it hovering even closer to his skin it looked like it was fading though like a bruise his neardeath experience maybe nakita was holding the bars of the fence her head gently resting between them as if she was in jail i felt like i was one of the dead spying on the living okay technically i was but being behind the graveyard fence only strengthened the emotion nakitas eyes closed and she breathed deeply theres like twenty people the right age that have auras like that she said lets get closer red purse tucked under her arm she headed for the impressive gate her sandals silent on the mown lawn i brushed my jeans glancing at joshs school pants and shirt he was going to be hot but it was better than his running shorts and tank top if it helps tammys brother has a bluish yellow aura i said loudly i saw that nakita turned to show me a worrisome smile predatory eager her fingers were on her amulet the origin of her power and the source of her scythe beside me josh hesitated shes not going to kill her right i shook my head feeling he was right to ask i picked up the pace to catch up with her nakita i asked warily nakita stopped her hand on the gate and her eyes on the kids there were fewer standing around outside now and the first of the buses was leaving i wont allow ron to put a guardian angel on her she said tightly youd just better get barnabas to do his part but im telling you this isnt going to work marks never listen ace did i was arguing with a brick wall but even brick walls could be broken down okay i admitted as she tilted her head and raised her eyebrows questioningly at me so ace is fated to live a short violent life but his soul isnt meaningless anymore and he gets people to think i protested and what about shoe now that he isnt taking the blame for trashing the hospitals system he can help prevent that computer terrorist attack in the future you cant tell me thats a bad thing life is transitory she muttered a whisper of doubt in her voice only the soul matters checking to see that she had her precious camera she lifted her head and started for the chipped curb josh laughed and we bumped shoulders as he took my hand and we followed like magic i felt as if the sun was warmer the air fresher and my step lighter his hand in mine was cool and he gave me a little squeeze cementing our connection josh put up with a lot from me and i was grateful he was here short violent life or not i was proud of our success with ace not only had we saved his soul and life but we managed to keep his best friend shoe out of the crapper too it had been really hard though and our success was as much due to shoe working to save his own skin as me barnabas and nakita trying to save it as well together josh and i stepped up beside nakita at the curb squinting into the sun at the unfamiliar school i know that everyone thinks that ace was a fluke i said softly as joshs hand slipped away with a last squeeze thats why we have to do it again tucking her purse under her arm nakita shrugged clearly she didnt believe it was possible but as far as i was concerned this scything was already going better than the last nakita had agreed to not kill tammy unless she was sure she couldnt be helped and we knew where tammy lived we were halfway there is that them nakita said suddenly and i followed her pointing finger to a blonde girl standing impatiently with one foot on the steps of a bus the other on the sidewalk she was yelling at a cluster of boys still on the school steps their heads together over a handheld game shes got a greenish aura with that orange center hold your horses a darkhaired boy yelled back making an ugly face at her ive got to get to a portal or im going to lose my place youre going to lose your ride home you idiot she yelled back mom is going to be ticked if she has to leave work to pick you up again johnny the memory of my heart gave a pound and vanished johnny that was tammys brothers name the girl turned in a huff and stomped up the stairs in the line of buses the second one revved its engine and left two more to go until tammys could leave your sister is a witch i heard one of the boys say to johnny but johnny was too engrossed in his game to comment thats them i said suddenly worried now what josh fidgeted as the next bus left are we getting on my lips pressed nakita could only carry one person in flight and i didnt want to separate guys the bus is leaving josh said motioning for us to run for it johnny the girl shouted out her window get on the bus a surge of excitement raced through me lets go i said and we all broke into a jog the bus was revving its engine we slipped on right after johnny stomping up the stairs nakita first then me and lastly josh hey the driver said clearly not recognizing us then he blinked i could feel my amulet warming and guessed that nakita was doing something the drivers gaze suddenly went unfocused and i scrambled past him and into the aisle when he reached to pull the door shut josh barely made it i blew my breath out in relief thanks to nakita the driver either didnt see us or didnt care the kids though knew we didnt belong and about fifteen pairs of eyes stared at us as we made our way down the aisle nervous i worked my way to the back where tammy sat with two girls one with her and one behind them leaning over the back of their bench my unease grew as several pairs of eyes took in my purpletinted hair and someone snorted at my yellow shoes hand going to my amulet i touched on the divine long enough to bend light around it hiding the stone i could still feel its original shape but as far as anyone knew it was just a silver chain i jumped when josh touched my hand and he grinned for having surprised me leaning forward his breath tickling my neck and sending a shiver through me he whispered im going to sit behind johnny see if i can learn anything okay i whispered back and he flopped into an empty seat closing his eyes to look bored his foot though was jiggling he was enjoying this and that made me feel good being the dark timekeepers girlfriend was hard it ought to have a few perks there i said to nakita pointing out the empty seat in front of tammy nakita sat stiffly her nose wrinkled as if she smelled something bad i agreed with her i hadnt ridden the bus since id gotten my car a year ago course my car was still in florida with my mom but id rather ride my bike in the rain for five miles than take the bus now i gingerly leaned back my feet spread wide for balance as i fell into the halfaware stupor that the bus had always engendered in me slowly nakitas posture eased as she took in my slouch and the barely contained havoc of the rest of the bus it was noisy id forgotten that part oh joy the bus lurched and i propped myself straight as we hit the main road slowly the noise evened out and the roaring of the diesel became a background hum okay id found tammy now the question was how could i convince her to stay home tonight so her apartment wouldnt catch on fire johnny wouldnt die and she wouldnt lose faith in herself and the world it wasnt like i could turn around in the seat and tell her to make a better decision or her brother was going to go to the big arcade in the sky oh its to die for a loud voice said too bold to be comfortable on my ears i saw it last night his pants are so tight you could bounce a peanut butter cup off them and i swear his shirt had a new button undone in every scene good god jennifer tammy said what is it with you comparing boys to food so what the loud voice protested im going to see it again tonight with chris you want to come we can invite dan and double date ive got homework a new voice said from right behind me sort of a soft quiet voice that sounded like it belonged to someone who had been beaten down one too many times by her friends i knew that voice it had never been mine but i knew it homework jennifer snorted i knew you wouldnt come i was talking to tammy beside me nakita started fiddling with her amulet i glared at her not wanting her to draw her sword barnabas would have a fit come on tammy jennifer coaxed you like dan right nows your chance to find out how good he can kiss uh my mom tammy started and jennifer laughed pleeeease she moaned there is no way your mom will find out shes working yeah but its not like i can sneak out with johnny around the little brat will tattle on me so wait until hes asleep were going to the late show anyway the image of a burning building drifted before my eyes and again the terror of tammy seeing the quietly flashing ambulance with its small covered stretcher filled me i turned my head just enough so i could see jennifer leaning over the back of tammys seat her arms dangling her expression was mocking and i recognized that pissed look tammy was now wearing id been goaded by people i thought were my friends too she was going to do it not because she wanted to sit in a dark theater with dan but because she didnt want jennifer to think she was chicken look jennifer said gum snapping wait for your mom to call at nine like she always does and then come out when bug boy is asleep easy peasy youll be home by twelve thirty the girl who had begged off with homework had her lips pressed silently telling tammy to say no jennifer saw it and pulled back a little youre chicken she said derisively i sighed knowing what was going to happen next am not i held the edge of the seat as we took a corner looking away when jennifers eyes met mine for a second then ill see you at ten thirty the girl said and i could feel her eyes on me still fine tammy said and the memory of her terror hit me again you cant i exclaimed turning in the seat the three girls and nakita stared at me nakita in wonder jennifer in anger and tammy and her last friend in bewilderment who asked you you freak jennifer said loudly my face warmed but it wasnt like i could just turn back around i uh i stammered madison is not a freak nakita said hotly shes trying to save tammys soul my eyes shut and i cringed when they opened tammys eyes were wide and the girl with her looked afraid jennifer started to laugh i was mortified god did nakita even have a clue how lame that sounded even if it was true what the hell jennifer said are you some kind of bible school reject my temper got the better of me and i squinted at her honey the stuff ive done and gotten away with would put your daydreams to shame i said anger shoving my embarrassment to the back of my mind to deal with later so listen to me when i tell you sneaking out isnt worth it the sound of the fire roaring was echoed in the buss engine and i stifled a shiver as i looked at tammy seeing her new resolve i realized that speaking out had done more bad than good she wanted freedom she wanted to make her own decisions but she clearly thought that making her own decisions meant doing the opposite of what her parents said was good for her id call her a fool but id been the same way myself until i had died trying to make a point that i was no ones little girl they were still staring at me maybe i should try a different tack look all im saying is that stuff goes wrong sometimes i said what if your little brother gets hurt a burglar could break in or the building could catch on fire hed be all alone jennifer flopped back into her seat in this town you gotta be kidding me nothing happens here mind your own business nakita reached for her amulet and i gently kicked her ankle her gaze shot to mine her eyes seeming to say i told you so i was hot with anger i dont know how because i was dead and didnt really have a body but i was definitely warm disconcerted i turned around very aware of them still staring at me i couldnt bring myself to look at nakita i didnt want her to be right there was no way that i was going to spend the next thousand years sending out assassin angels to end lives in order to save souls i stood when the bus lurched to a halt nakita rose with me were getting off what about her my eyes were fixed on the front as three kids filed off tammy will be fine until tonight we need to leave before i shove my amulet down jennifers throat i looked back at nakita who still hadnt gotten into the aisle come on we know where she lives or barnabas does nodding nakita followed me to the front were leaving josh said as i touched his shoulder but he immediately picked up his gym bag and stood from the back of the bus jennifer said in a mocking falsetto going home to play tea party with your dolls josh winced at my pressed lips and warm cheeks time to leave gotcha before madison learns how to use her amulet and scythes the wrong girl nakita said clearly amused i cant believe i just blurted it out like that i berated myself i am such an idiot didnt go well huh josh asked as he filed out behind nakita and we all got off the bus thats one way to put it i said hands on my hips and staring at the bus from the sidewalk tammy was watching me and jennifer was making angelic faces looking heavenward i hated that they were laughing at me especially with josh watching nakita and josh were beside me and i held my breath as the bus drove away the three kids who got off with us gave us a long look before heading down the sidewalk madison josh asked and i exhaled its okay i said trying to get rid of my anger i hadnt handled it well but it was only my second scything we know who she is and what shes doing tonight thats more than we did ten minutes ago i glanced at my watch surprised to find out it had only been just that long barnabas is probably a few houses up i said as i put my hands in my jeans pockets and started to follow the buss route you want to just walk it josh immediately shouldered his bag and fell into step beside me nakita though lingered behind head down arms crossed over her middlethinking chapter three the loud bang of the laundromats door hitting the wall brought barnabass eyes up from where he sat with an untouched vendordispensed coffee before him i watched the woman who just left drag her bratty kid to the busy street not even using the crosswalk to dart over the six lanes to reach the apartment complex on the other side the building was the same one from my flash forwardminus the fire trucks the airconditioning was on in here but it was humid from the dryers and it smelled like bad coffee and fabric softener the place was empty now apart from us and josh leaned over to open the dryer that someone had left going the heat billowed out to warm my feet and slowly the noise died to nothing josh slid from the dryer sighing as he went to stand before the concession machine he jiggled the change in his pocket before exchanging it for a doublestuffed massive cookie the size of a plate i looked at it enviously as he brought it back and slumped into the couch beside me nakita was in the chair next to barnabas and i propped my feet up on the table you found the place okay i asked barnabas as josh took a huge bite white cream squishing out the back barnabas nodded running a hand over his loose curls as his gaze went out the window to the apartment building how about you did you find tammy nakita rolled her eyes and set her purse on the table she blew it my brow furrowed and barnabass eyes widened shes dead she is not dead i said then lowered my voice when an attendant poked his head in before vanishing into a back room a sitcom laugh track rose faintly and i leaned toward barnabas i know who she is blonde bossy and thinks madison is a wacko nakita said as she snapped open her purse and brought her camera out focusing on the rows of silent washers lids up she added you just had to blurt it out hey im not the one telling her im trying to save her soul i said and barnabas exhaled loudly totally unperturbed nakita looked at the back of her camera and the digital screen stay home or youll ruin your life was the first thing out of her mouth we had to get off the bus glancing at barnabas she added did you see tammy get off barnabas pulled himself out of his slouch could have i saw a girl the right age get off the bus with a boy she looked scared i nodded that was probably her jeans pink shirt blonde yup she lives on the third floor corner apartment barnabas sipped his machinemade drink grimaced and set it down sweet seraphs this is bad so what happened on the bus my focus blurred as i thought back to it maybe i hadnt screwed things up too badly other than she and her friends thinking i was a freak of a goody twoshoes i dont know if she looked scared maybe shell stay home tonight instead of going to the movies to swap spit with david it was dan nakita said and i rolled my eyes dan then but if her brother doesnt die she wont run away right problem solved nakita though didnt look convinced as she exchanged a worried look with barnabas what i asked thinking they knew something i didnt josh turned his cookie around to lick the cream squishing out he looked happy and content and i shifted my leg until our knees touched he smiled as he looked up making me glad he was here with me dont you ever stop eating nakita asked him no josh turned to look at the vending machine you chipped your nail polish nakita gasped immediately checking her fingernails then bending first one sandal up to check her toes then the other i did not she exclaimed indignantly barnabas was smiling and josh held the last of his cookie up madison you want one i shook my head and nakita glared at him she doesnt eat mortal its still polite to ask josh said chewing and if i was able to blush i would have barnabas did they tell you yet that madison identified tammy by her aura a jolt of excitement raced through me and i sat up having forgotten my success there no barnabas said looking as happy as i suddenly felt madison thats fantastic how long have you been able to see auras i cant i said though i was starting to wonder nakita too was smiling again she looked back through at the time line to where she flashed so i could see tammys aura resonance shes a fish green with an orange center barnabas said cryptically shes got issues fish i asked wondering if it was some kind of code my aura is blue josh said barnabas looked askance at him i know he said then turned to me so you talked to her you scared her you think it was enough i shrugged glancing at joshs cookie i dont know its not like i zap back home when reality realigns itself i want to talk to her again theres a good idea ignoring barnabas i licked my lips wishing i was hungry that looks good josh josh beamed as he stood up ill get you one she doesnt eat josh nakita said dryly then took a picture of everyones feet and the crumbs he had made i shook my head and josh sat back down thanks anyway i said softly ill be glad when i learn how to look between the now and the next and find my body im tired of not being hungry nakita froze and i looked up to find her staring at me her eyes blinked and in a sudden motion she shoved her camera into her purse ill be outside watching the apartment she said then walked quickly to the door her back stiff and her pace stilted the door hit the wall making a bigger dent and then she was outside standing with her arms crossed and her head down in the fading sun bewildered i looked from josh his mouth full and chewing slowly to barnabass resigned expression what did i say i asked josh shrugged but barnabas winced shes worried that once you get your body back that youll dissociate from your amulet and leave her so am i worried i looked out the plateglass windows those black wings you put in her left some of your memories in her she knows you better than anyone on heaven or earth and shes afraid ill be okay but nakita you taught her what its like to fear death and she thinks that once youre gone no one will understand her and people will think shes more of a square peg than they already do oh god how do i get into these messes josh jumped when his phone vibrated excusing himself he went to answer it and give us some privacy at the same time my gaze dropped and i ran my fingernail along a groove in the table looking up i gathered my determination i dont want to give up being the dark timekeeper i said but if i cant make this workif i cant convince the seraphs that the early scythings are unnecessary to save a persons soul before it goes bad then im not going to stay around to send reapers to kill people who are too scared or frightened or just plain stupid to find joy in life barnabas looked out the window his hat pulled low over his eyes you wanted to know what was bothering her thats it he was being unusually callous and i frowned you dont think id rather stay here with you i almost growled crumpling up joshs cookie wrapper im trying to make this work so is she barnabas leaned forward she hasnt been on earth as long as i have she doesnt understand about human choice and the fragility of your dreams and the strength that lies in your hopes and faith angels see everything in black and white and the earth was made to be colorful think about what youre asking her to do she is all about the soul madison life is secondary to her life is transient and youre asking her to risk someones soul for an extension of something that to her is a blink of an eye but all we have is that blink i said miserably barnabas leaned back and glanced at josh talking with someone on the phone i know its one of the reasons i left heaven i think that nakita is starting to understand shes come a long way my throat was tight and i watched josh close his phone looking as depressed as i felt so have you barnabas i said softly frowning barnabas looked away i knew he wasnt happy about leaving his lightreaper status my special talent seemed to be screwing up everyones life sighing i watched nakita standing in the lowering sun looking perfect and worried she wasnt a fallen angel like barnabas but one in good standing so far but id scarred her changed her forever when i had accidentally put two black wings inside her they had been eating me alive when id lost contact with my amulet and had fallen through her like a ghost the black wings had latched on to her and started to eat her memories much richer than mine eventually the seraphs had gotten them out but the memories that the black wings had taken from me were forever a part of her she now knew what it was like to fear something that most angels have no concept of i dont want to leave i whispered barnabas made a small noise then wed better make this work josh shuffled up his eyes darting from me to barnabas i have to go he said in disgust my mom found out i wasnt at the low d with the guys and wants me home oh no i exclaimed guilt from making him lie for me rising up fast josh im so sorry i didnt mean to get you in trouble he shrugged head down as he zipped his gym bag shut i told her i took you to dinner instead and shes not mad but i gotta go put in an appearance youd better call your dad she might have phoned him i hated this lying it made more trouble than it solved but what were my choices here hey dad im on the west coast tonight trying to stop a boy from dying in an apartment fire back after midnight love you throwing my head back i looked at the stained ceiling someone had put graffiti up there and i blinked barnabas silently stood and shook out his long duster like it was his wings ill take you home he offered to josh puppy presents i swore softly standing as well do you think you can come back josh hoisted his gym bag to his shoulder and brushed the cookie crumbs from his shirt i dont know ill cover for you best i can but if anyone asks i left you at the low d with a couple of girls i made a face yeah that was likely i only had one girlfriend and she was out at the curb afraid i was going to ditch her josh glanced at his watch still set for illinois time its almost six thirty at home frustrated he dropped his hand and grimaced i might not be able to get away until after midnight which will be ten here everything might be done by then if were lucky i glanced at barnabas knowing that he wasnt going to sit and wait for josh hed come right back well im going to have to put in an appearance tonight too i said thinking of my curfew at least it was the weekend call me josh smiled at that and my entire frame of mind changed when he edged around the table and took my hands and pulled gently hesitantly i leaned in as he did and he gave me a kiss he smelled like soap and his lips quirked in a soft smile when he pulled away soon as i know whats up ill call he said maybe i can get away sooner okay i felt soft and squishy and i let his fingers slip from mine reluctantly outside nakita was frowning but barnabas patiently waited shifting his gym bag higher josh leaned toward me again and after one last kiss he rocked back smiling come on buck rogers barnabas said as he motioned to the door lets go giving me a last look josh headed for the parking lot whos buck rogers he asked as the door opened barnabas catching it before it hit the wall i slowly sank back down in my chair still feeling the warmth of those two kisses such a small thing but not really my smile fading i watched barnabas talk to nakita the dark reaper glanced at me then away i couldnt help but wonder what hed said to her as he started walking away with josh stretching out my leg i shoved the dryer door shut with my foot then stood to push the button to get it started again the soft hum and sliding schlummp schlummp schlummp of someones jeans slowly filled the steamy room head down i leaned over the adjacent dryer wondering if nakita would come in or continue to boycott me i wished that josh could have stayed but id be lying if i didnt admit that having him at home to help me if i needed it was a comfort being two time zones from home made it hard to cover ones tracks even if one was a timekeeper the faint humming in my legs grew stronger realizing it wasnt coming from the adjacent dryer i pulled my head up the world had gone blue like i was in a gigantic fishbowl in reverse the parking lot beyond the huge plateglass windows was a sunny inky blue but even as i stared the fluorescent lights in the laundromat began dripping an insidious indigo i was going to flash weve done it i thought joyfully eyes alight as i looked for nakita her back to me as she watched barnabas and josh leave why else would i flash forward unless tammy had indeed changed her fate my hand rose to grip my amulet shocked to find it more than warm it was hot nakita i shouted and she turned her eyes widened at something she saw in me and i heard her mental shout to barnabas echo as it hit the top of the atmosphere and bounced back and then the inky black poured from the ceiling lights it billowed up around my knees and like a deadly gas it hit me hard my knees gave way and i fell one hand still holding the top of the dryer the heat of it seemed to burn my fingers and i couldnt see the blue stuff had gotten in my eyes and they were tearing suddenly i realized i wasnt crumpled on the floor of the laundromat with my fingertips warm on the dryer i was in tammy her fingers burning and she was terrified choking hot air burned in my mouth and my lungs ached i couldnt breathe johnny i screamed then hunched over coughing i fell arms outstretched it was dark and i gasped when my cheek hit the carpet the air down here was a blessed few degrees cooler and i cried as i pulled it into my damaged lungs i was dying i had died before and i knew the feeling though tammy didntthe same blackness edging my vision and the same lack of pain filled my arms and legs no i thought confused i had changed things we had talked to tammy this couldnt be the future could it was there going to be a happy ending to this there had to be but the flash forward said otherwise and by the lack of any blue haze it looked like it was going to be tonight not tomorrow damn it id made things worse not better johnny i cried again crawling to his door i found it reaching up to turn the knob and push the door open a wave of sound rushed out over my head and i cowered in the sudden heat tammy i heard him call and i crawled forward scared out of my mind i could smell things burning and my mind walled the horror away everything everything was on fire and then i found him he was blind with terror but at my touch he grasped me and we clung together as the ceiling above us turned into a beautiful rolling orange and red it was mesmerizing even as my eyelashes singed and my nose burned inside tammy im scared johnny whispered coughing and i held him it was too late we couldnt get out crying i rocked him our backs to the wall beside his bed im here i whispered tammys last breath rasping as our twined thoughts were voiced by her alone youre not alone ive got you and then we looked up as a roaring sound of heat sucked a new breath of air into the room an instant before the ceiling gave way everything flashed red i jumped feeling as if someone had slapped me terrified my eyes sprang open barnabas i cried he was crouched before me his eyes intent it was over but what had happened the memory of my heart was thudding after having been inside tammy and slowly it beat one last time and stopped her terror took longer to leave me and i sat there clutching my cooling amulet as nakita and josh clustered around me in concern you came back i said thinking it sounded lame and barnabas shifted a few inches away standing he extended his hand and pulled me wobbling to my feet the humid air of the laundromat seemed cool tears were dribbling from me i slowly leaned back against the thumping dryer my arms wrapped around myself as i started to shake the tears steadily slipping from me it was awful so awful what happened josh asked but i couldnt talk not yet they had died both of them this was so unfair johnny and tammy had died with grace supporting each other in a way that was beautiful and showed the best of a human soul but they had died it wasnt what i had wanted her soul might be saved but it was the end of her life that had bought its purity something changed nakita asked but by her tone of voice she knew it wasnt good i looked past them at the empty laundromat as if it was a dream and would flake into nothing and return me to that hell of existence the fear the hopelessness the love for her brother giving tammy something to believe in they both die i whispered in a state of grace barnabas finished for me his brow furrowed josh rocked back looking worried i would never tell him of the horror id just lived through i didnt save tammys or johnnys life i said all i did was make it so a reaper didnt have to come out here and scythe her early god this sucks depressed i closed my eyes and wiped a tear away i couldnt do this it was too much it hurt too much when things went wrong we have to do something nakita said and my eyes opened she was standing over the table her lips pressed in determination now she said firmly we have to go now but her soul is safe i said wanting to do just that but surprised that nakita did too why do you care her hand on the door nakita paused looking at me to make me shiver her soul may be safe but mine is troubled chapter four the memory of fire trucks that existed only in the future seemed to haze over my sight as i looked across the busy road to the threestory apartment complex having watchedno livedtammy and johnny dying in a fire had more than shaken me it had rocked me to my core id thought that id made a difference but all id done was make things worse josh at least got home safely hed been gone only five minutes and i missed him already i worried that he was going to drift away looking for someone who wasnt being yanked across the continent to save someone she didnt even know someone who didnt have to lie to her dad all the time someone who had friends other than angelsand someone who could eat a friggin bowl of popcorn with him why couldnt i just be normal i sniffed jumping when nakita handed me a tissue from her purse thanks i said as i rubbed the soft paper under my nose and wadded it up in a tight ball god i was going to throw up i knew it im sorry madison she said as she stood awkwardly next to me while we waited for traffic to clear enough to cross me too i said glancing back when barnabas dropped from the sky a soft thump of air giving him away his expression was cross and his wings immediately vanished leaving him a slightly surly broody teenager in dark pants a faded band tee and a black duster totally at odds with the hot weather he shoved his hands in his pockets and joined us at the curb just back from his quick trip to take josh home josh said he was going to cover for me but i was likely still going to have to make an appearance for my dad before too long i turned back waiting for a light to change about half a mile up the road barnabas was upset looking positively angry as he scowled at nakita something clearly on his mind id be concerned but disappointment clung to me like a second shadow made worse by the darkening sky heat stored in the asphalt rose and i brushed the hair from my eyes as i scanned the skies for black wings that wouldnt be coming no id fixed everything up just jim dandy thanks to me tammy would die without reaper intervention the seraphs were probably tickled three shades of happiness i was truly the dark timekeeper able to convince people to kill themselves after a few minutes conversation you do not have a soul barnabas muttered to nakita out of the blue shocking me only creatures of the earth have souls souls i wondered my thoughts going back to nakitas last words before he had left and i turned to see her standing with her lips pressed and her grip tight on her red purse i do too she said defiantly but she looked frightened as well i fear she said as if finding strength in it for the first time im creative i think i could love i say that means i have a soul it might not be perfect like madisons but ive got one and it might be in danger if i just let tammy die bemused i looked at them both nakita flustered and looking like shed done something wrong and barnabas angry and surly you guys dont have souls i asked and barnabas dropped his gaze to his faded sneakers angels dont he said bitterly almost jealously even ones kicked out of heaven a semi clattered past and i held my hair to my head who says i have a soul nakita said firmly but her expression was haunted i have a piece of madisons mine how could she have a part of my soul i dont think i can give it back to you nakita said im sorry she was pleading looking both frightened and desperate her blue eyes pinched in concern its just a little sliver from yours it got stuck in me with the black wings ill ask the seraphs to try to take it from me if you want it back it might make things easier i dont think were supposed to have one no i said immediately and barnabass eyes squinted no i said softer you keep it are you sure i mean i dont feel like im missing anything nakitas smile was blissful as if a great guilt had been lifted from her i feel it she said firmly i knew it was there ever since the black wings but i didnt know what it was because sometimes it makes me hurt inside but even then it feels good shyly she looked up at me from lowered eyes thank you i touched her arm so shed realize i knew what it meant to her youre welcome she had a part of my soul jeez just how much had i ruined her existence you do not have part of madisons soul barnabas said disdainfully i do nakitas anger flared you need to shut up you filthy light reaper you dont have one so you dont know anything about it nakita i admonished but it almost looked like barnabas appreciated the insulteven if it was technically inaccurate his eyes were on the traffic and i followed his gaze to guess that it was clear enough to cross with two angels with me lets go i said nakita im glad you have a part of my soul its the least i can do for having put black wings inside you keep it make it yours my feet hit the pavement and the heat rose up in a wave i could hear them following going slow then fast as cars came and went around us barnabas hustled to catch up and as we reached the curb he whispered do you think she really has part of your soul i shrugged if she says so i dont feel like im missing anything nakita strolled past us intent on reaching the apartment building she looked breezy and bright clearly relieved that the question of her soul had been settled tammy is on the third floor i can sense her resonance barnabas and i found the sidewalk together he looked angry barnabas i started and he interrupted me im fine he said brusquely whos to say you dont have a soul i said maybe thats why you got kicked out of heaven in the first place his pace faltered and he looked at me in wonder something in me ached to see him hurting inside this much i dont have a soul he said but there was a thread of doubt in it we werent made to have one we were made to serve not delight in gods creations serve i thought then filed that away to think about later well you did get kicked out because you loved someone right i said watching my shoes scuff the thick cracks as we slowly followed nakita it was the first time i dared to ask him about his past and though he seemed uncomfortable i wanted to know and you found value in life not just someones soul you cant value something you dont have can you nno he stammered but nakita had already opened the front door and was waiting for us the cool air flowed out but that wasnt why i shivered barnabas has a soul doesnt he i followed nakita inside seeing the faded carpet with the flat black spots that had to be old gum it smelled like dry dirt and there was a thick layer of dust on the narrow sections of hardwood between the carpeted stairs and the wall a bank of mail slots took up one wall with a scratched table under it there were a couple of pieces of mail sitting there and nothing else upstairs i offered and nakita started up then me and finally barnabas still probably thinking about his soul or the lack of one someone was playing music too loudly and it rapidly grew as we ascended we rounded the second landing and started up the last stairway the music was coming from the third floor it thumped into me the bass being joined by a guitar and an angry vocal the higher we went my curiosity turned into a wince as i realized that the aggressive music was coming from the apartment that nakita had stopped in front of c corner apartment top floor it went without saying that tammys mom was probably not home suddenly unsure i wiped my hands on my jeans i didnt have a clue what i could say that wouldnt sound crazy i didnt care if i sounded crazy at this point the memory of the two of them dying was too awful to risk becoming true well nakita prompted this is a bad plan barnabas said but he leaned past me ringing the bell and knocking on the varnished door plan who said anything about a plan i dont even have a plan i thought in panic as a dog began to yap wildly and the thin strip of light coming from under the door was eclipsed by frantic little paws from behind the door came a kids voice telling the dog to shut up and then with a burst of music the door opened yeah johnny said hardly looking up from his handheld game as seethers fake it blasted with one foot he shoved the little yellow dog back he was still dressed in his school clothes and the polo shirt and black dockers looked out of place in the untidy living room behind him with its dirty dishes on the coffee table the adjoining dining room wasnt much better the table covered in what looked like college textbooks to the right was the open kitchen just off the narrow entryway i blanched at the memory of the room in flame and my eyes went to the ceiling recalling the beautiful deadly curls of gold and black and the searing heat in my lungs as johnny died in my arms tonight i wondered scared it had to be the vision had been very clear is your sister here barnabas finally said since i was lost in the horror of the memory still playing his game johnny dropped back tammy he shouted over the music your friends are here head down he walked to his room off to the left from the kitchen the phone began to ring the dog too was still barking not knowing what to do we all stood in the doorway come on in johnny said walking backward and killing ninjas at the same time and then louder called tammy without looking up he edged into his room and shoved the door closed i looked at the two of them and then the empty room should we go in barnabas pushed forward i would he said positioning himself just over the threshold otherwise as soon as she sees us shes going to slam the door in our faces have some faith barnabas i said as i followed nakita in and stood with my feet just on the linoleum that marked the beginning of the kitchen i have lots of faith the fallen angel said as he crouched and coaxed the dog closer i have faith that this is a bad idea shes not going to believe you shes going to think were nuts shes going to call the police unless she has a record and if she does shell run away i frowned glancing at the front door it didnt seem right to shut it nakita shifted to stand even deeper in the kitchen positioning herself so she could see the entire main room theres a lot of noise in here she said looking at the phone still ringing maybe a fried stereo would be what started the fire i was starting to wonder how these two had survived even this long when from a back bedroom came a frustrated i said would you get that johnny the volume of the music suddenly halved three seconds later the door across the living room from johnnys was yanked open and tammy strode out her hair swinging as she stomped into the living room and started throwing couch pillows as she looked for the phone wheres the friggin phone she muttered snatching it up her eyes were narrowed and she looked mad spinning she jerked to a stop as she saw us all standing in the kitchen barnabas still crouched as he rubbed the ears of the little dog the phone in her hand rang again seeming to jerk her out of her surprise oh no she said recognizing me get out she shouted waving her arm at me johnny youre not supposed to let anyone in its for you came his hidden voice im not your stupid secretary expression dark she started for us halting as she realized how vulnerable she was holding the phone like a weapon she snapped get out before thumbing the phone line open hello she said watching us stand there im sorry mr tambu johnny turned it up when i was in the bathroom its down now she frowned i said im sorry she said then hung up on him shaking she faced us i told you to get out she said loudly but she looked scared making me wonder why she hadnt told her neighbor we were up here tammy just listen i said thinking that leaving the door open might have helped were not going to hurt you youre in trouble im in trouble tammy pointed the phone at us im not the one breaking and entering get the hell out or im calling the police but she hadnt yet so i didnt think she would from her room the music shifted to something darker more dangerous barnabas stood up from petting the dog looking calm and casual like the lead singer in a boy band it will take them forty minutes to get here he said his voice soothing beautiful if you listen to us well leave in three tammy swallowed and nakita rolled her eyes at the effect he had on her who are you she asked him you werent on the bus barnabas he smiled and i almost groaned as he charmed her good grief he was better at this than nakita and me put together and yet he still harbored doubts we could make a difference nakita edged forward were trying to help your soul is safe but not your life tammys expression immediately shifted back to mistrust nakita i all but hissed at her will you shut up about souls everyone thinks were nuts when you talk about souls like theyre as common as tvs she looked at me innocently but they are that doesnt mean we talk about them i said exasperated tammy was eyeing us between glances at the door the phone still in her hand did my mom send you is this her perverted way of checking up on me she asked god its like a police state around here you can tell her to stay out of my life im not a baby her mom i wish your mom doesnt know were here i said thinking it would help barnabas threw the dogs toy and the little thing tore after it is that soap scum he asked and i stared until i realized he was talking about the music yeah tammy said losing her aggressive stance again youve heard of them he smiled i saw them in concert in chicago right before the drummer died from a heart attack nakita snorted did you mess up his scythe prevention too barnabas frowned taking the dogs toy as the animal jumped at his knees no i was there for one of the kids in the audience scythe prevention tammy whispered she looked at the phone in her hand and took a step back what are you guys trying to be grim reapers no nakita said before i could tell her to shut up were dark reapers she hesitated then added i think madison if were trying to save lives then are we technically light no i said worried about tammys expression this was going sour fast there were too many people mucking it up and i couldnt get to why i was here tammy two minutes i said thats it you listen for two minutes and well leave i know this looks weird but were trying to help if you dont listen to me youre going to die tonight johnny too her expression blanched and barnabas leaned toward me uh that might not have been the best thing to say he whispered tammy gestured violently get out she shouted get out or im calling the cops she was frantic and i stumbled when barnabas took my shoulder and drew me back tammy theres a fire i said loudly not caring if i sounded crazy or not the horror had been too real i watched you both die you need to leave tonight just go somewhere else anywhere and you think me talking about souls makes us sound crazy nakita said get out tammy was screaming and johnny had opened his door staring at us with one eye through the crack i told you this wouldnt work barnabas said his grip on my elbow tightening as he pulled me back another step okay okay i said scrambling we were backing up past the fridge and i grabbed the little sticky note from it that had a grocery list on it the little pencil tied to it swung and i caught it im going to give you a number i said writing it down call this guy okay his name is shoe hes in iowa i helped him last month well i helped his buddy ace but ace is in a mental institution right now so youre going to have to talk to shoe you can shut up anytime now madison youre just like friggin mary poppins huh tammy said sarcastically clearly feeling braver now that we were backing toward the door just call him i said he was going to be accused of killing three people when his friend dumped a computer virus he made into a hospital system and screwed it up we managed to fix that were trying to help tammy she stood with her arms crossed phone tucked against her youre crazy i bumped into nakita and the warmth of the hall soaked into me just call him okay and heres my cell number call me when you want to talk one way or another shes not going to be alive when the sun comes up nakita said dryly and i took a deep breath feeling my heels scuff on the carpet in the hall call shoe i said throwing the pad of paper to the floor between us find out im not crazy or dont call him i dont care just dont be here tonight you or johnny i know hes a pain but take him with you when you go to the movies or ice cream or whatever just dont be here youve got to believe me tammy theres going to be a fire she had come forward more confident now that we were in the hall johnny was wideeyed behind her and the dog was wagging his tail toy in his mouth tammy glared at us but it was johnny who picked up the piece of paper with the phone number with a shove she slammed the door shut in our faces the thump echoed in the hallway from inside the music grew louder that went well barnabas said glumly his hands in his pockets chapter five closing my phone i tucked it away having texted culr thx to josh after his message that he was on his way to bed but wanted to give it another thirty minutes before trying to sneak out i glanced at barnabas sitting next to me between the outside wall of the laundromat and the dumpster if it was nine here it was eleven at home i had an hour before my curfew i didnt know when the fire was going to start but tammy had been outside of the apartment in my first flash so it was likely going to happen sometime between nine and midnight local time itd be just my luck that the fire would start when i was convincing my dad i was going to bed right now tammy and johnny were out barnabas and i were watching to make sure it stayed that way across the street the apartment complex had come alive with lights and the sound of too many tvs from the laundromat we had watched the cop car which tammy had called leave about an hour ago it had taken them almost three hours to show up and forty minutes to leave both cops laughing at tammys story as they got in their vehicle and drove away which was really sad because three crazy people had been in her house uninvited and they werent taking her seriously tammy and johnny had left right after the cops johnny whining as she dragged him down the sidewalk as the sun went down looking scared as she got into her friend jennifers dented twodoor i shouldve felt relieved that shed taken my advice and left but the fear that they might come back had me tense and worried it was dark now the lights from the cars between us and the apartment complex creating moving spots of clarity in an otherwise depressing night nakita was out doing a flyby of the area my back was to the red bricks and my knees were bent almost to my chin as i swung my amulet on its silver chain idly concentrating on it to shift its form it was a skill that nakita had taught me i miss josh barnabas i said softly feeling alone though he sat right next to me you have a soul how can you not he was silent watching as i played with the glittery black stone safely encased in its wrapping of wire i focused on it modulating the light bending around it until it looked like a little silver cross with a black stone in the center you are the best of us i said looking at my amulet i was pleased with the result though it still felt like an oval riverwashed stone to my fingers unflawed and beautiful you have to have a soul angels werent made for the earth he said only those of the earth have souls okay but you abandoned heaven for earth i said not believing that god would be so cruel but then again look what hed fated for me maybe that means you really belonged here that youve had a soul all this time and you just didnt know it its not like angels all look or act the same if its not a soul that makes us different then what is it in my hand the cross melted into a pair of black angel wings barnabas was silent as he looked at them and then he muttered i left heaven because i was forbidden to return not because i was gifted with a soul gift i thought i doubted it had even bothered him that he might not have a soul until nakita said she had a sliver of mine with the memories the black wings stole from me memories of being afraid of the dark of dying of an end of everything nakita said you were kicked out because you loved a human girl the back door to the laundromat creaked open and an employee clickclacked out checking to make sure the door was locked before heading for one of the nearby cars silent we watched until her red pinto roared to life and puttered away is that true i asked in the new silence barnabas didnt say anything his jaw clenched and his eyes looking black in the dark suddenly embarrassed i let the angel wings shift back to the more familiar vision of a smooth rock im sorry i whispered ill shut up now god what was i doing prying into his past he might look my age but he was over three thousand years old to my seventeen like he really wanted to share anything with me there were no timekeepers back then he said abruptly and i jumped even though his words were very soft almost unheard over the nearby traffics thrum scythings were meted out by the seraphs like theyre doing now until things are settled with you i was told to end the life of a girl whose soul was going to die pride was going to prevent her from asking forgiveness barnabas shifted his weight his hands clasped loosely over his drawnup knees but his eyes were not seeing the back of the dumpster the lost expression on his face was scary the earth was so fresh back then he said the lines in his face smoothing not this cement carbonpolluted ember of what its become it was almost as if creation energy still rang in the rocks and echoed in the hum of the bees or the breath of a child on the verge of becoming a woman a woman so perfect that heaven was willing to cut her life short to bring her soul back to them unsullied i stifled a shiver scared as to what he might say next she was asleep in a field my sarah he breathed his shoulders easing as he spoke her name giving it an odd accent her name was sarah and id never seen anything more beautiful in all creation his head dropped they should have sent someone stronger i wanted to touch his arm but didnt how could i even pretend to understand hed laugh at me i couldnt do it he said head down i chose not to i chose only now did he turn to look at me frightening me with the intensity in his gaze her soul was alive still and beautiful it seemed wrong to take it then she woke and i was standing over her with my scythe bared she was so scared i didnt want her perfect beauty remembering ugliness as she left the earth so i lied i told her she was safe and i touched her feeling her tremble she believed me i shouldnt have touched her i might have been able to do it if i hadnt felt her fear he was smiling now as if in a fond memory that she trusted me when i told her id do her no harm struck me to my core i couldnt betray that trust and my lie became truth barnabass eyes tightened at the corner and his clasped hands separated and pressed into the dirty cement a second reaper came to end what i couldnt and i fought him beat him and sent him back broken to be made whole again in the forges of heaven his expression went sad as he looked at the dirty streets seeing the past her fate shifted in a single day because i saved her life his eyes came to me as if i might deny it but i could say nothing she realized she had worth when i saved her life and her soul was renewed innocent i left to tell the seraphs that fate could be swayed and to stop the scythings they wouldnt listen sending a third reaper even as i pleaded with them she would have died if not for the guardian angels that happened to be with her at the time they flocked to her her entire life they clustered around her soul his eyes went confused i never understood why now i wonder if it was so they would be there to save her lifeafter she saved her own soul my lips parted and i wondered if sarahs had been the first guardian angel but what shook me was that he had changed a persons fate before and yet was reluctant to believe that it could be done again maybe it was because it happened so seldom head tilted barnabas looked at me his eyes still holding his love for her i refused to leave her after that even when her soul remained intact and black wings couldnt find her when she died so they kicked me out of heaven his face changed becoming harder as he threw a pebble to skip and hop through the parking lot it was worth it i sent my gaze to the busy road and the brightly lit apartment complex you stayed with her for her entire life the faint sound of a siren came from the nearby interstate barnabas was smiling a fond soft smile that i didnt think id ever seen on him before he looked seventeen to me and i wondered how hed handled looking that young for sarahs entire life but people hadnt lived much past forty back then yes i did he said seemingly embarrassed and you say you have no soul i said dryly as i threw a chip of cement at the dumpster to hear it ting good grief barnabas if a soul is what lets us love then youve got one he opened his mouth as if to protest but then he stopped his gaze going across the street as the sirens didnt fade but grew louder my heart gave a thump and i looked at my watch it was almost nine thirty but if there was trouble nakita would have told us it looks okay to me i said then sucked in my breath when the sound of breaking glass came loud over the traffic and a tongue of flame licked out of a thirdstory window searching for the sky barnabas i exclaimed scrambling up my hand went around my amulet and i looked at the street as the fire trucks and a cop car roared up puppy presents on the rug it was happening where was nakita here we go barnabas said tiredly and we edged out from behind the dumpster tammy didnt come back did she i asked almost frantic i couldnt take it if it had all been for nothing barnabas is she in there no shes over there but shes not inside johnny either he said his eyes going silver for an instant as he touched on the divine and my shoulders eased your warning seemed to have changed her fate againif not saved her soul i havent flashed forward to see it i said and we started toward the busy street made twice as dangerous now that it was dark there was a crosswalk and barnabas angled us to it maybe her soul isnt safe yet barnabas said maybe that tammys soul might still be at risk was not a good thought barnabas pushed the cross button and i fidgeted wanting him to fly me across but that would be hard to explain we had time if tammy and johnny were out of the building we had time maybe now shed listen to me if johnny didnt die then she wouldnt give up on life would she my fingers gripped my amulet and i tried to relax enough to reach nakitaif the fire trucks werent enough of a clue nakita i thought closing my eyes against the dont walk sign flashing across the six lanes of traffic but barnabass shout jerked my eyes open and my attention shattered my mental call for nakita hit the ceiling of the air and broke unheard black wings barnabas said his eyes wide my fingers on my amulet clenched and i followed his pointing hand across the street my knees seemed to wobble and i reached for the light pole black wings scavengers of lost souls if they were here then there was probably a dark reaper on the hunt nearby and if there was a hunting dark reaper a light reaper was not far behind damn it did ron flash and send someone you think theyre here for someone else i whispered and barnabas shook his head as the slimy sheets of black glided like stingrays over the apartment complex they looked like a shiny silvery line from the side and most people when they saw them at all thought they were crows i wanted to believe it was coincidence but the heartbreaking truth was more likely the seraphs had decided id mucked this up too far and had sent in the professionals and here i was stuck on the wrong side of the street barnabas pushed the cross button again the fire trucks were causing some confusion and the light hadnt changed tammy was over there in that crowdwith half a dozen black wings circling overhead barnabas we have to get over there i said desperate as people started fleeing the apartments dogs cats stereos and tvs in their arms a fireman was at the door keeping people from going back in for more as part of his crew went in to get the stragglers and still the cars zoomed between us a boom of sound made me cower mouth open as a huge gout of flame took one corner of the complex she isnt in there barnabas said grabbing my arm i know it her aura puts her outside shes outside madison it was a small comfort i looked up the road then down the smell of the burning building was thick and the black smoke blocked out the stars we didnt have time for this lets go i said suddenly madison the cars barnabas said but i was already wiggling out of his grip and stepping off the curb nakita i thought trying to touch her mind my hand holding my amulet in a death grip as the first car laid on the horn and screeched the tires dinging the car next to it as it slid to a halt six feet in front of me scared i kept moving forward the driver was screaming at me but three lanes of traffic had stopped in a frightening sound of horns skids and a crunch of plastic my pace bobbled as the double image of joshs house on a dark deserted street overlaid itself on my reality of fire trucks and the threestory apartment complex it was nakita id reached her what was she doing at joshs house waiting for him hes brushing his teeth madison came nakitas bored thought into mine as i saw through her eyes and she saw through mine our connection that tight this might be a while the apartment is on fire i thought back at her but she was already wide awake having glimpsed my reality of another car slamming on its brakes only to be rearended and shoved forward another three feet almost hitting me i felt barnabas take my elbow shifting my path to avoid another car madison dont go in there she shouted into my thoughts scared i wondered if i could enter a burning building and be okay i was dead i didnt need to breathe shes not in there but there are black wings nakita i need you i looked up as barnabas hesitated at the curb until i took the step up nakita saw the black wings through my eyes and panic iced both of us at the memory of the pain of being eaten alive i held my amulet tighter black wings couldnt see me as long as i was wearing it i was safe i was safe damn it but it was hard to walk under them im coming nakita exclaimed and the double vision vanished i took a deep breath snapping myself out of the almosttrance barnabas was holding my elbow turning at the noise behind us i blanched stopped cars were everywhere good thing the emergency people were here already thanks barnabas i whispered knowing he had guided me through it nakita was at joshs shes on her way im not going to let a dark reaper kill tammy i wont and i wont let a light reaper give her a guardian angel barnabas said as his touch fell from me not this time i saved sarah maybe i just need to try harder like you the strength of his words hit me and i turned surprised at his clenched jaw hed always supported me but never had he looked this determined it had to be the reminder of sarah thank you i whispered and he turned away seeming embarrassed my attention went over his shoulder to the glow among the frightened people gathering in the parking lot of the apartments i caught a flash of an amulet then it was gone behind a wave of choking black look its nakita i said eyes stinging as i started that way but barnabas jerked me to a halt thats not nakita barnabas said his expression alarmed thats a dark reaper my eyes darted back into the crowd seeing nothing then went back to barnabas crap i whispered feeling my knees go watery were in trouble look theres a light reaper too what in bloody heaven is going on the seraphs know im here why are they interfering but it was obvious as to why id really messed it up by saving tammys life barnabass lips pressed together as he watched the beautiful light reaper standing in front of the building her hands on her hips as she looked appraisingly at the fire not yet having identified who she was here to save its arariel he said stiffly shes good were in trouble she keeps guardian angels in her pocket and the dark reaper i recognize him too thats demus things were spiraling out of control clearly neither reaper had found tammy yet and though we could find her by way of her aura so could arariel if ron had flashed and passed the description of it on to his light reaper im sure the dark reaper had a description of her by now too thanks to the seraphs and that is what ticked me off the most the seraphs had written my attempt off without giving me a real chance i was trying to fix this they had no right to call in a dark reaper yet not yet but my hope was fading maybe they had given up on my ideas altogether maybe i can change tammys resonance i said barely breathing the words but i knew he had heard me despite the roar of the fire trucks and the calls of frightened people if ron has flashed forward hes given a description to his reaper and if i can change it shell be safe do you think you can he asked and i winced thats timekeeper magic even i cant do that i dont know but if we can get close enough to her you can at least shield her resonance but tammy thought we were crazy and shed probably run if she saw us its worth a try barnabass eyes flashed silver as he touched on the divine found her he said hunching closer as if the surrounding reapers could read his mind shes scared alone shes not in the parking lot shes in an alley he turned and i followed his gaze to a nearby selfserve storage site with rows of singlestory buildings and garage doors there i asked him it was noisy with the fire trucks engines and the lights from the emergency vehicles made comeandgo shadows on him as he nodded can you see her aura he asked me in turn and i closed my eyes trying to relax with the noise and commotion no i said barnabas i dont think that i can figure out how to change her aura my eyes opened finding him looking frustrated lets just get over there and hide her resonance even if we have to sit on her to keep her from running away he nodded but as we turned to go i saw a flash of amulet i froze my chest seeming to clench at the red hair and short stature id never met any of my dark reapers except for nakita but by his unearthly beauty i knew it had to be demus and as i watched him search the crowd for tammy anger kindled in me this was my reap taking a breath i pulled myself straight my eyes never left the beautiful angel who looked like hed just gotten off a boat from ireland he was one of my reapers and my hand gripped my amulet as determination filled me he was going to do what i said go shield her barnabas i said and he grunted as he followed my gaze and saw demus as well im going to go talk to demus distract him at the least demus barnabas said looking shaken as his gaze darted back and away i know youre the dark timekeeper but hes here on seraph business hes not going to listen to you the hell he isnt i muttered im his boss barnabas furrowed his brow and his eyes shifted to worry madison dont you madison me i exclaimed im not going to let this go and neither are you go find tammy hide her resonance from the reapers she likes you im the one she thinks is crazy ive got this its not like he can kill me barnabas stiffened people carrying dogs and terrified cats stood between us and the dark reaper shouting and gesturing about their lives going up in flames the firemen ignored them the best they could as they worked and the cops were trying to get them to go into the nearby skating rink smoke billowed between us and when it cleared demus was gone crap where did he go a black wing flew over and we both ducked the scent of decay and roses seeming to catch in my throat madison came a familiar shout and we turned to see nakita elbowing her way through the frightened people who is watching tammy a surge of pride came and went she cared nakita cared about tammy if i could make a dark reaper care then maybe this wasnt as impossible as everyone said it was barnabas is i said and her wide eyes flicked at him as if asking how when he was standing right beside us nakita you take arariel i said pointing then blinked when i realized that the light reaper in the black jumpsuit had seen us and had her sword bared and was grinning at us waiting dont let her put a guardian angel on tammy okay barnabas is going to hide tammys resonance and protect her im talking to demus nakita nodded her own smile eager as her hand gripped her amulet and her sword ghosted into existence in the other one with pleasure she said striding away sidestepping a fireman oblivious to everything but his job the stink of ash rose up and i squinted through it glad i didnt have to breathe id never seen so many black wings before and the foul mindless things swirled through the smoke to make it look like a living thing barnabas was still standing beside me like this was a lost cause it would be only if we let it will you go find tammy i exclaimed and he looked at me a sick expression on his face its too late he said and my heart gave a thump look i followed his pointing arm to see tammy standing at the top of one of the rows of the storage building her mouth open and her dog in her arms staring at the fire eating through the roof of her home demus was right behind her in the shadows looking as if he was comparing her aura to something as his eyes went silver in a blink between one flash of light and the next his sword was made anew the memory of my heart pounded demus i shouted breaking into a run dodging around crying people no i could almost feel the whispers of feathers through my soul as i recalled being scythed and the fear of waking up in the morgue with no way to change things no way to hit the reset button and make a better choice tammy didnt deserve that madison barnabas shouted but i dodged around an angry man arguing with a cop and kept going demus raised his sword planning on taking her from behind oblivious to me barreling down on him wait i shouted but he was swinging and i plowed into tammy sending us and her dog sprawling into the shadows between the storage buildings she shrieked and her dog barked furiously but no one outside the alley heard still on the ground i looked up demuss shock was turning into an ugly expression his eyes dropped to my amulet and he raised his sword again youll have to do better than that light reaper he said mistaking me for an angel well that was one good thing but then his arm descended in a smooth arc of motion i pressed back into tammy wincing as i prepared to take the blow for her id survive it she wouldnt but the pure ting of the divine shocked through me seeming to cut through the noisy confusion for a brief instant my eyes cracked open it was barnabas his sword inches from me and holding back demuss blow barnabas the dark reaper stammered still holding his position i thought you went grim grim was what they called reapers who didnt work for the light or the dark mistrusted by both sides they killed at random or at least for a reason no one else could see with a grunt barnabas pushed him back i did his voice was flat and again i was taken by his image standing protectively over me his duster mixing with the smoke and his eyes dark and intent avenging angel beautiful and unshakable sarah her name had been i thought wondering how she had instilled in him the best of all of us i fell backward as tammy scrambled out from under me and deeper into the alley her dog was gone running into the crowd with his tail tucked tammy i exclaimed spinning onto my stomach and snatching her ankle she fell shrieking again but at least demuss blade went hissing harmlessly over her head as he swung at her stay down i shouted at her and this time she listened eyes wide as she slid backward on her butt until she found a bright orange garage door you talked to shoe i asked you believe me now her eyes were fixed on barnabas and demus and she jumped as their swords met and that sound rang out again youre crazy she exclaimed freaking crazy what the hell is wrong with you people demus kicked at barnabas sending him backward tammy gasped as demus turned to her smiling wickedly the eagerness in his expression was a dire warning this was who i was supposed to convince to spare a marks life and now you die he shouted lunging demus knock it off i exclaimed as i scrambled up i shot my hand out as he swung his blade cutting right through me sparkles scintillated through me as heavens might mingled within then ebbed to nothing as it recognized me as one of its own and threw the divine strike back my head snapped up and i took a breath feeling it go all the way to the bottom of my lungs demus yelped and when i looked he was wringing his hand his sword at his feet as he blinked in shock who by gabriels pearly toes are you im your boss i said still tingling from the blow and tickedeven though it had felt good demus bent to grasp his sword and barnabas shoved him arms and legs flailing the dark reaper smacked ungracefully into the wall barnabas dont i said but the reaper had yanked him up dazed and confused as he put him in a choke hold and spun him to face me using his foot barnabas kicked demuss sword to me i bent to pick it up feeling the heavy weapon hum in my grip it was responding to my amulet i suppose your boss wants to talk to you barnabas said his eyes pinched in anger or didnt you get the memo demus focused on me his snarl fading as his gaze flicked from the sword in my hand to tammy crying behind me somewhere the dark timekeeper her his gaze dropped to my amulet and then his eyes widened as he began to swear in latin at least i think it was latin looking vindicated barnabas let go of him giving him a parting shove youre the new dark timekeeper demus said the lights from the emergency vehicles flashing on him youre just a girl sweet seraph toes no wonder the angels are still organizing the reaps my brow furrowed and i came forward a step it kind of surprised me too i said glad we were the same height and i didnt have to look up at him listen carrottop i said as i handed his sword back to him and barnabas cringed i dont care what the seraphs said you are not killing tammy shes offlimits a test case if you want behind me tammys sniffling stopped but the seraphs demus started his glance going behind me to tammy again she shouldnt be hearing this but it could only help her understand the seraphs arent playing fair i said i bet they didnt even tell you what im trying to do did they this is my scythe and they butted in by sending you then ron sent arariel is it and now its all messed up but since youre here youre going to do what i say and i say tammy is going to wake up tomorrow were trying to change her life not end it it had been a mouthful and i dropped back a step to catch my breath well i really didnt need to but still demus was staring quizzically at me then he glanced at barnabas to see if i was joking you cant change a marks path barnabas was shrugging and i said not when you just kill them sure tammy started to edge for the opening of the alley barnabas moved to stop her and she whimpered standing with her arms crossed over her chest we managed to change one persons life barnabas said we can do it again demus fidgeted his bared sword pointing downward the seraphs said i say shes offlimits i exclaimed put your sword away and listen to me hell and damnation demus muttered wincing as his sword vanished i cant just let ron put a guardian angel on her do you know what happens to people who die who have lost their souls and fail to regain them i didnt but barnabas seemed to relax and after a quick look behind him he put his own sword away hands now in his deep pockets he eyed the burning apartment shell regain her soul he said softly tammy made a dart for the opening past barnabas and the angel reached out snagging her let me go she shouted smacking him and he took the abuse angling her so no one outside the alley could see her this doesnt make any sense demus said and i moved closer hoping the nearby news van didnt look this way the mark either dies or gets a guardian angel theres no other choice i smiled hearing the word demus we are going to get along just fine choice is exactly what im going for here i said let me go tammy insisted wiggling i have to get johnny i left him by the lamppost looking almost cocky demus fluffed out his hair to get the sifting ash out of it chill babe she just saved your life i exhaled one reaper down one more to go the light reaper though wasnt going to listen to me i should probably at least try to change tammys resonance now that i had a moment to think i said let me go tammy screamed and kicked barnabas in the shin howling he dropped his grip on her in an instant she was gone barnabas took three running steps after her then skidded to a halt youll be okay go i said and barnabas gave himself a quick shake turning he vanished into the noisy mass of fire trucks and crying people damn he looked good with his duster flowing and his eyes alight like that my attention turned to demus he was fiddling with his amulet his eyes going silver for an instant before turning back to their original green he was like a bright copper penny beautiful and gold like barnabas was beautiful and dark youre not like nakita at all i said and he looked up at me his white teeth startling well youre not like kairos i couldnt help my snort thank god i came forward to stand at the opening between the two rows of storage buildings my arms crossed i was reluctant to step out of the somewhat peaceful spot beyond it was noise lights ash billowing smoke and spraying water were going to scythe her later right demus said this is just a way to make ron crazy and put barnabas off his guard my head dropped and i took a deep breath two steps back linking my arm in his i started to lead him back into the mess demus we have to talk there shrilled out a high voice and we both turned recognizing tammys voice there she is shes the one that set the fire my mouth dropped open and i froze as demus pulled away tammy was in a clear spot with a cop and a fireman johnny was with her pressed into a scaredlooking woman holding their dog their mom maybe behind them trying to stay out of sight was barnabas there was a ting of divinity and i saw nakita facing down the light reaper a strong thump came from my heart then stopped shes blaming me for the fire im the one that warned her to get out puppy presents i whispered feeling demus drop back and vanish into the crowd i turned to make my own escape but the cops were faster and i found myself yanked around and staring up at a stern smokemarked face god he was big and he had a gun she broke into my house this afternoon tammy was yelling currently being held back by a second cop i called and it took you three hours to help me i told you i told you and you laughed at me i did not break into your house i said indignantly your brother let us in it looked like the fire was almost out but they werent allowing anyone in yet the parking lot was full of angry people and they were all starting to look at me she was talking about a fire tammy said and the cop holding me tightened his grip she told me not to be here tonight mom she exclaimed its her im telling you its her fault she said there was going to be a fire how would she know unless she set it you the woman said her fear finding an easy outlet the dog in her arms squirmed and she held him tighter you burned down my apartment why her shrill voice carried over the roar of the fire trucks and i backed up to bump into a third cop crap i was surrounded barnabas couldnt help the cop looming over me grew even more grim whats your name miss i want her in jail tammys mother yelled attracting even more attention she set fire to my apartment i lost everything everything i touched the bump of my cell phone in my pocket thinking of my dad oh god i didnt want him to get a call about me being two time zones away uh i have to go i whispered scared out of my mind i jumped when the cop gripping my arm pulled me to him im sorry miss will you come with me she burned my apartment tammys mother said starting to cry ive got nothing you still have your children i thought but i couldnt say it they wouldnt understand that tammys and johnnys lives had nearly been lost hey i yelped when the cop pinched my arm and started leading me away i didnt set the fire i just had a feeling yeah well you and your feeling are in deep trouble the cop said how old are you he asked they couldnt question me without an adult present if i was a minor seventeen i whispered thinking of the disappointment in my dads eyes look i shouldnt even be here the cop opened the door of one of the cop cars it was quieter at the curb the entire six lanes of traffic diverted somewhere else people were everywhere whats your name how can we reach your folks he asked i looked at the inside of the car and got in my mouth was shut and it was going to stay that way i was so scared but i was almost laughing i was the dark timekeeper able to stop time stand down dark reapers and fly with angels and i was scared better to just go along with it until barnabas showed up and changed their memories but the less there was to change the better so i said nothing looking up at him and knowing there would be no mercy he made a soft grunt wrong answer he said then shut the door it made a firm thump cutting through the noise and confusion warm silence took me comforting almost though the seat was hard and the space tiny outside the fire trucks thundered and people cried but inside here it was quiet the cop tapped the glass and i jerked back youd better remember your phone number by the time i get back missy he said his voice muffled turning he walked away with a swagger big strong man put the little girl in her place i muttered crossing my arms over my chest and slumping back in the seat i had a bad feeling i was going to miss my curfew i could see tammy talking to both the fireman and another cop pointing at me her mother was in tears and johnny looked lost patting his moms knee as she sat on the ground and rocked their dog barnabas was lurking at the edge of the crowd and nakita i didnt see demus or the light reaper barnabas had called arariel maybe they were gone maybe all of this had changed tammys future yeah and maybe ive got icecream cones coming out of my ears if the seraphs had sent a dark reaper then tammys soul was still fated to be lost and id accomplished nothing chapter six i watched the wall clock as i sat in the swivel chair tapping my foot in time with its ticks to irritate the cop sitting behind the desk but mostly i just sulked either luck or grace had landed me here instead of the juvenile detention area which was apparently full up at the moment it could have been the fire but i think it was grace my guardianangelturnedmessenger had shown up halfway to the station almost getting me into the psych ward when i started talking to her luck had stayed with me so instead of a cell i was stuck in some cops office while they figured out what to do with me it stank like stale cigarette smoke and he had dried diet coke rings on his scratched desk nasty the somewhat overweight stocky man looked up at me and i gave him an insincere smile irritated he set his pen down on his steelandlaminate desk and crossed his arms over his chest staring back at me my cell phone was next to his oversize ugly monitor grace had drained the batteries she drained every single thing they tried to plug into it they hadnt been able to contact my parents yet and i hoped id be out of here before they managed it grace was good but these guys were determined you ready to tell me who that redheaded kid was with you he asked and i shook my head how about how to call your folks he tried and i looked at the ceiling punkass kids he muttered standing up and pocketing my cell phone we used to be able to put you gangbangers behind bars where you belonged and be done with it youre only making it harder on yourself well find out who you are and that redhead too i didnt set the fire i said and he pressed his lips together which made his mustache stick out stay there he demanded pointing a stubby fat finger at me dont touch anything i stuck my tongue out at him as he left but he missed it more intent on getting a sugarinduced coffee high the frostedglass door shut with a bang and i jumped exhaling a breath id taken who knew how long ago i slumped back in my chair and swung my foot looking over the cluttered shelves the high narrow window with the metal netting on it and finally the scuffed green and white tiles i didnt think my treatment was standard procedure but i wasnt making things easy on them either head thrown back i looked at the stained ceiling id totally missed my curfew and i was going to be soooo grounded when i got home even if my dad never found out about this but what really had me worried was tammy i didnt like that the seraphs had sent a reaper out to take her early they knew i was handling this grace had told me that barnabas was watching tammy and that both arariel and demus were gone so maybe my actions tonight in stopping demus had caused them to reconsider i just didnt know id feel a lot better if i could change tammys resonance to help hide her while i cooled my heels in juvie ron had changed mine several times but he had done it by modifying my amulet seeing as it was the source of my aura now that i was dead tammy didnt have an amulet to give her the illusion of an aura so id have to change it some other way logic said id have to be with her to do it but maybe all i needed to do was find her in the time line and just sort of tweak it it was worth trying bringing my head down i looked at the ticking clock it was after ten past midnight at home my dad was going to kill me grace i whispered needing some company there once was a cop shop in baxter the guardianangelturnedmessenger sang out as she ghosted through the glass in the door who once a timekeeper did capture accused of a fire her condition was dire but barnabas wont let them ax her looking at the bookcase of sloppy folders where she had landed i squinted grace whats going on i feel like im on a deserted island here youre in jail madison the angel said cheerfully the seraphs are angry tammy is a lost cause and demus is walking the streets again looking for her shes run away just like the seraphs fated she would what i sat up now twice as worried for tammy as i was before i thought demus was recalled the glowing ball of light landed on my knee and a soft warmth soaked into me like a sunbeam no he just went back to heaven temporarily to make sure he wasnt doing something contrary to heavens will by doing what you told him to do my face scrunched up into an ugly expression three guesses as to how that went i said sourly and the first two dont count just like tammys desire to live i guess this is so unfair i saved her from the fire i saved johnny from the fire and still tammy lets her soul die what is wrong with the girl doesnt she see how much her mother and brother love her um they told demus to get back down here and scythe her madison it doesnt look good he knows her aura signature and even what she looks like thanks to me grace rose up the glow from her wings a spot of clean in the otherwise sticky office barnabas and nakita are going to get you out she offered but i didnt feel much better madison maybe this isnt such a good idea grace said softly and my heart gave a thump not you too i said miserable damn it why did no one believe that this was possible wed done it before it would work if they would believe in it its just that the seraphs are so agitated grace said hovering right in front of me their songs are going higher than ive ever seen them the echoes are reaching down here even those sensitive to it are getting visions i havent seen it like this since since the renaissance in italy she hesitated and a burst of light came from her at a thought unshared maybe the seraphs shouldnt have butted in and sent demus i said and grace flew backward in alarm im trying to help tammy i said almost pleading it doesnt always happen whizbang if it takes a year for a soul to give up on life then it might take longer than two hours to rekindle the will to live scything someone to save their soul is so fast that its cheap wheres the honor in that im getting better at this havent i changed things already so that she is alive her and her brother both she doesnt have that guilt now how can that be a bad thing never never would anyone be able to convince me that tammy and her brother dying in pain and agony in a fire was a good thing there once was a brave human girl immortality gave her a whirl for humans to save gods wrath did she brave her tenacity making me hurl nice i looked at the door as a shadow went past grace i whispered i got this job for a reason maybe because i want to change things her glow dimmed and i felt cold as her depression soaked into the room what do the seraphs say tammys fate is now i asked there had to be something i could do to make this better it hasnt changed a brief glow came from grace vanishing as she moved to the desk and stilled her wings her brothers death had been the trigger of her souls decline now its losing her home in the fire thats why they sent demus back she needs to come home early or shes not coming home at all madison were talking about her soul what is a human life compared to the everlasting soul this isnt a game is that what they think i think this is a game i exclaimed then lowered my voice before someone came in i want this to work so badly that it hurts tammys fate hasnt changed at all nope she sounded resigned and i slumped back into my chair not wanting to believe it barnabas could lie maybe seraphs could too tammys choice to stay with her brother tonight was based on fear not a change in heart grace said you may have saved their lives but tammy still runs away abandoning those who love her and losing hope in herself soon as demus finds her grace made a curious highpitched whistle and went silent game over i whispered staring at the cops desk and his phone maybe they left me alone thinking id use it and they could track my parents down are you sure yup i need to figure out how to change her resonance i was a timekeeper damn it i should be able to do this maybe if i talked to her a little more madison dont you get it you are a timekeeper you cant change fate and you cant cause change you see the future you send out dark reapers to cull souls if they are successful the light reaper who failed escorts them to heavens gate so the black wings dont eat their stillbright soul severed early from their body you know this its how you met barnabas andif the light reaper wins a guardian angel keeps the mark safe in the hope that their soul will remember how to live thats all you do screw it i knew i could do more i see the future huh i said starting to get angry then i want to see her future ask the seraphs to show me i can still fix this they are angry at you first you fix it so that they both die in grace which is what they wanted and then you go muck it up by talking to tammy and getting her to leave the apartment you may have saved both their lives but you damned her soul doing it grace said glowing so brightly that she started to cast shadows im not going to ask them to do a far search on her yeah well im not too happy with them butting in like that sullenly i stood pacing to the high window and back that cop was going to come back i had to get out of here i had to find tammy before demus did jeez what kind of timekeeper was i if i couldnt even elude a building of cops i bet i can find her future by myself i said hands on my hips and glaring at her see the future before the seraphs do grace snorted there once was a girl with no brain whose theories were kind of insane thanks grace youre a font of wisdom i muttered she rose up in a haze of glowing light adding to outfly immortals caused many to chortle because what the girl was was vain im not vain i said as she hovered before the closed door im trying to get things done and no one is helping grace bobbed up and down impatiently i gotta go they found another phone battery go go and thank you i said waving at her as she flew through the glass and vanished i didnt want to explain to my dad why i was on the west coast and accused of arson but even if grace could keep them from contacting my dad there was no way that i could hide that i wasnt at home never would i have imagined i could get things this messed up maybe grace was right maybe they were all right arms wrapped around myself i glanced at the door and sank down in my squeaky chair maybe but it didnt feel right barnabas had once said to trust my gut my gut said this wasnt done my gut said i could make this better my gut said i could make a difference i looked at the ceiling again closing my eyes against the water stains that looked like swirling clouds or angels and im disgraced i thought feeling a welling of selfpity the seraphs were angry with me worse i failed tammy ticked i kicked out at the cops desk my toe met the thick steel with a dull thump but i hadnt put any force behind it and nothing happened not even a twinge in my toes i know tammys aura resonance i can find her future by myself i thought defiantly but it was quickly followed by the realization that i probably couldnt i wasnt being a selfdefeatisti was being a realist still maybe i could change her resonance so demus and arariel couldnt find her buy me some time resolving to try it i looked at the ceiling again exhaling everything out of my lungs my eyes closed and i pulled into my awareness the shimmering silver sheet of time that stretched to infinity in either direction it glowed from the auras that comprised it people that existed this very second falling from it like water or a drape was the past it still glowed but not nearly as bright as the present it was the light of collective memory go back too far and the canvas grew black except for people that humanity had chosen to remember silver triumphs and disasters that transcended time itself but here so close to the present it was alight with color as lives intertwined connected and parted going forward from the ribbon was vastly different a black so intense as to almost not be there made a hazy patch of whatmightbe it was conscious thought and it was what pulled us from the present into the future it stretched wide in some places and narrow at others almost as if some people were living a tiny bit into the future by pushing their thoughts into it artists mostly teachers children the movers and shakers but it was the glowing ribbon of now that i was interested in and i searched it looking for tammy i knew demus was likely looking for her too and a spike of fear almost broke me from my concentration steady i whispered hearing a commotion down the hall an argument about me probably my mental sight grew clearer and it was as if i hovered over the glowing blanket of light searching for a particular note among an entire concert down one way then retracing my steps and going farther down the other searching among the thousands of souls near me and then like the small sound a vibrating glass makes when you run your finger across the rim i felt her tammy i thought elated it had to be she was alone by the looks of it and not too far away i focused on her trying to put myself in her thoughts but i only got the impression of wet hair aching knees and a sense of fear and hopelessnessof giving up and abandonment the vibratingglass sound grew louder almost sour and i wondered if it was this offkey soundtaste that the seraphs used to find souls in danger of becoming lost it grated on me she wasnt thinking of the future at all her thoughts pulling her into the next moment hardly stretching past her existence i tried to slip my awareness into that dull gray haze that existed between everyones present and future to try to reach her mind like i could nakita or barnabas but it was like trying to thread a needle when you cant see the eye or feel the thread i didnt think it was even possible but changing the sound her aura was making i might be able to change that a sliding thump in the distance jolted my eyes open and i looked at the clock not even a minute had passed okay id found her now to see if i could make a change i shifted on the thin padding of the chair trying to settle myself i willed my thoughts to slow and my focus to sharpen on my mindscape making her aura my entire world and surrounding myself in her green and orange i changed the color of my thoughts when i talked silently to barnabas and nakita i really didnt know how i did it apart from focusing on them and bringing them clearly into my thoughts nakitas willingness and desire to understand barnabass deepset melancholy for the human tragedy but thinking of tammy would only strengthen her existing aura which was not what i wanted frowning i wondered if the answer might be in her past and i looked down its length seeing one sorrow layered over the next until it looked like that was all that existed for her the birthday party her dad promised hed come to and then the argument he got in with her mother which in turn took all the joy from the present hed given herand the purse he lovingly picked out for her was never used forever stained with the memory of it there was the shame from a failed test and another failed test and another until it was easier to pretend it didnt matter than to try and to fail again deeper went the ugly words her friends spoke about another girl but it was the knowledge that if they said such lies about one person they probably spoke that way about her too which ruined any joy she might find with them but what tore at me was her understanding that the promises made in childhood were not true that the lies our parents told us about being nice to others and others will be nice to you that people were kind on the inside and that love was more abundant than hurt all of it was lies no wonder her soul was lost it wasnt that she had a harder life than others but that she was blinding herself to the joy that the little things were being brushed aside forgotten her perception of good and bad was off because she refused to put the good on the scale too and as i looked over her life it was all i could do not to cry along with her what about this i thought seeing the laughter in her mothers face when they had all come back to the shopping cart with the same carton of ice cream and this i wondered watching tammy scuff the marvel of a bluejay feather under her shoe as she walked home the satisfaction in a poem she wrote but never shared had to have more weight than the sigh of disappointment from her mother because of a dishwasher left unemptiedbut tammy ignored it any satisfaction rubbed out as if it never existed and this i exclaimed seeing johnnys smile of thanks when she put a bowl out for his breakfast was that worth nothing to her tammy made a low moan clutching her knees to her chest and rocking as if in pain a flash of brilliance sparked through her aura shifting the orange and i knew that tammy was seeing what i was not hearing my thoughts perhaps but seeing the good in her life as i recognized it myself excitement shivered through me as i realized her aura was shifting the orange being muted dulled as i made her revaluate her life in small subtle ways encouraged i focused on johnny and somehow when everything else seemed to be blocked and useless she remembered him and her tears grew to include regret it was the first step toward making a change and i fastened on it like a lifeline rushing forward through her life i found more memories of johnny forgotten the sullen thankyou he gave her last sunday when she gave him the remote control instead of lording over the tv the gratitude she had felt two weeks ago when she overheard him stick up for her with his friends and the time that he changed her bowling score so it would look like she won he loved her and she had all but forgotten i could feel tammy crying holding her knees to herself utterly miserable i could feel her sorrow her heartache it ran through me like it was my own and i gave her some of my hope wanting to leave her with the idea that things werent so bad we were as much our past as our future and hers was better than she knew she just had to look at it in a new way a tear hot and heavy spilled down my cheek and as i wiped it away i pulled back from tammys aura to see what id done the orange at its center was now rimmed with black my heart gave a thump then stopped my first thought was that id damaged her made things worse but then i decided it didnt matter her aura had shifted maybe just enough demus or arariel wouldnt find her pulling back farther i memorized tammys new resonance so i could find it again i had no idea if the color shift was permanent or not she was still a lost soul but perhaps now shed live long enough for me to get out of here and help her i had to get her to do her own soulsearching she had to make the choice herself tammys aura melted into the glorious bright line of the present as i withdrew and a feeling of satisfaction filled me smiling i fingered my amulet warm from having touched the divine take that seraphs i thought feeling empowered for the first time in a long while curious i brought my own resonance before me wondering if i had any black in my aura before i had died and taken on the dark timekeepers amulet i felt a soft quiver in me as i ran my attention down my recent history blurring over the snarl the time line had made when my soul had been cut out of it it was where i had died and it amazed me how the lives around me had bound together supporting each other until a new weft and weave could mend the tear and then the sudden burst of light when i had taken the amulet from kairos the timekeeper before me using it to keep me connected to the present nervous i steadied myself and looked past the snarl it wasnt easy to look at ones past knowing it was fixed and ones emotions were laid bare but i felt myself smile as i saw that i really hadnt changed since id died sure my original aura of blue and yellow was vastly different from the deep violet that it now was but my vision of the balance between good and bad was about the same it really was a pretty aura i thought sort of mentally running my fingers through it and feeling melancholy that it wasnt mine anymore or was it maybe i could change my own aura just for a moment and be myself shifting focus i ran my attention back to the present until i found myself sitting alone in a cops office waiting for them to find a battery for my phone my aura was the dark of a timekeepers not my own but as i compared it to the one in my memory a faint glimmer of blue seemed to echo not in my aura but in the hazy gray where the future became the now between the now and the next oh crap i thought excitement zinging down to my toes was that what the seraph had meant was that where my body was hidden in the fraction of existence where time shifted from the past to the future time wouldnt exist there and my body would be pristine and perfect hovering an instant into death until i could reclaim it i took a deep breath letting it all out to try to calm myself if that was my original aura then it had to be coming from my body stuck in stasis where the old timekeeper had left it i could reclaim my body and with that i didnt need the timekeeper amulet to keep me alive and the black wings off me it was all i wanted at this point and i slowly centered myself trying to focus on the small space all around me were my thoughts reaching out to pull me into the future and a tiny almostnotthere glow of blue i snatched at it wanting it so bad i could feel it vertigo came from everywhere and i gasped clenching the arms of the chair but refusing to open my eyes and lose what progress id made this is mine i whispered feeling my lips move and the last bit of breath i had in my lungs escape there was the faintest taste of salt on my lips and i licked them curious a faint breeze sifted my hair tickling my cheek but there was no air vent in the cops office the tickling grew more intense and a faint uncomfortable feeling of of i have to go to the bathroom i said eyes still closed and mystified since i had died the only time id run for the bathroom was to evade a question from my dad an uncomfortable feeling slid through me and my hands clenched on the arms of the chair but they werent gripping the hard plastic and metal it was soft like velvet my eyes flew open bright light stabbed into me and i gasped i was still sitting in a hot office smelling like cigarettes and stale sugar but i was also in a breezy room white curtains drifting in over the sills and thresholds i could hear surf and birds the ceiling was marble and the floor was black tile id been here before my island i looked down seeing the grassstained torn remains of my prom dress overlaying the reality of my jeans and black lacy top covered in ash my god it was my body i had found my body between the now and the next right where the seraph had said it was i wasnt in it yet since i could still see the reality of my blue jeans and black top but i had found it and the best part my body looked okay it had been stuck frozen in time and it was normal now all i had to do was let go of the body i was in and take it madison someone grabbed my shoulder from behind i jerked and with a cry i felt a gutwrenching pull pain vibrated through me and i doubled over eyes closed against the pain the sound of the wind and the taste of the salt were gone i had almost had it but now it was gone madison are you okay you looked like a ghost seethrough stop i croaked out almost vomiting as i bent over my knees my eyes opened and sadness rose up i was staring at the ugly green and white tiles of the police station where in the hell was the beach i almost had it i cried standing up and nearly hitting barnabas in the chin he backed up in confusion and i spun looking at the chair as if i might still see myself sitting in it torn prom dress and all but all that i saw was the empty chair barnabas i was there i pointed down feeling my heart thump but i knew it wasnt real it wasnt realand the heartache of that almost brought me to tears i found my body between the now and the next it was at the island stuck in a time bubble or something barnabas damn it why couldnt you have waited just a few minutes more i almost had it i was in it i was almost alive barnabass shocked expression went empty you found my body yes i looked at the ugly room torn between crying and screaming at someone there were footsteps in the hall and barnabas took my elbow lets go the sooner we get out of here the fewer memories im going to have to fix he started pulling me to the door and i dug my heels in memories hes worried about memories i found my body and you dont care i do care but we have to get out of here his grip on me tightening he jerked me into the hallway as someone skidded around the bend in the hallway where do you think youre going the cop said and then his eyes widened as he looked at barnabas hey werent you at the fire falling into a crouch he reached for his gun you have got to be kidding me barnabas said pushing me toward the end of the hallway i found my friggin body and you dont care i insisted resisting stop the cop exclaimed and barnabass eyes inches from my own glinted silver as sweet as syrup the man fell down i looked over my shoulder to see but barnabass grip on my arm tightened and he started pushing me to the end of the hallway again im thrilled you found your body but were trying to get out of here he muttered you can claim your body later his gaze went over my shoulder and his eyes widened run he shoved me and i staggered almost cracking my nose as i went down on all fours my palms stung and my knees throbbed i looked up in time to see barnabas make a gesture his eyes silvering for a moment the second man bending over the first fell but i could hear more people coming ticked i pulled myself up off the floor my palms were sticky and i didnt know what to wipe them on later i shouted i want it now my last words were a veritable shout and a wave of angry force pulsed from me swearing barnabas ducked his face white as he rose from his crouch and looked at me i staggered as the dizziness that had risen up and lapped about my head slowly ebbed to my feet my hand went to the wall and i swear it felt spongy i yanked it back then blinked my stone had gone ice cold and silvery uh madison barnabas whispered and i realized it was quiet you know too quiet the men sprawled on the floor werent moving fear trickled through me as i remembered that burst of anger that had exploded from me had i killed them whoohoo came nakitas excited whoop from somewhere in the building and a sudden pounding of feet echoed in the hallway i spun as she leapt over the downed men skidding to a breathless halt her sword bared and her amulet gleaming madison when did you learn to stop time stop time i uh i stammered then looked at my amulet it was still silver like barnabass eyes when he touched the divine a thread of sound was running through me and when i chanced a look at the time line it burst into existence so brilliantly that i almost fell i dont know i said instinct making me cover my eyes though the brightness was in me blinking i dropped my inner sight and looked up barnabas was holding me upright seeing me okay he let go and stepped back uh how do i undo it i asked them not yet nakita exclaimed her color high wait until we get out she darted past us to the back door sending her whoops of excitement to echo in the absolute stillness the clock in the cops office wasnt ticking when we passed it the lights from the cars outside werent moving the only sound in the entire world was coming from us it was as creepy as all getout and i did it lets go barnabas said clearly subdued i followed him down the hall to where nakita was pushing open the automatic door outside was even creepier with no wind no noise it was as if we had walked into a painting everything felt flat nakita almost danced down the cement steps and to the shadowed parking lot madison youre getting good at this i think we should try teaching you how to make a sword from your thoughts when this is done okay i cringed all i wanted to do was go home i wanted to get my body and go home and forget everything that had happened but if i did nothing would change not in heaven not in earth not in me nothing how do i start time i whispered confusion so thick in me it made me ill i dont know barnabas scuffed to a halt beside a cop car turning to look as a ball of light burst out the stillopen doors madison grace exclaimed darting circles around me you stopped time thats wonderful and how clever of you to exempt the divine i had been wondering about that but it wasnt as if i knew what i was doing it would be if she knew how she did it barnabas said echoing my thoughts he stood with his hands on his hips watching nakita doing her impression of a professional football player after a touchdown what is your problem barney nakita said giving him a little shove as she finished madison is finally getting the hang of this you look like you just swallowed a scarab barnabas furrowed his brow the skin tight around his eyes she found her body nakitas smile hesitated her eyes becoming confused even as her delight lingered in her expression what she found her body between the now and the next he said again and even graces glow dimmed it was if the deadness of the world around us seeped into nakita she froze unspoken thoughts turning her elation into ash nakita i said reaching out and she took a step back the sword in her hand dissolving into nothing her amulet went dark as the energy was reabsorbed and her gaze fell from mine im happy for you she said not looking at me i know its what you wanted nakita why was i feeling bad about this if the seraphs werent going to give me a real chance to make this work then why should i stick around and be a part of a system that i didnt agree with i could be with josh then and be normal but she had turned away and guilt hit me hard nakita i said more firmly and she stopped feeling like a heel i caught up with her and tried to get her to look at me i dont want to give this up but what choice do i have you say you believe in choice she said turning away but you dont really or youd stay again she turned away and this time i let her go grace came to hover over my shoulder and barnabas eased up on my other side why does everyone think i should stick around when no one believes i can change things i believe you can change things barnabas said but i wasnt listening and i stomped off nakita had found the street and was walking in front of cars that had been going fifty miles per hour her pace stiff and her arms swinging i do he insisted as he caught up to me thats why i left ron i still think you can if youd stick with it he probably did which made it all the harder madison he said as he drew me to a stop we were at the curb and the lights from the oncoming traffic lit his face showing his pinched brow and his eyes pleading with me you keep saying that no one is giving you a chance to see if your theories work but they are youre trying to change a system that has been in place since people looked up at the stars and wondered how they got there it works for a reason and you might make more progress if youd take the time to see why a system is in place before trying to change it to yours the seraphs are singing i can hear them even down here change is happening you simply dont see it you might have to do something you dont want to for a while before you find the way to make your change happen i couldnt say anything back i was too depressed seeing me silent he inclined his head then turned to follow nakita walking fast as he tried to catch up nakita he called out and i stared at him my hand wrapped around my amulet i think it was the longest thing hed ever said to me and it left me feeling even worse im such an idiot i whispered to grace but youre our idiot she chimed out and i winced what do you think i should do i asked as i started to follow them my sneakers barely lifting from the asphalt first you need to let go of the time line and start things moving she said before ron comes to see whats going on yeah okay let go of the time line how does one do that and i think you ought to go home and check in with your dad before he realizes i set his clocks back two hours grace added he thinks its like ten thirty same as here oh wow thanks grace the first inkling of hope started to seep back in and i mentally added talk to nakita to my list of things to do she looked positively melancholy as she walked beside barnabas her head down as he talked to her well once a guardian angel always a guardian angel she said wryly if a glowing ball of light could be wry and after that you can meet us back in the graveyard to figure out how to fix this mess you made with tammy the seraphs are ticked when did you learn how to change a persons aura right before i learned how to stop time i said thinking it wasnt right that my learning something had gotten me in trouble with the seraphs again great grace said pointedly how about starting it back up this is getting old any tighter of a grip and you would have stopped your reapers too i nodded bringing up the image of the time line in my imagination it was brighter than usual and it was starting to give me a headache relax i thought dropping my shoulders my eyes flashed open when just that easy the noise and color rushed back into the world good job grace said dipping up and down as car lights flickered over us and a cry of outrage rose up from the cop shop lets get out of here i ran after barnabas and nakita glad time was going again but that lingering feeling of doubt wouldnt leave me yes i had found my body but no one seemed to care or rather they wished i hadnt what did it say about my life when the thing i wanted most of all was the very thing that would cause me to lose the things i loved chapter seven it was almost too dark to see when barnabas backwinged and landed me gently on the roof of my house the threat of rain making it darker than it typically would be the muffling black was like a blanket smothering it seemed to spill out my darkened bedroom window to fill the entire world and make one big nothing it was sort of how i felt inside my short hair flew up as barnabas settled his wings and i reached to smooth it catching a glimpse of his wings before they vanished head down he stood before me as if wanting to say something it had been a very quiet flight backmy thoughts on nakita his on whoknewwhat leaving her had been hard with her stalking to the graveyard to wait for me probably thinking i was going to abandon her once i got my body back demus was somewhere this side of heaven but since he was looking for the wrong resonance i had a space of time to regroup i was going to spend at least five minutes of it convincing my dad that nothing was going on and that i was going to bed there was that word again nothing nothing was exactly how i felt empty inside after having been in my body for even that instant i remembered what it was like to see feel to really be a part of existence now the shell that my amulet gave me felt like the nothing that it was you sure you want me to leave barnabas finally said seeing as neither of us was moving from the roof i nodded arms wrapped around myself the slight chill seeping into me after the steamy warmth of baxter it should only take an hour i said wondering why hed landed here instead of the front yard and i want to see if josh can slip away itd be great if he could come back with us he at least would be glad i had found my body and that it wasnt a mass of decayed yuck an hour looking uncomfortable barnabas flicked a dark gaze to me then back to the cloudy skies ive got time to go back and get your phone then theres no reason to leave it there to trigger memories thank you i said earnestly i hoped hed get it there was no way to explain to my dad why it was in california unless youre sure you dont want me to wait for you barnabas asked i shook my head nakita was there alone moving to the edge of the roof i sat down to make the jump to the ground lucy the neighbors golden retriever wasnt in the yard i hesitated at the scrape of barnabass sneakers beside me and i looked up to his shadowed face what do you want me to say to nakita barnabas asked his eyes catching the glow from the streetlamp she thinks youre leaving are you you want me to lie to her my depression thickened frosted with guilt i didnt know i wanted to stay but i couldnt do this if all i was doing was killing people tell her that im thinking i said unable to look at him anymore tell her that im proud of her and you and that i want it to work i want to stay i will stay if barnabas didnt move but somehow he became darker what if the seraphs dont allow you to do things your way they did send demus it was exactly what i was worried about but i gave him a fake smile my feet dangling into the black between heaven and earth hey im the dark timekeeper what are they going to do kill me they already did that i looked away fear making me drop my eyes they could take my amulet away and let black wings destroy me a soul without an aura was fair game and mine came from my amulet right now but i wasnt going to take the job of dark timekeeper and send reapers out to kill people to save their souls if the reason i was doing it was because i was afraid even if i was ill talk to her he finally said clearly seeing my fear thanks barnabas i pushed myself off the roof my knees bending to absorb the impact of the fall i looked up to try and see him wing out but there was nothing except the barely moving black branches between me and the heavy clouds head down i walked to the front door looking at my shoelaces skulls and hearts maybe i should grow up a sliver of selfpreservation made me hesitate before i went in grace said shed fixed things with my dad but it was still hard to grab the doorknob and turn it reaching for it i felt a prickling through my aura my fingers curled under and i waited breathing in the feeling its almost like im being watched i said then spun as my amulet grew warm my breath hissed in and i watched a vertical line of divine silver crack the night a somewhat short thin man seemed to step through it sideways the light making a silhouette of his tight graying curls and his billowy clothes ron i hissed exhaling everything id just taken in it was the light timekeeper himself standing on my front lawn in the dark my first thought to call barnabas lit through me and died i could stop time damn it i didnt need barnabass help besides he was probably shielding his resonance and wouldnt be able to hear me cocking my hip i stared at ron as he finished materializing what do you want i shot out and he jerked his head up seeming to be surprised i knew he was there it was a brief flash of satisfaction in an otherwise sucky night the small man quickly recovered his pompous attitude shaking out his billowy robes that were more suited to the back lot of a hollywood set than anything that had to do with reality and he thought what i wore was funny to know what youre up to he said filling those few words with more sly bile than one would think possible god help me he knew everything my arms crossed over my middle i didnt care if it made me look vulnerable my day hadnt gone well and there was no hiding it im trying not to get grounded i said lightly maybe you should leave before i yell for help and get you thrown in jail for being a pervert ron only smiled that same infuriating smile you learned how to stop time congratulations funny how it didnt sound like congratulations when he said it and i looked at the porch light wishing grace was here to make a tree branch fall on him yeah so what ron took a step closer head cocked as he lost his smug air i had a reaper out there so i noticed i rocked back toward my door not liking this so i wonder what youre doing he drawled as if id fill in the blank blah blah blah i said making talkinghand motions dont start monologing ron im not doing anything i turned to go inside gasping when ron grabbed my arm spinning i yanked out of his grip shocked that he had touched me back off i exclaimed softly as i stared down the two steps at him not wanting to explain to my dad who he was my heart gave a thump and settled you changed the marks resonance ron said clearly angry as he looked up at me my reaper cant find her wahh wahh wahh i thought madison isnt playing fair but what came out of my mouth was a short good youre going to get her killed ron said my eyes narrowed did that i said shortly made a video posted it online its over ron go home it is not over he insisted looking both angry and confused she isnt dead you wouldnt kill her though i dont know why what are you trying to do you cant change things they are what they are i took a breath feeling the disappointment of the entire day fall on me but this time it only made me mad i didnt have to explain myself to him yanking my door open i went inside grimacing at him standing at the foot of the steps before i shut the door in his face exhaling i leaned back against it i could hear my dad on the phone in the kitchen his voice holding a hint of strain as it rose and fell i pushed myself up and peeked outside through the narrow window beside the door ron was gone thank you god the house looked quiet and normal and my dad stepped from the kitchen with the landline phone stuck to his ear my first thought was he was on the phone with josh or joshs mom wanting to know where i was but then he gave me a finger wave and i knew he thought it was still before my curfew bev shes fine he said somewhat crossly and i realized he was talking to my mom it was just a prank phone call oh jeez the cops at the juvie center had reached her worried i glanced out the window for ron then came in trying to hear her end of the conversation i said shes fine my dad said rolling his eyes at me shes upstairs asleep or id put her on the phone so you could see for yourself i reached for the receiver and he shook his head why is my dad lying to my mom about where i am bev he said his voice taking on that tightness that i remembered from when i was growing up listen to me madison is fine i am fine we are getting along fine and i think you have a problem with that i can raise our daughter just as well as you can shes a wonderful girl and i honestly dont know where you come up with this stuff ill have her call you tomorrow im not going to wake her up because someone is yanking your chain go take a valium or something my eyes were wide as he hung up and exhaled looking at the phone like he wanted to throw it at the wall mom i asked though it was obvious she thinks i cant take care of you he said the skin around his eyes wrinkling to make him look tired a sick feeling seemed to steal around my heart and seeing it reflected in my eyes he forced the irritation from his expression smiling though i knew he was still upset and likely would be for a few days dad youre taking care of me great i said feeling lost and i gave him a hug my guilt rising high my dying was not his fault and i couldnt bear it if he thought it was he gave me a squeeze then he stepped back thanks he said softly call your mother tomorrow trust me you dont want to talk to her now he said as he went back into the kitchen to hang up the phone someone told her you were on the west coast in jail having been accused of setting fire to an apartment complex really i said forcing a laugh as i wondered how a call had gotten past grace my dad carefully hung up the phone but his fingers were shaking and the click seemed unusually loud maybe if your mother would get into the twentyfirst century and get caller id she wouldnt have to put up with cranks like that yawning he covered his mouth with the back of his hand i cant believe how tired i am he said dropping his wrist to look at his watch i tried to call you but youre either out of minutes or your battery is dead his eyes met mine annoyance in them again he added i couldnt bear lying to him and i went to the fridge pretending to get a glass of apple juice i dumped out about a gallon of it every week um its probably the battery i said as i stuck my head in the fridge and breathed in the cold air i uh kind of loaned it to barnabas madison the exclamation was like a whip and i pulled back out of the fridge my eyes downcast ill get it back tomorrow i promised use mine until you get yours back okay he said as he handed me his where did you and josh eat the heavy black phone felt funny in my grip different from my slim pink one the time was more than two hours off but as soon as i looked at it it magically shifted to the right time um the low d i said scrambling to remember our cover story nakita and barnabas were with us after joshs track meet stuff you ate right as much as i always do smiling i got a glass out of the cupboard and poured myself some juice he wasnt saying anything just looking at me with concern i might have something before i go to bed though i added and he seemed to lose much of his worry can i go over to nakitas tomorrow we took a lot of pictures at the meet and i want to help her organize them sure but get your chores done before you leave this time he said i might not be here when you get up ive got to go in tomorrow to close out a trial i hate those tenday biological runs half the time you either have to start them on the weekend or end them on one dont forget to empty the dishwasher take out the recyclables and i want the porch swept before you leave front and back this time it was the usual list and i recapped the juice hoping he would leave before i had to drink some yes dad i almost groaned again he yawned looking at the clock over the stove i cant believe how tired i am i must not have had enough coffee today im going to bed too i said leaving my juice on the counter and going to give him a hug good night his arms went around me in a blanket of security and he kissed the top of my head im serious about calling your mom tomorrow he said softly still holding me shes worried about you i will i promised he let go and i dropped back turning to leave he hesitated you smell like smoke i didnt know if he meant from the fire or the cigarette stench from the police station and i fumbled saying i got a ride home with one of joshs friends the car stank my dad accepted that smiling faintly as he rubbed the top of his head leaving his hair mussed did you set your stops right he asked meaning the photography stops you know it i said cheerfully i want to see the pictures when youre ready he said as he turned and shuffled into the hall i know its the weekend but dont stay up too late he said from the stairs i exhaled my faith in grace increasing a hundredfold damn she was good at keeping me out of trouble with my dad she and josh both okay i called back to him then stood there listening to hear his bedroom door shut maybe i could get out of here sooner than i thought the house went quiet and i dumped my apple juice rinsed out the glass then hesitated when i opened up the dishwasher sighing i pulled the rack out and started to empty it i was able to stop time and here i was emptying the dishwasher it might not be a bad idea to sweep the porch too before i left the soft tap at the kitchen window shot through me like a pulse of fear and my head snapped up thinking it was ron but it was josh standing between the house and the foundation plantings his nose and eyes showing seeing my relief he dropped from sight but i was already on my way to the front door swearing softly at him for having scared me josh i whispered as i opened the door i thought your mom grounded you his gaze went to the stairway and he whispered back youre not the only one who can sneak out what happened did you get in trouble my mom tried to call your dad but the call wouldnt go through and then the phone died i exhaled thanking grace she loved causing mischief if it would keep me out of trouble i pulled him in seeing the street behind him was empty and dark he must have biked over so his car wouldnt wake anyone up come on in i said softly my dads upstairs no doubt josh looked at his watch youre going back to baxter tonight right i nodded not sure what i hoped to accomplish anymore but knowing that it wasnt over yet im going to have to josh you wont believe what happened he followed me in taking the plates from me as i pulled them out josh knew my kitchen almost as well as i did and he slid them away being careful not to make too much noise did you get grounded he asked in a serious voice i looked up from stacking the bowls blinking until i figured it out oh no i said grounding was the least of my worries grace set the clocks back my dad thinks its before midnight no grounding nice he said glancing at the clock over the stove as i went to reset it whats so awful then his face went concerned oh no madison they didnt die did they i touched the digital clock and the numbers jumped to the correct time i jerked my hand back as if stung staring at it that was weird no i said the apartment caught on fire tammy and johnny are okay but she told the cops that i set it i spent most of the night in some cops office watching grace short out my phones battery so they couldnt call my dad josh made a noise of disbelief and i turned shrugging barnabas and nakita got me out and i learned how to stop time and change tammys aura thats great josh said his pleased expression fading when i didnt smile back isnt it the seraphs sent a dark reaper to scythe tammy i said feeling the hurt of that all over again theyre giving up on me so of course ron sent a light reaper to stop him it was a mess he stopped by tonight ron i mean i looked toward the front door as if i could see through the walls trying to figure out what i was doing eyes wide josh fumbled for a clean glass so what is he going to do i dont know i said the open dishwasher between us at least he admitted he doesnt think im trying to kill her no he just thinks im being stupid i did manage to stop the dark reaper the seraphs sent out his name is demus hes a redhead i said my focus blurring as i remembered how good he looked what do you like him joshs voice had risen in pitch and i jerked my attention to him hes an angel i said hiding a quick smile when i realized he was jealous youre not worried are you of an angel no he said but his motions as he stacked the bowls said otherwise josh i said worried that he felt like he didnt belong and might leave angels are pretty but they are kind of intense you know yeah but they can fly oh stop it i said giving his shoulder a little push as i leaned across the dishwasher between us and grabbed the silverware i like you okay not an angelic serial killer when you put it like that he said smiling and i turned away suddenly uneasy angelic serial killer and i was the boss as soon as josh figured out how true that was he might be gone and then id be a bigger freak than before puppy presents this sucked silverware in hand i yanked the drawer open with my pinkie tonight had been a disaster i couldnt plug the holes fast enough and the water was almost up to my chin frustrated i gave up sorting the forks from the spoons and just dumped them in and shut the drawer arms over my chest i stood at the counter and stared at the wall youll make it work i know you will josh said softly the dishwasher was empty and feeling numb i sat at the table and put my head in my hands i couldnt do this anymore the lies the sneaking around i was trying to change something that no one else wanted to changeno one else saw anything wrong with except barnabas barnabas believed i could do it head down i exhaled feeling my breath leave me and my lungs collapse i didnt have to breathe again and that bothered me i wanted to be normal damn it what guy wants to date a superhero who never needs rescuing he had his pride besides the seraphs didnt believe in me tammy hated me nakita was upset my eyes grew warm and i wasnt surprised when a tear brimmed and fell i dont have to breathe but i can still cry how unfair is that madison joshs hesitant touch on my shoulder made me even more depressed and i sniffed not looking up im sorry i said sitting up and wiping my eyes im not crying i said as if trying to convince myself because i sure wasnt convincing him its only that nothing is going right anymore smiling faintly josh sat down beside me its going to be okay he said finding and holding my hand thats not why im crying i said head down and tears leaking out no matter how hard i tried to stop them i mean tammy is important but i couldnt say the words they sounded so lame next to the problem of tammy being hunted by a dark reaper one of my dark reapers then what josh asked and i looked at my hand in his he was holding it protectively and it hit me hard ii found my body i whispered looking at our hands on our touching knees when i was in the police station i almost had it almost managed to slip into it completely and make it mine again but barnabas came in and i lost it your body josh said then glanced at the hall madison thats fantastic he said his voice softer why are you upset if you found it once you can find it again you can be fully alive again thats great its not great i said miserable no one else was happy about it they all want me to stay as the dark timekeeper i dont know why im not good at it barnabas thinks i can change things but he used to be a light reaper nakita thinks its a waste of time now the seraphs are mad at me they think im not taking this seriously or that i dont understand whats at risk miserable i wiped my eyes again and sniffed loudly im happy josh said as he leaned forward at that i let out a barking sound of a sob dropping my head and letting go of his hands so i could wipe my face im tired of it all i said feeling it hit me hard as i admitted it aloud im tired of lying to my dad tired of fighting to make myself understood tired of not being able to sleep or eat i just want to come home and be normal i looked up at him through my wet eyes to see sympathy but no understanding but he started and i shook my head stopping him nakita is depressed because i might leave and forget about her barnabas is disappointed that i want to give up on something hes believed in for thousands of years but was too afraid to try for until now im actually starting to figure things out and somehow its making things worse not easier i changed tammys aura today i said finding no joy in it and i stopped time i stopped time josh and i dont even care yes you do he said and i shook my head but at least i was able to stop crying for the first time i said for the first time i feel like i can make a difference but the seraphs wont give me a chance i could do this timekeeper thing if they would just let me do it suddenly i realized how close we were he had taken my hands again and his knees where they pressed against mine were warm he was listening to me and it almost started me crying again i miss not being able to eat dinner with my dad i whispered i miss waking up and looking at the sun on my wall and wondering what the day is going to be like i blinked and a tear brimmed and fell josh wiped it away and his hand taking mine again was damp i miss being normal i breathed feeling drained and thinking about paul the rising light timekeeper sure there was the icky factor of having ron as a teacher but he did have a teacher and a life and probably a girlfriend who didnt know he was someday going to be a friggin timekeeper in charge of angels he could pretend he was the same as everyone else most timekeepers get to live their entire life before the old one dies and they have to set everything aside and be more than normal im going to miss everything okay so maybe i was being a little drama queen but josh was the only person who i could tell this to who might understand youre not going to miss everything he said and before i knew what he was doing he leaned in and gave me a kiss a spark lifted in me my hands tightened on his and i shifted my head so our lips met more fully my eyes closed and i leaned in just a bit feeling the space between us electricity spun down to my toes and i pulled him closer it was awkward sitting the way that we were but it was the first time all day that i felt something other than confusion and desperation i didnt want the kiss to end but he slowly pulled back the memory of my heartbeat thumped and my eyes opened i felt breathless though i knew i couldnt be josh was smiling and his eyes flicked to mine and held making me feel warm again you want your body right he asked as if he hadnt just made every part of me come alive i nodded and he added so go get it i pulled back worried you mean you think i should give the amulet up i said feeling a ping of alarm ring through me just walk away from being the dark timekeeper no of course not he shifted and our knees parted but ron still has his body right hes alive and hes still the light timekeeper so whats the big deal you want it go get it being alive doesnt mean you have to give it up does it no i said hesitantly as i recalled my conversation with a seraph on that greek island when i accepted the position i had asked if i could take the amulet until i found my body then return it and the seraph had said i could if that was what i chose to do if i chose now to have both wouldnt that count for something josh leaned in surprising me when he kissed me again lightly almost teasingly as he took my fingers in his just go get it let the rest figure itself out i looked at the hallway thinking of my dad now josh stood grinning down at my reluctance why not if it had been me i would have made barnabas stop so i could have taken it when i first saw it they live forever madison what do they know go get your body and ill make you a sandwich we can eat it and be normal and when were done being normal we can call barnabas and you can go back to saving the world jeez madison even superheroes have real lives it was exactly what i wanted what id been thinking about all day and i sat at the table unable to stop my fake heart from pounding he made it sound so simple i wanted it to agonize over what everyone else thought i might do because i had my body was a stupid thing to do im going to do it i said and his smile grew wide i knew you would he gave me a soft smack on the shoulder it wasnt as nice as that kiss but i smiled back at him doing this felt right for a change heaven be damned if they didnt want to do things my way then id just give the amulet back and to hell with them all excitement zinged down to my toes almost as potent as that kiss had been i settled myself more firmly in the chair setting it square to the table with my back to the hallway arch josh made a sound of surprise here what if your dad comes in he had moved to stand beside the coffeepot concern in his expression and i put my hand out hoping hed come sit beside me i want you with me when i do this i said my foot jiggling under the table you in my room after midnight isnt going to happen talk about my dad having a cow the roof is out too ron might still be out there okay but we could go somewhere else he said arms crossing in front of him as he looked out the black window to the street barnabas is going to be here in an hour i said impatiently theres nothing open it will be fine josh the first time i did this i was in a cops office besides what do you think is going to happen i slip into my body and its done he made a face and i wiggled my fingers at him my palm up a kiss for luck i said feeling myself grow warm i couldnt wait to get my real body back everything i felt with josh was being filtered through my amulet and i just wanted to be myself again josh chuckled at that his arms uncrossing as he took the few steps that separated us a kiss for luck he said one hand taking mine and the other going flat on the table between us with a last look at the empty hallway as if my dad might be coming he leaned over the table tilted his head and met my lips i breathed him in imagining i could feel his aura swirling through mine my eyes shut and i leaned forward our lips moving against each other as the memory of my heart gave a pound i want to be alive again i thought as my fingers tightened on his and then let go his eyes opened as we pulled away his gaze going to the hallway before they came back to me if youre sure he said pulling out the chair facing the archway and sitting down my heart was still pounding and i shrugged licking my lips as if trying to seal the memory of him there tell me if you hear him coming down okay josh put his arms flat on the table his head shaking okay god i hope this works i felt like i was running out of time smiling at josh i closed my eyes and resettled myself i felt him take my hand and i gave his fingers a squeeze it was easy to find my mindscape of the sheet of the present and the tightly interwoven threads of everyones lives falling from it i could see joshs blue twining heavily about mine barnabas and nakita close in thought but not presence inching my awareness higher i found the lines of my thought that were attaching to my amulet and pulling me into the future and between them was the soft blue and yellow glow of my body stuck in time waiting for me i can do this i breathed as i let my awareness fall into the spaces in between like a foot into a welldesigned shoe my soul gave a sigh and slipped into my body the memory of joshs lips on mine was replaced by the taste of salt the hum of the fridge ebbed and became the sound of surf i gasped when a wrench twisted my gut josh cried out but it sounded thin and unreal and with that same sort of mental relaxation id used to let go of the time line and get it started again i let my mind slip back an instant in time i hadnt before and it made all the difference with a little thunk of presence i felt my body shift back in sync with the universe i was here and there was no going back my heart pounded and a thrilling sensation spilled through me as i sat up in a spacious sunlit room i looked down at my torn prom dress unbelieving as i felt the grimy fabric between two bloodcaked fingers that fast it was done i was in my body dizziness hit me and i took a gasping breath almost forgetting to let it out a laugh burbled up mixing with the sounds of gulls i had to breathe i had to breathe my hand went to my neck and i found my amulet swinging my feet around i jerked my toes from the cold marble floor everything seemed to be moving slowly and i ached everywhere there was no toe tag when i looked but i remembered having torn that off a throbbing at the front of my head brought my hand up and i probed my forehead carefully feeling what was probably a bruise my shoulder and chest hurt i pulled the dirtstained grimy dress from me to look down my front and see a long bruise where the seat belt would have been i was really in my body it was mine i did it i shouted hearing my voice echo and the gulls outside seemed to mock me coughing i hunched on the velveteen couch holding my ribs so it wouldnt hurt so much i did it i whispered not caring if i hurt i had done it and i wondered if my resonance had changed because i was again in my body black wings i realized wouldnt be a problem anymore but then my victorious smile hesitated and slowly vanished moving carefully until i was sure i could i stood up and hobbled toward the nearest door frantically searching for the one thing i hadnt needed in six months i had really done it the proof they say is in the pudding or in this case the can i had to go to the bathroom in the worst way and i didnt have a clue where it was chapter eight i trailed my hand across the smooth marble walls just so i could feel the silky sensation as i left the bathroom it had taken me an entire desperate three minutes to find it the huge washroom had been off an entire suite of rooms that i was guessing had been kaiross private quarters kairos the same guy who had killed me id give the man one thing he had taste everything id found in my mad dash for the bathroom had been scrumptiously elegant cold and precise a band poster or cd rack would look out of place which made me wonder how much time hed actually spent here giving the huge sunken tub a last longing glance from over my shoulder i padded barefoot into the bedroom with its huge bed of soft pillows and downy comforters still messed up from when kairos had left it which was kind of creepy when you thought about it my body had been here all along just an instant out of step with the rest of the world and therefore unseen and protected from the passage of time sort of like barnabas hiding his wings out of sync with the universe and invisible the sun coming in the huge windows with the flat ocean beyond it made me sigh taking a bath didnt sound prudent even if i would feel a hundred percent better i had changed clothes though spending the rest of the night trying to save tammy in my old prom dress wasnt an option kairos predictably hadnt had any skirts or dresses in his closet but id found a black pair of trousers that almost fit if i rolled up the bottoms and a baggy tunic that might be fashionable if you were in azeroth in world of warcraft i hoisted the baggy pants up higher and tied a small knot in the waistband to keep them from falling down as i went into the hallway the shirt i couldnt do much with and id just have to be careful not to lean too far forward my old dress was wadded up and shoved under the bathroom sink if i never saw it again it would be too soon though caught in time and basically static for the time id been out of my body i couldnt help but feel like id been wearing it since id died no wonder my chest hurt scrunched into that corset my shoulder ached from the car accident and i swung it experimentally smiling yeah it hurt but it was because i was alive i couldnt wait to tell josh the hallway opened up into a huge common area with fabulous cushions and low tables which in turn led out to the spacious tiled patio through wide archways edged in flowing curtains i knew no one had been here since kairos had died but everything looked clean one of the perks of living on holy ground maybe i headed for the outside my hand holding my amulet in reassurance i was soooo glad i still had it and it hadnt been left behind in the kitchen when i had vanished and i was sure i had barnabas had told me i had looked like a ghost when he yanked me back the first time and since my amulet was what gave me my fake body and it was with me now poor josh i thought wishing i had a way to talk soundlessly with him as i went outside and blinked in the sudden sun he must be worried sick me vanishing like that as soon as i got myself thinking straight i was going to contact barnabas or nakita to come pick me up nakita at least knew where kaiross island was seeing as she killed him here my eyes darted to the broken table where shed scythed him the cracked table empty of any sign of violence id taken on the duties of the dark timekeeper before the blood of the last one had gone cold and i shivered the hard stone had been cracked when the seraph had laughed at me for not believing in fate or had it been laughing because it had seen the future and knew that id be here now wanting my body and the amulet both theyd let me keep it right concerned i wrapped my arms around myself and turned from the table as i remembered the painful beauty of the seraph theyd let me keep the amulet i mean id asked if i could try it out then give it back and the angel had given me this crafty look and said i could if that was what i chose like choice was all that there was when it was obvious that seraphs were all about fate it had even said that there was always a choice well i was making one now ron had an amulet and he was alive it had said i could choose to give up my amulet when i found my body that meant the default was for me to keep it right determination filled me and the wind from the water rose up the hundredfoot drop from the tiny beach to shift my hair the white cloth strung between the pillars made kaiross patio look like a perfume commercial the tide was mostly out and i closed my eyes and faced the sun hands spread wide as if i could take the moment and remember it forever filling myself with the heat of the sun my heart beat in my chest and i breathed in and out i was alive and it felt wonderfuleven if my neck hurt as if i had whiplash slowly my smile faded and my head dropped somewhere on the other side of the earth nakita waited in the darkness thinking i was going to give up my position and abandon her some might think it unhealthy to have pinned so much on another person but nakita was an angel one of heavens finest reapers for a creature who had existed since time began fear was a worldaltering realization her mind wasnt created to understand it and i was her only way to figure it out friend was too simple a word master was just wrong mentor didnt fit i only knew we had a bond and i couldnt dismiss it just to make my life easier my hand gripping my amulet i closed my eyes thinking of nakitas aura shifting my own aura so my thought could slip free of me i sent a call to her imagining her in my mind nakita i thought feeling my emotion wing from me and i modified it to her aura exactly and precisely right before it hit the top of the atmosphere and bounced down even if she were on the opposite side of the earth she would hear but my thoughts stayed empty frowning i tightened my hold on my amulet nakita i thought louder taking more care to tailor it to her again it bounced from the ceiling of air back to earth and simply vanished concerned i opened my eyes i might be in some trouble here eventually theyd talk to josh and figure out what id done and since i had told barnabas that id found my body on my island theyd look for me here how long that would take i didnt know what might happen to tammy in the meantime was not pretty barnabas i called modifying my thought to slip past his aura and into his mind i had always been able to reach him the easiest oh crap i whispered when i got the same responsewhich was no response what the devil was going on it was entirely possible that id accidentally changed my signature when i took my body even if it looked the same to me they might be hearing me and be unable to answer back but i didnt think so it was as if my thoughts werent reaching them at all i spun to look at the broken table fear making my stomach hurt maybe the seraphs had cut me off they had been taking care of the dark timekeepers duties for months what if they had seen me take my body and they just cut me completely out of the equation and left me here before i could tell them i had made a new choice clutching my amulet i searched its depths it looked the same and scared i stood with the dropoff to my back the wind shifting my hair as i held my amulet and brought the time line into focus it looked the same too and i exhaled in relief my amulet at least worked there once was a girl who was dead grace sang and my eyes flew open as i spun looking for her whose decisions she made with her head her body to save was just what she craved choice or fateboth were messed up instead grace i exclaimed hardly able to hear her over the loud surf and squinting still not seeing her glow in the bright sun im so glad youre here barnabas and nakita are they okay i tried calling them and they didnt answer im still the dark timekeeper right a faint buzzing tipped me off that she was nearby and a warmth stole into my aching shoulder soothing it yup youre still the dark timekeeper they cant just take that away you have to voluntarily give it up or be scythed my chest felt warm and i wondered if she had moved to hover before me your aura looks the same she said her voice going more faint maybe theyre just ignoring you you smell funny now gee thanks i said fully aware that i stank like i hadnt bathed in a month there was nothing funny about it do you think you could have one of them come get me im worried about tammy you should be worried about demus she said cryptically demus i echoed wondering what the dark reaper had done but there was no answer she was gone i hadnt even seen her leave my brow furrowed and i crossed my arms over my middle feeing how empty it was the elation at having gotten my body back was starting to fade i was hungry tired and i ached from the injuries id gotten rolling down a hill in a convertible it was starting to get hot and my clothes fit funny looking at my nails and the old polish from the prom i wished i had asked grace to have barnabas bring josh with him god he must be worried sick the hair on the back of my neck seemed to prick and i spun heart pounding there was no one there just the big empty house that now belonged to me madison came from above and i looked up almost blinding myself it was nakita and i backed up under the canopy as she landed her beautiful wings glinting in the afternoon sun she was wearing all white again from her head to her boots and i felt a pang of guilt she only wore white when she was upset with me her way of expressing her anger her face was creased but upon seeing me in my new black clothes pulled from kaiross closet confusion trickled into her eyes youre wearing kaiross clothes she said i i said then hesitated well ive got his job right i said sounding harsher than i intended i may as well do it right nakitas lips parted and her wings rose to block out the sun then youre staying i dont know i admitted and her expression fell as if id told her i was leaving this moment nakita im trying but nothing seems to be working i pleaded with her you can see it better than i can i dont want to think about it okay i just want to do right by tammy then when its over we can think about what comes next she seemed to accept that her head down and the wind shifting her long black hair into her face im sorry the seraphs arent listening to you she said barnabas found demus he went to find you and found josh instead they are both waiting for you in the graveyard josh i exclaimed glad he was going to be there you need to talk to demus nakita said tightly or hes going to kill tammy the second he sees her a faint smile came over me and that would be wrong huh i asked her and she blinked at me slowly her smile grew and she looked almost embarrassed it might be she admitted stretching her wings to put us both in the shade if there is a chance we can change her fate we should go i had forgotten how peaceful it is here her eyes met mine holding not peace but at least a lack of fear or maybe i never noticed before nodding i hoisted my pants back up and minced across the black marble to her nakitas arm went around me and i stepped up on one of her feet standing next to her rather than in front one push of her huge wings and we were airborne my stomach dropped and i clutched at nakitas arm looking down at the small island i shivered flying was a lot scarier now that i was alive again close your eyes nakita warned me and i screwed them shut the muffling softness of her wings pressed against my ears as she enfolded us and the scent of feathers and wind filled my nose i gasped when the world seemed to turn inside out but i was expecting it nakita had flung us across space moving us from high noon to nearly midnight in an eyeblink a warm breeze shifted my hair and i opened my eyes just as nakita unfolded her wings and we dropped into space below us were the scattered lights of baxter descending in a slow spiral nakita angled to a very dark part of town it was the graveyard a fitting spot i thought for a dark timekeeper to meet with her reapers a reaper nakita once saw death comes to the big and the small came graces faint voice but i still couldnt see her alone she once stood thinking no one else would but the truth empowers us all hi grace i said putting a hand to my stomach as we descended in the humid blackness man we were a long way up and the ground looked really hard im not going to drop you nakita said as if she could read my thoughts but it was probably my grip on her arm that gave me away i stumbled as she made the last wingflapping movements in the air and my feet finally touched earth my oversize shirt was slipping and i yanked it back into place warming as everyone looked up barnabas looked uneasy clearly having guessed i had my body back but josh standing beside him grinned demus was leaning indolently against a large stone his arms over his chest and his expression cross until he noticed what i was wearing upon which he straightened to attention as if my clothes gave me status nakita had hidden her wings and was moving to stand hesitantly beside barnabas grace im sure was somewhere about but she wasnt moving so who knew where her bright glow was hi josh i said and he ducked his head as he came forward giving me a quick hug you feel the same as before he said smiling with half his mouth as he gave me a squeeze thanks i said meaning for about six different things barnabas cleared his throat and josh stepped back you scared the life out of me when you just vanished like that josh accused then added proudly i knew you could do it some warning would have been nice sorry i said fidgeting as i turned to barnabas congratulations barnabas said as he handed me my phone his tone not giving me a clue as to what he thought about me getting my body back and my smile started to fade yes well nothing has changed i said as i fumbled for a place to stash it before i handed it to nakita to put in her purse except im hungry demus pushed himself from the tombstone squinting as he approached youre wearing kaiross clothes and his amulet but you dont look anything like him and were all glad of that nakita said earning a chime of laughter from grace who was hiding somewhere there was a crossdresser from france she started and nakita threw a rock at her it went clattering into the dark and i swear i heard a cat yowl i looked down at my clothes the reapers seemed to be making more out of me wearing them than id intended i uh was in that old prom dress it was kind of icky this was the only thing that remotely fit you look fine barnabas said but his eyes were on the dark school behind me well i think you still smell funny grace whispered right next to my ear and i jumped grace flap your wings a little i said its eerie not knowing where you are i was just in time to see the worried look exchanged between nakita and barnabas you cant see her barnabas asked and i flushed again man i was starting to miss being dead ive never been able to see her very well its dark out here i said wondering if i was seeing the tip of my new iceberg first i wasnt able to contact nakita or barnabas and now i was having a hard time seeing grace it didnt help that nakita was still looking at barnabas like i was broken my stomach growled and i levered myself up to sit on the nearest tombstone okay the seraphs are mad i said understatement demus said bluntly as he tossed his amulet up and caught it they sent you to scythe her i added making sure we all knew where we stood the moment i find her demus said throwing his amulet up again into the inky black barnabas reached out and the dark stone smacked into his hand demus sat up fast i wont let you kill her barnabas said she might be able to keep her soul alive rekindle it you dont know they never do demus shouted lunging barnabas sidestepped him smacking his butt with the flat of his sword brought into existence in the time it takes for an electron to spin josh grabbed my elbow and i slid from the stone putting it between us and the reapers demus caught his balance his face twisted into an ugly snarl i will kill her he vowed i will save her soul from butchers like you breaking seraph will choice is nothing compared to fate nothing or youd be able to change it and you cant give me back my amulet my eyes were wide and i gripped the stone i was standing behind josh firmly next to me barnabas had taken the stone to keep demus from having the ability to kill tammy but that wasnt how i wanted to change things and i gave a directive headtoss in demuss direction barnabass lips pressed together disapprovingly but he lobbed it back to the angry angel even as nakita scoffed but we have changed fate dark reaper barnabas said as demus caught it the seraphs just dont want you to know about it if the seraphs dont tell me then i dont need to know demus said cradling his amulet as he hunched protectively over it soon as i find her i take her soul to save it demus said then turned to nakita why are you even listening to this are you going grim nakita nakita stiffened her features lost in the dark as she crossed her arms over her middle nakita wasnt grim but i could see why he asked you cant find her because i changed tammys resonance i said my bare feet going damp in the grass as i came from around the stone and walked toward him and you are not going to kill tammy you dark reaper are going to help me find her and then we are not going to scythe her we are going to talk to her and show her a different choice so she stirs her soul back to life before it dies completely thats how we do things down here now barnabas saved someone ages ago and we saved someone else just last month it can be done life is transitory souls are not to be risked he said backing away if her soul is to be lost then we will save it but not at the cost of her life i said then lowered my voice before someone called the cops about voices in the graveyard i am the dark timekeeper i said pushing forward until his back found a tombstone i survived my predecessor killing me i survived black wings eating me alive i am going to change things i said my heart pounding and you are going to help me got it he didnt say yes but he didnt say no either who am i i insisted youre the dark timekeeper he muttered his expression going from defiance to one of a sullen understanding nakita this is stupid havent you told her that you cant change fate of course i did nakita who had been doing handstands against a tombstone walked on her palms toward us flipping right side up she landed in a fighting pose and then she proved me wrong we saved ace barnabas demus almost whined the angel smiled with half his mouth still leaning on his sword just go with it he advised but if you try to scythe tammy i will stop you demus crossed his arms over his chest defiant but understanding why not just let ron put a flipping guardian angel on her and be done with it he said belligerently if you want to save someones life thats how you do it because were not just trying to save her life were trying to save her soul and her life i said not knowing how to explain it to him it was about free will and choice and angels just didnt get it like barnabas had said heaven was black and white but the earth was colorful slumping to the ground demus sat crosslegged sweet seraph toes i dont get it his head shaking at the angels confusion josh gingerly sat on a broken stone intense and a little dense too he whispered to me and i smiled barnabas put his sword away clearly relaxing as demus backed off so how do we talk to her he asked then added without her calling the cops on you i mean she does think you started the fire right do you want me to wipe her memory no i said quickly head down as i began to pace in the wet grass thats why marks dont change you take their memories and they have nothing to make a change with i came to a halt and pulled my head up everyone leaves tammys memories alone got it demus groaned rocking back as he sat there crosslegged this is the weirdest scything ive ever been on i couldnt help my smile thats because its not a scything its a rescue his head thrown back to the stars demus moaned this isnt going to work my stomach growled and i turned to the empty street im sure tammy would appreciate us trying and he was wrong it would work it had to never going to woooork demus sang and nakita threw a rock at him shut up she exclaimed as demus ducked and the rock shattered into fragments on the stone behind him shes the dark timekeeper and youre going to listen its okay nakita i said as i felt the sudden adrenaline rush banish my tiredness he sounds like you used to hell learn barnabas ran a hand through his curls his eyes on my bare toes theres only one problem he said giving nakita a worried glance and that would be i prompted thinking it likely wasnt my lack of shoes your amulet he said his gaze flicking to it and back to me i dont think its working what do you mean i said grasping it like it might vanish barnabas shrugged what i mean is that grace has been talking to you for the last five minutes and you havent heard a word shes said chapter nine no i exclaimed my grip on my amulet becoming tighter as josh straightened concern pinching his brow i could hear her before barely though and i hadnt seen her at all and i can see the time lines i added bringing them up in my thoughts but panic iced through me and i stared at barnabas all i could see in my mindscape was a hazy glow like the imprint a bright light might leave on your retina its almost not there i yelped they cut me off the seraphs cut me off no wonder i couldnt reach either of you earlier try to talk to me barnabas talk to me barnabas gave me a pained look ive tried been trying madison i dont think youve been cut off then my aura has shifted i was babbling but i couldnt help it josh had risen but i was frantic and i wouldnt let him touch me when he tried to put a hand on my shoulder we can see that and compensate nakita said she was standing next to barnabas i think it was the first time they had ever made a united front demus flopped back against the grass and stared up at the stars completely uncaring like a light reaper can hear a dark timekeeper he scoffed they can josh said belligerently and im not light barnabas added his angry tone shocking me out of my own fear i stared at him and his gaze dropped as if he was ashamed not anymore my lips parted making my fear hesitate he had admitted it barnabas had let go of the last of himself his eyes were on my amulet and i took my hands off it letting it dangle freely if they havent cut me off then i broke it when i took my body i said damn it how long do you think before it fixes itself nakita was waving her hand in front of her face backing up i will she was saying to grace probably since i didnt think nakita was psychotic just shut up a moment okay exhaling she turned to me grace says that your amulet is fine i looked at josh almost wishing id never taken my body back and he dropped his eyes it wasnt his fault i made the choice then they cut me off i started no nakita insisted madison will you just listen they didnt cut you off and you didnt break it by claiming your body but youre alive now and thats a problem my swirling thoughts slowed why is that a problem i asked barnabas though was nodding his head remember when you first flashed forward into aces future and it was too much for you he said and i took joshs hand giving it a quick squeeze at the memory of stars so beautiful they almost broke me you were dead he said halfway to the divine ron had to adjust your amulet for you its still toned down and now that youre alive youre not making a strong enough connection oh maaaan i groaned dropping back to slump against a tall tombstone muffled everything was muffled you think i asked my voice quavering if that was all it was it could be fixed not by me though ron had fixed it the last time you should have waited and gotten your body back after we saved tammy barnabas said i gave barnabas a dark look relieved that it wasnt anything that the seraphs did to curtail me grace had said something about how my decision to claim my body messed up both fate and chance id just have to deal with it how am i going to deal with it so we look for her on foot josh said seeming as relieved as i was whats the big deal we have enough people we should hit the bus depots and allnight places first there isnt much open how hard can it be youd be surprised demus said to the stars finding someone on foot isnt as easy as it sounds nakita nudged him with the toe of her white boot saving a mark isnt easy reaper its hard work get used to it scowling he swung at her foot and she danced back laughing at him enjoying herself barnabas was frowningas usual finding her visually will take too long even if we split up this would be a lot easier if you hadnt changed her resonance he grumbled maybe you can ask the seraphs to fix your amulet josh said sitting back down on his broken grave marker yeah like they would do that now demus said with a harsh laugh madison they are so mad at you ron maybe nakita offered looking like she had swallowed something nasty and i shook my head he doesnt know were here barnabas said i think we should keep it that way he probably suspected we were here but i wasnt going to bring it up not being able to see the time line was going to be a problem i knew what tammys resonance looked like now but i couldnt show anyone if the time line was a blurred mess to me i didnt think reapers could backtrack by themselves into the past to see where her aura shifted unless i was there to guide them it would take a timekeeper for that or perhaps one studying to be a timekeeper elated i yanked my borrowed pants back up paul i said firmly and everyone stared paul nakita echoed disbelief in the slant of her eyes whos paul josh whispered demus had sat back up to better laugh at me you mean the rising light timekeeper he snorted and joshs expression darkened yeah he remembered him now paul isnt skilled enough to tweak your amulet was barnabass opinion but i was waving at them to listen yeah i know but he can help us find tammy he can look at the time line back to where i changed her aura he can show both of you i glanced at demus the three of you i mean and once you have that badabing we have her demus was eyeing me in disbelief uh were talking rons grub right grub i thought how insulting is that nakita had crossed her arms in front of her looking immovable this is not a good idea even for you madison josh too had turned away and was scuffing the turf with the toe of his boot he wasnt jealous was he i wondered feeling a flash of delight why not i asked not caring that everyone thought it was a bad idea when had i ever had an idea they thought was good paul helped us before we never could have saved ace if it wasnt for his help the words were out of my mouth before i had a chance to think about them but it was true dark and light working together had done it oh come on i almost moaned as nakita rolled her eyes you got any better ideas barnabas gave up with a long exhale if she wants to try it why not he said and nakitas lips parted in surprise great demus said as he stood and stretched you go talk to the rising light timekeeper and ill go check in with the seraphs barnabas spun his long coat unfurling his hand was on his amulet and his threat was obvious you show even one feather to leave and ill cut your wings off youre madisons reaper and youll do as she says so help me god gee thanks barnabas i said to try to lighten things up and demus slumped apparently barnabass swordsmanship was legendary i guess im in then the dark reaper said i smiled at that demus wasnt really a bad guy just focused on old methods nakita had been too and she had been far more militant in voicing her opinion still smiling i held out my hand to nakita can i have my phone i asked sweetly and demus made an odd strangled sound sweet seraph nubs shes going to phone him the reaper gasped and josh sighed falling back to stand against a tall pillar with his arms over his middle he was starting to look cold i knew i was and hes jealous i smiled my thanks as nakita handed me my little pink phone the battery charged and five bars showing magic technology it was pretty much the same thing to me the important thing was that we were going to do this together i couldnt do it alone i didnt think it was even possible to do alone it was going to take all of us light and dark she has his number demus asked in disbelief as i went through my phone book and hit ice when did you get his number josh asked his voice clipped last month i said listening to it ring i got it from shoe and thought it would be a good idea josh was still staring at me and i made a questioning face whats the big deal here im a timekeeper hes trying to be one ive got him as my emergency number in case i dont know i get put in jail for starting a fire or something josh turned away and faintly almost at the edges of my hearing i thought i heard grace huff and say that she was all the protection id ever need am i the only one who sees a problem in this demus was saying nakita shes betraying everything the seraphs believe in everything we believe in shut up and watch nakita shot back at him but i could tell she was worried the phone was still ringing and i fidgeted with it to my ear wondering if the warmth i felt on my face was from grace ello a tired voice came on and my tension doubled paul its madison i said and paul said nothing dark timekeeper i prompted then felt a flush of worry maybe id gotten the number wrong crap is this paul oh hi mark paul said and i froze until i realized he wasnt alone sorry i fell asleep on the couch watching a movie sure hold on and ill get it its in my lab book youve got all weekend to do it couldnt you have called tomorrow demus was leaning against a rock again his disgust obvious he doesnt even know who you are relax barnabas said leaning close to whisper it hes with ron is all thats the problem with you dark reapers you dont know how to lie properly demuss expression became irate but i thought it was funny there was a smattering of background noise the sound of a door closing and then pauls hushed voice saying are you insane why are you calling me why did you tell me i could if you didnt want me to i asked him it was in case of an emergency paul said then hesitated what did you do i would have taken offense but i had kind of screwed up um i found my body and now my amulet doesnt work right congratulations he said making it into a question see nakita said leaning forward so she could hear even the grub knows it was a mistake it wasnt a mistake i said but i was starting to think that it was giving her a dark look i turned back to the phone my eyes on joshs he looked mad or maybe worried paul i need your help i said jeez i hope he hadnt heard the grub comment he sighed i heard it even though he was probably several hundred miles away in an arizona desert are you trying to change someones fate again he asked madison it was luck the last time fate is fate thats why they call it that i thought you believed in choice i mocked him then caught my anger swallowing it paul didnt say anything and my worry crept back paul for gods sake he said voice hushed do you know what ron will do to me if he finds out i helped you my hand holding the phone to my ear trembled her name is tammy i said her soul was going to start to die after her brother died in a fire i talked to her and her fate changed so they both died so i talked to them again and something shifted so that they survived she listened paul and i reminded her of the good stuff she wants to change but shes not out of it yet shes still in danger of letting her soul die i need to find her talk to her again i know i can fix this demus was peering at me in question his eyes met mine and held this is a big mistake he said his voice utterly devoid of the devilmaycare attitude he had shown so far she still isnt making the choice to live i said to paul but talking to both of them but i think she can i changed her resonance to hide her from the reapers and i cant find her because my amulet i took a breath paul my amulet is tuned to a dead person not one halfway to heaven or hell i cant find her please just help me find her and then you can go back to your movie or whatever you were doing five minutes tops you changed her resonance paul asked a hint of jealousy in his voice yes i said feeling a stirring of pride my eyes flicked to josh again he still wasnt looking at me and i felt a ping of anger save me from the touchy male ego help me find tammy and ill tell you how i did it you cant teach the rising light timekeeper demus exclaimed and barnabas shoved him over i cant see the time lines i admitted starting to get nervous paul we have to find her before the light reaper does and puts a guardian angel on her again he sighed or i could sit here and do nothing and tammys life is saved by a guardian angel paul finally said a guardian angel doesnt save anything i said in frustration working to keep the irritation from my voice because i was trying to gain his help it just means that her life goes on no meaning paul no grace she may as well be a painting on the wall im not going to ask the seraphs for help grace says theyre ticked at me and i think its because im proving them wrong and they dont like it it felt good to say it and my face warmed even as i turned from the reapers watching me with varying degrees of hope and disbelief paul was silent again but there was nothing more i could say and i waited fidgeting where are you he said flatly and i took a huge breath of air thrilled to my toes demus softly swore and barnabas and nakita exchanged a high five josh smiled softly and i warmed puerto rico he guessed ron just sent someone out there baxter california i said feeling like this might work even though he hadnt said yes yet im not sure where that is exactly somewhere south its hot and muggy paul made a soft mmmm of sound i think i know where that is let me get my shoes ron was griping about one of the reapers not checking back in arariel i said and paul made a grunt of acknowledgment yes thats her hold on i gotta tell ron im going to bed hold on i wondered but the phone made a highpitched squeal yelping i dropped it scrambling to catch it and missing sorry i said after i picked it up and gingerly put it back to my ear paul paul you there but paul wasnt there anymore and i spun at a bright light that lit the graveyard ten feet away a vertical line split the darkness widening until a black shadow grew at its center it was paul closing his phone as he stepped from one part of the world to the other as easily as crossing into another room his smile widened as his unlaced dress shoes found the dewwet grass and the bright line behind him closed in on itself and vanished nodding respectfully to barnabas and nakita he let his gaze linger on demus who was eyeing him with mistrust then blinked in surprise when josh pushed himself up from the pillar obviously the odd man out not being a reaper hi madison paul said lightly as he tucked his dress shirt back in his dockers fully aware that i was as impressed as all hell who are we saving tonight chapter ten demus dropped back to take in paul your aura is green he mocked staring at the luminescent stone around pauls neck the glow of the stone was a reflection of pauls aura and it was indeed a bright goldlaced green paul dropped his eyes his lips set tight as he ran a hand over his sandybrown hair he was embarrassed and i didnt think it was because he was still wearing the rumpled clothes that hed worn to school today the stone he used to touch the divine should be shifting up the spectrum to a light timekeepers red by now but it was that sparkly neutral green as demus had so inelegantly pointed out that ebbed to a flat black even as i watched you shut up nakita threatened to smack him and i cleared my throat i thought it odd she was defending paul seeing as she didnt like him but she had apologized to paul for knocking him out once so maybe it was part of her trying to understand barnabas too looked more uncomfortable now that paul was here youre not doing this demus said ignored and i didnt like the look in his eye i cant stay long paul said glancing at everyone his gaze lingering on josh questioningly the rising light timekeeper should not be here demus hissed and i jerked when i felt him tap into the divine barnabas was already moving his dark shadow darting across the open area to slam into the redheaded angel look out nakita shouted and i found myself on the ground the air pushed out of my lungs and nakita on top of me damn she was fast blowing the hair out of my eyes i wiggled to get a better look as barnabas sat on demus a handful of red hair in his grip as he pulled demuss head up paul had fallen back knowing to get out of the way when angels fought and josh was behind that pillar again barnabas lifted the chain around demuss neck until he had his amulet in his possession nakita do you have any rope in that purse of yours get off me nakita i wheezed yeah my life was so glamorous out after midnight among the tombstones sweating and slapping at mosquitoes nakita slipped off and i took a huge gulp of air sitting up to brush last weeks dried grass clippings off me nice i hadnt been in my new dark timekeeper clothes five minutes and i get them dirty josh extended a hand to help me up and i took it gratefully thanks i said softly my lips next to his ear and relax will you you look like he wants to be my boyfriend or something hes just a guy yeah josh said as he watched me brush the last of the dirt off just a guy who can do that amulet thing and walk through space i grinned at him appreciating that he felt jealous hes not the one who held my hand when i died i said shifting my weight to bump into him and hes not the one who was there when i got my body back joshs shoulders eased and he actually smiled even when paul came to stand at my other side the two guys warily greeted each other as nakita leaned against a stone and pulled her long stockings off this is wrong demus was shouting and i looked at the dark street that suddenly seemed too close the seraphs need to know what youre doing that grub is going to tell ron hes going to put a guardian angel on her i had broken curfew too many times and gotten away with it to be cowed by what a seraph might think about me hanging out with my future adversary they were the ones who picked me if they couldnt handle my rebellious tendencies then they should have picked someone else still i watched the sky demus couldnt do much without his amulet but there was no need to advertise here nakita said as she handed barnabas her white stockings barnabas tossed me the reapers amulet and i caught it feeling the violet stone warm in my grip as both paul and i looked down at it i hadnt made it but the amulet around my neck had been used in its construction and it was as if the two stones were greeting each other get off demus huffed as barnabas yanked his arms back and tied his wrists nakita he pleaded when barnabas finished and got off him hes going to put a guardian angel on her nakita stop this youre traitors traitors he shouted feet spread wide nakita stood over him as barnabas yanked him into a seated position i told you to be quiet she said bending provocatively to shove her last waddedup stocking into his mouth and im not a traitor she added looking unsure as she stepped back paul gave me a look like he wanted to laugh but was afraid to having problems with your reapers my heart was pounding demuss face was as red as his hair hes new to my methods i said with a false lightness then turned away as if it didnt bother me but it did paul grinned reaching out a finger to poke my shoulder youre alive now i couldnt help but smile back yeah so no scything me okay he laughed pantomiming cutting through me with a blade remembering our first meeting when hed tried to kill me i had been evil incarnate according to him now i was hoping he saw us as colleagues sort of glancing at demus paul said i dont know exactly what you want me to do here excitement tingled to my toes your amulet is strong enough to see the time lines right i asked i mean ron didnt give you an amulet that couldnt yes paul looked down at his green stone i can see them sure but that doesnt help you much i dont have the slightest idea where to look barnabas gave demus a nudge to be quiet what have you been doing the last three months not this was pauls quick defensive answer and josh snorted if you can bring the time lines up i said i can see them through your thoughts ill show you her resonance like i would a reaper pauls eyes were wide you can do that show someone else what youre looking at its how a timekeeper shows a reaper what soul to take i said realizing that ron hadnt told him that much sure paul could jump across space and make a sword from the divine but he didnt know the first thing about his job what was ron waiting for like i said barnabas muttered as he leaned toward me what have you been doing the last three months i glared at barnabas to be quiet we needed pauls help you want to try it i asked paul if he didnt we were screwed paul glanced at josh then me you uh wont be able to read my thoughts will you he asked i looked at nakita and barnabas not sure myself and they shrugged maybe this wasnt such a good idea i dont know paul youre going to have to do this eventually i cajoled and his eyes grew determined okay he said sitting down on one of the stones nakita made a tiny huff arms over her chest she leaned toward barnabas why is it they both have to sit down to do stuff nervous i sat across from paul feeling the damp go right through my thin clothes i took three breaths trying to center myself as barnabas had taught me it was a lot harder now that i was alive i guessed that taking pauls hand might improve the chances we could pull this off but josh was scowling again and i didnt okay i found it paul said his expression calm as he looked at his inner mindscape i found you his one eye cracked open as he compared my real aura with the one on the time line found them he added meaning the reapers i guessed as he glanced at them then he cringed madison i have no idea what im looking at hold on i said closing my eyes i brought up my mindscape as i feared there wasnt much to look at just that blurry haze of nothing try touching him nakita said dryly and josh exhaled loudly okay i said then reached for him hey he yelped i got a flash of bright light and then it was gone my eyes flew open and i stared at paul he looked scared his eyes wide in the dim light of the distant streetlamp my heart pounded and i realized my hand was fisted in my lap are you okay i asked him as barnabas grumbled yeah he said clearly flustered it just surprised me lets try again demus made some muffled comment that we all ignored and paul reached for my fingers nervous i took his hand it was smooth in mine and a little sweaty or maybe the sweat was from me nakita snorted and i gave her a dark look before closing my eyes immediately i was struck by how fuzzy everything still was it was like going from highdef to normal tv or maybe taking your glasses off the exquisite definition of everyones life lines was muted and blurry it was still easy to tell though where paul and i were nakita barnabas and demus were even easier to find their glows twining around us almost protectively here i thought not knowing if paul could hear me and i drifted my awareness down into the time lines until i found tammy not too far away still alone very alone her new aura with the blackrimmed orange center shining dully pauls bright glow was beside mine and the reapers auras too all we had to do now was find her in reality we can do this i thought with a resurgence of hope my fingers tightened in pauls grip and he squeezed back but before i could even relax my hold and break our connection the entire line flashed blue holy crap i thought my grip tightening spasmodically its a flash forward in an instant paul and i were alone the reapers were gone i could feel pauls confusion then fear as he realized something was wrong his fingers loosened in mine and i gripped them tighter frantically trying to keep him with me if he let go wed lose it its a flash forward i thought trying to maintain my grip on his fingers and my sight on the line i cant see if you leave i had probably been trying to flash forward all night but my connection had been too weak now with paul it was enough i was desperate to see tammys future and it was with a huge sigh of relief that i felt pauls confusion turn to excitement his fingers in mine wiggled and around us the line became a darker blue almost black with a curious flipping sensation we were out of the present and in tammy i thought familiar with the sensation of being in someone elses mind a silent observer as a myriad of moments flitted through someone elses consciousness at least this time she wasnt in a burning apartment the softness of sheets was what i noticed first then pauls presence next to mine his quicksilver thoughts were jumping from idea to idea his excitement contagious knowing it wouldnt help i willed tammy to open her eyes and she did the shock of that reverberated through me and i took in the toonarrow proppedup bed the industriallooking builtin counter and drawers the blank tv fixed high to the wall and the long ugly table on wheels there was an oversize cup on it the straw bent away and a single getwell card the sun was up but it wasnt coming in the open window that had a view of a brick wall i couldnt tell if we were two stories up or thirty the hazy blue indicating a fardistant flash forward hung on the edges of my vision and i realized tammy was squinting as i struggled to get a clearer view when are we i heard paul ask another surprise but i didnt think tammy heard since she didnt react i dont know a few days from now a week maybe no more than that i guessed and then a new thought intruded clear and resolved im dying my heart gave a jump and i felt pauls grip tighten in mine when tammy moved her hand above the sheets it was horribly thin the skin pale and almost transparent looking too weak to even tie a shoelace a bruise was around her wrist where someone had gripped her and her fingernails were painted a bright red garish against the white sheets an ache filled our entire body as if in a fever and i wondered if she had been beaten the blue haze surrounding everything put it a few days ahead at most but there was no way she could lose this much weight that fast and i wondered why the vision was so clear we must be months maybe years ahead the breath labored in our chest and i felt a tear slide down tammys cheek inside i could feel her pulse becoming erratic and a weird tingling rose up from her toes she said she was dying she might be right a feeling of worthlessness had filled our joined thoughts as the sound of traffic came in the open small window set in the large pane of glass she was alone but that was not why she cried regret regret for words not said for thoughts left unspoken for actions not taken and challenges not acknowledged and only now at the end did she understand what she had lost by shutting out the good things and living her life without love even her brother who she had turned away so often that he had quit trying tammy its okay i thought trying to reach her its not too late but only paul heard me my chest clenched in heartache as she thought of drawings she never began and poems stopped with only one phraseafraid of what others would think there were trips not taken and friends never joined chances to make someone else happy that she ignored thinking that it made her stronger when all it did was eat away at her soul i wish she breathed her head turning to the window and the dismal brick wall i wish but it was too late and i felt a lump in my throat as a small glint of dust glittering in the corner took on the familiar glow it was a guardian angel weeping sunbeams and i wondered if this was why the far flash forward was so clear paul started in surprise and then i realized by tammys sudden exhalation of breath that she saw her too is that an angel he asked me and i sent a sideways thought to him that it was why is she crying both tammy and he wanted to know because your life is over the angel said aloud her chiming voice like falling water both familiar and different from graces tears slipped from me from us we were all the same youre so beautiful tammy breathed clearly able to see her too have you come for me the hope in her voice went to my core and twisted and hearing it the angel dropped down before her bathing her in warmth as the room seemed to go cold and dark ive been with you since forever and no time at all the angel said smiling through her own tears i know i felt you tammy said i think i felt you im so sorry she said around a gulp of air the tears spilling over and blurring our shared vision what for child her pale hand lifted and fell looking unnatural as it lay palm up on white faded sheets i ran away i dont just mean from johnny and my mother but from everything i had so many plans i was going to do so many things and i cant even remember them now she was dying six thousand sunrises behind her a billion emails sent a thousand jokes laughed at a zillion moments tucked in her brain to add up to nothing because she had forgotten how to love she was still that same scared girl i had tried to help hours ago frightened and thinking she was alone the angel dropped even lower coming to rest in the cup of her hand you must be brave now she admonished crying still crying a spike of fear lit through her and died why she whispered its going to hurt the fear redoubled and tammy held her breath why she thought her question echoing in both pauls and my minds i wont leave you ill stay until its over the angel said like a parent reassuring a child they wouldnt leave until he fell asleep and the warmth of her stole up tammys arm and settled in her chest am i going to die tammy asked her thought quavering youve already done that love fear my own this time filled me it was true tammy was dead she had not taken another breath since the angel had told her it was going to hurt i felt pauls panic and i squished my own terror we were okay we werent dead but tammy was whats going to happen to me tammy asked her thoughts clearer now among ours and still the angel cried im sorry she said beautiful in her sorrow i wish i could make it different but all im made for is to protect in case your soul would revive and be renewed before you died but its too late her eyestoo bright to seebore into tammy finding me somewhere inside her is it now or is it yet to be what tammy asked but i was the one who jumped she was talking to me the guardian angel who had been with tammy was talking to me she knew i was here living the future and the angel didnt know if what we were living was true or just a maybe god i hoped it was a maybe a shadow covered the window and the stink of wet stone my pulse leapt as i saw the black wing slide into the room through the open window fear hit me sour and rank and paul sensed my sudden terror her soul is dead madison the guardian angel said to me not a hint of accusation in her voice it died three years ago and i stayed with her keeping the black wings from her in the hope that it might rekindle and grow anew but it did not she failed to nourish it and it perished utterly no i shouted as the first black wing landed on her tammy screamed her body dead but something still aware in her whitehot ice filled her thoughts peppermint and fire i tried to pull back but i was caught in this hell and couldnt escape black wings had found her and her memories were being eaten as we watched unable to move and stop them the energy that she had stored as memory was being stripped from her the dripping sheet of black tearing memories from her like a hyena over a kill and like hyenas more came one by one they fought their way into the room and covered tammy as she screamed and writhed in her mind unable to escape unable to fight back her body flaccid and still stop i pleaded feeling real tears slip down my real cheeks somewhere across time in a dark graveyard the memory of having my own thoughts stripped from me returned and i felt anew the burning lack the fear of nothing being left behind she was being taken apart aware and watching this i thought in horror this is what happens to lost souls no wonder dark reapers kill them someone please help me tammy screamed her body peaceful but her mind in terror as huge chunks of her disappeared she was becoming nothing i couldnt help her and i cried huge racking sobs as i tried to hold her together failing not this i said fighting off a black wing when the image of a sundrenched car from tammys memories filled me there was laughter a silly song nothing much but there was happiness this they couldnt take and i pulled it to me hoarding it the black wing i took it from rose up and i howled as it fought me for it hungry and having gotten a taste i shoved a memory to it one just as precious but one of mine the black wing melted into nothing not knowing the difference i curled myself around tammys beautiful memory crying and wishing it would all just end slowly tammys agony and terror ebbed as more and more was taken and less and less was left and finally it was just paul and me one by one the black wings lifted swollen and misshapen as they staggered out the open window bumping into the glass like wasps until they found their way my thoughts shaky i reached for pauls presence feeling like a great tide of poison had rolled over us and only we had survived the guardian angel was still with us her tears now ceased as the one she watched and protected in the slim hope her soul would renew itself vanished as if she had never existed hope thats all the light reapers bought with their guardian angels a slim hope that the soul would rekindle it was a hope that barnabas had started with his beautiful sarah and heartache filled me at the travesty of it has this happened yet the angel asked me her voice sad i cant tell has this happened yet is it happening now youve never been here before at the end i felt raw and even though i knew i was really sitting in a graveyard i also knew i was here in the future talking to tammys guardian angel that she didnt have yet it hasnt happened i thought feeling emotionally drained cupped in the curve of my awareness was one bright spot of glorytammys memory too beautiful to allow to be eaten the angel rose up her eyes going terrible and hard make it stop she said and it was as if she carried the voice of god in her please she added sounding helpless now and then she vanished the world flashed red and i let out a choking sob of relief it was over and i steadied myself for the gutwrenching feeling of my consciousness being yanked back across the years of whatif to reality i woke up crying curled up on the wet grass between nakita and barnabas josh standing awkwardly as if not knowing how he could help they were silent and subdued knowing that it had to be bad by the shape i was in meeting their eyes i saw the tears in nakitas barnabas had cried his last eons ago but the pain behind his gaze was no less he had started this when sarahs soul had revived i didnt know if i should thank or curse him it was awful sitting up i looked for paul he was standing hunched beside a distant tombstone puking his guts out im sorry i whispered and he turned wiping his mouth haggard he faced me looking more alone than id ever seen a person i tried to get up and josh jumped to help my hand was cold in his and shaking are you okay i asked paul hearing my voice crack that was a bad one no his word was short full of the dead terror we had endured that he said hands shaking as he tried to find words that was hell this job is hell i couldnt find fault with him there and i staggered listing sideways until josh pulled me upright its not always like that i breathed sometimes youre burned alive paul turned away his expression ugly as he tried to come to grips with what we had seen i leaned against a rockexcuse me a grave markerand josh let go after making sure i wasnt going to fall over you okay he asked and i nodded not looking up at him it was a flash forward i said and barnabas sighed seeming to know what id seen we saw tammys death a few years from now im guessing i dont know she had a guardian angel so i think if we walk away right now we fail to help her my words drifted to nothing as i thought back to what the angel had said to me we have to do something i said remembering the pain tammy ended her life with and then the utter nothingness a nothing so complete that it was as if she had never existed if we cant help her tammys life is worthless no grace no beauty she didnt do anything to nourish her soul no art no creativity taking in nothing outside of eating sleeping living and when she died her soul was eaten by black wings bile rose and i forced it back she was gone except for the tiny bit i had kept i could feel it in me lost alone and not fitting in with the rest of my memories nakita touched my arm and i jumped her eyes were brimming with tears but it only made her more beautiful im sorry madison i thought you knew thats what happened to lost souls if they cant rekindle them thats why i was so confused rekindled souls happen so rarely so very rarely she was looking at barnabas his head was down and it looked as if he was reliving his entire lifetime of lonely heartache i didnt know i shouted and he looked up tears in his eyes i didnt know i said softly no one told me i glanced at paul clearly he hadnt known either my sorrow was shifting to anger but it didnt feel any better thats why we take them early nakita said giving barnabas a soft glance to spare them that and save what we can if tammy is scythed tonight a light reaper will keep her soul safe until she is welcomed home remembered loved like barnabas was going to do for you until you stole kaiross amulet but if she is given a guardian angel and her soul doesnt rekindle itself i finished nakitas thought for her a life of nothing ending in the same i turned from them heartsick and confused maybe i should just give up and send reapers to cull souls i cant do this it had come from paul and i looked up at him his features hidden in shadow i cant be the light timekeeper he said this is insane he started to back away into the dark i cant do it i cant barnabas pressed his lips together reaching out he grabbed pauls arm you are the rising light timekeeper i dont want it paul said panicking but unable to break barnabass hold i cant do that i cant send reapers out to put guardian angels on people if all they are going to do is be eaten by that sludge it would be better if they died young my head dropped as paul struggled to unwedge himself from barnabass grip finally managing it and stepping back as he rubbed his arm and that was where we were neither of us wanted to do what was expected of us i knew i should be depressed but a part of me was glad i wasnt the only one being asked to do something i didnt want to do together maybe we could do what one of us could not listen to me barnabas said his hand on his amulet as if it was the hilt of his sword you are the rising light timekeeper you will keep your mouth shut you will learn what ron teaches you you will take his amulet when he steps down barnabas nakita exclaimed appalled barnabas ignored her and when you reach your power you will use your understanding of choice to change things he finished josh exhaled in understanding and i stiffened barnabas turned his gaze to me and i shivered at the depth of his heartache eons of it stored behind his dark eyes you both will he said to me his voice breaking we just have to be patient i dont want to wait a lifetime to make a difference i said then you find them when you can barnabas said a new almost eerie fervor to his voice that bordered on the fanatical talk to them if they listen before ron sends an angel to guard them or the seraphs send a reaper to scythe them it was what i had been trying to do all along barnabas believed it was possible maybe now paul did too and if paul did perhaps we had a real chance we have to find tammy paul said his voice almost virulent we have to change this she cant be allowed to live her life if all that is at the end of it is for the sum of her life and memories to be eaten by a mindless dish of bacteria then we do this i said hope making me shake inside paul took a breath knowing he was agreeing to more than saving tammy he was going to get in trouble ron wasnt going to be happy screw ron we do this paul said his eyes closed briefly and then he turned to look deeper into the graveyard across it to the rest of the town shes not very far away good nakita said her expression drawn up into a worried look because demus is gone chapter eleven it wasnt the muggy breathless darkness that creeped me out and made my stomach clench it wasnt that i couldnt hear barnabas and nakita behind me somewhere swords drawn as they jogged after me it wasnt that my outofshape breathing was harsh and heavy next to joshs longdistance runners light breaths it wasnt even that this end of town had bars on the windows and rolldown gates over the storefronts what bothered me was that i was still barefoot and had stepped in something sticky grimacing i raised my foot and shuddered this way barnabas said easing past me as i hesitated i could hardly see him in the black alley his coat making him a moving shadow nakitas scent brushed past me and i started to follow paul edged past josh and me and i couldnt help but see how predatory the two reapers looked beside him barnabas dark and furtive nakita taut and slim both on the hunt both joined in thought to one goal i was proud of them working together like that demuss amulet was in my pocket heavy and warm i dont know what he intended to do to tammy without it but demus and tammy were together according to barnabas shes just ahead paul whispered as he turned the streetlight glinting on the shine of his dress shoes his posture was tense and eager and i wished i could see the time line to gauge how close we were the brighter square of black at the end of the alley beckoned i picked up my pace watch it josh whispered reaching out and jerking me back an instant before i stepped in a foulsmelling pile of garbage outside a side door it was a bad part of town i wouldnt come here even during the day the street was empty seeing as it was about two in the morning a faint brightening hinted at the coming sunrise but it was hours off the air stank heavy and humid streetlights barely lit the potholed street the asphalt making hardly any division between itself and the sidewalk and then the tired chipped buildings with their rolldown gates and brickedup windows it was rock asphalt and cement not a hint of anything green or alive not even a rat which is probably a good thing i thought as i shifted my weight from one cold foot to the other thanks i whispered back wrinkling my nose at the smell my arms had gone around my middle and i was cold maybe i should have waited until we were done with this prevention before claiming my body and what was that squishy thing between my toes this was just gross shes in there paul said his rising chin indicating a bus depot the broken neon sign in the shape of a big arrow with demus nakita said almost hissing the word the bus depot i said turning to give josh a smile you were right heart pounding i took a step forward only to have barnabas yank me back overhead a streetlight popped to put us in darkness my eyes went up as i wondered if it was grace and barnabas whispered cop car frustrated i pulled back into the even darker alley paul was beside me and josh nakita jumped straight up vanishing onto the roof the slow sound of an idling engine grew and we pressed back even more hiding behind a box i could see inside the bus depot from where i stood with my back to the wall demus and tammy were just talking but i was sure if demus had had his amulet shed be dead by now it was a cop car and i silently thanked grace for the broken light as it cruised very slowly past the spotlight playing over the abandoned storefronts and probing into the dark places standing between me and the top of the alley paul exhaled as the car slowly drove away he looked determined as he shifted to the center of the alley and i couldnt help but feel a spark of something as we all followed him back to the street not romantic but perhaps a contemporary i wondered someone who would really understand the hell that we had to go through that is if i kept my amulet hes gone paul said as the cops brake lights flashed and the car turned a corner do you think theyre looking for me i asked reluctant to step into the open barnabas was a shadow on my other side his gaze still where the car had disappeared probably no i tweaked their memories of you i think i got everyone paul turned to frown at him you think barnabas frowned right back nothing is certain the car is gone i said tension making me jittery lets go black wings paul said and i froze fighting an irrational fear as i looked up seeing their black outlines against the sooty sky there was a flash of brilliant light as one turned and i looked away shivering i had a body they couldnt sense me and even if they could they couldnt touch me not with a real aura around me again what are they doing here josh asked hunched and uneasy hed seen what they had done to me demus cant scythe anyone if you have his amulet and they dont follow light reapers he looked at barnabas his expression ill right barnabas said nothing as he put a hand on my shoulder and pushed us into motion not usually no but weve got three reapers a timekeeper and a rising timekeeper out here even plants turn to the sun and maybe arariel was here hunting too i mused following us since she couldnt find tammy on her own my eyes scanning everything we crossed the empty street moving furtively and avoiding going right under the circling black sheets of dripping goo god i hated those things and i shivered at the memory of them eating tammys memories until she was nothing what is demus even doing here i babbled mincing in my bare feet he cant make a scythe i think hes going to push her in front of a bus i looked askance at barnabas trying to decide if he was being funny or not there was the soft sound of feathers and a soft click of heels and nakita joined us as we reached the door i pulled one side of the twin doors only to find it locked barnabas reached in front of me and gave a yank with a sharp ping of breaking metal the door opened a fetid scent of old sneakers and stale cigarettes spilled out nice demus looked up his boyish featuressoftened to lull tammybecame hard broken feathers and pinions get behind me tam he said as he stood pushing her behind himself frightened the girl stood holding his shoulders and peeping around his shoulder oh theres a good idea barnabas said as he filed in behind me tammy honey his job is to kill you nakita said taking my other side it was clear tammy had been crying her eyes were red and her hair was a mess there was a backpack beside her it was likely all she had in the worldapart from her soul she was running it was the beginning of the end for her and i had to stop it here if she left shed believe the lies she was telling herself and her soul would die he is not going to hurt me she exclaimed as she took in the five of us but she was edging back as if unsure you burned my apartment hes going to save you i said and she looked up at him seeing his anger at us and her doubt grew take you away from everything tammy hes lying angels do that i glanced at barnabas adding a lot a frown crossed barnabass face and he pulled to a stop from where he had been edging away from us trying to circle demus nakita had been doing the same on the right especially dark reapers barnabas said looking at his nails feigning disinterest i could tell he was poised to move in an eyeblink then why hasnt demus killed me already she asked belligerently because i have his sword i said pulling his amulet out and dangling it madison no barnabas yelled but demus had seen it and lunged exactly as i had wanted nakita made a dart for tammy pushing her back to a bulletin board and getting between her and demus josh reached out and pulled me out of the way and paul danced clear his shiny shoes clacking oh crap josh yelled as his tug caused my fingers cold and damp to slip on the lanyard the flat black stone glittered as it arced through the air and a delicate ting of crystal echoed for one pure instant when it hit the floor barnabas get it i yelled as i fell but demus had already switched directions and was diving for it i watched breathlessly as paul got there first i got it he shouted triumphantly then his eyes widened at the sight of demus barreling toward him knowing he didnt have a chance he threw it to nakita here the dark reaper shouted hand raised but it wasnt her grip that the stone landed in it was arariels son of a puppy i shouted as i scrambled up and she smiled pure evil at me pulling back out of nakitas swords reach im sorry josh was saying his hands on my shoulders as we blocked the door im the one who dropped it i said frustrated as i tugged my oversize shirt straight arariel give me the amulet paul demanded but she wasnt listening to him twirling demuss amulet like shed won a prize at the fair nakita i questioned and my wonderful reaper grinned just as evilly back her sword dipping once in invitation to arariel behind nakita tammy curled into a ball in one of the flaccidcushioned chairs against the wall crying i really couldnt blame her you will not grace her with a guardian angel nakita intoned and arariel fell into a fighting stance poised and im not going to let you kill her foul black reaper she shouted back lunging you call me foul nakita shouted face red i give a clean release not a slow death you are ugly ugly demus just wanted his amulet still dangling from arariels hand he watched it hungrily inching closer as nakita pushed arariel farther from tammy i jumped when barnabas touched my shoulder you and josh get tammy out of here he whispered shes too scared to move ill stay here and try to help nakita scared was right i could be killed now and i knew the feeling josh looked as unsettled as i was but he gave my hand a quick squeeze and together we circled around nakita and arariel as they took their first shots at each other tammys tearstreaked face turned to us as we approached and she scrunched back into the chair when i reached for her come on i exclaimed we have to get out of here tammy kicked at me and i jumped back shoe said you were dead she said terrified are you dead come on madison josh urged standing between me and the reapers she called him i thought elated i used to be i said quickly but im not anymore which is why we have to get out of here how could she believe i was dead and still trust demuss lies again i grabbed her wrist and this time she let me pull her to her feet look out paul shouted and we ducked as a chair ripped from the floor crashed into the wall only five feet away bits of tile and cement peppering us like shrapnel nakita was getting serious we gotta go josh said and we ran for the door arariel saw us battle cry ringing she leapt high circling over nakitas sword to land between us and the door my eyes widened and i pushed tammy behind me as we skidded to a halt arariel stop paul called out from the opposite side of the room you are not my keeper she snarled then looked to the ceiling heavens guard descend she called out summoning a guardian angel oh crap if an angel was assigned then it was all over back i shouted but tammy had frozen where she stood frightened demus lunged at arariel intent on his amulet bellowing he crashed into her and they went down as she screamed in outrage demuss black stone hit the tile floor flashing violet for an instant as it bounced flat on his stomach demus reached stretched and got it with a cry of relief he rolled to a stand his blade already forming teeth clenched nakita swung at demus her lips pulled back and the glory of heaven in her eyes their blades met and again a clear ping of infinity rang my heart was pounding and paul slid to a stop beside us his eyes bright arariel isnt listening to me he said sounding betrayed you think josh said finally getting tammy to move back a step as she watched the angels battle for her soul we have got to get out of here i said tammy we have to go barnabas was at the door holding it open and making frantic out gestures but nakita demus and arariel were too close for my comfort my god tammy whispered the tears stopped in her awe shoe wasnt lying her arariel cried out kicking both demus and nakita back so she could point her sword at tammy she is heavens blessed save her oh shit it was the angel without thought i reached out with one hand and shoved tammy behind me with the other i grabbed pauls hand my head snapped back as the battle suddenly took on a new hue of sparkle and depth as i saw everything with the added power of his amulet deep tones shook the air at each blow and energy radiated from the battling reapers like the sun and over it all were two small glowing balls of light one was grace and the other was the one from my flash forward no i cried out hand raised to the guardian angel when i flashed forward you told me to stop this now im telling you leave she is not to be graced with an angel she is the one arariel shouted then dropped her sword and gripped her wrist with a cry as nakita finally scored on her she is mine i said words flowing from me in desperation tammys future death rang through me the terrible futility of a life wasted making me frantic please tammy cried out hiding behind josh clutching at him as he stood in front of her go away all of you i just want to live i want to live thats a start paul said come with me and you will arariel said her hand outstretched behind her nakita and demus got to their feet blades out but pointing down they didnt attack feeling the power of the guardian angel soak into them it was up to me now could i convince the angel that tammy was mine or would that awful future of a life wasted be true the angel waited recognizing me but probably not knowing if this was the moment of now the future or even the past outside the black wings gathered one plastered itself against the window and i shuddered paul tried to pull away but i gripped his hand harder if he let go id lose sight of the guardian angel that is not life you offer her i said to arariel pulling my gaze from the ugly sight its a slow death you cant have her she is already mine i took a breath feeling wild and unreal i am the dark timekeeper and i have claimed her i say she is not to be scythed and she is not to be graced with a guardian she is mine claimed her arariel said her stance losing its confidence you cant claim her i have i said shaking as i remembered tammys death and how i had exchanged part of my soul for hers to keep it from being eaten i have a part of her soul i said and tammy whimpered pressing into josh shes dark now she is part of the dark and the light has no claim i leaned toward arariel my voice low as i said you cant touch her tammys eyes widened and even josh looked shocked i was too afraid to look at paul standing beside me as i gripped his arm you arariel was thunderstruck you claim her soul leave i shouted gesturing and arariel leapt backward yelping and holding a hand to her chest as if burned i thought your amulet didnt work paul said it doesnt i said confused i didnt do anything it was the old power arariel said hunched as she backed away giving the guardian angel a betrayed glare ancient law you speak of the ancient law your claim surmounting heavens itself i cant touch her i cant touch her nakita too looked shocked scared almost as she dissolved her sword madison nakita warbled what have you done look out barnabas shouted and i tripped on the cuffs of my toolong pants and fell back as arariel wailed stretching her shoulders until her wings flashed into existence and took up the entire room for an instant they brushed the edges of the walls and then still keening she wrapped them around herself and vanished in a thunderous clap of sound stunned i looked over the destruction racks of chairs upended holes in the ceiling and deep gouges in the floor from divine swords nakita rose from a crouch halfway across the room where did you learn the ancient law she whispered madison you are responsible for her soul now if it fails to thrive you will be held accountable do you know what that means not really but i could make some guesses i was scared becoming more so as barnabas growled at her to shut up the guardian angel was gone or at least i didnt see her id lost my grip on paul when id fallen and he had backed away his arm behind his back as if i was going to take it again maybe that bit about me having a piece of tammys soul had scared him it didnt make me feel very warm and fuzzy eithereven if it had saved her life frightened i tried to reach his eyes but he was making a huge effort to avoid me head down as he tucked his shirt back in from the floor tammy stared at the empty space where arariel had been her mouth was hanging open she wasnt crying she wasnt scared she looked numb she tammy started then swallowed hard she had wings are you all angels just them josh said pointing to barnabas and nakita demus was gone swell but the black wings were too and i breathed a sigh of relief did you save her josh asked me and i nodded taking his hand as he helped me up yes and no i said as i glanced at paul who looked like he was avoiding me and wondering how much of this was going to end up in rons ears it didnt feel over my bare feet seemed to find every pointy bit of broken tile and cement and i shifted uneasily as nakita set an overturned chair upright and sat in it her elbows on her knees as she caught her breath grime marred her white clothes making her gray turning her black this mess was going to be hard to explain but then again in this part of town maybe not are you okay nakita asked from across the room and i nodded feeling joshs touch on me slip away we were okayfor now arariel wasnt going to forget this had happened and demus was going to go crying to the seraphs barnabas reached out to help tammy to her feet she stared at his hand for a moment then when he smiled she slipped her hand into his and stood a pang hit me and i watched as she dropped her eyes suddenly shy as she realized he was an angel id been the same way and i wondered at my past innocence is it true paul accused harshly jerking me from my thoughts is it true what you said about having part of her soul is that why they cant touch her because you tied her soul to your own my lips parted and i glanced at tammy still with barnabas im trying to help i whispered tugging my oversize shirt straight again it wouldnt stay put you said you claimed my soul that you had it tammy said the beginnings of trust that barnabas had started dropping from her just a tiny piece of it i said almost pleading tammy i saw you in the future dying the black wings were eating you alive i couldnt let them take everything you had such beautiful memories of your mother and johnny i couldnt bear to see them destroyed forever even though youd forgotten them i gave the black wings one of my memories instead they took a part of me instead they ate it and its gone forever if i could give you yours back i would but i dont know how they eat me alive tammy breathed fixated on that one part and backing away making a tiny cry she turned and ran for the door tammy were trying to help i called out but barnabas was faster and he was in front of her before she got halfway there wait he said grabbing her help she screamed hitting him someone help me i felt awful and i winced when tammy smacked his face leaving a handprint on his cheek its okay he whispered pulling her closer comforting her they wont eat you now youre not the same its going to be okay you belong to the dark now but i dont want to belong to the dark she wailed slumping into his warmth and his strength feeling the purity of him and taking comfort in it her cries for help dissolved into racking sobs and he held her firm i knew how she felt paul looked at me his disgust at my having stolen a piece of her future soul starting to evaporate josh touched my elbow and i jumped if you gave them part of your own then isnt that okay josh asked his eyebrows high you saved a little bit of her didnt you i think she might have saved all of her nakita said as she stood up it was starting to look like i might have but at what cost ancient law it sounded like i was responsible for her now i guess if her soul died would i be the one to suffer not her guess id better make sure her soul didnt die tammys sobs quieted and i wondered if there were any more tissues in nakitas purse i took a breath to ask her when she sidled up to me but everything went out of my head when nakita leaned close and whispered grace has a message for you it was as if my heart seemed to stop my head snapped up and i looked over the destruction wwhat i asked my knees going weak uh she says they want to talk to you they they who i asked already guessing she meant the seraphs id taken part of tammys soul that probably wasnt a good thing in hindsight even if it had saved her i think it had saved her i looked at tammy shaken and distraught as josh and barnabas talked to her please let it have saved her nakita looked at one of the ceiling lights and it glowed brighter grace the seraphs she said looking frightened youre to go to rons josh looked up from tammy you mean the light timekeeper he exclaimed no way my gaze went to paul seeing that he was just as scared as i was clearly they knew id gotten paul to help me and now that id gotten my body back they were likely going to insist that i give back the amulet after the mess id made here barnabas gently pushed tammy from his shoulder handing her a black handkerchief that was quick i thought we might have a little time paul said nervously and i realized just how many lives id messed up trying to save one im so sorry i said looking at them in turn paul i didnt mean to get you in this much trouble no he said firmly his gaze going haunted as he glanced away id do it again in a second the system in place is flawed i stand by what i believe he shifted his feet frightened but determined its okay ill be with you no you wont nakita grimaced as the light that surrounded grace fizzed and hummed youre staying here with tammy to take her home im not leaving her now i said loudly this is just so they can come back and kill her or slap a guardian angel on her which in this case is the same thing my thoughts winged back to the guardian angel crying over tammy and the thunder in her voice when she told me to change things that had to mean something it had to tammys expression flashed into fear again dont leave me please she said clutching at barnabas i dont know whats going on i just want to go home home is exactly where paul is going to take you nakita said just as loudly glaring at the light she added im telling her shut up with a huff she turned to me paul is to take tammy home uh i mean to her aunts where her mother is staying she looked at tammy with hard severity they are worried sick about you im sorry tammys voice was a faint whisper of real regret and in it i felt a breath of hope maybe she had changed maybe she was going to live touch the lives around her for the better and not just exist barnabas is going to take josh home nakita said and josh stiffened in protest and i nakita said am going to take you to rons its almost sunrise there and the seraphs like the sunrise she focused on me and her eyes pinched in concern they know you have your body back damn it i was in so much trouble but i wouldnt change a thing the light surrounding grace popped and went out startling me swallowing hard i turned to paul youll get her home paul walked across to tammy his hand extended im not as pretty as barnabas but i can tell you whats going on ive seen your future she blinked the tears almost starting again is it okay she warbled turning to the door paul started to lead her away stepping over and around chunks of ceiling tile and foam from the seats that depends upon what you do the future isnt fixed you know you have the choice of your fate i can tell you what i saw and then ill tell you what could happen if you change a little open up and see things differently the knot in my chest started to ease if i was going to lose my timekeeper status id at least leave with the satisfaction of having saved tammys life that is if they let me remember it the door to the bus depot squeaked as it opened and then it fell in a sliding crash to hang from one hinge tammy and paul gingerly stepped around it paul turned holding tammys hand if i dont see you again barnabas im sorry for calling you grim youre still light i dont care what color your amulet is barnabas ducked his head seeming to grow taller im not he said eyes holding determination when they rose flicking first to me then paul but thank you paul nodded and turned back to tammy together they walked down the street his voice rising and falling as he told her what he had seen in her future slowly my smile faded as my reality soaked in i had royally messed up taken a slice of someone elses soul that had to be illegal or something they were going to take my amulet make me forget ancient law arariel had said that didnt sound good cold i wrapped my arms around myself and looked at the busted light is grace coming i asked knowing id feel better if she was shes here barnabas moved closer to stand beside me he shook his shoulders and his long coat shimmered growing into his blackfeathered wings im taking you to rons he said nakita can take josh home the seraphs nakita said and barnabas glared leaning until they were nose to nose i am taking her barnabas leaned back losing his threatening mien see you around josh but would he i didnt know madison josh said his voice uneasy shaky and lightheaded i gave him a hug thanks for being here i whispered pressing into him as if he was the only thing real anymore i dont know whats going to happen i hope i dont forget me either he said as he stepped back and we parted then i glanced up as graces light doubled in brightness im sorry for what i said and barnabas cleared his throat for us to hurry up josh smiled sickly at me i wanted this to work i know it meant a lot to you my stomach hurt and i couldnt look at him see you at home i said and barnabas tugged me to him biting my lip so i wouldnt cry i leaned back into barnabas as his wings enfolded me and with a sudden feeling of falling the bus depot melted away and we were gone chapter twelve my feet slipped off barnabass and i gasped clutching at his arm wrapped around me as my toes dangled in the wind the world shifted beneath us wheeling as an updraft buoyed us higher i was safer in barnabass grip than i would be at home in my own room more so probably ive got you he murmured in my ear a mix of annoyance and reassurance that only barnabas could manage flying was a lot scarier now that hitting the ground held real consequence i still had the bruises from hitting the seat belt i didnt need to add to them i trust you i said squinting down at the desert below its me im worried about he said nothing but his flight smoothed into a slow spiral down it looked like he was headed for the modest home below us rons presumably it was the same color as the tan almost pink sand there was nearly no vegetation either next to the house or in the surrounding area i didnt see any roads at all leading up to it and no sign of people anywhere just a low singlestory adobe home amid the desert dirt and watercut gullies it was quiet and dim the sun wasnt up yet but it was close the wind was a steady dry force blowing my hair first one way then another as barnabas circled to a pinktiled patio that opened seamlessly to the desert my nerves were ragged i didnt know what was going to happen in the next five minutes but it was tearing me up that i might not have a chance to even say goodbye theyd let me say goodbye wouldnt they i was pretty sure i was meeting with the seraphs for one of three reasons one i stole some of tammys soul two because i convinced the rising light timekeeper to help me circumvent a guardian angel or three to give them my amulet back and renounce my timekeeper status because i got my body back but the seraph had said i could do that if i chose to what if i chose to do something different now maybe we hadnt succeeded with tammy maybe we had wasnt it worth spending a little time to find out and if it became certain that she would never change then i would scythe her down myself oh god could i do that barnabas set us down with a gentle stephop and i let out my held breath his grip on me loosened and i turned i knew i had a scared look on my face but he managed to muster up a weak smile for me ill see you later barnabas said and i reached for his sleeve keeping him from going more than a step youre not staying my voice quavered and i hated it sighing he dropped his head then looked back up at me i cant i have to leave i hope i hope i see you later they were going to take my amulet from me i knew it and my hand grabbed it useless as it was at this point remember me i breathed barnabas cupped my chin his thumb wiping away a tear that had somehow leaked out if they let me he said you were a very good timekeeper madison barnabass hand dropped eyes fixed to mine he backed up his wings made one fast downward push and he was airborne i felt alone and miserable hed been told to leave and he left angels were made to serve barnabas had said but if one served unwillingly wasnt it slavery a bitter resolve pushed out my fear as i watched his silhouette spin turn and vanish sure i had made the deal to give the amulet back once i had my body but things had changed ino wehad proved that a souls fate was not fixed but that it could be turned back to a better path i wanted my body my amulet and a chance to really see if this could work and as i turned to look at rons house i promised myself that i wasnt going to let anything go without a fight arms wrapped around myself i looked in the wide patio doors at a huge tiled living room done in tasteful browns taupes and pale pinks and oranges it looked very desertish so unlike my green suburbia no wonder ron wore desert robes the sand must get into everything going up and knocking didnt seem rightafter all the sun wasnt up yetand it wasnt like i wanted to talk to ron where are you i whispered looking up into the pale blue sky that almost looked white no seraphs i went to sit on the waisthigh wall surrounding most of the patio angling so that i could see the house and the rising sun both id never been to the desert and it was breathtaking in its open beauty the horizon was so far away the colors melting into themselves like watercolors the wind blew into me as if it had never brushed against anything ever before i could feel a hum in my veins and i wondered if it was because the ground was holy it would have to be for a seraph to set foot on it my island too was holy a thump on the glass door shattered my introspective mood and i spun chest clenching when i saw ron furious as he struggled to get the door to slide open you he shouted his bony bare ugly feet slapping as he came out paul is gone youre here what have you done with him his pace slowed as he noticed my new reaperblack clothes i slid from the wall and tugged my oversize tunic straight hi ron nice place you have must be a bitch getting out here with no roads or is that to keep people from leaving once they get here i gasped backpedaling as he reached for me giving me a shake with his small hands on my shoulders i was too taken aback to try to stop him and besides i thought i deserved it the seraphs told me to come here i said teeth rattling not my idea im waiting for them get your hands off ron let go backing up as he tried to guess if i was telling the truth his eyes narrowed in the rising sun he looked at me youre alive he said suddenly and his gaze dropped to my amulet yeah i said in a huff i found my body thanks for adding to the misery im not going to adjust your amulet if thats why youre here ron said haughtily backing up even more and slowly making a with his gaze on the skies where is paul sniffing i refused to let him know how miserable i was adjust my amulet adjust it right out of my hands maybe careful i mocked turning to look at the rising sun someone might think you care about him you little girl ron spat and i turned back around hearing the hatred in his voice where is paul hes changed his amulets signature i dont know how but he did i cant find him my eyebrows rose i hadnt told him how to change resonances so his amulet must have changed on its ownbecause he helped me the dark save someone from the light i didnt even try to hide my smug look and rons look became choleric you didnt ron exclaimed how dare you interfere with my own student why not you interfered with me and i was kaiross student i said arms over my chest well i would have been his student if he hadnt been trying to kill me paul is helping me were saving souls you are wrong madison standing stiffly before me ron fisted his hands his eyes going blue for an instant as he touched the divine you cannot change a persons fate after their soul dies you can if you catch them soon enough before it dies completely i shouted hearing my voice become lost in the desert shredded by the wind what is your problem youre the one who believes in choice or is it that you believe in choice only when its done your way ron paced to me and i stood firm head even and lips pressed defiantly what did you do he demanded nothing i backed up a step not liking him that close my amulet wasnt working at all and if i died before the seraph got here well who knew if it would listen to me anyway paul helped me find tammy since my connection with my amulet is less than it should be we flashed forward i said and rons face went gray it wasnt happyhappy ron we both saw what happens to the people you save with guardian angels who dont manage to rekindle their souls paul wasnt too thrilled about it i wasnt either no wonder the dark timekeepers kill people to prevent that im starting to think they are right no one deserves to be eaten by black wings their entire existence erased like they never existed when were you planning on telling him when you were on your deathbed and youd brainwashed him into being a second you you turned him dark it was a breathy whisper but i could see the tension in him building i did not i stated firmly but i wondered we saw the truth and the truth sucks you turned him dark he shouted face going red hes my acolyte you are toxic madison poisoning everything you touch we were trying to save someone i shouted back still holding myself like i was afraid guardian angels are not guarding the living they are guarding the dead in the vain hope that they will somehow rekindle their souls people cant change unless they see the good and the bad the light and the dark the system doesnt work anymore but he wasnt listening his bony feet slapping the gritty pavers as he paced his fury needing an outlet he was my student and you turned him against me i took a breath to yell at him some more but it came out in a gasp as he snatched his amulet and a brilliant sword glittered into existence hey i shrieked stepping backward to get space between us but i stepped off the patio and into the soft sand my arms pinwheeled and i went down my air huffed out and i could do nothing as he bore down on me sword gleaming in the new sun i widened my eyes and my breath sucked in as the sword glittered and then ron swung his sword catching the first rays of the new day im going to die again i thought not knowing what that meant anymore but a matteblack sword swung to block rons the two met in a ping that was more feeling than sound and i felt dizzy at the bubble of energy that was released pressing out and away to color the sun and stir an echo from the sky itself the sword above me looked as immutable as time soaking in the light my eyes struggled to shift and i blinked at the seraph above me i couldnt tell if it was the same one as before or not the white glow hurting my eyes its face was terrible with anger short of understanding and patience give me that the seraph demanded snatching rons sword from his slack grip rons sword in the seraphs hand made a ping cracking from the hilt to the point ron stumbled back his amulet on his chest glowing briefly before it went out my lips parted at the new crack in the stone leaking a silver line of infinity seeing it ron covered it shamed but he was still angry i sat up at the seraphs feet stunned that awful black sword was gone and the seraph was extending a hand to help me rise watching my hand move as if in a dream i put my fingers out it was a perfect hand too strong to be feminine but too thin to be masculine and as i put mine into it i could feel a divine strength humming tightly leashed chronos is there an issue you wish to discuss the high angel said as it drew me effortlessly to my feet she he stammered eyes rising from his sword still in the seraphs hand she poisoned the rising light timekeeper against me mmmm it was a slow sound and i swear i heard thunder rumble against the distant mountains the seraphs thoughts echoing between heaven and earth my pulse was fast and i backed away from both of them finding the patio and not knowing what to do with my hands it had saved me but saved me for what they were going to take my amulet away im sorry i whispered and both ron and i took several prudent steps back as the angel moved to stand on the pavers as well it was getting easier to look at it and i snuck glances its beauty still hurting me somehow you showed paul the truth of the guardian angels the seraph said looking too kindly at me for me to bear they are rejoicing that their torment finally be understood and your praises are being sung whether anything changes or not paul made the choice he was fated to rest easy thats not it i said and ron made a frustrated noise she turned him against me he protested my own student i jumped when the angel abruptly looked at ron i hadnt even seen him move ron too had closed his mouth scared you turned him against you yourself with your hoarding of knowledge in fear the seraph said be still for a moment i want to know why madison sorrows and while here on earth i can only do one thing at a time its bothersome how do you exist able to do only one thing at a time see one outcome from a thing instead of many the seraph turned to me concern pinching its brow to make it look more beautiful yet madison why do you sorrow i couldnt look up and i felt like i was before god himself i took some of tammys soul i admitted in the flash forward abomination ron all but hissed and i agreed with him my head came up and i squinted at the seraph pleading the memory was so beautiful i didnt want the black wings to eat it and have it be gone forever id give it back if i could can you give it back to her for me only now could i meet the angels eyes and i blinked at the understanding no the pleased expression it wore i gave them a part of my own soul instead and they didnt know the difference i added more confidently i couldnt let that much joy be forgotten by everyone mmmm again the thunder rumbled in a clear blue sky and the sun rose higher you claimed her with ancient law giving an equal sacrifice for her soul there is no need to make repairs it said touching my shoulder in support and i felt lifted buoyed memories grow with the sharing as do souls you took a memory of the future not the present she still has it there is a long life for her now with much sorrow and memories too beautiful to forget are what sustain us the trick the seraph hesitated its lips quirking in what had to be humor is to recognize them i was almost in tears but ron was smug as he set his feet wide apart and crossed his arms over his chest in a confident manner then paul got her a guardian angel after all he stated if she lives then she must have her guardian good for paul the angel let go of my shoulder and laughed the sound pealed forth shaking the air frightened i wanted to run but the angel was focused on ron not me no it said and a cool breeze touched my face heavy with moisture odd here in the desert but good for paul yes madison showed a lost soul how to recognize joy and pauls counsel gave her the strength to fight for it her fate is changing this very moment and her life is lived not endured she dies with grace and touches many souls the seraph turned to me as i stared openmouthed you and paul did well tammy is okay i said elated wed done it wed done it twice surely they had to see now but then my mood softened ebbed and died tammys fate wasnt my only worry fingering my amulet i thought of my body i had said id give the amulet back if i ever found my body i didnt want to i wanted to stay theyd let me stay if i wanted to right tammy is okay the seraph said beaming warmth into me to make me feel good despite my world falling apart around me because of you and paul because you worked together ron lost his confident stance grim and ugly paul is not going to succeed me he said vehemently this is an outrage light and dark working together it isnt done ive served for a hundred lifetimes and youll continue to do so the seraph interrupted him beautiful bare feet grinding the grit as the angel turned you are going to forget pauls intentions and what has passed this morning my eyes widened as it raised rons sword over his head and plunged it deep into the paving stones the earth shook and both ron and i fell he scrambled up but i stayed where i was feeling the air grow damp against me above us thick rain clouds had formed rain in the desert a gift out of time out of place the angel stood before us terrible in its beauty and anger reclaim your sword to bring about heavens will it intoned and ron looked in horror at his blade sticking out of the patio like excalibur use the time before you find your bravery to reflect the seraph added there is one last task for me before i leave this confused maelstrom of existence and you are not required for it chronos i didnt understand why ron was staring at me so hatefully standing before his sword as if it was a snake if he didnt reclaim it his amulet wouldnt work at full strength he takes it and his memory of what paul did this night is gone the seraph said crouching down to be at my level it was an odd position for an angel and my breath caught at his nearness slowly i stood up my eyebrows rising in understanding and if he leaves it there he wont have the strength to stop us i said and the angel beamed holding out a hand as it knelt before me i looked at it feeling my face going cold the seraph was asking for my amulet one last thing it said and i clutched at the stone you want my amulet i whispered and ron snorted clearly not upset that i was going to lose everything as well yes the seraph gracefully rose to a stand as well still holding a hand out but i proved fate can be changed that a dying soul can be rekindled i said looking over the cooling desert as if my past deeds would be out there somewhere to find and collect like pretty rocks all of us together light and dark we saved tammys soul and her life i know i said id give it up when i found my body but i saw what happened to those who are given guardian angels but arent able to rekindle their souls on their own and that is awful agreed the seraph said the songs of the guardian angels did much to sway heaven but to kill a person outright to save his or her soul i lamented that is awful too agreed the seraph said again a touch of impatience in its tone a hand still outstretched your amulet please it is confusing here i want to leave give it to the angel madison or it will take it ron said smugly and my reach to pull it over my head almost stopped i wanted to cry as i felt the amulet leave me felt the bond between us stretch and hold paul and i i said as the seraph cupped its hands around it hiding it from me we changed things i can understand why i need to forget but dont make him forget a glow leaked from between the seraphs fingers pure and divine the angel opened its hand and my whitehot stone slowly cooled shifting through the spectrum until it was again black we have no intention of making him forget the seraph said extending my amulet back to me i stared at it unbelieving they are giving it back it took several hundred years of searching the time lines to find someone able to manipulate time and have the fate to make the choice he has made the seraph said here take your amulet i want to leave i stared at my amulet dangling from the seraphs fingers theyre giving it back slowly i reached out fingers closing on air an instant before i touched it bbut i stammered as i looked at it still in the seraphs possession i found my body claimed it the seraph lowered its arm as ron began to pace his sword between us do you want to be the dark timekeeper the seraph asked yes i exclaimed looking at my amulet but i want to be alive too the seraph shrugged so you changed your mind it said smiling we knew you would it was fated such take your amulet it has been adjusted not breathing i reached out hesitating take it the seraph thundered and i jumped grabbing it there once was a girl named madison sang a familiar voice and my eyes shot to the seraphs shoulder it was grace and i could see her i mean really see her she was beautiful glowing with spiderwebs and dew i couldnt seem to breathe and she laughed almost falling off the seraphs shoulder check out the time line she suggested and i closed my eyes gasping it was so clear so precise and tears pricked at my eyes i could see everything intertwined one thing affecting the other until it was singing a glorious resonant hum of existence my dad was worried about me shoe was thinking of me curious after having talked to tammy josh was at home sending me a worried text message wendy wasnt thinking about me at alland that was okay she was living her life joyfully im the dark timekeeper i whispered and my eyes flew open to see grace beaming you always have been the seraph said kneeling as if trying to get closer to my happiness but now you have the chance to be a person too to live as those youre trying to save even a superhero needs a place to be normal it finished with a wry smile i sat on the tile and blinked far above us the clouds thickened it was raining but the drops were evaporating before reaching the ground i had my amulet i had my body they were going to let me do things my way then you agree i said needing to hear it no more scythings again the seraph laughed an echo of thunder above following it the scythings will continue it said and ron standing before his sword with his hands fisted grunted but you agreed i started not caring i was arguing with one of gods angels the seraph shifted standing up to tower over me your plans are sound but madison the reapers are a different drawer of spoons my shoulders slumped as ron harrumphed not so easy madison he taunted almost reaching for his sword but not yet ready to consign his memory of pauls intent to the crapper reapers serve their timekeepers out of respect the seraph said frowning at rons glee it is their choice to change or not the guardian angels are behind this shift as one but the reapers depressed i slumped on rons patio hating his smile at me then ive gained nothing i whispered the seraphs touch was almost not there it was so soft as it tilted my chin up to look me in the eye grace was behind it smiling and my head hurt at their combined beauty youve gained everything you will work with reapers as they come to you seeking answers and they will come seeking answers word of what has happened is echoing between heaven and earth that you and paul have worked together has reapers questioning both the light and dark light and dark they will come to you and light and dark you will send them out together as one to save or damn souls thats why we sent demus to you he has doubt your questions will be his answers my eyebrows rose they had sent demus to me because he might listen then the cullings will stop i whispered but the seraph was shaking its head smiling benevolently i told you light and dark you will pair them up and light and dark you will send them out together the reapers will try to change fate but if it is determined that the soul will remain steadfast to ruin despite their efforts a dark reaper will cull their soul and a light reaper will weep i dont understand i stammered the cullings will continue the seraph insisted but it will be the light reaper who deems the soul lost not the dark my mouth made an o of understanding the light who once assigned the guardian angels would be less likely to write a soul off a person would have to truly be beyond hope for that to happen it was enough this i decided i could do seeing my resolve reflected in my eyes the seraph nodded and drew back if a change can be made then fate will intervene and a life will be lived i hope this happens its up to you the seraph smiled and i almost burst with happiness and your reapers there is no more using the ancient law though it worked this time but you are not to risk yourself in such a way again understand i exhaled smiling wryly up at it this is the best im going to get isnt it the seraph arced its wings to touch over its head an angels version of a shrug id seen barnabas do it extended a hand for me and feeling renewed i slipped my hand among the angels fingers as we turned to the sun a clear light filled me at the touch thrilling me down to my toes the desert vanished with a crack of real lightning i gasped and then felt myself go misty the first patters of large heavy drops of rain hit my face i was both there to feel it and gone half of me feeling the warm plops of rain and half the emptiness of nothing and then the warm wetness vanished and i was nowhere i panicked disembodied and unreal i clutched at my amulet as if it could save me but i wasnt sure i even had hands anymore a girl once dared walk the line came graces thought into mine and i grasped it seeking union of soul and divine light and dark work together for now perhaps forever but its going to take eons of time eons of time i mused calming as i realized i was safe i just wasnt sure where i was anymore i felt my body seem to lift finishing the move that the angel had started in the arizona desert i took a breath not knowing if it was real it made my heart beat and my blood move a blinding light pulsed over me and i cowered my hand that had been in the seraphs grip falling to my side blinking i brought my head up to see that i was standing in my room not rons patio my reflection stared back at me from my mirror and grace darted over everything as if she hadnt seen it in years numb i stared at myself in that ridiculous black outfit i looked tired small and really dirty heart pounding i turned not believing it i was home alive i looked down the hand clenching my amulet falling open and i still had my amulet now what i wondered aloud peering into its depths to see sparkles and rainbows chapter thirteen the mall was pleasantly busy the weekend traffic moving quickly past the displayed photographs most people not seeing them apart from being something to avoid on the way to a new pair of jeans or an iced mocha but that was how we lived our lives most timesunless something smacked us hard enough to realize that life is fleetingtoo busy with the details of existence to recognize the things that turn existing into living no i wasnt depressed just introspective and as i stood before nakitas photograph of a silent hospital at night i hoped no one noticed the outofstate plates shed taken it at a slant then went on to blur it to make the lights glow and overtake everything almost like what i saw in a fardistant flash forward but still if you looked close did she blur it intentionally my dad asked from behind me and i jumped almost spilling the milk shake i was slamming down josh had gotten it for me before excusing himself to lurk in the nearby food court he liked my photography but after five minutes of it hed had his fill barnabas and nakita were awol but i figured they were around avoiding my mother like most people yes my mother she had shown up unannounced this morning claiming to be here for the mall show but i think she had been on her way to a california youth detention center and got diverted thank you god barnabas seraphs and maybe grace gosh ive no clue whats in nakitas mind when she takes pictures i said she just points and clicks at everything yes well you used to be the same way my dad goodnaturedly chided me as i rolled my eyes his hand on my shoulder made me feel like i belonged and i took it tugging him away before he noticed the outofstate plates neck craning he tried to get a longer look whatever shes doing she needs to keep doing it he said squinting behind him all her work has a unique feral quality its as if im seeing sorrow concern or joy for the very first time through her really yes really he said then he did a double take thats not our local hospital is it i hadnt noticed flustered i stopped at nakitas last entry then had a mild panic attack i hadnt seen this onedidnt even remember her taking it it had won top honors according to the little sticker on the auction slip but thats not what had me tense the photograph was of me from the back as i walked down a dark sidewalk head down and arms over my middle it was shoes house at night and there were orbs trailing behind me like bubbles at least fifty crap had there been guardian angels following me and i never even knew it um you want to see mine i said tugging on my dads arm to get him to where my mother stood alone before my three entries her trendy purse over an arm and her heels planted firmly on the scratched mall floor as if mine were the only photographs out here but he didnt move his eyes fixed on nakitas blackandwhite photograph of me with the angels how did she do that he asked finger hovering over the orbs and why two photos superimposed you think probably i said becoming more nervous had they been following me to evaluate me as a timekeeper barnabas seemed to think that for all their small size guardian angels were more powerful than even the seraphs could be someone told me once that cherubs sat next to gods throne but the more i heard from the experts the more i realized we didnt have a clue slowly my dads shoulders slumped and his eyes became sorrowful as he peered at the picture i hesitated and then knowing that he wouldnt move until he satisfied his curiosity i dropped back to stand with him and tried to see what he was looking atnot what was behind the glass but what was in the mind of the person taking the picture the blackandwhite threw everything into a misty sharpness and it looked like the weight of the world was on me i remembered that night nakita had perfectly captured my worry the need to fix what id broken and as i looked at it that same tiredness seemed to soak into me again nakita was good really good has it been that hard my dad whispered turning to me with a soft pain still in his gaze i thought you were happy here if you want to go back with your mother no i quickly assured him giving him a sideways hug and almost spilling my shake again im happy i like it here i like living with you i feel centered i said using one of his favorite words it was just a rough night you know boyfriends but were okay now i glanced at josh at the food court then blinked barnabas had joined him i didnt even know she took it i finished my dad was looking at my mother who was standing before my photographs like they were the mona lisa if youre sure one hundred percent i said fervently then added just dont tell mom okay she makes me wear funny clothes he laughed at that looking at my short skirt tights and the top that was so uncoordinated with the rest that it worked much of the tension hed adopted since finding out my mom was in town seemed to evaporate hed been looking at me all morning as if he was trying to figure out what was different i think his subconscious knew i was alive again and he was trying to find a more reasonable explanation as to what the change was smiling he put an arm over my shoulder and we slowly moved toward my mom id won an honorable mention and it was at this one that my mother was standing her pride radiating from her more than her threehundreddollar perfume this is wonderful madison she said shunning the pen tied to the auction slip to use her own turquoiseinlaid pen to make an outrageous offer still taking shots of daydreams she added referring to my childhood preoccupation of photographing clouds this one was nothing special just a photograph to fulfill a class requirement it didnt deserve even an honorable mention as far as i was concerned the one id taken of the black wings circling an abandoned house hadnt even placed thanks mom i said giving her equal hugtime so they wouldnt start arguing i pressed into her my eyes closing at the scent of raw silk her grip on me seemed a shade too tight a moment too long and she seemed concerned when i broke from her and she searched my gaze she looked the same in her fashionable shoes her creased slacks and her silk blouse her hair was in the latest conservative cut and her makeup was perfect she had huffed as usual at my choice of clothes and dads casual slacks and shirt but i could tell she was worried about me the wrinkles around her eyes had broken free of her expensive cream to give her away i cant believe you came up all the way from florida for a mall show mom i said trying to get her to stop looking at barnabas and josh her attention came back to me and a quick unsure smile flashed across her and miss this not going to happen i didnt have anything this week but a cancer fundraiser and the people running it know better than me what needs to be done she put her pen away carefully ignoring my dad as she moved to the picture with the black wings did i tell you they had me changing planes in arizona my mother added shaking her head at the crows the connecting flight was canceled i almost got on a flight to san diego not illinois hell of a way to run an airline i fidgeted not knowing what to say well im glad youre here i finally said it really means a lot to me i slurped the last of my shake seeing my dad hide a smile as my mom frowned at the rude noise it was the first time in months that id eaten anything in front of him without duress i was still hungry too and i glanced at the nearby food court where barnabas waited with josh and a halfeaten plate of fries nakita had shown up standing with her hip cocked and her eyes narrowed she and barnabas were arguing big surprise my mother ever sensitive to the boys around her one and only daughter raised her eyebrows at the incongruous trio barnabas was eye candy to the max but it was josh who was watching me with hopeful eyes even as he stuffed fries in his mouth my stomach rumbled it seemed like it was making up for lost time at least my bruises didnt show hey um you guys mind if i go talk to my friends for a minute i asked wanting some of those fries before josh ate them all yes go my mother said frowning suspiciously at barnabas theyre invited to come with us for lunch she added her gaze rising to linger on my amulet ill ask i was backing up and i flushed when my dad shook his wrist then adjusted his watch reservations at twelve thirty my mother added i think the van i rented will hold all of us id like to meet your new friends she looked at her watch and murmured eleven seventeen bill looking up with an exhale she said to me especially your boyfriends oh god just take me now youve met josh i said guardedly knowing she was talking about barnabas who is that other young man talking to nicki she asked its nakita i corrected her growing uncomfortable as nakita seemed to deflate at something barnabas said the reapers anger washing away to leave only sadness something was going on josh too looked unhappy and barnabas isnt my boyfriend i said my mouth dropping open as nakita gave barnabas a hug hes more like i hesitated blinking as nakita turned and walked away head down and looking miserable hes helped me with a few issues i said my voice preoccupied what on earth is going on my mother cleared her throat and i turned flushing at her unbelieving gaze he seems to be quite the casanova when my mother got it wrong she really got it wrong yeaaaah i said just wanting to go over and find out what was up um would you mind if i uh go my dad said finding his own bic pen in a pocket and topping my mothers offer on my lackluster photograph my mother huffed as i was turning away i couldnt help my smile i knew that there wasnt a chance that they would ever get back together again but there was a peace that hadnt been there before and it was nice to have them both around me centered as my dad would say head down as i lived for a moment in my tiny daydream i tossed my empty shake cup away feeling good as i joined barnabas and josh running a fry through his ketchup josh gave me an understanding grin as he took in my folks one comfortable and almost sloppy the other uptight and proper madison your mom looks nice he offered and i snorted i cant imagine why you and your mother didnt get along josh added and i slumped into my chair shes okay i said pulling myself upright so my mom wouldnt frown she just wants to be sure im safe i reached for one of joshs fries and he pushed the plate to me a warm spot grew in my middle and i smiled yeah he liked me a guy wouldnt just give up his fries like that if he didnt barnabas brought his gaze back from the shop that nakita had gone into his expression cross i cant go for lunch he said irately my eyebrows went up you heard that josh squirted more ketchup out he heard your entire conversation sitting with him is like sitting with an fbi agent i though would like to go to lunch he ate a fry narrowly escaping dripping ketchup on himself i already cleared it with my mom he added mouth full i followed barnabass dark gaze down the hall he was brooding about nakita i ah talked to paul this morning i said and barnabas jerked his attention back to me a trace of what might be alarm drifted through him and i put up a hand were good i said ron pulled his sword out of his patio and he doesnt remember anything about paul helping us last night good good barnabass words werent quite jiving with his body language i heard from paul too he added eyes on the table really i hoped nakita was okay it wasnt like her to just leave like that shed been on cloud nine maybe literally since finding out that id retained my timekeeper position and that things had the potential to change the silence brought my attention back to the table josh was giving barnabas a look and the reaper was studiously ignoring him gazing at his amulet the usually flat stone was glowing and i saw the hint of yellow in it as in shifting to red yellow whats going on i asked remembering nakitas angry then sad mood just tell her barney josh prompted him earning a glare from the reaper tell me what i demanded still barnabas sat there with his lips pressed tight hands clasped tightly on the table i could see my mother beyond him watching us josh slurped some of his drink barnabas wants to go back to ron he said flatly my lips parted and i sat up straight excuse me my loud exclamation had caught my moms attention but my dad caught her elbow and tugged her away giving us the privacy that i deserved but she didnt understand ron i said softer but no less vehemently barnabass expression had gone from defiant to miserable dark eyes pleading he reached for my hands and i pulled them away no wonder nakita was pissed its not like that he said and i dont want to go back to ron i want to go back with paul paul seeing my anger hesitate barnabas leaned in madison i talked to paul this morning after the seraph tuned your amulet he says that not only does ron not remember him helping us but that ron doesnt remember me leaving him either ron thinks im still a light reaper in good standing why do you think the seraph did that you want to go back i said hating that my voice was so high you dont think we can do this after i convinced the seraphs to let us try no he shook his head glancing at josh who was getting a chuckle at his expense i do believe but so does paul he wants to help and he cant do it on his own he needs someone to run interference for him like josh does with you josh grinned shoving a fry into his mouth im your secret agent backup he said clearly enjoying himself i slumped elbows on the table youve got nakita to help you too barnabas said softly his head almost touching mine paul doesnt have anyone ive known ron his entire life and its going to take that kind of knowledge to work around him paul is going to be sending you light reapers and someone is going to have to lie to ron about it he grinned softly leaning back with a sly look if theres one thing i can do its lie ive been lying to myself for eons ill be there if you need me but meantime ill stay with paul and watch for the light reapers who might be looking for new answers to old questions and then cover for those who do my heart was aching okay i said feeling the lump in my throat start to grow he was still leaving but he was leaving with purpose barnabas was going to be light and dark both he could do it to ask him to stay would be selfish im going to miss you i said refusing to even let my eyes tear up much less cry hey he said his light touch on my hand seeming to warm me we can still talk right i nodded miserable though i had everything i wanted barnabas had been with me from the moment i had woken up dead in the morgue and saying goodbye was like breaking up sort of barnabas stood and i blinked up at him its not like im dying he said as he leaned down to give me a hug but im going to miss the way you used to scramble to look like you just got out of bed in the morning my eyes closed and i could feel the divine in him smelling like feathers and sunflowers my thoughts went to sarah living her life with him what would it be like i wondered to have the divine with you all the time it would be too much for me and i let him go he pulled himself to his full height and i smiled up at him she loved you to her last breath didnt she i said suddenly barnabas hesitated scrambling until he figured out i was talking about sarah and beyond he said seriously sometimes i envy you with your endings endings are not always bad most times theyre just beginnings in disguise he inclined his head gaze going past me i should go josh wiped his hand and extended his fist catch you on the flip side birdman he said and the two banged knuckles the lump in my throat seemed to settle in for good and i took a deep breath if my mother saw me like this shed think that i was crushing on barnabas and anyway barnabas said as he turned to leave i think youre going to be too busy to miss me i followed his gaze down the hallway to where nakita stood confident and sassy again with demus beside her the dark reaper seemed embarrassed but the light in his eyes demanded answers that he could find only with me my lips parted and i looked at barnabas grinning as he spun in a slow half circle the hem of his duster furling josh grunted as he crushed his plate and napkin into a ball i think nakita has brought you your first turncoat he said and i just shook my head seeing the belligerent confusion in the redheaded angel standing beside nakita i stood thinking this afternoon with my parents was going to be memorable if nothing else good thing nakita could change memories do you think he eats seafood i asked josh beats me barnabas was leaving but demus seemed to be taking his place bringing another reaper around to a colorful frame of mind might be fun seeing as he was looking for answers i had my body and my amulet and a future that was going to be both challenging and rewarding as i worked oneonone with heavens own showing them what the collective consciousness of humanity had distilled into methat life was as important as the soul and to end one to save the other wasnt necessary if light and dark could work together to bring about understanding light and dark i thought fingering my amulet good and bad soul and body all together in a mixedup mess that somehow made divine sense perfectly satisfied i walked beside josh wondering what tomorrow would be what souls i might save today though i was me going out for lunch with my parents and my friends and that was just fine with me about the author new york times bestselling
