anne perry rutland place charlotte pitt took the letter and looked at the errand boy in some surprise he gazed back with round intelligent eyes was he waiting for a financial reward she hoped not she and thomas had only recently moved from their previous house into this larger airier one with its extra bedroom and tiny garden and it had taken all their resources will there be a reply maam the boy said cheerfully a trifle amused by her slowness he was generally employed in a wealthier part of the city people in these streets ran their own errands but this was the sort of place he aspired to one day in the dim adult future a terraced house of his own with a clean step curtains at the windows a flower box or two and a handsome woman to open the door and welcome him in at the end of the day oh charlotte breathed out in relief just a moment she tore the envelope pulled out the single sheet of paper and read rutland place london rd march my dear charlotte a curious and most disturbing thing has happened here lately and i would value your advice upon it in fact knowing your past skill and experience with things of tragic or criminal nature perhaps even your help of course this is nothing like the unspeakable affairs you have unfortunately been drawn into before in paragon walk or that appalling business near resurrection row thank heavenssimply a small theft but since the article i have lost is of great sentimental value to me i am more than a little distressed over it and most anxious to have it returned my dear would you help me in this at least with your advice i know you have a maid now who can look after jemima for you in your absence if i send the carriage for you tomorrow about eleven oclock will you come and take luncheon with me and we can talk over this wretched business i do so look forward to seeing you your loving mother caroline ellison charlotte folded the letter and looked back at the boy if you wait just a moment i shall write a reply she said with a little smile and then after a small interval returned to hand him her acceptance thank you maam the boy nodded and scampered off apparently he had not expected more his reward no doubt customarily came from the sender anyway he was far too worldly wise not to know precisely who was worth how much and who would or would not part with it charlotte closed the door and went back along the corridor to the kitchen where her eighteenmonthold daughter jemima was sitting in her crib chewing a pencil charlotte took it from her absentmindedly and handed her a colored brick instead ive asked you not to give her pencils grade she said to the little maid who was peeling potatoes she doesnt know what theyre for she only eats them didnt know she had it maam she can reach ever so far between those bars leastways it keeps her from getting into the coal scuttle or the stove there was an abacus of bright wooden beads set into the railings of the crib and charlotte knelt down and rattled them lightly jemima was immediately attracted and stood up char shylotte began to count them out for her and jemima repeated the words concentrating hard her eyes going from the beads to charlottes face waiting after each word for approval charlotte was only half alert to jemima most of her concentra shytion was on her mother her parents had accepted it extremely well when she had told them she was going to marry of all things a policeman edward had prevaricated a little and asked her very soberly if she was perfectly sure she knew what she was doing but right from the start caroline had understood that her most awkward daughter had found someone whom she loved and the trials of such a radical drop in both social and financial status would be far less difficult for her than a politely arranged marriage to someone she did not love and who could not hold her interest or respect but in spite of their continued affection it was most unlike caroline to send for charlotte over something as trivial as a petty theft after all such things did occur every so often if it was a trinket it was probably one of the servant girls borrowing it to wear for an evening out it might well turn up again if a few judicious hints were dropped caroline had had servants all her life she ought to be able to cope with such a matter without recourse to advice from anyone still charlotte would go it would be a pleasant day and she had been through a time of hard work getting the house into the order she wished im going out tomorrow grade she said casually my mother has invited me to take luncheon with her we can leave doing the landing curtains until the day after you can look after jemima and scrub this floor and the wooden cupboard in the corner get some good soap into it it still smells odd to me yes maam and therell be some laundry and shall i take jemima for a walk if its fine yes please that would be excellent charlotte stood up if she was going to be out for most of tomorrow then she had better get on with the bread this afternoon and see what her best day dress looked like after hanging up in a wardrobe over the winter gracie was only fifteen but she was a competent little thing and liked nothing better than caring for jemima charlotte had al shyready told her that in six months time there would be another baby to care for and it was part of the terms of gracies employment that she should do the heavy laundry that another child would entail as well as the usual kitchen and household chores far from being daunted by the prospect gracie appeared to be positively excited she came from a large family herself and she missed the constant demanding and noisy companionship of children pitt was tired when he came in from work a little before six he had spent most of the day in the profitless pursuit of a couple of dragsmen thieves who stole especially from carriages and had ended up with nothing more for his exercise than half a dozen descriptions that did not match an inspector of his experi shyence would not have been called to deal with the affair at all had not one of the victims been a gentleman of title who was loath to have anything to do with the police the man had lost a gold pocket watch inherited from his fatherinlaw and did not care to have to explain its absence charlotte welcomed him with the same strange mixture of excitement and comfort she always felt at the sight of his untidy skewcollared rumplecoated figure she hugged him for several long close minutes then presented him with hot soup and his dinner she did not disturb him with so trivial a matter as her mothers mislaid item the following morning she stood in front of the cheval glass in her bedroom and adjusted the lace fichu at her neck to hide the place where she had taken off last years collar then she put on her best cameo brooch the effect was entirely satisfactory she was three months with child but there was not yet any observ shyable change in her figure and with the customary whalebone corseting that laced even the most recalcitrant waist into elegant curvesuncomfortable though it was for the more generously made and almost crippling for the plumpshe looked as slender as ever the dark green wool was becoming to the warmth of her complexion and the richness of her hair and the fichu took away from the severeness of the dress making it a little more feminine she did not wish caroline of all people to think she had become dowdy the carriage came at eleven and before half past it had crossed the city trotted along the sedate length of lincolnshire road and turned into the quiet treelined elegance of rutland place it stopped in front of the white portico of number and the footman opened the door and handed charlotte out onto the damp pavement thank you she said without looking around as if she were perfectly accustomed to it as indeed she had been until only a few years ago the door opened before she reached it and the butler appeared good morning miss charlotte he said inclining his head a little good morning maddock she smiled at him shp had known him since she was sixteen and he had first come as butler when her family lived in cater street before the murders there during which she had met and married pitt mrs ellison is in the withdrawing room miss charlotte maddock moved easily just before her to push the door inside caroline was standing in the middle of the room a bright fire burning behind her against the chill spring a bowl of daffodils spilling gold reflections all over the polished table she was wearing a gown of pink peach as soft as an evening sky which must have cost her a months dress allowance there were not more than a dozen threads of gray in her dark hair she stepped forward immediately my dear im so glad to see you you look extremely well do come in and warm yourself i dont know why spring is so cold everything looks marvelous bursting with life but the wind is like a blade thank you maddock well take luncheon in about an hour yes maam he closed the door behind him and caroline put her arms round charlotte and hugged her hard you should come more often charlotte i really do miss you emily is so busy these days with all her social circle i hardly see her charlotte tightened her arms round her for a moment then stood back her younger sister emily had married into the aristocracy and was enjoying every opportunity it afforded nei shyther of them spoke of her other sister sarah who had died so dreadfully in cater street well sit down my dear caroline arranged herselfele shygantly on the sofa and charlotte sat opposite in the big chair how is thomas caroline asked very well thank you and jemima charlotte dealt with all the expected questions and the house is very comfortable and my new maid is working out most satisfactorily caroline sighed with faint amusement you dont change do you charlotte you still speak your mind the minute you think it you are about as subtle as a railway engine i dont know what i would have done with you if you had not married thomas pitt charlotte smiled broadly you would still be shuffling me round endless polite and disgusting parties hoping to persuade some unfortunate young mans mother that i am really better than i sound charlotte please what have you had stolen mama oh dear i simply cant imagine how you ever detect anything you couldnt trick a policeman into telling you the time i shouldnt need to mama policemen are always perfectly willing to tell you the time in the unlikely event they know it i can be devious if i wish then you have changed since i ever knew you what did you lose mama carolines face changed the laughter dying out of it she hesitated as if trying to choose exactly the right words for something that was surely simple enough a piece of jewelry she began a small locket on a gold bow it is not of especial value of course its not very large and i dont imagine it is solid gold for a moment but it was very pretty it had a little pearl set in the front and of course it opened charlotte voiced her first thoughts do you not think one of the maids could have borrowed it meaning to return it immediately and forgotten my dear dont you imagine ive thought of that carolines tone was more anxious than irritated but none of them had an evening off between the time i last saw it and when i missed it and quite apart from that i really dont believe any of them would the kitchenmaid would have no opportunityand shes only fourteen i really dont think it would occur to her the parlormaidshe smiled a little bleaklyis as handsome as most parlormaids are i did not realize maddock had such excellent taste in employing our staff nature has endowed her quite well enough not to need the assistance of stolen jewelry with all its risks and my own maid i trust absolutely ive had mary since we moved here and she came from lady buxton whod known her since she was a child shes the daughter of their cook no her face creased in distress again im afraid it is some shyone outside this house charlotte tried the next avenue are any of your maids courting do they have followers carolines eyebrows rose not so far as i know maddock is very strict and certainly not inside the house with access to my dressing room i suppose youve asked maddock of course i have charlotte im perfectly capable of doing the obvious myself if it were so simple i should not have troubled you she took a deep breath and let it out slowly shaking her head a little im sorry its justthe whole affair is so wretched i cant bear to think one of my friends could have taken it or someone in their households and yet what else is there to think charlotte looked at her unhappy mother her fingers knotted together in her lap twisting her handkerchief until the lace threatened to tear she understood the dilemma now to institute inquiries even to allow the loss to be known would sow doubt among all her acquaintances the whole of rutland place would imagine caroline suspected them of theft old friendships would be ruined perhaps perfectly innocent servants would lose their jobs or even their reputations the rebounding unpleasantness would be like ripples in a pool troubling and distorting everything i would forget it mama she said quickly reaching to touch carolines hand the regaining of a locket would be far less valuable than avoiding all the pain inquiry would cause if anyone asks say the pin was loose and it must have fallen out what did you wear it on the coat to my plumcolored outfit then thats easy it could have fallen anywhereeven in the street caroline shook her head the pin was excellent and it had a chain with a small extra safety catch which i always fastened as well for goodness sake you dont need to mention thatif anyone should ask which they probably wont who gave it to you papa carolines eyes moved slightly to look over charlottes shoul shyder out the window at the spring sun dappling the laurel bush no i would explain it to him easily enough it was your grandmama for last christmas and you know what a precise memory she has when she chooses to charlotte had a peculiar feeling that some essence had eluded her that she had heard something important and had failed to understand it but grandmama must have lost things herself she said reasonably explain to her before she misses it shell probably be a bit selfrighteous but thats not unbearable shell be that sometime or another anyway she smiled this will only give her an excuse yes caroline said blinking but a certain tone in her voice belied any conviction charlotte looked around the room at the pale green curtains and soft carpet the warm bowl of daffodils the pictures on the walls the piano in the corner that sarah used to play with the family photographs on it caroline was sitting on the edge of the sofa as if she were in a strange place and were keeping herself ready to leave what is it mama charlotte asked a little sharply why does this locket matter so much caroline looked down at her hands avoiding charlottes eyes i had a memento in itofof a quite personal nature i should feel mostembarrassed if it should fall into anyone elses hands a sentimental thing im sure you can understand it is not knowing who has it like having someone else read your letters charlotte breathed out in relief she did not know now what she had been afraid of but suddenly her muscles relaxed and she felt a wave of warmth ripple through her it was all so easy now that she understood for goodness sake why didnt you say so to begin with there was no point in suggesting the thief might not open it the first thing any woman would do on finding a locket would be to look inside perhaps that day you forgot to do up the safety clasp and it really did fall off i suppose youve looked thor shyoughly in the carriage oh yes i did that immediately when do you last remember it i went to an afternoon party at ambrosinesambrosine charrington she lives at number eighteen a most charming person caroline smiled fleetingly you would like her she is quite markedly eccentric charlotte ignored the implication at the moment the locket was more important indeed she said dryly in what way caroline looked up in surprise oh shes perfectly respectablein fact more than respectable her grandfather was an earl and her husband lovell charrington is a most notable man ambrosine herself was presented at court when she came out of course that was a long time ago but she still has many connections that doesnt sound very eccentric charlotte said skeptically thinking that carolines view of eccentricity was probably quite different from her own she likes to sing caroline explained and some of the oddest songs i cannot imagine where she learned them and she is extremely forgetful even of things one would have thought any woman in society would remembersuch as who called in the last week or so and who is related to whom she sometimes makes quite startling mistakes charlotte warmed to her immediately good for her that must be most entertaining she remem shybered endless afternoons before she was married when caroline had taken her three daughters to meet the mothers of suitable young men and they had all sat in overstuffed chairs drinking lukewarm tea sizing each other up with regard to income dress sense complexion and agreeability while the girls wondered which callow young man they would be introduced to next and which ironeyed prospective motherinlaw would inspect them she shivered at the recollection and thought of pitt in his linoleumfloor office with its brown desk and files of papers pitt stalking in and out of alleys and tenements after forgers and dealers in stolen goods and just occasionally walking the smarter streets after a safebreaker or embezzler or even a killer charlotte carolines voice recalled her to rutland place and the warm withdrawing room yes mama perhaps it would be better if you said nothing at all after all if it was stolen the thief is hardly going to admit it and anyone decent enough to return it to you would not have looked at what they would know is personal and even if they did they would not find it remarkable after all we all have private matters caroline forced a smile overlooking the fact that the thief would not even know it was hers without some natural investi shygation which would be bound to include opening it to see the inscription no of course not she stood up now im sure it must be nearly time to eat you look very well my dear but you mustnt neglect your health remember you are eating not only for yourself the meal was delicious and far more delicate than charlotte would have had at home where she tended to skimp on midday meals she ate with enjoyment afterward they repaired to the garden for a short breath of air and in the shelter of the walls it was very pleasant a little before three oclock they went back to the withdrawing room and within half an hour received the first caller of the afternoon mrs spencerbrown maam the parlormaid said formally shall i tell her you are at home yes by all means caroline agreed quickly then waited a moment until the girl left before she turned to charlotte she lives opposite at number eleven her husband is a terrible bore but she is very lively pretty creature in herown way the door opened again and the parlormaid ushered in the visitor she was perhaps thirtythree or thirtyfour very slender with fine features the longest most graceful neck charlotte had ever seen and fair hair that was swept to the back of her head and piled in the latest fashion she was dressed in ecrucolored lace my dear mina how delightful to see you caroline said as easily as if no thought had troubled her all day how opportune you should call mina turned immediately to charlotte her eyes bright i dont believe you have met my daughter mrs thomas pitt caroline performed the awaited introductions charlotte my dear this is my most excellent neighbor mrs spencerbrown how do you do mrs spencerbrown charlotte inclined her head a little in something like half a curtsy and mina made the same gesture of recognition i have been so interested to meet you she said looking charlotte up and down mentally taking note of everything she wore from her slightly scuffed boots to the sleek styling of her hair in order to assess the skill or otherwise of her maid and thus the standard of her whole household charlotte was used to such judgments and she met this one with unflickering coolness how kind of you she said her eyes amused and frank im sure had i known of you a little more i should have looked forward to our meeting just as much she knew caroline was regarding her anxiously trying to get close enough to kick her under her skirts without being observed charlotte smiled even more candidly how fortunate mama is to have such an agree shyable neighbor i hope you will stay and take tea with us mina had had every intention of staying but was momentarily disconcerted to have the subject mentioned when she was hardly through the door whywhy thank you that would be delightful mrs pitt they all sat down mina opposite charlotte where she could face her without appearing to stare i havent seen you in rutland place before do you live far away charlotte was careful not to make jemima an excuse people in minas position were not obliged to care for their children themselves there would be first a wetnurse then a childs nurse then at five or six a nanny and finally a governess or a tutor and thus every possible need would be tended to a little distance she said composedly but one gets involved with ones own circle you know caroline shut her eyes and charlotte heard her give the faintest of sighs mina was temporarily at a loss the reply had not elicited the information she had expected nor yet led to another avenue of exploration yes she said naturally she took a deep breath smoothed her skirts and began again of course we have had the pleasure of meeting your sister lady ashwortha most charming person the implication was being made very delicately that if some shyone of emilys social distinction could find the time then char shylotte certainly ought to im sure she must have enjoyed it charlotte knew quite well that emily would have been bored to tears but emily had always been skilled at hiding her feelings in fact she seemed to have the entire familys share of tactfulness i do hope so mina replied does mr pitt have interests in the city yes charlotte said quite truthfully i imagine he is there at this moment caroline slid a little down in her chair as if she were pretend shying she was absent mina brightened indeed how sensible an idle man can so quickly fall into unfortunate company and end up wasting both his time and his substance dont you think i have no doubt of it charlotte said wondering what had prompted the remark although naturally the city has its pitfalls as well mina continued indeed some of our own neighbors here in the place have the oddest of habits with comings and goings in the city but then of course young men are prone to do such things and i suppose one must expect it of a certain sort family background always tells you knowsooner or later charlotte had no idea what she was talking about caroline sat up if you mean inigo charrington she said with only the barest edge to her voice although charlotte no shyticed her ankles cross and her knees tighten as she deliberately kept her face smooth i believe he has friends in the city and no doubt he cares to dine with them on occasion or possibly go to the theater or a concert minas eyebrows went up of course one only hopes he has chosen wisely and his friends are worthy of him you didnt know poor ottilie did you no caroline shook her head mina made a little face of sympathy the poor creature died the summer before you arrived as i recall she was so young not more than twentytwo or twentythree charlotte looked from one to the other of them waiting for an explanation oh you wouldnt know her mina said seizing the chance she was ambrosine charringtons daughterinigos sister really a most tragic affair altogether they were away for a few weeks during the summer ottilie was in perfect health when they leftat least she seemed so and then within a mere fortnight she was dead quite dreadful we were all completely at a loss im so sorry charlotte meant it the story of life cut short was suddenly sobering in the midst of all the silly chatter and games of social superiority how very painfulfor her family i mean minas slender fingers roamed over her skirt again laying it even more smoothly over her knees actually they have borne it with the greatest fortitude her fine eyebrows rose as if she were still surprised by it one cannot but admire them most especially ambrosine herself that is mrs charringtonshe has risen above it so magnificently if one did not know of it for oneself one would almost believe it had not happened at all they never speak of her you know no doubt the wound is still there charlotte answered one never forgets no matter how brave ones face oh dear mina crumpled i do hope i have not inadvertently said something distressing my dear mrs pitt nothing was further from my mind than to cause you some painful memory charlotte smiled at her pushing sarah from her thoughts and hoping caroline could do so too i would never imagine that you might she said quietly i expect everyone has suffered some loss or another there cannot be a family in the land that has never had death rob them of someone before mina couldsearch for a courteous acceptance of this the withdrawingroom door opened and a very elderly lady came in her face creased with irritation a fine lace shawl drawn round her shoulders and her black boots polished like glass good afternoon mrs spencerbrown she said curtly didnt know you were entertaining this afternoon caroline cook said nothing at luncheon she looked at charlotte then took a step closer good gracious its charlotte she snorted slightly decided to come back into decent society have you good afternoon grandmama charlotte stood up and offered her the most comfortable chair which she herself had been occupying until that moment the old lady accepted it after rearranging the cushions and dusting the seat she sat down and charlotte found herself a hardbacked chair better for you anyway the old lady nodded get a round back sitting in one of these at your age girls always sat up properly when i was young knew how to conduct ourselves then none of this gadding about without chaperones going to the theater and the like and electricity all over the place it must be unhealthy goodness only knows whats in the air gas lamps are quite bad enough if the good lord had intended it to be light all night he would have made the moon as bright as the sun mina ignored her and turned to charlotte with excitement do you go to the theater alone mrs pitt how thrilling do tell us do you have adventures grandmama pulled out a handkerchief and blew her nose loudly charlotte hovered on the edge of pretending that she did do such a thing to annoy her grandmother then decided the embar shyrassment it would cause caroline was too great to balance the pleasure no no i never have she said with a touch of regret is it adventurous good gracious mina looked startled i have no idea one hears stories of course but suddenly she giggled i should ask mrs denbigh she is just the sort of person who would have the courage to do it if she wished i daresay grandmama glowered at her but i have often thought that for all that she is a widow and ought to know her place better amaryllis denbigh is no better than she should be caroline are we going to have tea this afternoon or sit here till dusk chattering dry caroline reached out and rang the bell of course we are mama we were merely waiting until ybu joined us over the years she had grown accustomed to calling the woman mama although she was in fact edwards mother indeed grandmama said skeptically i hope there is some cake i cant bear all that bread cook sends up the woman has a mania for bread they used to know how to make a decent cake when i kept servants trained them properlythats what it all comes down to dont let them get away with so muchthen youll get cake when you want it i do get cake when i want it mama carolines temper was wearing thin and keeping a good staff these days is a lot harder than it used to be times change not for the better grandmama glared at charlotte she refrained from saying anything about respectable women who married into the police of all things but only because there was an outsider present who please god knew nothing about it if she did next thing it would be all over the neighborhood and then heaven knew what people would say let alone what they would think not for the better she said again women working in offices like clerks when they ought to be in good domestic service whoever heard of such a thing who looks after their morals i should like to know there arent any butlers in offices not that there are many women thank heaven womens place is in a houseeither their own or if they havent one somebody elses charlotte thought of several answers and held her tongue on all of them the conversation degenerated into pleasantries about fashion and the weather with only occasional references to other residents of rutland place and grandmamas dour comments upon them they were almost finished when edward came in rubbing his hands a little from the cold why charlotte my dear his face lit up with pleasure and surprise i had no idea you were calling or i would have come home sooner she stood up and he gave her a quick kiss on the cheek you look extremely well i am thank you papa she stepped back and he noticed mina for the first time her pale lace almost blending into the brocade of the sofa and its cushions mrs spencerbrown how pleasant to see you he bowed good afternoon mr ellison she answered brightly her eyes moving from edward back to charlotte interested that he had not been expecting her you seem cold she observed do you care to sit next to the fire she moved her skirt to allow him more room on the sofa beside her he could not decline without discourtesy and anyway he considered the spot nearest the fire to be his right he sat down gingerly thank you it does appear that the weather has changed in fact i fear it might rain we can hardly expect better at this time of the year mina replied caroline met charlottes eyes over the low table in a glance of helplessness then reached for the bell to send for a fresh pot of tea for edward and some more cakes edward received them with obvious appetite and they all engaged in only the barest conversation for several minutes did you find that brooch you lost my dear he said presently head toward caroline but his attention still on the cake caroline colored very slightly not yet but i daresay it will turn up didnt know youd lost anything grandmama exclaimed you didnt tell me no reason why i should mama caroline replied avoiding her eyes im quite sure if you had found it you would have mentioned it to me without my asking what was it grandmama was not going to let go so easily how unfortunate mina joined in i hope it was not valuable ive no doubt it will turn up caroline replied with a note of increasing sharpness in her voice charlotte glancing down saw her hands twined in the handkerchief again white where the tightness of the linen bit into her flesh i expect you have mislaid it she said with a smile she hoped did not look as artificial as it was it may be pinned to some garment you had forgotten you had worn i do hope so mina said shaking her head her dark blue eyes were enormous in her fragile face it is most distressing to have to say so but my dear there have been a number of thingstakenin the place recently she stopped and looked from one to another of them taken edward said incredulously what on earth do you mean taken mina repeated i hate to use a worse word you mean stolen grandmama demanded i told you if you dont train your servants properly and run a house as it ought to be run then this is the sort of thing you can expect sow a wind and reap a whirlwind ive always said so it wasnt you who said that grandmama charlotte said tartly its from the book of hosea in the bible dont be impertinent grandmama snapped edward seemed quite unaware of carolines distress or of charlottes attempt to close the subject did you say there have been other thefts he asked mina im afraid so its perfectly dreadful poor ambrosine lost a most excellent gold chain from her very own dressing table servants grandmama snorted whole class of servants is going down ive said so for years nothings been the same since prince albert died in he was a man with standards no wonder the poor queen is in perpetual mourningso should i be if my son behaved like the prince of wales she snorted in outrage the whole countrys heard of his goingson and my husband lost an ornamental snuffbox with a crystal lid from our mantelshelf mina continued ignoring her completely and poor eloise lagarde lost a silver buttonhook from her reticule unfortunate child she looked at the old lady candidly i cannot imagine any servant who had opportunity to take all those articles i mean how would someone elses ser shyvant be in my house grandmamas eyebrows went up and her nostrils flared then obviously we must have more than one dishonest servant in rutland place the whole world is degenerating at a disastrous speed heaven only knows where it will all end it will probably end with everyone finding what they have misplaced charlotte said standing up it has been most delightful meeting you mrs spencerbrown i do hope we shall have the opportunity to speak again but since the afternoon is turning somewhat unpleasant and it does indeed look like rain im sure you will excuse me if i seek to return to my home before i am drenched without waiting for a reply she bent and gave her grandmother a peck on the cheek her father a swift touch and extended her arm to caroline as if inviting her to accompany her at least as far as the door after rather startled murmurs of goodbye caroline took advan shytage of the opportunity she was almost on charlottes heels as they came into the hall and she shut the withdrawing room door behind them maddock caroline called sharply maddock he appeared yes maam shall i call the carriage for miss charlotte yes please and maddock have polly close the curtains please it is still two hours at least until dark maam he said with slight surprise dont argue with me maddock caroline took a breath and steadied herself the wind is rising and it will rain quite shortly i prefer not to watch it please do as you are asked yes maam he withdrew obediently stiffshouldered in correct and spotless black charlotte turned to her mama why does this locket matter so much and why do you want the curtains drawn at four oclock in the afternoon caroline stared at her as if frozen charlotte put out her hands and touched her mother gently carolines body was stiff under the fine material of her dress she let out her breath slowly and stared past charlotte toward the light coming through the hall windows im not really sureit sounds so hystericalbut i feel as if there were someone watching meandwaiting charlotte did not know what to say caroline was right it did sound hysterical i know its foolish caroline went on hunching her shoul shyders and shivering a little although the hall was perfectly warm but i cant get rid of the sensation ive told myself not to be so fanciful that everyone else has far too much to do to be inter shyested in my comings and goings but its still therethe feeling that there are eyes and a minda mind that knowsand waits the idea was horrible waits for what charlotte asked trying to bring some rationality into it i dont know a mistake waits for me to make a mistake charlotte felt a chill of real fear this was unhealthy even morbid it carried a faint whiff of madness if her mother was as overwrought as this why on earth had edward not noticed and called both her and emily to do something even called a doctor certainly grandmama was always watching and criticizing but then she had done that for as long as charlotte could remember and no one had ever really minded before she did it to everyone to know better than anybody else was part of her satisfaction in living on when so many of her friends were dead caroline shook herself i believe youll get home before the rain in fact i dont think its going to rain after all it was of total indifference to charlotte whether it rained or even snowed do you know who took the locket and the other things mama no of course not what on earth makes you ask such a thing i should hardly have asked you to help me in the matter if i already knew why not you might have wished to get it back without bringing in the police if it were a friend or even a good servant of someone else well i told you charlotte i have no idea suddenly charlotte had a glimpse of the obvious and wondered why she had been so blind as not to have seen it before what is in the locket mama incaroline swallowedin the locket yes mama what is in it she almost wished she had not asked carolines face was white and she stood perfectly still for several seconds outside the carriage wheels rattled on the road and a horse snorted a photograph caroline said at last charlotte looked at her she heard her own voice almost against her will sounding disembodied and remote of whom afriend just a friend but i would rather it was not found by anyone else they might misunderstand my feelings and cause me embarrassment and even she stopped and her eyes came up to meet charlottes at last even what mama charlotte asked very softly maddock was back in the hall standing with her cloak and the footman was at the door even perhapsa little pressure caroline whispered charlotte was used to ugly words and ugly thoughts crime was part of pitts life and she was too close to him not to share much of his pain confusion or pity you mean blackmail she asked caroline winced i suppose i do charlotte put her arms around her and held her tightly for a moment to maddock and the footman it must have looked like an affectionate goodbye then we must find out where it is she said almost under her breath and see that it does no harm dont worry well manage then she raised her tone to normal and stepped back thank you for a most pleasant afternoon mama i hope i shall come again sooner next time caroline blinked and sniffed in a manner she would have abhorred had she been aware of it thank you my dear she said thank you so much it was three days after this that charlotte received another letter from caroline touching on the same subject this time she did speak of it to pitt they were sitting in front of the fire after jemima had been put to sleep charlotte was sewing and pitt was gazing into the flames and sinking gently lower and lower into his chair thomas charlotte looked up from her work and held the needle in the air he turned his head and hitched himself a little higher before his feet slipped over the fender the light flickered and jumped warmly in its glowing brass yes i had a letter from mama today she remarked casually she is distressed about the recent loss of a piece of jewelry his eyes narrowed he knew charlotte a great deal better than she suspected when you say loss i take it you do not mean that she misplaced it he inquired charlotte hesitated im really not quite sure she may have she picked up her work again to give herself time to arrange her words she had not expected him to perceive quite so quickly actually she had thought he was very nearly asleep after a moment or two she looked across at him and found his eyes bright and waiting watching her through his lashes she took a long breath and abandoned the idea of subtlety it was a locket and there was a picture of somebody inside it she went on she would not say who but i gathered it was someone whose presence she would prefer not to explain she smiled a little selfconsciously perhaps it was an old love someone she knew before papa he straightened up and took his legs off the fender his feet were getting hot and he would scorch his slippers if he was not careful and she thinks someone has taken it he asked the obvious yes charlotte said i think she does any idea who she shook her head if she has she wont say so and pf course if she were to report the loss it would cause far more unpleasantness than even having it returned would be worth pitt needed no further explanation he was perfectly familiar with societys feelings about having police in the house with the attendant vulgarity one reported a breakin of course and that was regrettable enough but at least a breakin was an outside affair a misfortune that could happen to anyone with goods worth the taking domestic crime was different it was some shything that might involve the questioning and resultant embar shyrassment of ones friends and therefore resorting to the police was unthinkable does she expect you to play discreet detective he asked with a broad smile im not a bad detective she said defensively in paragon walk i knew the truth before you did as soon as she had spoken memory came back and brought with it ugliness and pain and selfcongratulation became ridiculous almost indecent that was murder he pointed out soberly and you nearly got yourself killed for your cleverness you can hardly go around asking your mothers friends do you happen to have stolen mamas locket and if so would you please give it back unopened because it contains some indiscretion or a picture that might be interpreted as such youre not being very helpful charlotte said crossly if i could have done it as easily as that i wouldnt have needed to ask you about it he sat up straight and leaned forward to take her hand my darling if it really does contain something private then the less said about it the better leave it alone she frowned its more than that thomas she feels some shyone is watching her and waiting he screwed up his face you mean someone has already opened it and is waiting for an opportunity to apply a little blackmail yes i suppose i do her fingers grasped around his its horrid and i think shes really quite frightened if i come in it will only make it worse he said softly and i cant officially anyway unless she calls me i know her fingers tightened charlotte be careful i know you mean well but my dear you have a transparent face and a tongue about as subtle as an avalanche oh thats unfair she protested although at least half of her knew it was not i shall be very careful i still think it would be better if you left it aloneunless someone actually does try blackmail there may be nothing to itno more than your mothers own fears painting shadows on the wall perhaps a little conscience i cant do nothing she said unhappily she has asked me to come see her and i cant leave her so distressed without doing all i am able to i suppose not he conceded but for goodness sake do as little as you can questions will only arouse curiosity and are more likely than anything else to bring about the very specula shytions she is afraid of charlotte knew he was right and she nodded but at the same time she was already making plans to call at rutland place the following day she found caroline in and awaiting her anxiously my dear im so glad you were able to come she said kissing charlotte on the cheek i have planned for us to make a few calls this afternoon so you can meet some of the other people in the placeparticularly those i am best acquainted with myself and to whose houses i have been or who have come here charlottes heart sank obviously caroline intended to pursue the pendant do you not think it would be better to be quite casual about it mama she asked as lightly as she could you do not wish anyone to realize how important it is to you or their curiosity will be aroused whereas if you say nothing it may pass almost without remark carolines lips tightened i wish i could believe that but i feel terribly sure that whoever it is already knows she stopped knows what charlotte asked knows that it is mine and that it is important to me caroline finished awkwardly i told youi can feel them feel their eyes on me and dont say its foolish i know it is but im as sure as i have ever been of anything that there is some personhere who is watching watching and laughing she shivered and hating ii have even felt once or twice as if they were following me in the dusk the red color burned uncomfortably in her cheeks that person sounds like somebody mad charlotte said as levelly as she could very unpleasant but more to be pitied than feared caroline shook her head sharply i would prefer to be sorry for madness at a much greater distance charlotte was shaken her voice came far more roughly more critically than she had intended so would most people she said i think that is what is called passing by on the other side then she stopped aware of how unjust she was being she was confused she was afraid caroline was hysterical and she did not know how to treat it a look of amazement crossed carolines face followed swiftly by anger are you suggesting i owe some christian duty to this crea shyture who stole my pendant and now is peeping at me and following me she said incredulously charlotte was ashamed and angry with herself she should not have spoken her thoughts so bluntly especially since they had nothing to do with the problem and would hardly be of comfort in what was now obviously a far deeper matter than she had appreciated no she said gravely i am trying to make you see that it is not as serious as you believe if whoever stole or found the pendant is really watching you and sniggering behind the curtains then they are not quite right in their minds and need notbe feared so much as viewed with revulsion and some sense of pity as well it is not like a personal enemy who wished you harm and had the ability to bring it about you dont understand caroline shut her eyes in exasperation and the muscles in her face were tight they would not need to have any brains to cause me harm merely to open the locket and see the picture would be enough one can be as mad as a bedlamite and still be able to open a locket and see that the picture inside it is not of your father charlotte sat silent a moment trying to collect her thoughts there must be a great deal more to it that caroline had not said the picture must be more than some dim romantic memory either the dream was still sharp the event still capable of causing pain or else the picture was of some man she knew now here in rutland place who is it in the picture mama she asked a friend caroline was not looking at her a gentleman of my acquaintance there is no more to it than aregard but it could easily be misunderstood a flirtation charlotte was only momentarily surprised she had learned a lot since her total innocence at the beginning of the cater street murders few people are immune to flattery a little romance to flesh out the ordinariness of every day edward had not been so why should caroline and she had kept a picture in a locket foolish but very human people kept pressed flowers theater or dance programs old letters a wise husband or wife allowed a little privacy for such things and did not inquire or dig up old dreams to look for answers she smiled trying to be gentler dont worry about it mama everyone has something private she deliberately phrased it evasively i daresay that if you do not make much of it other people wont in fact i dont suppose they will wish to quite apart from liking you they probably have lockets themselves or letters they would prefer not to lose caroline smiled bleakly you have a charitable view my dear you have been out of society too long you see it from a distance and lose the detail charlotte took her arm and squeezed it for a moment above all things society is practical mama it knows what it can afford now who is it you wish us to visit tell me something about them so i dont say anything tactless and embarrass you good gracious what a hope caroline put her hand over charlottes in a little gesture of thanks first we are going to the charringtons to see ambrosine i told you about her before then i think on to eloise lagarde i dont think isaid anything about her no but was that not a name mrs spencerbrown mentioned i dont recall anyway eloise is a charming person but quite retiring she has led a very sheltered life so please charlotte do give some thought to what you say from charlottes now wider viewpoint everyone in rutland place had led a very sheltered life including caroline herself but she forbore saying so pitts broader teeming world with its vigor and squalor farce and tragedy would only be confusing and frightening to caroline in pitts world realities were not softened by evasion and genteel words its raw life and death would horrify the inhabitants of rutland place just as the myriad icebound rules of society would appall a stranger to it is eloise in delicate health mama charlotte asked i have never heard of any actual illness but there are many things a person of taste does not discuss it has occurred to me that she might be consumptive she seems a little delicate and i have noticed her faint once or twice but it is so hard to tell with these fashions whether a girl is robust or not i confess that when mary does her best with my whalebone and laces to give me back the twentyinch waist i used to have i sometimes feel like fainting myself she smiled ruefully and charlotte felt another twinge of anxiety fashion was all very well but at carolines age she should not care so much i have not seen a great deal of eloise lately caroline continued i think perhaps this inclement weather does not agree with her that would not be hard to understand it has been distressingly cold she is quite lovelyshe has the whitest skin and the darkest eyes you ever saw and she moves marvelously she reminds me of lord byrons poemshe walks in beauty like the night she smiled as fragile and as tender as the moon did he say that about the moon no i did anyway you will meet her and judge for yourself her parents both died when she was very youngno more than eight or nineand she and her brother were cared for by an aunt now that the aunt is dead also the two of them live here most of the time and only go back to the country house for a few weeks at a time or perhaps a month mrs spencerbrown described her as a child charlotte said caroline dismissed it oh thats just minas turn of phrase eloise must be twentytwo or more and tormod her brother is three or four years older at least she reached for the bell and rang it for the maid to bring her coat i think its about time we should leave i would like you to meet ambrosine before there are a number of callers charlotte was afraid the matter of the locket was going to be raised again but she did not argue she pulled her own coat closed and followed obediently it was a very short walk and ambrosine charrington wel shycomed them with an enthusiasm that startled charlotte she was a striking woman with fine features under a smooth skin only faintly wrinkled around the corners of the mouth and eyes her cheekbones were high and swept wide to wings of dark hairshe surveyed charlotte with interest and gradual approval as her instinct recognized another highly individual woman how do you do mrs pitt she said with a charming smile im delighted you have come at last your mother has spoken of you so often charlotte was surprised she had not realized caroline would be willing to talk about her socially at all let alone often it gave her an unexpected feeling of pleasure even pride and she found herself smiling more than the occasion called for the room was large and the furnishings a little austere com shypared to the ornate and bulging interiors that were currently popular there were none of the usual stuffed animals in glass cases or arrangements of dried flowers no embroidered samplers or elaborate antimacassars across the backs of chairs by compari shyson with most withdrawing rooms it seemed airy almost bare charlotte found it rather pleasing except for the phalanxes of photographs on the farthest wall covering the top of the grand piano and spread along the mantelshelf they all appeared to include rather elderly people and had been taken years before to judge from the fashions obviously they were not of ambrosine and her children but rather of a generation earlier charlotte presumed the man who appeared in them so frequently was her husbanda vain man she decided from the number of his pictures there were some halfdozen highly exotic weapons displayed above the fireplace ambrosine caught charlottes glance horrible arent they she said but my husband insists his younger brother was killed in the first afghan war fortyfive years ago and hes set them up there as a sort of memorial the maids are always complaining that they are the perfect devil to clean collect dust like mad above the fire charlotte looked up at the knives in their ornamental sheaths and scabbards and had nothing but sympathy for the maids quite ambrosine said fervently observing her expression and they are in excellent condition bronwen swears someone will wind up with their throat cut one of these days although of course it is not her task to clean them heathen weapons she calls them and i suppose they are bronwen caroline was at a loss my maid ambrosine invited them all to be seated with a gesture of her arm the excellent one with the reddish hair i thought her name was louisa caroline said i daresay it is ambrosine arranged herself gracefully on the chaise longue but the best maid i ever had was called bronwen and i dont believe in changing a good thing i always call my personal maids bronwen now also it saves confusion there are dozens of lilies and roses and marys there was no argument to this and charlotte was obliged to turn and look out of the window in order to hide her amusement finding a really good maid is quite an achievement caro shyline said pursuing the subject so often those who are compe shytent are less than honest and those whom one can really trust are not as efficient as one would like my dear you sound most despondent ambrosine said with sympathy a current misfortune im really not quite sure caroline plunged on have missed a small article of jewelry and i dont know whether it is a theft or merely mischance it is a wretched feeling i dont wish to be unjust when the whole affair may be quite accidental was it of value ambrosine inquired with a little frown not especially except that it was a gift from my motherinlaw and she might be hurt that i had been careless with it or flattered that of all your pieces someone chose that to take ambrosine pointed out caroline laughed without pleasure i hadnt even thought of that im obliged to you if she makes any observation i must say that to her i still think you may have mislaid it mama charlotte said trying to allow the subject to die it may well turn up in a day or two if you let grandmama think it has been stolen she will begin to accuse people and she will never let thematter rest until someone is blamed caroline caught the sharpness in her voice and perceived the danger she was inviting upon herself you are quite right she said it would be wiser to say nothing people with not enough business of their own to mind will be quick enough to mind yours if you start word of things like theft charlotte added for good measure i see your estimate of peoples charity matches my own mrs pitt ambrosine reached for the bell cord and pulled it i hope you will take tea as well as a good maid i also have an excellent cook i employed her for her ability with cakes and desserts she makes the most dreadful soups but then since i dont care for soup i am perfectly happy to overlook that my husband is extremely fond of soup caroline remarked absently so is mine ambrosine said but one cannot have everything the parlormaid came and ambrosine sent her for the tea you know mrs pitt ambrosine continued your obser shyvations about other peoples curiosity are peculiarly apposite i have had the disturbing sensation lately that someone is taking a marked interest in menot a kindly one but purely inquisitive if anything i have the feeling it is malicious charlotte sat perfectly still she was conscious of carolines body stiffening beside her how distressing charlotte said after a moment have you any notion who it may be no none at all that is what makes it so unpleasant it is merely a repeated impression the door opened and the maid came in with tea and at least a dozen different kinds of cakes and tarts many of them with whipped cream thank you ambrosine said eyeing one particular fruit pastry with satisfaction perhaps i am being fanciful she went on as the maid disappeared again i daresay there is no one with as much interest in me as such a thing supposes caroline opened her mouth as if to speak then said nothing after all you are quite right charlotte said hurrying to fill the silence her eyes on the tea table you have a most accom shyplished cook i vow i should grow out of every garment i possess if i were to live with such a woman ambrosine observed carolines still slender figure i hope that does not mean you will not call upon me again charlotte smiled on the contrary it means that i shall now have two reasons for calling instead of one she accepted her tea and an enormous cream sponge no one bothered with the polite fiction of taking bread and butter first they had been at tea only a matter of five minutes or so when the door opened again and a grayhaired middleaged man came in charlotte immediately recognized the shortnosed rather se shyvere face from the photographs this man was even wearing the same kind of stiffwinged collar and black tie as the man in the photographs he had to be lovell charrington introductions proved her correct no sandwiches he looked at the plates critically didnt know you would be joining us ambrosine replied i can always call cook for some if you wish please i cannot imagine that all this cream is good for you my dear and we should not restrict our visitors to indulging in your somewhat eccentric tastes oh we are equally eccentric charlotte answered without thinking her impulse was to side with ambrosine moreover she had quite enough bread at home i am delighted to be able to enjoy them in such happy company ambrosine rewarded her with a smile of satisfaction and surprise if you will not be offended by my saying so mrs pitt you remind me of my own daughter ottilie she enjoyed things so much and was not averse to saying so charlotte did not know whether it would be all right to admit knowing of the girls death or if it might seem as if she had been talking of the charringtons affairs too familiarly she was saved from her dilemma by lovell our daughter has passed on mrs pitt im sure you will understand if i say that we find it distressing to discuss since charlotte had not spoken she thought his manner less than courteous but for ambrosines sake she restrained herself of course she said i myself seldom speak of those i have lost for the same reason to her satisfaction he looked a little taken aback obviously he had not considered the possibility that she might have feelings on the subject quite he said hastily quite charlotte deliberately took another cream cake and was forced to spend the next few moments concentrating on eating it without dropping the cream down her bosom conversation became polite and stilted they discussed the weather what the newspapers were reporting in the society columns and the possibilityor in lovells opinion the impossibilityof there being any lost treasures in africa such as those that were portrayed in mr rider haggards novel king solomons mines published the previous year nonsense he said firmly dangerous imagination fellow ought to employ his time to better purpose ridiculous way for a grown man to earn his living spinning fantasies to beguile foolish women and girls who are susceptible enough to take him seriously overstimulating the minds of such persons is bad for their health and their morals i think it is an excellent way to employ oneself said a young man of perhaps twentynine or thirty coming into the room with a wave of his arm he helped himself to the last cake ate it almost in one gulp and flashed a dazzling smile at charlotte then at caroline he picked up the teapot to test if there was anything still in it harms no one and entertains thousands brings a little color into lives that might ordinarily never have a dream worth indulging without dreams their lives might be unbearable never heard such nonsense lovell replied panders to overheated imaginations and to greed if you wish for tea inigo please ring for the maid and request it instead of swinging the pot around like that that is what servants are for i dont think you have been introduced to mrs pitt inigo looked at charlotte of course not if i had i would most certainly have remembered how do you do mrs pitt i will not ask how you are you are obviously in excellent health and spirits indeed i am charlotte tried to keep up the front of dignity she knew caroline would wish if not expect and if you said less for yourself i should find it hard to believe she added oh his eyebrows went up with evident pleasure a woman of opinions you would have liked my sister tillie she always had opinions a few rather odd ones mind but she always knew what she thought and usually said so inigo lovells face was deeply flushed your sister has passed away kindly remember that and do not speak of her in that flippant and overfamiliar manner he swung round i apologize mrs pitt such indelicacy must be embarrassing to you his tone lacked conviction in his mind charlotte was already hardly better than his son on the contrary charlotte settled more comfortably into her seat i find it very easy to understand how one still thinks with great vividness and affection of those whom one has loved we all bear our losses in different wayshowever is easiest for usand afford others the same comfort lovells face paled but before he could reply caroline stood up setting her cup and saucer on the table it has been most charming she said to no one in particular but we have other calls it would be only civil to make i trust you will excuse us my dear ambrosine i do hope i shall see you again soon good afternoon mr charrington inigo lovell rose from his chair and bowed good afternoon mrs ellison mrs pitt so delightful to have made your acquaintance inigo opened the door for them and followed them out into the hall im so sorry if i caused you distress mrs pitt he said with a little frown it was not my intention in the least of course not charlotte answered him and i think from what i have heard of her that i should have liked your sister very much indeed i certainly find your mother the most comfortable person i have met for a long time comfortable he said in amazement most people find her quite the opposite i suppose it must be a matter of taste but i assure you i like her a great deal inigo smiled broadly all the anxiety slipping out of his face he shook her hand warmly the footman was helping caroline with her coat she fastened it and charlotte accepted hers a moment later they were outside in the sharp march wind an open carriage rattled by and the man inside raised his hat to them caroline had a brief impression of a dark elegant head with thick hair curving close to the nape of his neck sleek and beautiful and of dark level eyes she caught only a glimpse and then the carriage had passed but it woke a memory in her so sharp it left her tingling the man in the carriage was paul alaric the frenchman who had lived in paragon walk only a hundred yards from emily and who had stirred so many pas shysions that summer of the murders poor selena had been so obsessed with him it had almost deranged her against all her common sense charlotte herself had felt at shytracted by his cool wit the charm that seemed almost unconscious and the very fact that they all knew so little about himno family no past no social category in which to fit him even emily with all her grace and elan had not been entirely impervious could it really have been he just now she turned and found caroline standing very straight her head high the wind whipping color into her cheeks do you know him charlotte asked incredulously caroline began to walk again her steps sharp on the pavement slightly she replied he is monsieur paul alaric charlotte felt the heat flood through herso it was he he is acquainted with quite a few residents in the place caroline continued charlotte was about to add that it seemed beyond question that caroline was one of them then without being sure why she changed her mind he seems to be a person of leisure she said instead it was a pointless remark but suddenly sensible words had left her he has business in the city caroline walked more rapidly and further conversation was whipped away from them by the wind twenty or thirty yards on they were at the lagardes front entrance are they french charlotte whispered under her breath as the door opened and they were conducted into the hall no caroline whispered as the parlormaid went to an shynounce them greatgrandfather or something came over at the time of the revolution the revolution that was nearly a hundred years ago charlotte whispered back then fixed her face in an appropriately expectant expression as they were ushered into the withdrawing room all right then it was further back i have heard so much history from your grandmother i am tired of it caroline snapped good afternoon eloise may i present my daughter mrs pitt she continued with a total change of voice and expression without drawing breath the girl who faced charlotte was indeed as caroline had said darkly lovely with the translucence of moonlight on water her hair was soft and full without sheen quite unlike charlottes which gleamed like polished wood and was hard to keep pinned because of its weight how delightful of you to call eloise stepped back smiling and by implication inviting them to sit down will you take tea it was a little late and perhaps it was merely a courtesy that she asked thank you but we would not wish to be of inconvenience caroline said declining in an accepted formula it would be less than flattering to say that they had already taken tea elsewhere she turned to the mantelshelf what a delightful picture i dont believe i have noticed it before personally charlotte would not have given it houseroom but tastes varied do you like it eloise looked up a flicker of amusement in her face i always think it makes the house look rather dark and it isnt really like that at all but tormod is fond of it so i let it hang there that is your country house charlotte asked the obvious question because there was nothing else she could think of to say and she knew that the reply would provide material for several minutes polite discussion they were still on the subject of town and country differences when the door opened and a young man came in who charlotte knew immediately must be eloises brother he had the same mass of dark hair and the same wide eyes and pale skin the resemblance in features was not so great however he had a higher brow with the hair sweeping away from it in a broad wave and his nose was rather aquiline his mouth was wide quick to laugh and charlotte judged quick to sulk now he came forward with easy quite natural grace mrs ellison what a pleasure to see you he slipped his arm around eloise i dont believe i have met your companion my daughter mrs pitt caroline smiled back mr tormod lagarde he bowed very slightly welcome to rutland place mrs pitt i hope we shall see you often that is most kind of you charlotte replied tormod sat next to eloise on a broad sofa i expect i shall call upon my mother more often as the spring approaches charlotte added im afraid the winter is very grim he answered one feels far more like remaining close to the fire than venturing out to go visiting in fact we quite often retreat altogether to our house in the country and simply close the doors all january and february eloises face warmed as if at some sweet and lingering memory she said nothing but charlotte imagined she could see reflected in her eyes the light of christmases with trees and lanterns pinecone fires and hot toast and long happy companionship too easy to need the communication of words tormod fished in his pocket and brought out a small package here he held it out to eloise to replace the one you lost she took it looking up at him then down at the little parcel in her hands open it he commanded its not so very special slowly she obeyed anticipation and pleasure in her face inside the parcel was a small silverhandled buttonhook thank you dear she said gently that really was most thoughtful of you especially since it might so easily have been my own fault i shall feel dreadfully guilty now if the other one turns up and i had merely been careless all the time she looked over at charlotte apology and a touch of embarrassment in her face i lost my old one that i had for years i think it went from my reticule but i suppose i might have put it some shywhere else and forgotten charlottes desire to know was stronger than her good judg shyment to keep silent on the subject you mean you think it could have been stolen she asked feigning surprise tormod dismissed it these things happen sometimes its an unpleasant thought but one must face realityservants do steal from time to time but since it appears to have happened in someone elses house it is far better to say nothing it would be in very poor taste to embarrass a friend by letting it be known besides as eloise says it may turn upalthough i doubt it now caroline cleared her throat nervously but should theft be condoned she said a little hesitantly i meanis that right tormod was still casual his voice light he smiled at her with a little twist of regret i suppose not if one knew for sure who it was and had proof that it had occurred he said but we havent all we would do is rouse suspicion and perhaps quite unjustly better to let the matter lie once one begins an inquiry into evil one can start a train of events that is very difficult to stop a silverplated buttonhook is hardly worth all the anger and fear and the doubts that inquiry would raise i think you are quite right charlotte said quickly after all a case of something missingone has no idea whereis very different from actually knowing beyond question that a particular person has stolen it how wise of you tormod flashed her a rapid smile justice is not always best served by shouting thief before caroline could defend her view the maid announced another caller mrs denbigh maam she said to eloise shall i say that you will receive her eloises face tightened almost imperceptibly in another light farther from the window the change in her expression might not have been visible at all yes of course beryl please do amaryllis denbigh was the sort of woman charlotte felt quite uncomfortable with she came into the room with assurance carrying with her an air of always having been successful always valued she was not beautiful but there was an appeal in her face of wide eyes and slightly too round curved lips the innocence of an adolescent who does not yet understand her own potential for excitement and hunger she had an abundance of fair wavy hair that was dressed just casually enough not to look unnatural it required a very skilled maid to achieve such an effect her dress was undeniably expensivenot in the least ostentatious but charlotte knew how much it cost to have a dressmaker cut it so cleverly that the bust looked just that much fuller the waist those few inches smaller introductions were formal and very complete amaryllis weighed charlotte to an exactness and dismissed her she turned to tormod shall you be coming to mrs wallaces soiree on thursday i do so hope so i have heard the pianist she has invited is quite excellent im sure you would enjoy it and eloise too of course she added as an afterthought a politeness without conviction charlotte noted the tone in her voice and drew conclusions of her own i think we will tormod replied he turned to eloise you have nothing else prepared have you dear no not at all if this pianist is good it will be a great pleasure i only hope they do not all make such a noise we cannot hear him my dear you cannot expect conversation to cease just to listen to a pianistnot at a soiree amaryllis said gently after all it is primarily a social event and the music is merely a diversion a pleasantness and of course it gives people some shything to talk about without having to think too hard for a suitable subject some people are so awkward you know she smiled at charlotte do you not think so mrs pitt indeed i am sure of it charlotte agreed frankly some cannot think of anything suitable to say at all while others speak far too much and at all the wrong times i greatly like a person who knows how to be silent comfortably especially when there is good music playing amaryllis face tightened she ignored the implication do you play mrs pitt she asked no charlotte answered blandly i regret i do not do you amaryllis regarded her chillingly i paint she replied i prefer it so much less intrusive i think one can look or not as one chooses ohshe widened her eyes and bit her lipim so sorry eloise i had forgotten that you play i did not mean you of course you have never played at anyones soiree no i think i should be very nervous eloise said although it would be an honor to be asked but i rather think i should be irritated if everyone talked so much that no one else could listen she spoke with some feeling music should be respected not treated like street sounds or wallpaper no more than a sort of background then one becomes bored with it without ever having appreciated its beauty amaryllis laughed a high pretty sound that irked charlotte unreasonablyperhaps because she would have liked to have such a laugh and knew she did not how philosophical you are amaryllis said brightly i warn you my dear if you start saying things like that at a soiree you will become most unpopular people will not know what to make of you charlotte gave her mother a sharp nudge on the ankle and as caroline bent to touch the place thinking something had fallen on her charlotte pretended to assume she was preparing to leave may i help you mama she offered then rose and gave caroline her arm caroline glanced at her i am not yet in need of assistance charlotte she said crisply but although the idea of sitting down again out of contrariness lingered quite clearly in her eyes after a moment she excused herself politely and a few minutes later they were both outside in the street again i dislike mrs denbigh charlotte said with feeling very much that was obvious caroline pulled her collar up then she smiled actually so do i it is completely unfair because i have no idea why but i find her most irritating she has set her cap at tormod lagarde charlotte remarked by way of partial explanation and she is being very bold about it i do you think so of course she is dont tell me you had not noticed of course i have noticed caroline shivered but i have i seen a great many more women set their caps at men than you have my dear and i had not thought amaryllis was particularly clumsy in fact i think she is really quite patient i still do not care for her that is because you like eloise and you cannot think what will happen to her if tormod marries since amaryllis obviously is not fond of her perhaps eloise herself will marry and that will solve the problem then it would be a great deal cleverer of amaryllis to find a suitable young man for eloise than to sit there disparaging her wouldnt it it should not be hardshe is perfectly charming what is the matter mama you keep hunching your shoulders as if you were in a draft but it is quite sheltered here is there anyone behind us charlotte turned no why were you expecting someonet no noii just have the feeling that someone is watching us for goodness sake dont stare like that charlotte you will have people think we are watching them trying to see in through their curtains what people charlotte forced herself to smile in an effort to hide her anxiety for caroline there isnt anyone she said reasonably dont be silly caroline snapped there is always someonea butler or a maid drawing curtains or a footman at a door then it is hardly anything to matter charlotte dismissed it with words but in her mind she did not find it so easy the sensation of being watchednot casually observed by someone about another duty but deliberately and systematically watched was extremely unpleasant surely caroline was imagining it why should anyone do such a thing what possible reason would there be caroline had quickened her pace and now she did so again they were walking so rapidly charlottes skirts whipped round her ankles and she was afraid that if she did not look where she was going she would trip over one of the paving stones and fall headlong caroline whirled around the gatepost and up the steps to her own front door she was there before the footman had seen them to open it and was obliged to wait she shifted from foot to foot and once actually turned to stare back into the road mama has someone accosted you in the street charlotte asked touching her arm no of course not its just she shook herself angrily i have the feeling that i am not alone even when it would appear in every way that i am there is someone i cannot see but who i am perfectly sure can see me the door opened and caroline swept in with charlotte behind her close the curtains please martin she said to the footman all of them maam his voice rose in surprise it was still daylight for another two hours and perfectly pleasant yes please in all the rooms that we shall occupy caro shyline removed her coat and hat and gave them to him charlotte did the same in the withdrawing room grandmama was sitting in front of the fire well she surveyed them up and down is there any news of what mama caroline asked turning toward the table of anything girl how can i ask for news of something if i do not know what it is if i already knew it it would not be news to me would it it was a fallacious argument but charlotte had long ago discovered the futility of pointing that out to her we called upon mrs charrington and miss lagarde she said i found them both quite delightful mrs charrington js eccentric grandmamas voice was tart as if she had bitten into a green plum that pleased me charlotte was not going to be bested she was very civil and after all that is the important thing and miss lagardewas she civil too she is far too shy for her own good the girl seems incapable of flirting with any skill at all grandmama snapped shell never find herself a hus shyband by wandering around looking fey however pretty her face men dont marry just a face you know which is as well for most of us charlotte was equally acerbic looking at grandmamas slightly hooked nose and heavylidded eyes the old woman affected not to have understood her she turned toward caroline icily you had a caller while you were out indeed caroline was not particularly interested it was quite usual for at least one person to visit during the afternoon just as she and charlotte had visited others it was part of the ritual i expect they left a card and maddock will bring it in presently dont you even wish to know who it was grandmama sniffed staring at carolines back not especially it was that frenchman with his foreign manners i forget his name she chose not to remember because it was not english but he has the best tailor i have seen in thirty years caroline stiffened there was absolute silence in the room so thick one imagined one could hear carriage wheels two streets away indeed caroline said again her voice unnaturally casual there was a catch in it as if she were bursting to say more and forcing herself to wait so her words would not fall over each other did he say anything of course he said something do you think he stood there like a fool caroline kept her back to them she took one of the daffodils out of the bowl shortened its stalk and replaced it anything of interest who ever says anything of interest these days grandmama answered miserably there arent any heroes anymore general gordon has been murdered by those savages in khartoum even mr disraeli is deadnot that he was a hero of course or a gentleman either for that matter but he was clever everyone with any breeding is gone was monsieur alaric discourteous charlotte asked in surprise he had been so perfectly at ease in paragon walk good manners innate in his nature even if she had frequently seen humor disconcertingly close beneath no grandmama admitted grudgingly he was civil enough but he is a foreigner he cannot afford not to be civil if hed been born forty years earlier i daresay he would have made something of himself in spite of that there isnt even a decent war now where a man could go and prove his worth at least there was the crimea in edwards timenot that he went crimea is in the black sea charlotte pointed out i dont see what it has to do with us you have no patriotism grandmama accused no sense of empire thats what is wrong with the young you are not great did monsieur alaric leave any message caroline turned around at last her face was flushed but her voice was perfectly steady now were you expecting one grandmama squinted at her caroline breathed in and out again before replying since i do not know why he called she said walking over tothe door i wondered if he left some word i think ill go and ask maddock and she slipped out leaving charlotte and the old lady alone charlotte hesitated should she ask the questions that were teeming in her head the old womans sight was poor she had not seen carolines body the rigid muscles the slow controlled turn of her head still her hearing was excellent when she chose to listen and her mind was still as sharp and as worldly as it had ever been but charlotte realized that there was not anything grandmama could tell her she had not already guessed for herself i think i will go and see if mama can spare the carriage to take me home she said after a moment or two before dark as you please grandmama sniffed i dont really know what you came forjust to go calling i suppose to see mama charlotte answered twice in one week charlotte was not disposed to argue goodbye grandrnama it has been very nice to see you looking in such good health the old lady snorted full of yourself she said dryly never did know how to behave just as well you married beneath you youd never have done in society all the way home rolling smoothly through the streets in her fathers carriage charlotte was too consumed by her thoughts to take proper pleasure in how much more comfortable the carriage was than the omnibus it was painfully apparent that carolines interest in paul alaric was not in the least casual charlotte could recall too many of the idiotic details of her own infatuation with her brotherinlaw dominic before she had met thomas to be deceived by this she knew just that affectation of indifference the clenching of the stomach in spite of all one could do the heart in the throat when his name was mentioned when he smiled at her when people spoke of them in the same breath it was all incredibly silly now and she burned with embarrassment at the memory but she recognized the same feeling in others when she saw it she had seen it before for paul alaric more than once she understood carolines stiff back the overly casual voice the pretense of disinterestthat was not strong enough to stop her from almost running to maddock to find out if alaric had left a message it had to be paul alarics picture in the locket no wonder caroline wanted it back it was not some anonymous admirer from the past but a face that might be recognized by any resident of rutland place even the bootboys and the scullery maids and there was no possible way she could explain it there could be no reason but one why she should carry a locket with his picture by the time charlotte reached home she had made up her mind to tell pitt something about it and to ask his advice simply because she could not bear the burden alone she did not tell him whose picture was in the locket do nothing he said gravely with any luck it has been lost in the street and has fallen down a gutter somewhere or else it has been stolen by someone who has sold it or passed it on and it will never be seen again in rutland place or by anyone who has the faintest idea who it belonged to or whose picture it is but what about mama she said urgently she is obviously flattered and attracted by this man and she doesnt intend to send him away pitt weighed his words carefully watching her face not for a little while perhaps but she will be discreet he saw char shylotte draw breath to argue and he closed his hand over hers my dear there is nothing you can do about it and even if there were you have no right to interfere shes my mother that makes you carebut it does not give you the right to step into her affairs which you are only guessing at i saw her thomas im perfectly capable of putting together what i saw this afternoon the locket and what will happen if papa finds out then do what you can to make sure that he doesnt warn her to be careful by all means and to forget the locket but dont do anything more you will only make it worse she stared back at him into his light clever eyes this time he was wrong he knew a lot about people in general butshe knew more about women caroline needed more than a warning she needed help and whatever pitt said charlotte would have to give it she lowered her eyes ill warn herabout pursuing the locket she agreed he understood her better than she knew he would not press her into a position where she was obliged to lie he sat back resigned but unhappy pitt was too busy with his own duties to harass his mind with anxieties over caroline previous cases had led him into associa shytion with people of similar positions in society but the circum shystances in which he had seen them had necessarily been unusual and he was aware that these past associations gave him little real understanding of their beliefs or their values he understood even less of what might be acceptable to them in their relationships and what would cause irreparable harm pitt felt it was dangerous for charlotte to get mixed up in the rutland place thefts but he knew that most of his reaction sprang from his emotions rather than his reason he was afraid she would be hurt now that she had moved from cater street and left her parents home she had absorbed new beliefs albeit some of them unconsciously and she had forgotten many as shysumptions that used to be as natural to her as they still were to her parents she had changed and he was afraid that she had not realized how muchor that she had expected them to have changed also her loyal fiercely compassionate but blind inter shyference could so easily bring pain to them all but he did not know how to persuade her from it she was too close to see he was sitting at his brown wood desk at the police station looking at an unpromising list of stolen articles his mind on charlotte when a sharpnosed constable came in his face pinched eyes bright death he said simply pitt raised his head indeed not an uncommon occurrence unfortunately why does this one interest us his mind pic shytured the alleys and creaking piles of rotting timber of the rookeries the slums that backed onto the solid and spacious houses of the respectable people died in them every day every hour some died from cold some from disease or starvation a few from murder pitt could afford to concern himself only with the last and not always with them whose he asked woman the constable was as sparing with words as with his money wealthy woman good address married pitts interest quickened murder he said half hopeful and ashamed of it murder was a double tragedynot only for the victim and those who cared for her but for the murderer also and whoever loved or needed or pitied the tormented soul but it was less gray less inherently part of a problem too vast to begin than death from street violence or poverty which was innate in the very pattern of the rookeries dont know the constables eyes never moved from pitts face need to find out could be pitt fixed him with a cold stare who is dead he demanded and where a mrs wilhelmina spencerbrown the constable answered levelly a faint ring of anticipation in his voice at last of number eleven rutland place pitt sat up did you say rutland place harris yes sir know it do you sir he added the sir only to keep from being impertinent usually he did without such extra niceties but pitt was his superior and he wanted to work on this job even if it was not murder and it probably was not a death in society was still a great deal more interesting than the runofthemill crimes he would otherwise employ himself with all too seldom did he find a genuine mystery no pitt answered him dourly i dont he stood up and pushed his chair back scraping it along the floor but i imag rutland place ine we are about to what do you know about mrs wilhelmina spencerbrown not a lot harris fell in behind him as they collected hats coats and mufflers and strode down the police station steps into the march wind well pitt demanded keeping his eye on the thoroughfare in hope of seeing an empty cab harris doubled his step to keep up early thirties very respectable nothing said against her still he said hopefully there wouldnt be in that sort of address plenty of servants plenty of money by the looks although looks dont always mean much known those as had three servants bombazine curtains and nothing but bread and gravy on the table all appearance did mrs spencerbrown have bombazine curtains pitt inquired moving sideways sharply as a carriage sped by him splattering a mixture of mud and manure onto the pavement he swore under his breath and then yelled cabbie furiously at the top of his lungs harris winced dont know sir only just got the report havent been there myself do you want a cab sir of course i do pitt glared at him fool he muttered under his breath then was obliged to take it back the next moment when harris leapt into the street with alacrity and stopped a hansom almost in its tracks a moment later they were sitting in the warmth of the cab moving at a sharp trot toward rutland place how did she die pitt continued poison harris replied pitt was surprised how do you know doctor said so doctor called us got one of them new machines what new machines what are you talking about telephones sir machine what hangs on the wall and i know what a telephone is pitt said sharply so the doctor called on a telephone who did he call we havent got one friend of his who lives just round the corner from usa mr wardley this mr wardley sent his man with the message i see and the doctor said she was poisoned yes sir that was his opinion anything else not yet sir poisoned this afternoon parlormaid found her pitt pulled out his watch it was quarter past three oclock what time he asked about quarter past two or just after that would be when the maid went to inquire whether they would be expecting callers for tea or if mrs spencerbrown was going out herself pitt thought he knew enough about the habits of society to be familiar with the afternoon routine a few moments later they were in rutland place and pitt looked with interest at the quiet gracious facades of the houses set back a little from the pavement areaways immaculate some shaded by trees windows catching the light a carriage was drawn up outside one and a footman was handing a lady down closing the door behind her farther along another was leaving harness glinting in the sun one of those houses was carolines pitt had never been there it was a tacit understanding that such a call would be comfortable for neither the occupants nor pitt they met occasionally but on neutral territory where no compari shysons could be made even though it would be the last thing either had intended the hansom stopped and they climbed out and paid the fare eleven harris said as they mounted the step the door opened even before they reached it and a footman hastened them in as forcefully as was consistent with his dignity one did not desire police to wait on the doorstep so the whole neighborhood was aware one had been obliged to call them in it was more than his promotion was worth to be clumsy in the handling of such a matter inspector pitt pitt announced himself quietly conscious of the presence of tragedy whatever its nature turned out to be he was used to death but it never failed to move him and he still did not know what to say in the face of loss no words could make any difference he hated to sound trite or unfeeling yet feared he often did simply because he felt it from the outside he was an intruder a reminder of the darkest possibilities the ugliest explanation yes sir the footman said formally youll be wanting to speak to dr mulgrew no doubt a carriage had been sent for mr spencerbrown but he is not home yet do you know where he is pitt asked merely as a matter of course yes sir he went to the city as usual he has several interests i believe he is on the board of directors of a number of important business houses and a newspaper if you will come this way sir i will show you tef the morning room where dr mulgrew is waiting pitt and harris followed him along the hall toward the back of the house pitt eyed the furnishings and noted that a great deal of money had been invested in them whether purely for appearances sake or not if the spencerbrowns had any financial worries a few of the pictures on the staircase and hall would have given them an income the like of which pitt could have lived on for several years he had come to be a fair judge of the price of a painting in the course of his professional connections with the art world the morningroom fire was banked high and mulgrew stood so close to it pitt fancied he could smell his trousers singeing in the heat he was a stocky man with white heavy hair and a fine white mustache at present his eyes were watery and his nose distinctly red he sneezed loudly as they came in and withdrew a large handkerchief from his pocket cold he said in completely unnecessary explanation filthy thing no cure for it never has been names mulgrew i suppose you are the police yes sir inspector pitt and constable harris how do you do hate a spring coldnothing worse except a summer one i understand the parlormaid found mrs spencerbrown dead when she came to inquire about the afternoons arrangements pitt asked did the maid call you not precisely mulgrew put his handkerchief away she told the butler which is natural i suppose butler came to look for himself then sent the footman round for me only live round the corner i came straightaway wasnt a thing i could do poor creature was stone dead i used the telephone to call a friend of mine william wardley he sent a message to you he sneezed again and whipped out his handkerchief you ought to take something for that pitt said moving a step back hot drink and a mustard poultice no cure for it mulgrew shook his head and waved his hands no cure at all poison but i cant say what yetnot for certain you are quite sure pitt did not want to insult him by cj lestioning his competence too obviously couldnt be any form of illness mulgrew narrowed his eyes and looked at pitt closely couldnt take my oath on it but dont want to wait until i can before i tell you too late for you to see the scene if i do not a fool you know pitt found himself wanting to smile and had to force his mouth into a more appropriate expression thank you it seemed the most civil thing to say i take it you are mrs spencerbrowns regular physician yes naturally thats why they called me perfectly healthy woman usual small ailments from time to time but then havent we all had she any medicine that you know of which she might have taken in excess by accident nothing ive given her only ever had the occasional cold or fit of the vapors no cure for them you know just part of lifebest to put up with it gracefully a little sympathy if you can get it and a good sleep pitt again controlled his desire to smile at the man what about anyone else in the house heasked what oh doubt shed be stupid enough to take anyone elses medicine not a silly woman as women go but then i suppose she could have at that not a lot of sense when it comes to medicine most people he sneezed again fiercely gave mr spencerbrown some stuff for pain in the stomach though i think he brings it on himself for the most part tried to tell him that and got a flea in my ear for my trouble pain in his stomach pitt inquired diet mostly mulgrew shook his head and blew his nose eats all the wrong things no wonder it gives him a pain hes an odd fellowno use for that either he looked at pitt out of the corner his eye as if waiting to be argued with quite pitt said anything in this stuff of mr spencerbrowns that could have killed anyone if taken in excess mulgrew pulled a face i suppose soif you mixed the whole lot arid drank it no possibility of an overdose by accident if mrs spencerbrown had a stomach pain for example and thought she would relieve it by borrowing some of her husbands medicine told him to keep it locked in his cabinet but i suppose if he didnt she could have taken it still dont think she could take enough to kill herself by mistake instructions on the bottle box its a powder and yes of course there are dont go handing out poisons willynilly you know poisons has belladonna in it i see but we dont know what she died of yet or at least if we do you havent said so he watched hopefully mulgrew looked at him over the top of his handkerchief and blew his nose solemnly he fished in his pocket for another and failed to find one pitt pulled out his own spare and soberly handed it over thank you mulgrew took it youre a gentleman thats what makes me unhappy cant swear to it yet but ive a strong suspicion it was belladonna that killed her looks like it appar shyently she didnt complain of feeling unwell she had just come in from making an early call somewhere close by and she was dead within fifteen or twenty minutes of going into the withdraw shying room all pretty sudden no vomiting no blood not much in the way of convulsions you can see the dilated pupils dry mouthjust what youd expect from belladonna heart stops suddenly the reality hit pitt could almost feel it himself a woman dying alone the tightness of breath the pain the world receding leaving her to face the darkness the paralysis and the terror poor creature pitt said aloud surprising himself harris coughed in embarrassment mulgrews face softened and a flicker of appreciation showed in his eyes as he looked at pitt could have been suicide he said slowly at least in theory dont know of any reason but then one usually doesnt god only understands what private agonies go on behind the polite faces people show so help me dont there was nothing for pitt to say silence was the only decent answer he must remember to send harris to find mr spencerbrowns medicine box and see precisely how much was gone do you want to see her mulgrew asked after a moment i suppose i had better pitt said mulgrew walked slowly to the door and pitt and harris followed him out into the hall past the footman standing gravely to attention and into the withdrawing room curtains drawn in acknowledgment of death it was a large room with elegant palecovered chairs and sofas in a french style bowed legs and lots of carved wood there was much petitpoint embroidery in evidence artificial flowers made of silk in profuse arrangements and some pleasant pastoral watercolors in other circumstances it would have been a charming if rather overcrowded room wilhelmina spencerbrown was on the chaise longue her head back eyes wide mouth open there was none of the peace of sleep about her pitt walked over and looked without touching there was no spirit left no privacy to invade no feelings to hurt but still he regarded the woman as if there were he knew nothing about her whether she had been kind or cruel generous or mean brave or a coward but for himself as much as for her he wished to accord her some dignity have you seen all you wish he asked mulgrew without turning around yes mulgrew replied pitt eased her forward a little so she appeared to have been relaxing folded her hands although he could not unclench them and closed her eyes she was here only fifteen or twenty minutes before the maid found her like this he asked so she says so whatever it was it acted quickly he turned and looked around there was no glass or cup to be seen what did she eat or drink he frowned it doesnt seem to be here now did the maid remove anything asked her mulgrew shook his head she says not doesnt seem like a flighty girl dont see why she should lie too shocked when she found her mistress dead to think of tidying up i would imagine so she didnt take it here pitt concluded pity that would have made it easier well youll have to do a postmor shytem and tell me what it was and if possible how much and when naturally pitt looked at the body once more there was nothing else to learn from it there were no signs of force but then since she had been alone he would not have expected any she had taken the poison willingly whether or not she had known what it was remained to be discovered lets go back to the morning room he suggested i cant see anything here to help us gratefully they returned to the fire the house was not cold but there was a chill in the mind that communicated itself to the flesh what sort of woman was she pitt asked when the door was closed and dont hide behind professional confidences i want to know if this was suicide accident or murder and the sooner i do with the fewest questions of the family the easier it will be for them and theyll have enough to bear mulgrew pulled an unhappy face and blew his nose on pitts handkerchief i cant imagine an accident he said staring at the floor not a silly womanvery capable in her own way very quick noticed things least absentminded woman i ever knew pitt did not like the sort of question he had to ask but there was no way to avoid it or to make it sound any better do you know of any reason why she might have taken her own life no or id have said so she looks as if she was an attractive woman feminine delicate could she have had a lover i daresay if shed wanted one but if you mean do i know of one no i dont never heard any gossip about her whatsoevereven in confidence he gave pitt a very direct look what about her husband pitt pressed could he have had a woman a mistress could she have been driven to suicide over that alston mulgrews eyebrows shot up in surprise at the idea obviously it was one he had never considered before i should think it highly unlikely bloodless sort of creature still you never knowthe flesh is full of surprises nothing odder about the human animal than his predilections in that area im fiftytwo years old and ive been a doctor for twentyseven of them nothing ought to surprise mebut it does other uglier thoughts occurred to pitt thoughts about other menboys even children knowledge of such a thing might drive a wife to feel her life was insupportable but that was only a wild speculation then again there were other thoughts perhaps more likely things that charlotte had spoken about thefts a sense of being watched could this woman have been the thief and then when she realized the watcher knew about it have killed herself in the face of the overwhelming shame society was cruel it seldom forgave and it never ever forgot pitt was touched by a breath of misery as cold as january sleet poor woman if he discovered that to be the truth he would find some way to avoid saying so dont lay too much on what i say inspector mulgrew was looking at him soberly i dont mean anything by itjust generalizing pitt blinked thats all i took it for he said carefully just that nothing is certain when we come to such things there was a commotion out in the hall a rising and falling of voices and then the door burst open they all turned simultaneously knowing what it was and dreading it only harris stood straight up because he knew he would not have to say anything alston spencerbrown faced them bristling with shock and anger who the devil are you sir he glared at pitt and what are you doing in my house pitt accepted the anger for what it was but there was still no way of dealing with it that took away the hurt or the embarrass shyment afterward inspector pitt he said without pretense dr mulgrew called me as was his duty duty alston demanded swinging round to face mulgrew i have the duty in this house sir it is my wife who is dead he swallowed god rest her soul it is no concern of yours there is nothing you can do for her now she must have had a heart attack poor creature my butler tells me she had passed away before you even arrived i cannot think why you are still here except perhaps as a courtesy to inform me yourself for which i thank you you may feel yourself released from all obligation now both as physician and as friend i am obliged to you no one moved it was not her heart mulgrew said slowly then sneezed and fished for a handkerchief at least it was but not of itself he blew his nose im afraid it was caused by poison all the color drained from alstons face and for a moment he swayed on his feet pitt believed no man could act such a total and paralyzing shock poison alston spoke with difficulty what in heavens name do you mean im sorry mulgrew raised his head slowly to stare at him im sorry but she ate or drank something that poisoned her i think either belladonna or something very like it but i cant be sure yet i had to call the police i had no choice thats preposterous mina would never have he was lost for words all reason seemed to have betrayed itself and he abandoned the attempt to understand come mulgrew went toward him and eased him to the big padded chair pitt went to the door and called the footman for brandy it came pitt poured it and gave it to alston who drank without taste or pleasure i dont understand he repeated its ridiculous it cannot be true pitt hated the necessity that drove him to speak i presume you know of no tragedy or fear that could have driven your wife to such a state of distress he began alston stared at him what are you suggesting sir that my wife committed suicide howhow dare you his chin quivered with outrage pitt lowered his voice he could not look the man in the eyes can you imagine any circumstance in which your wife would take poison by accident sir he asked alston opened his mouth then closed it again the full impli shycation of the question reached him he let several moments tick by as he fought to see another answer no he said at length i cannot but then neither can i conceive of any reason whatsoever why she should take it knowingly she was a perfectly happy woman she had every shything she desired she was an excellent wife to me and i was happy to give her everything she wantedcomfort a place in society travel when she desired it clothes jewels whatever she wished and i am a most moderate man i have neither ill temper nor any excesses of nature wilhelmina was well liked and respected as indeed she deserved to be then the answer must be in something we do not yet know pitt put the reasoning as gently as he could i hope you will understand sir that we must persist until we discover what that is nono i dont understand why cant you let the poor woman rest in peace alston sat more upright and set the brandy glass down on the table nothing any of us can do can help her now we can at least let her memory rest with dignity in fact i demand it pitt hated this part he had expected it it was natural it was what most people would feel and do but that did not make it any easier it was familiar to him he had said his part more times than he could count but it was always the first time for the hearer im sorry mr spencerbrown but your wife died in circum shystances that have not yet been explained it may have been an accident although on your own word that seems unlikely it may have been suicide but no one knows of a reason why she should do such a thing it may have been murder he looked at alston and met his eyes i have to knowthe law has to know that is ridiculous alston said quietly too appalled for anger why on earth should anyone wish mina harm i have no idea but if anyone did then the person must be found alston stared at the empty glass in front of him all the answers were equally impossible to him and yet his intelligence told him one of them must be the truth very well he said but i would be obliged if you would remember that we are a house in mourning and observe what shyever decencies you can you may be accustomed to sudden death and she was a stranger to youbut i am not and she was my wife pitt had not warmed to him instinctivelyhe was a fussy deliberate little man where pitt was extravagant and impulsive but there was a dignity about him that commanded respect yes sir pitt said soberly i have seen death many times but i hope i never find myself accepting it without shock or a sense of grief for those who cared thank you alston stood up i presume you will wish to question the servants yes please they were duly brought in one by one but none of them could furnish anything beyond the simple facts that mina had arrived home on foot a few minutes after two oclock the footman had jet her in she had gone upstairs to her dressing room to prepare herself for the afternoon and a little after quarter past two the parlormaid had found her dead on the chaise longue in the withdrawing room where pitt and mulgrew had seen her no one knew of any reason why she should be distressed in any way and no one knew of anyone who wished her harm certainly no one knew of anything she had eaten or drunk since her breakfast which had been at midmorningfar too early for her to have ingested the poison when they were gone and harris had been dispatched to find the box of alstons stomach medicine and to perform a routine inspection of the kitchen and other premises pitt turned to mulgrew could she have taken something at whatever house she was visiting between luncheon and her return home he asked mulgrew fished for another handkerchief depends on what it was if im wrong and it wasnt belladonna then we start all over again but if it was then no i dont think so works pretty quickly cant see her taking it in another house walking all the way back here going upstairs tidying herself up coming down here and then being taken ill sorry for the time being youd better assume she took it here one of the servants pitt did not believe it in that case it should not be hard to find which one brought her something only why glad its your job not mine mulgrew looked at his hand shykerchief with disgust and pitt gave him his own best one thanks what are you going to do pitt tightened his muffler and thrust his hands into his pockets im going to pay a few calls he said harris will make arrangements to have the body removed the police surgeon will attend the autopsy of course i daresay youll need to help mr spencerbrown he looks pretty shaken yes mulgrew held out his hand and pitt shook it five minutes later he was outside on the street feeling cold and unhappy there was only one realistic step to take now and he could not reason himself out of it if charlotte was right there was something very unpleasant going on in rutland place petty theft and perhaps some person peeping and staring with a malicious interest in the private lives of others he could not overlook the likelihood that minas death was a tragic result of some part of this he knocked on carolines door with his hands shaking there was no pleasant way of asking her the questions he had to she would regard the questioning as intolerable prying and the fact that it was he who was doing it would make it worse not better the parlormaid did not know him yes sir she said in some surprise gentlemen did not usually call at this hour especially strangers and this looseboned untidy creature on the step with his windruffled hair and coat done up at sixes and sevens was certainly not expected will you please tell mrs ellison that mr pitt is here to see her he walked in past her before she had time to protest it is a matter of some urgency the name was familiar to her but she could not immediately place it she hesitated uncertain whether to allow him in any farther or to call one of the menservants for help well sir if you please to wait in the morning room she said dubiously certainly he was herded obediently out of the hallway into the silence of the back room and within moments caroline came in her face flushed thomas is something wrong with charlotte she demanded is she ill no no she is very well he put out his hands as if to touch her in some form of reassurance then remembered his place im afraid it is something quite different he finished all the anxiety slipped away from her then suddenly as if hearing a cry it returned and without anything said he knew she was afraid charlotte had told him about the locket with its betraying picture it would have been better police work if he had allowed her to go on thinking so since she might have made some slip but the words came to his tongue in spite of reasoning im afraid mrs spencerbrown has died this afternoon and the cause is not yet apparent oh dear caroline put her hand to her mouth in horror oh how dreadful does poor alstonmr spencerbrown know yes are you all right her face was very pale but she seemed perfectly composed would you like me to call the maid for you no thank you caroline sat on the sofa it was very civil of you to come to tell me thomas please sit down i dislike having to stare up at you like thatyou make me feel uncom shyfortable she took a breath and smoothed her skirts thoughtfully i presume from the fact that you are here it was not an entirely natural death was it an accident involving some kind of negligence perhaps he sat down opposite her we dont know yet but it was not a carriage accident or a fail if that is what you mean it appears to have been poison she was startled her eyes widened in disbelief poison thats horribleand ridiculous it must have been a heart attack or a stroke or something its just a hysterical maid with too many penny novels in her bedroom she stopped her hands clenched on her knees are you trying to say it was murder thomas i dont know what it was it could have beenor an accidentor suicide he was obliged to go on the longer he evaded it the more artificial it would seem the more pointed charlotte told me there have been a number of small thefts in the neighborhood and that you have had the unpleasant sensa shytion of being watched did she carolines body stiffened and she sat upright i would prefer she had kept my confidence but i suppose that is academic now yes several people have missed small articles and if you want to chastise me about not having called the police not at all he said more sharply than he intended he resented the criticism of charlotte but now that there is death involved i would like to ask your opinion as to whether you believe it possible mrs spencerbrown could have been the thief mina caroline opened her eyes in surprise at the thought it might be a reason why she should have killed herself he reasoned if she realized it was a compulsion she could not control caroline frowned i dont know what you meancould not control stealing is never right i can understand people who steal because they are in desperate poverty but mina had everything she needed and anyway none of the things that are missing are of any great value just little things silly things like a handkerchief a buttonhook a snuffboxwhy on earth should mina take those people sometimes take things because they cannot help it he knew even as he said it that explanation was useless her values had been learned in the nursery where good and evil are absolute and although life had taught her complexity in human relationships the right to property was one of the cornerstones of society and order the framework for all morality and its pre shycepts had never been questioned compulsions belonged to fear and hunger were even accepted if deplored where certain appetites of the flesh were concerned at least in mennot in women of course but compulsions of loneliness or inadequacy frustration or other gray pains without names were beyond consideration outside the arc of thought i still dont know what you mean she said quietly perhaps mina knew who it was who had been taking things she did give certain hints from time to time that she was aware of rather more than she felt she ought to say but surely no one would murder just to hide a few wretched little thefts i mean one would certainly dismiss a servant who had stolen but one might not prosecute because of the embarrassmentnot only to oneself but to ones friends no one wishes to have to make statements and answer questions but where murder is concerned one has no choicethe person is hanged the police see to it if we catch themyes pitt did not want to go into the morality of the penal system now there was no possibility of their agreeing on it they would not even be talking of the same things their visions would be of worlds that did not meet at the fringes of the imagination she had never seen a treadmill or a quarry never smelled bodies crawling with lice or sick with jail fever or seen fingers worked to blood picking oakumlet alone the death cell and the rope she sank deeper into the sofa shivering thinking of past terrors and sarahs death im sorry he said quickly realizing where her memories were there is no reason yet to suppose it was murder we must look first for reasons why she might have taken her own life it is a delicate question to ask but suicide is not a respecter of feelings do you have any idea if she had a romantic involvement of any nature that could have driven her to such despair at the back of his mind was beating charlottes conviction of the depth of carolines own affairs and he felt it so loudly he almost expected caroline to answer these thoughts instead of the rather prim words he actually spoke he felt guilty as if he had peeped in through someones dressingroom window if caroline was surprised she did not show it perhaps she had had sufficient warning to expect such a question if she had she replied i certainly have heard no word of it she must havebeen extraordinarily discreet unless what unless it was tormod she said thoughtfully please thomas you must realize i am giving voice to things that are merely the faintest of ideas just possibilitiesno more i understand that who is tormod tormod lagarde he lives at number three she had known him for some years and was certainly very fond of him is he married oh no he lives with his younger sister they are orphans what sort of a person is he she considered for a moment before replying weighing the kind of facts he would want to know he is very handsome she said deliberately in a romantic way there is something about him mat seems to be unattainable lonely he is just the sort of man women do fall in love with because one can never get close enough to him to spoil the illusion he remains forever just beyond ones reach amaryllis denbigh is in love with him now and there have been others in the past and does he pitt did not know how to phrase acceptably what he wanted to say she smiled at him making him feel suddenly clumsy and very young not so far as i know she answered and i believe if he did i should have heard society is very small you know especially in rutland place i see he felt his face grow warm so mrs spencerbrown might have been suffering an unrequited affection possibly what do you know about mr spencerbrown he asked moving on to the other major avenue for exploration is he the sort of man who might have become involved with other women and caused mrs spencerbrown sufficient grief if she discov shyered it to take her own life alston good gracious no i should find that almost impossi shyble to believe of course hes pleasant enough in his own way but certainly not possessed of any passion to spare she smiled bleakly poor man i imagine he is very upset by her deathby the manner of it as much as the event do clear it up as soon as you can thomas suspicion and speculation hurt more deeply than i think sometimes you know he did not argue who could say how much anyone under shystood the endless ripples of one pain growing out of another i will he promised can you tell me anything else he knew he ought to ask her about being watched and whether the watcher whoever it was could have known about mina and tormod lagarde if there was anything to know or if mina was the thief or the other great possibility if mina knew who was the thief and had been killed for it or yet another thought that mina was the thief and in her idle pickings had taken something so potentially dangerous for the owner that she had been killed in order to redeem it silently something like a locket with a telltale picture in it or more damning than that what else might she have stolen had she understood it and tried her hand at blackmailnot necessarily for money perhaps but for the sheer power of it he looked at carolines smooth face with its peachbloom cheeks the high bones and slender throat that reminded him of charlotte the long delicate hands so like hers he could not bring himself to ask no she said candidly unaware of the battle in him im afraid i cant at the moment again he let the opportunity go if you recall anything send a message and ill come straightaway he stood up as you say the sooner we know the truth the less painful it will be for everyone he walked over to the door and turned i dont suppose you know where mrs spencerbrown went early this afternoon she called upon someone close by because she walked carolines face tightened a little and she drew in her breath knowing the meaning oh didnt you know she went to the lagardes i was at the charringtons a little later and someone mentioned iti dont remember who now thank you he said gently perhaps that explains what happened poor woman and poor man please dont speak of it to anyone else it would be a decency to let it pass unknownif possible of course she took a step toward him thank you thomas charlotte was not nearly so gentle with caroline as pitt had been largely because she was afraid and the feeling was so raw and urgent inside her it overruled the caution with which her mind would otherwise have softened her words old memories came flooding back as if the shock and the disillusion had come yesterday the need to protect was stronger now though be shycause she could see everything so much more sharply and this time she was on the outside not numbed by her own emotions as she had been then mama i think we cannot reasonably place any hope in the idea that mina took poison by accident she said frankly as she sat in carolines withdrawing room the following day she had called as soon as she could after hearing the news from pitt gossip would fly very quickly mistakes might be made at a single encounter it would be very tragic to think the poor woman was wretched enough to take her own life she went on and even worse to believe someone else hated her enough to commit murder but closing our eyes to it will not remove the truth i have already told thomas the very little i know caroline said unhappily i even made some rather wild guesses that i wish now i had not i have probably been extremely unjust and rather less than honest charlotte added harshly you told him nothing about monsieur alarics picture being in your stolen locket caroline froze her fingers locked as if she had a sudden spasm only her eyes were hot scalding charlotte with contempt and did you caroline said slowly charlotte saw the anger in her but she was too concerned with the danger to spare time for hurt of course not she dismissed the question without bother shying to defend herself but that does not alter the fact that if you lost such a thing maybe someone else did too and if they did what has that to do with minas death caroline was still stiff with chill oh dont be so silly charlotte exploded with exasperation why was caroline being so obtuse if mina were the thief then she might have been murdered to recover the stolen article whatever it is and if she were the victim maybe it was some shything that mattered to her so much was so dangerous for her that she would rather die than face having it known there was silence a pan was dropped in the scullery and the dim echo of it penetrated the room very slowly the hard anger died out of carolines face as she understood charlotte watched her without speaking what could there be that was worse than death caroline said at last that is what we need to find out charlotte finally relaxed her body enough to sit properly in her chair and lean against the back thomas can find facts but it may take you or me to understand them after all you cannot expect the police to know the feelings of someone like mina something that would seem trivial to them might have been overwhelming to her it was not necessary to explain all the differences of class sex and the whole framework of customs and values that lay between pitt and mina both charlotte and caroline understood that all the sensitivity or imagination he was capable of would not guide him to see with minas eyes or recognize what it was that had accomplished her death i wish i didnt have to know caroline said wearily look shying away from charlotte i would so much rather bury her in peace i have no curiosity i can abide a mystery perfectly well i have learned that one is not very often happier for having found all the answers charlotte knew that at least half her mothers feeling sprang from a desire for privacy herself the need to keep her own secrets so much of the pleasure of a flirtation was that other people should see your conquest and this realization added to her fear caroline must be very enchanted with paul alaric if she was content for the relationship to be unobserved that meant it was far more than a game there was something in it that caroline wanted very much something more than admiration alone you cannot afford not to know charlotte said sharply wanting to shock her mother into fear acute enough to bring her to some sense if mina were the thief then she may still have your locket when her possessions are sorted out alstoq will find itor thomas will this had all the jarring effect she intended carolines face tightened into a mask she swallowed with difficulty if thomas finds it she began and then the enormity of it hit her oh dear heaven he might think i killed mina charlottehe couldnt think thatcould he the danger was too real for soft words and lies i dont suppose thomas himself would think so she an shyswered quietly but other police might there must have been some reason why mina died so we had better find it first before the locket turns up and anyone else has the chance to think anything at all but what caroline shut her eyes in desperation searching blindly for some explanation in the darkness of her mind we dont even know if it was suicide or murder i did tell thomas about tormod lagarde what about him thomas had not mentioned tormod or any possible connection that mina might have been in love with him caroline replied she definitely had an admiration for him it could have been more than we thought and she did go to the lagardes house just before she died perhaps she had some kind of interview with him and he rejected her in a way that she could not bear the idea of a married woman finding the end of such a relationship cause for suicide disturbed charlotte it was frighten shying and pathetic in a way that repelled her especially since she could not put caroline and paul alaric from her mind but then she did not know how disagreeable or empty the spencerbrowns marriage might have been she had no right to judge so many marriages were appropriateand even those born of love could sour she reproved herself for making too hasty a judgment an act she despised in others i suppose eloise lagarde might know charlotte said thoughtfully we shall have to be very tactful in inquiring no one would wish to believe they might have been the cause however unintentionally of someone elses taking her own life and eloise is bound to protect her brother the hope faded from carolines face yes they are very close i suppose it comes from having only each other when their parents died so young there are several other possibilities charlotte continued someone has been stealing perhaps they took from mina some lovers keepsake from tormod and the fear that it might become public was unbearable to her perhaps they even went to her and threatened to give it to alston if she did not give them moneyor whatever else they wished her imagination went on to thoughts that might drive a person into thinking of death perhaps it was another man who desired her and that was the price of his silence charlotte caroline sat bolt upright what a truly appall shying mind you have girl you would never have been capable of such thoughts when you lived in my house charlotte had on her tongue a few pointed words about caroline paul alaric and the question of morality but she refrained from speaking them some truly appalling things happen mama she said instead and i am a few years older than i was then and you also appear to have forgotten a great deal about the sort of people we are no man in rutland place would stoop to such a thing not so openly perhaps charlotte said quietly she had her own ideas about what was done but would be called by a pleasanter name but he doesnt have to be one of you why not a footmanor even a bootboy can you answer for them so surely oh dear god you cant be serious why not might not that have been enough to make mina or any other woman think of suicide might you not i caroline stared at her she let out her breath very slowly as if she had given up some fight i dont know i should think it is one of those things that would be so dreadful you could not know how you would feel unless it happened to you she moved her eyes to look down at the floor poor mina she so hated anything in the least unseemly something like that would haveshriveled her to the heart we dont know that that was what happened mamachar shylotte leaned forward and touched her there are other things it could have been perhaps mina was the thief and she could not face the shame of being discovered mina oh surely caroline began then stopped suspi shycion fighting incredulity in her face someone is charlotte pointed out soberly and consider shying where the articles were stolen from it doesnt appear that any one servant could have taken them but someone like mina could but she lost something herself caroline argued a snuffbox you mean she said she did charlotte corrected and it was her husbands not hers surely the most intelligent way to direct suspicion from oneself would be to take something of your own as well it does not take a great deal of brains to work that out i suppose not and you think this person who is watching knew about it it is a possibility caroline shook her head i find it terribly hard to believe do you find any of it easy yesterday mina was alive i know its all so ugly and useless and stupid sometimes it seems impossible to believe how so much can change irrevo shycably in a few hours charlotte tried another line of thought do you still have the sensation of being watched caroline looked startled ive no idea i havent even consid shyered it what does a peeping tom matter now compared with minas death it might have something to do with it im just trying to think of everything i can well none of it seems worth anyone dying over caroline stood up i think it is time we took luncheon i asked for it to be ready at quarter to one and it is past that now charlotte followed her obediently and they repaired to the breakfast room where the small table was set and the parlormaid ready to serve after the maid had gone charlotte began her soup at the same time trying to recall some of the conversation that had taken place when she had met mina a week ago mina had made a number of remarks about ottilie charrington and her death possibly even implying that there was something mysterious about it it was an ugly idea but once it was in charlottes mind it had to be explored mama mina had lived here for some time had she not yes several years caroline was surprised why then she probably knew everyone fairly well quite well enough that if she were the thief and took something important she might well understand its meaning dont you think such as what i dont know ottilie charringtons death she said a lot about it when she was herealmost as if she suspected there could be a secret something the family would rather were not known caroline put her soup spoon back in the bowl you mean that it was not natural charlotte frowned uncertainly not anything quite so awful as that but perhaps she was not as respectable as mr charrington at least would have liked mina said she was very highspirited and definitely implied she was also indiscreet maybe there would have been some sort of scandal if she had not died when she did caroline started to eat again breaking a piece of bread what an unpleasant thought but i suppose you are right she said mina did drop several hints that there was a lot more to know about ottilie than most people realized i never asked her because i am so fond of ambrosine i did not wish to encourage talk but mina did make me a little curious about theodora as well now that i come to remember charlotte was puzzled who is theodora theodora von schenck amaryllis denbighs sister shes a widow with two children i dont know her very well but i confess to liking her considerably charlotte found it hard to imagine liking anyone related to amaryllis indeed she said unaware how skeptical she sounded caroline smiled dryly they are not at all alike for a start theodora does not appear to have any desire to marry again even though she has very little means as far as anyone knows and of course people do know in fact when she came here a few years ago she had nothing but the house which she inher shyited from her parents now she has a new coat with a collar and trim right down to the ground i would swear is sable i remem shyber when she got it that mina remarked about it i am ashamed of myself but i cannot help wondering how she came by it a lover charlotte suggested the obvious then she is incredibly discreet it doesnt seem very discreet to wear a sable collar out of the blue with no explanation charlotte protested she can hardly be naive enough to imagine it would pass unnoticed i would wager every woman in rutland place could price the garments of every other woman to within a guinea and probably name the dressmaker who made them and the month in which they were cut oh charlotte thats unfair we are not soso illdisposed or so trivialminded as you seem to think not illdisposed mama but practical and with an excellent eye to value i suppose so caroline finished the last of her soup and the maid reappeared to serve the next dish the two women began to eat slowly it was a delicate fish and extremely well cooked at any other occasion charlotte would have enjoyed it theodora obviously has more money now than she used to caroline went on reluctantly mina once suggested that she did something quite appalling to earn it but i was sure at the time that she was only being facetious she had rather poor taste sometimes she looked up charlotte do you think perhaps it could have been true and mina knew something about it perhaps charlotte weighed the idea or perhaps on the other hand mina wasmerely being spitefulor saying something for the sake of making an effect the stupidest stories get started that way sometimes but mina wasnt like that caroline argued she very seldom talked about other people except as everybody does she was much more inclined to listen then it begins to look as if it was something to do with tormod charlotte reasoned or some other man we dont know of yet or perhaps something to do with alston that we do not know or else simply that she was the thief suicide caroline pushed her plate away what a dread shyful thing it is that another human being another woman you thought of as much like yourself only a few houses away could be so wretched as to take her own life rather than live another dayand you know nothing about it at all you go about your own trivial little affairs thinking of menus and seeing that the linen is repaired and whom to call upon exactly as if there were nothing else to do charlotte put her hand across the table to touch caroline i dont suppose you could have done anything even if you had known she said quietly she gave no clue at all that she was so desperately unhappyand one cannot intrude into everyones business to inquire grief is sometimes more easily borne for being private and a humiliation is the last thing one wishes to share the kindest thing one can do is to affect not to have noticed i suppose youre right but i still feel guilty there must have been something i could have done well there isnt anything now except speak well of her caroline sighed i sent a letter to alston of course but i feel it is too early to call upon him yet he is bound to be very shocked but poor eloise is unwell also i thought we might call there this afternoon and express our sympathy she has taken the whole thing very badly i think perhaps she is even more delicate than i had realized it was not a prospect charlotte looked forward to but she could see it was quite plainly a duty and if the lagardes had been the last people apart from minas own servants to see her alive then perhaps something could be learned charlotte was stunned when she walked behind caroline into the lagarde withdrawing room eloise looked so different from the woman she had seen the week before that for a moment she almost expected a new introduction eloises face was almost colorless and she moved so slowly she might have been fum shybling in her sleep she forced herself to smile but it was a small gesture death was in the place and the formality of the usual pretended delight was not expected now how kind of you to call she said quietly first to caroline then to charlotte please do sit and make yourselves comfortable it still seems to be quite cold she had on a heavy shawl over her dress and kept it closed around her charlotte sat down in a chair across the room as far as she could get with courtesy from the fire that roared up the chimney as if it had been midwinter it was a pleasant spring day outside bright though not yet warm caroline appeared to be at a loss for words perhaps her own anxieties were too pressing for her to organize her thoughts into polite remarks charlotte rushed in with speech before eloise should become aware of it im afraid summer is always longer in coming than one hopes she said meaninglessly one fancies because the day shylight hours are longer that the sun will be warmer and it so seldom is yes eloise said looking at the square of blue through the window yes it is easy to be deceived it looks so bright but one doesnt know till one is in it quite how cold it is caroline recollected her manners and the purpose of their visit we will not stay long she said because this is not a time for social visits but both charlotte and i were concerned to know how you were and if there was anything we could say or do to be of comfort to you for a moment eloise seemed almost not to understand her then comprehension flooded her face that is very kind of you she smiled at them both i cannot think that i feel it more deeply than we all do poor mina how very suddenly the whole world can alter one minute everything is as usual and the next enormous and dreadful changes have taken place and are as complete as if years had gone by some changes are just the results of appalling accidents charlotte dared not miss an opportunity to press for knowledge it was too important but others must have been growing all the time it is just that we did not recognize them for what they were eloises eyes widened momentarily confused seeking to un shyderstand charlottes curious remark what do you mean im not quite sure charlotte hedged she must avoid seeming to pry only i suppose that if poor mrs spencerbrown took her own life then it can only have been a tragedy that had been growing unknown to us for some time she had intended to be far more subtle but eloise was so candid herself that charlotte could not play word games with her as she might have with someone more devious eloise looked down at the folds of her skirt arranged over her knees you think mina took her own life she pronounced the words one by one very clearly weighing them that seems rather a cowardly thing to do i always thought of mina as stronger than that charlotte was surprised she had expected more pity and more understanding we dont know what pain she was faced with she said rather less gently at least i dont no eloise did not look up a flash of contrition in her face i suppose we seldom even guess at anyone elses pain rutland place how big it is how sharp how often it cuts she shook her head but i still think that taking ones life is a kind of surrender some people grow too tired to fight anymore or the wound is greater than they can overcome charlotte persisted wonder shying at the back of her mind why she was defending mina so hard she had not especially liked her indeed she had felt a greater warmth for eloise we do not know that poor mina took her own life caro shyline said intervening at last it may have been some sort of horrible accident i cannot help believing that if there had been something distressing her so dreadfully we would have been aware of it i cannot agree with you mama charlotte replied do you think that was what happened miss lagarde you knew her quite well did you not eloise sat without answering for several seconds i dont know i used to think i knew all the obvious things and heard most of the gossip one way or another and imagined i could evaluate its worth now her voice trailed away and she stood up turning her back to them and walked over to the garden window now i realize that i knew almost nothing at all charlotte was about to press her when the door opened and tormod came in his glance went immediately to eloise at the window then to charlotte and caroline there was anxiety in his face and his body was stiff good afternoon he said politely how kind of you to call his eyes went to eloise again dark and troubled im afraid eloise has taken this appalling tragedy very hard it has distressed her till she is quite unwell there was a warning in his face to be careful choose their words or they might add to the burden caroline murmured understandingly it is a very dreadful affair charlotte said a person of sensibility would be bound to feel for everyone concerned and i believe you were the last to see the poor woman alive tormod gave her a glance of profound appreciation of course and it cannot but distress poor eloise to wonder if perhaps there might have been something we could have done naturally her own servants actually oh servants charlotte said waving them away with a little gesture of her fingers but that is not the same as friends whom one might have confided in exactly tormod said unfortunately she did not i really think it must have been some sort of accident perhaps a wrong dosage of a medicine perhaps charlotte said doubtfully of course i did not know her very well was she so absentminded no eloise turned from the window she always seemed to know precisely what she was doing if she did something so fatally foolish then she must have been very distracted in her mind or she would have noticed immediately that she had poured from a wrong bottle or a wrong box and disposed of it instead of drinking it tormod went to her and put his arm around her gently you really must stop thinking about it dear he said there is nothing we can do for her now and you are distress shying yourself you will make yourself ill and that will help no one and it will hurt me very much tomorrow we shall go into the country back to five elms and think of other things the weather is improving all the time the first daffodils will be out in the wood and we shall take the carriage and go driving to see themperhaps even with a picnic basket if it is warm enough wouldnt you like that she smiled at him her face softening in gentle melting pleasure more as if she were comforting him than he supporting her yes of course i should she put her hand over his thank you tormod turned to caroline it was most thoughtful of you to call mrs ellison and you mrs pitt we appreciate it such courtesies of friendship make these things easier to bear and i am sure you must feel very shocked as well after all poor mina was a friend of yours also indeed i am completely at a loss caroline said a little ambiguously charlotte was still pondering what she meant by that when the maid opened the door and announced mrs denbigh amaryllis came in so close behind her there was no time to say whether the call was acceptable or not eloise looked at her bleakly almost through her tormod remained with his arm still around her and smiled politely amaryllis face stiffened and her round eyes were glittering sharp are you ill eloise she said with surprise her voice ambivalent between sympathy and impatience if you are faint let me help you upstairs to lie down i have salts if you wish no thank you i am not faint but it is most civil of you to offer are you sure amaryllis eyes swept her up and down with chilly condescension you do not look at all well my dear in fact you are really very peaked if you do not mind my saying so i am the last person in the world to wish my visiting you to cause you to overstrain yourself i am not ill eloise said a little more sharply tormods arm tightened around her almost as if he were bearing her weight although to charlotte she looked quite steady of course not dear he said but you have suffered a deep shock and you are not strong amaryllis added perhaps if you send for a tisane shall i ring for your maid for you thank you tormod accepted quickly that would be an excellent idea im sure mrs ellison and mrs pitt would care for a cup of tisane as well it is a most distressing time for all of us you will take some refreshment wont you thank you charlotte said immediately she was not sure what could be gained from remaining but since she had learned nothing so far she must at least try i hardly knew poor mrs spencerbrown but i still feel most profoundly sad for her death how tenderhearted of you amaryllis said skeptically charlotte affected an air of innocence do you not feel the same mrs denbigh i am sure i can understand miss lagardes emotions with the greatest of sympathy to know you were the last person to see a friend and talk with them before such overwhelming despair of mind overtook them that they found life itself insupportableim sure i also should be far from well amaryllis eyebrows rose are you saying mrs pitt that you are of the belief that mrs spencerbrown took her own life oh dear charlotte weighed all the consternation into her voice that she could contrive surely you dont believe some shyone elseoh dearhow very dreadful for once amaryllis was too confused for words it was obviously the last thing she had intended to imply well no i mean she stumbled and retreated into silence her skin flushed and her eyes cold with awareness of having been outmaneuvered i hardly think that is likely tormod said coming to her rescueor was it charlottes mina was not in the least the kind of woman to rouse such an enmity in anyone in fact i j cannot believe she would even know a person who would con shyceive of such an abominable thing of course amaryllis said gratefully i expressed myself less clearly than i should such a thing is unthinkable if you had known bettershe looked meaningfully at charlottethe sort of people who were her friends then you would not have mistaken me so charlotte forced a smile she did not feel i am sure i should not but i am at a disadvantage and you will have to forgive me did you mean that it was some kind of accident put baldly like that the idea of having walked home and calmly taken a fatal dose of poison by pure mischance was so ridiculous that there was nothing amaryllis could say her round eyes looked at charlotte with cold dislike i simply do not know what happened mrs pitt and i really think we should refrain from discussing the subject in front of poor eloise she let the condescension drip from her voice you must have appreciated that she is most delicate and suffers from a nervous and sensitive disposition we are causing her distress by pursuing this so tastelessly eloise dear she swiv eled around with a smile so glittering it sent shivers down charlottes spine and produced a feeling of revulsion so sharp it i almost burst over into words eloise are you sure you would not care to come upstairs and rest a little you look quite extraordinarily pale thank you eloise said coolly i do not wish to retire i would greatly prefer to remain down here we must share this grief together and be what comfort we can to each other but tormod was not satisfied here he brushed amaryllis aside led eloise to lie on the chaise longue and lifted her feet for her charlotte caught a flicker of anger on amaryllis face so hot it would have scorched eloise to the skin had she known of it it gave charlotte an acute satisfaction of which she was not proud but she did nothing to try to rid herself of it rather she relished it with peculiar warmth she savored the turn of tormods shoulder and the soft movement of his hand as he smoothed eloises skirt while amaryllis watched from behind the door opened and the maid came in with a tray cups and a hot tisane amaryllis set it on the table and poured somefor eloise immediately giving it to her and passing her a cushion so that she might rest more easily charlotte made some harmless observation about a social event she had read of in the london illustrated news tormod seized on it gratefully and after they had all drunk a little of the tisane charlotte and caroline took their leave followed by amaryllis poor eloise amaryllis said as soon as they were in the street she does look most poorly i had not expected her to take it quite so badly i have no idea what can have caused such a tragedy but since eloise was the last person to see poor mina before she died i cannot but wonder if perhaps she knows something her eyes widened oh told her in the greatest of confidence of course which must place her in a most dreadful dilemma poor creature knowing something vital and not being able to tell it i should not care to be in such a position charlotte had begun to wonder the same thing especially in view of tormods decision to take her away from rutland place into the country where pitt could not easily question her indeed she said noncommittally confidences are always a most difficult matter when there is strong reason to believe it might be morally right to divulge what you know the burden is even heavier if the person who entrusted you is dead and therefore cannot release you one cannot envy anyone so placed if that indeed is the case we must not leap to conclusions and risk spreading gossip she flashed amaryllis a freezing smile that would be quite irresponsible it may simply be that eloise is more compassionate than we are i am very sorry but i did not know mrs spencerbrown very well she left the implication in the air amaryllis did not miss it quite and some of us display our emotions while others prefer to keep a certain reservea dignity as befits the death of a friend after all one does not wish to become the center of attention it is poor mina who is dead not one of us charlotte smiled more widely feeling as if she were baring her teeth how sensitive of you mrs denbigh i am sure you will be a great comfort to everyone i am charmed to have met you they had come to amaryllis gateway how kind amaryllis answered im sure i enjoyed it also she turned and lifting her skirts climbed the steps charlotte caroline said sharply under her breath really sometimes i am quite embarrassed for you i thought now that you were married you might have improved a little i have improved charlotte replied as she walked i lie much better i used to fumble before and now i can smile as well as anyone and lie through my teeth i cant bear that woman so i gathered caroline said dryly neither can you no but i manage to keep it under considerably better control charlotte gave her a look that was unreadable and stepped off the pavement to cross the road then suddenly she noticed the lean elegant figure of a man coming out of a gateway on the far side of the street even before he turned she knew him knew the straight back the grace of his head the way his coat sat upon his shoulders it was paul alaric the frenchman from paragon walk about whom every shyone thought so much and actually knew so little he walked over to them easily a half smile on his face and raised his hat his eyes met charlottes with a widening of surprise and then a flash that might have been pleasure or amusementor even only the courtesy of remembering a most agreeable acquaintance with whom one had shared profound emotions of danger and pity but naturally he spoke to caroline first since she was the elder woman good afternoon mrs ellison his voice was exactly as charlotte had remembered soft the pronunciation exquisitely correct more beautiful than that of most men for whom english was their mother tongue caroline stood in the middle of the road her skirt still held in her hand she swallowed before she spoke and her voice was rather high good afternoon monsieur alaric a very pleasant day i dont think you have met my daughter mrs pitt for an instant he hesitated his eyes meeting charlottes very directly while a host of memories flashed through her mind memories of fear and conflicting passions then he bowed very slightly the decision made how do you do mrs pitt i am quite well thank you monsieur she replied levelly although i was distressed at the tragedy that has so recently happened mrs spencerbrown his face wiped clean of polite trivia and his voice dropped yes im afraid i can think of no answer which is not tragic i have been struggling within myself to find any reason for such an ugly and useless thing to have happened and i cannot compulsion drove charlotte to pursue it even though good taste might have demanded that she say something sympathetic and change the subject then you do not think it could have been an accident she asked caroline was beside her now and she was acutely con shyscious of her of the tight muscles of her body of her eyes fixed on alarics face there was gentleness in him and something like a light of bitter humor as if for a second her candor had aroused some other emotion in him no mrs pitt he said i wish i could but one does not take a dose of medicine that has not been prescribed for one nor drink from an unlabeled bottle unless one is very foolish and mrs spencerbrown was not foolish in the least she was an extremely practical woman do you not think so mrs ellison he turned toward caroline and his face softened into a smile the color rose up carolines cheeks yes yes indeed i do in fact i cannot recall ever knowing of mina doing anything illconsidered charlotte was surprised she had not received the impression that mina was especially intelligent indeed the conversation they had had as she recalled it had been mostly trivial con shycerned with things of the utmost unimportance really she said with rather more skepticism than she had intended she did not wish to be rude perhaps i did not know her well enough but i would have thought it quite possible her mind could have been occupied with some other concern and she might have made an error you are confusing intelligence with common sense charlotte caroline said spiritedly mina was not fond of study nor did she concern herself with some of the very odd affairs that you do she was too discreet to name them but a slight lowering of her eyelids and a sidelong glance made charlotte decide that she was referring to her political convictions with regard to reform bills in parliament poor laws and the like but she was well aware of her own skills caroline continued and how best to use them and she had far too much native wit to make mistakesof any sort do you not think so monsieur alaric he glanced down the street over their shoulders into some distance they could not see before turning to face charlotte we are looking for a genteel way of saying that mrs spencerbrown had a very fine instinct for survival mrs pitt he replied she knew the rules she knew what could be said and what could notwhat could be done she was never careless never moved by passion before sense she did appear trivial on occasion because that is the socially acceptable way to talk intelligently of serious subjects is not considered attractive in a woman he smiled fleetingly caroline could not know they had talked before at least not by most men but underneath the prattle mina was a skilled and prudent woman who knew precisely what she wanted and what she could have charlotte stared at him trying to control her thoughts you make that sound a little sinister she said slowly calculating caroline took her arm nonsense one has to use some sense in order to survive monsieur alaric means only that she was not flighty the sort of silly creature who does not take any care what she is doing is that not so she looked at him her face glowing in the cool air her eyes bright charlotte was surprised and jarringly afraidto see how lovely she still was the color the brilliance the blood under the skin had nothing to do with the march wind it was the presence of this man with his dark head and strong straight back standing in the road talking gently about death and his pity for the tragedy around it then i fear it may have been suicide charlotte said sud shydenly and rather loudly perhaps the poor woman got herself into an affaire of the heart became involved with someone other than her husband and the situation was unbearable to her i can see very easily how that could happen she did not have the boldness to look at either of them and there was absolute silence in the street not even the sound of a bird or of distant hooves such adventures very often end in disaster she continued after a harsh breath of one sort or another maybe she pre shyferred death to the scandal that might have accompanied such a thing becoming public caroline stood frozen do you think either she or any man would allow such a matter to become public alaric asked with an expression charlotte could not fathom i have no idea she said with defiance she instantly regretted but she plunged on he had always had the ability to make her speak incautiously perhaps an indiscreet letter or a love token people who are infatuated are often very foolish even normally sensible people caroline was so rigid charlotte could feel her behind her shoulder like a column of ice you are right caroline said in a low voice but death seems a terrible price to pay for such a folly it is for the first time charlotte looked fully at her then she turned to alaric and found his eyes dark and bright and unreadable but understanding her as clearly as if they could see inside her head but then when we embark on such affaires charlotte continued with a tightening of her throat we seldom see the price at the end until it is time to pay she swallowed and suddenly tried to sound light as if it were all just speculation and nothing to do with anything real at least so i have observed surely he must also be remembering paragon walk and their first meeting did he still live there now his face relaxed fractionally and his lips moved in the smallest smile let us hope we are wrong and there is some less desperate explanation i would not care to think of anyone suffering so she recalled herself all that was long past nor i and i am sure you would not either mama she closed her hand over carolines we had better be returning home now that we have paid our duty calls papa will be expecting us for tea caroline opened her mouth as if to speak then closed it again but even so charlotte had to pull her good day monsieur alaric charlotte said briskly i am delighted to have made your acquaintance he bowed and raised his hat and i yours mrs pitt good afternoon mrs ellison good afternoon monsieur alaric they walked a few paces charlotte still pulling caroline uncomfortably by the arm charlotte i despair of you sometimes caroline shut her eyes to block out the scene do you charlotte said tartly without relaxing her pace mama there is no need for a great deal of words between us that will only hurt we understand each other and you do not need to tell me that papa is not at home either i know that caroline did not reply the wind was sharper and she tucked her head down into her collar charlotte knew she had been abrupt even cruel but she was very badly frightened paul alaric was not some light affaire a man full of pretty phrases and little gestures to please a taste of romance to brighten the monotony of a thirtyyear marriage he was hard and real there was power in him and emotion a suggestion of things beyond reach exciting and perhaps infi shynitely beautiful charlotte herself was still tingling from the meeting charlotte did not tell pitt of her feelings regarding paul alaric and caroline or indeed that he was someone she had known previously in fact she could not have put it into words had she desired to the encounter had left her more confused than ever she remembered the heat of emotion and the jealousies he had engendered in paragon walk the disquiet he had awoken even in her she could understand carolines infatuation easily alaric was far more than merely charming a handsome face upon which to build a dream he had a power to surprise to disturb and to remain in the memory long after parting it would be blind to dismiss him as a flirtation that would wear itself out she could not explain it to pitt and she did not wish to have to try but of course she had to tell him that tormod and eloise lagarde planned to leave rutland place the following day so that if he wished to speak to them about minas death he would have to do so immediately since they had been the last people he knew of to see mina alive there was a great deal pitt wished to ask them although he had not yet formed in his mind any satisfactory way of wording f his thoughts which were still confused conscious only of unex shyplained tragedy but chance allowed him no time to juggle with polite sympathies and suggestions at quarter past nine the earliest time at which it would be remotely civil to call he was on the icy doorstep facing a startled footman whose tie sat askew and whose polished boots were marred with mud yes sir the man said his mouth hanging open inspector pitt pitt said may i speak with mr lagarde if you please and then with miss lagarde when it is convenient it aint convenient in his consternation the footman forgot the grammar the butler had been at pains to instill in him theyre going down to the country today they aintthey is not receiving no one miss lagarde arent well im very sorry miss lagarde is unwell pitt said refusing to be edged off the step but i am from the police and i am obliged to make inquiries about the death of mrs spencerbrown who i believe was known to mr and miss lagarde quite closely i am sure they would wish to be of every assistance they could oh well the footman had obviously not foreseen this situation nor had the butler prepared him for anything of this sort perhaps it would be less conspicuous for me to wait some shywhere other than on the doorstep pitt said glancing back into the street with the implicit suggestion that the rest of the place knew his identity and therefore his business oh the footman realized the impending catastrophe of course youd best come into the morning room theres no fire there then he recollected that pitt was the police and explanations let alone fires were unnecessary for such persons you just wait in there he opened the door and watched pitt go in ill tell the master youre here now dont you go awandering around ill come back and tell you whats what pitt smiled to himself as the door closed he bore no rancor he knew the boys job depended on his proper observance of social niceties and that an irritable butler illserved could cost him very dear there would be no recourse no opportunity for explanations and little tolerance of mistakes to have the police in the house was most unfortunate but to keep them at the front door arguing for all the world to see would be unpardonable pitt had seen a good deal of life belowstairs beginning with his own parents experience when his father had been gamekeeper on a large country estate as a boy pitt had run through the house with the masters son an only child glad of any playmate pitt had been quick to learn to ape the manners and the speech and to copy the school lessons he knew the rules on both sides of the green baize door tormod came quickly pitt had barely had time to look at the gentle landscape paintings on the walls and the old rosewood desk with its marquetry inlays before he heard the step on the polished floor outside the room tormod was rather what he had expected broadshouldered wearing a beautifully cut coat his collar a little high he had dark hair swept back from a broad white brow and a full mouth with a wide lower lip pitt he said formally dont know what i can tell you i really havent the faintest idea what can have happened to poor minamrs spencerbrown if she had any anxiety or fear unfortunately she did not confide it to either my sister or myself it was a blank wall and pitt had no idea how he was going to make the slightest impression on it yet this was the only human clue he had but she did call on you that last day and left within an hour or so of her death he said quietly his mind was racing searching for something pertinent to ask anything that might crack the smooth composure and reveal a hint of the passion that must have been thereunless it really had been only a chance and ridiculous accident oh yes tormod said with a rueful little shrug but even with the wisdom of hindsight i still cannot think of anything she said which would point to why she should take her own life she seemed quite composed and in normally good spirits i have been trying to think what we talked of but only commonplaces come back to me he looked at pitt with a half smile fashion menus for the dinner table some silly society jokesall the most ordinary things one talks about when one is passing the time and has nothing real to say pleasant but one only partially listens pitt knew the type of conversation perfectly well life was full of just such pointless exchanges the fact that one spoke was what mattered the words were immaterial could it really be that mina had had no idea whatsoever that she had less than an hour left to live had accident occurred like lightning out of a still sky no storm no rumble of far thunder no oppression mount shying before murder was not like that even a lunatic had reasons for killing insanity built its slow heat like spring thawing the long winter snows till suddenly the one more gallon became too much and the dams burst with wild destructive violence but pitt had seen death caused by madmen and they did not use poisonnot on a woman alone in her own withdrawing room neatly laid on the chaise longue if this was murder it was perfectly saneand there was sane reason behind it i wonder he said aloud reverting back to the subject could mrs spencerbrown have had some trouble on her mind and desired to confide it to you but when faced with the necessity of expressing it in words have found herself unable to might she have spoken only of commonplaces for just that reason tormod appeared to consider the possibility his eyes blank as he examined his memory i suppose so he said at last i dont believe it myself she did not seem other than her usual self i mean she was not agitated as far as i can recall or unconcerned with the conversation as one might be if one were seeking an opportu shynity to speak of something else but you said yourself that you were only half listening pitt pointed out tormod smiled pulling his face into a comic line wellhe stretched his hands out palms upwho listens to every word of womens conversation to tell the truth i had intended to be out but my plans had been canceled at the last moment or i should not even have been at home one has to be civil but how interested can one be in what color lady whoever wore to the ball or what mrs soandso said at the soiree its womens concern i just didnt feel that it was anything different from usual i heard no change of tone caught nothing of anxiety thats what i mean pitt could only sympathize it must have required hard discipline to remain courteous throughout only the rigid doctrine of good manners above allfrom nannys knee through tutors and public schoolhad instilled a pattern of selfcontrol that would allow tormod to do so with apparent grace all the same pitt took the opportunity it gave him then perhaps your sister may have observed something heard some nuance that only a woman would understand he asked quickly tormod raised his eyebrows a little whether at the suggestion or at pitts use of words he hesitated i would rather you did not trouble her inspector he said slowly the death has been a severe shock to her in fact i am taking her away from rutland place for a little while to recover the associations are most unpleasant my sister and i are orphans death has hit us hard in the past and im afraid eloise still finds it difficult to bear i suppose it may be that mina did confide something to her that day i was not present all the time it may be that eloise feels she should have understood how desperate the poor woman was and done something and that grieves her additionally although in truth if someone is determined to take their own life one cannot do anything to prevent themonly put off the time of the inevitable then he brightened ill tell you whati shall ask eloise she will confide in me if there is anythingthat i promise youand i shall report it to you if it has any bearing whatsoever on minas death will you accept that im sure you would not wish to distress anyone more than is absolutely necessary pitt was torn he remembered all the white stricken faces he had ever seen of people who had encountered death especially sudden and violent death those faces came back to him each time it occurred again the surprise the hurt the slow acceptance that one cannot evade truth as the shock wears off and the reality remains like growing cold creeping deeper and deeper but he could not afford to let tormod lagarde make his judgments for him no im afraid that wont do he saw tormods face change the mouth set hard and the eyes chill im quite happy that you should be present pitt continued without changing his own expression or his voice a smile remained fixed on his lips in fact if you prefer to ask her yourself im quite agreeable i understand your concern that she should not be harrassed or reminded of other tragedies but since i know facts that you cannot know about mrs spencerbrowns death i must hear miss lagardes answers for myself and not as you interpret them to me with the best intention in the world tormod met his eyes stared at him for a few moments in surprise then took a step backward and with a swing of his arm reached for the bell rope ask miss lagarde to come into the morning room will you bevan he said when the butler appeared thank you pitt said acknowledging the concession tormod did not reply turning instead to look out of the window at the gray drizzle that was beginning to thicken the air and dull the outlines of the houses across the place the laufel leaves outside hung glistening drops from their points when eloise arrived she was pale but perfectly composed she kept her shawl close around her and met pitts gaze candidly as soon as the door opened tormod went to her putting his arm around her shoulders eloise darling inspector pitt has to ask you some questions about poor mina im sure you understand that since we were the last people to see her he feels we may know something of her state of mind just before she died of course eloise said calmly she sat down on the sofa and regarded pitt steadily only the bare interest of courtesy in her face the reality of death was seemingly greater than any curiosity theres no need to be afraid tormod said to her gently afraid she seemed surprised im not afraid she lifted her head to look at pitt but i dont think i can tell you anything that is of value tormod glanced at him warningly then back at eloise do you remember i left you for a while he asked her his voice very soft almost as if encouraging a child you had been speaking of little things until thenfashion and gossip did she confide any other matter to you when you were alone anything of the heart a love or a fear perhaps someone she was becoming fond of eloises mouth moved in a fraction of a smile if you mean did she love someone other than her husband she said without expression in her voice i have no reason to think so she certainly did not speak of it to methen or at any other time im not sure if she believed in love of the storybook kind she believed in passionslust and pity and lonelinessbut they are quite different things not really love they pass when the hun shyger is satisfied or the need for pity removedorwhen one grows exhausted with loneliness these things are not love eloise tormods arm tightened around her and his hand held the flesh of her arm so hard it made white marks on her skin that pitt could see even through the muslin of her dress im so sorry his voice was soft a whisper i had no idea mina would speak of such things to you or i would never have left you alone with her he swung around to stare at pitt theres your answer inspector mrs spencerbrown was a woman who was disillusioned in some tragic way and she wished to unburden herself of it to someone unfortunately she chose my sister an unmarried girlwhich i find hard to forgive except that she must have been desperate god have pity on her now i think you have learned enough from us im taking eloise away from here away from rutland place until the worst of the shock is over and she can rest in the country and put this from her mind i dont know what mrs spencerbrown indi shycated to her about her private agonies but i will not permit you to press her any further it is obviously aan intimate and extremely painful subject i trust you are gentleman sufficient to understand that tormod eloise began no my dear the inspector can discover whatever else he needs to know in some other fashion poor mina seems unques shytionably to have taken her own life there was nothing you could have done about it and i will not have you blame yourself in any way at all we may never know what it was that she could no longer bear and perhaps it is better that we should not a persons most terrible griefs should be buried decently with them there are things that lie so close to the heart of a person every decency of man or god demands they remain private he lifted his head and glared at pitt defying him to contend pitt looked at them sitting side by side on the sofa he would get nothing more from eloise and in truth he was inclined to agree that minas suffering whatever it was deserved to be buried with her not turned over weighed and measured by other hands even the impersonal ones of the police he stood up quite he said succinctly once i am sure that it was simply a tragedy and there has been no crime even of negligence then it would be far better if we all left the matter to be forgotten in kinder memories tormod relaxed his shoulders easing the fabric of his coat falling back to its natural lines he stood up also and extended his hand holding pitts in a hard grip im glad you see it so good day to you inspector good day mr lagarde pitt turned a little miss lagarde i hope your stay in the country is pleasant she smiled at him with uncertainty something that struck her with doubt even a presage of fear thank you she said in a little more than a whisper outside in the street pitt walked slowly along trying to com shypose his thoughts everything so far indicated some private grief nursed to herself that had finally overwhelmed mina spencerbrown and driven her to take quite deliberately an overdose of something she already possessed probably it would prove to be her husbands medicine containing the belladonna which dr mulgrew had spoken of but before he allowed it to rest he must ask the other women who had known her if anyone was aware of her secret it would be one of them either from some imparted confidence or merely from observation he had learned how much a relatively idle woman could perceive in others simply because she had no business and few duties to occupy her people were her whole concern relationships secrets those to be told and those to be kept he called on ambrosine charrington first because she was the farthest away and he wanted to walk in spite of the thicken shying rain he was not yet ready to face anyone else once he even stopped altogether as a ginger cat stalked across the footpath in front of him shook himself in disgust at the wet and slipped into the shelter of the shrubbery perhaps pitt thought he should not disturb the slow settling of grief maybe it was no subject for police and he should go now turn and walk away catch the omnibus back to the police station and deal with some theft or forgery until mulgrew and the police surgeon put in their reports still thinking about it without having consciously made any decision he began to walk again the rain was gathering in vehemence and ran in cold streaks inside his collar and down his flesh making him shudder he was glad to reach the charringtons doorstep the butler received him with faint displeasure as if he were a stray driven in by the inclement weather rather than a person who had any place there pitt considered the hair plastered over his forehead the wet trousers flapping around his ankles and the one bootlace broken and decided that the butlers look of disap shyproval was not unwarranted pitt forced himself to smile inspector pitt from the police he announced indeed the butlers look of polite patience vanished like sun behind a cloud i would like to see mrs charrington if you please pitt continued it is with regard to the death of mrs spencerbrown i dont believe the butler began then looked more closely at pitts face and realized protestations were only going to pro shylong the interview not end it if you come into the morning room i will see if mrs charrington is at home it was a fiction pitt was well used to it would be discourteous to say i will ask her if she will see you although he had been told so bluntly often enough he had barely sat down when the butler returned to escort him to the withdrawing room where there was a fine fire dancing in the grate and three bowls of flowers in jardinieres by the wall k ambrosine sat bolt upright on the green brocade love seat and looked pitt over from hair to boots with interest good morning inspector do be good enough to sit down and remove your coat you seem more than a little wet he obeyed with pleasure handing the offending garment to the butler then arranging himself in an armchair so as to absorb the full benefit of the fire thank you maam he said with feeling the butler retired closing the door behind him and ambrosine raised her fine eyebrows i am told you are inquiring into poor mrs spencerbrowns death she said i am afraid i know nothing whatsoever of interest in fact how little i know is quite amazing in itself i would have expected to hear something one has to be remarka shybly clever to keep a secret in society you know there are many things that are not spoken of which would be in unforgivable taste to mention but you will usually find that people know all the same there is a certain smugness in the face she looked at him to see if he understood and was evidently satisfied that he did it is infinitely pleasing to know secrets especially when others are aware that you doand they do not she frowned but i have not observed this attitude lately in anyone but mina herself and i never really knew whether she had any great knowledge or merely wished us to think so he was equally puzzled do you not think that someone might be prepared to speak now that a death is involved he said to avoid misunderstandings and perhaps even injustice she gave a weary little smile what an optimist you are inspector you make me feel very oldor at least as if you must be very young death is the very best excuse of all to hide things forever few people have the least objection to injusticethe world is run on it and after all it is part of the creed de mortuis nil nisi bonum he waited for her to explain although he thought he knew what she meant speak no ill of the dead she said bleakly of course i mean societys creed not the churchs a very charitable idea at first glance but it leaves all the weight of the blame upon the livingwhich of course is what it is designed to do whoever took any joy from hunting a dead fox the blame for what he asked her soberly forcing himself not to be diverted from the issue of mina that depends upon whom we are discussing she replied in the case of mina i really do not know it is a field in which i would have expected you to be far more knowledgeable than i why are you concerned in the matter at all to die is not a crime of course i appreciate that to kill oneself isbut since it is obviously quite unprosecutable i fail to see your involvement my only interest is to make certain that that is what it is he answered a matter of her having taken her own life no one appears to know of any reason whatsoever why she should have done so no she said thoughtfully we know so little about each other i sometimes wonder if we even know why we do the important things i dont suppose it is the reason that appears like money or love mrs spencerbrown seems to have been very well provided for he tried a more direct approach do you suppose it could have been anything to do with an affaire of love her mouth quivered with a suppressed smile how delicate of you inspector i have no idea about that either im sorry if she had a lover then she was more discreet than i gave her credit for perhaps she loved someone who did not return her feelings he suggested possibly but if all the people who ever did were to kill themselves half of london would be occupied burying the other half she dismissed it with a lift of her fingers mina was not a melancholy romantic you know she was a highly practical person and fully acquainted with the realities of life and she was thirtyfive not eighteen people of thirtyfive can fall in love he smiled very slightly she looked him up and down judging him correctly to within a year of course they can she agreed with the shadow of an answering smile people can fall in love at any age at all but at thirtyfive they have probably had the experience several times before and do not mistake it for the end of the world when it goes amiss then why do you think mrs spencerbrown killed herself mrs charrington he surprised himself by being so candid i you really wish for my opinion inspector i do i am disinclined to believe that she did mina was far too practical not to find some way out of whatever misfortune she had got herself into she was not an emotional woman and i never knew anyone less hysterical an accident not of her making i should think an idiotic maid moved bottles or boxes or mixed two things together to save room and created a poison by mistake i daresay you will never find out unless your policeman removed all the containers in the house before the servants had any opportunity to destroy or empty them if i were you i shouldnt worry myselfthere is nothing whatsoever you can do about it either to undo it or to prevent it happening again somewhere else to somebody else a domestic accident i would think so if you had ever been responsible for the running of a large house inspector you would know what extraordinary things can happen if you were aware what some cooks do and what other strange bodies find their way into the larder i daresay you would never eat again he stood up concealing an unseemly impulse to laugh that welled up inside him there was something in her he liked enormously thank you maam if that is indeed what happened then i expect you are righti shall never know she rang the bell for the butler to show pitt out it is one of the marks of wisdom to learn to leave alone that which you cannot help she said gently you will do more harm than good threshing all the fine chaff to discover a grain of truth a lot of people will be frightened perhaps made unemploy shyable in the future and you will still not have helped anyone he called on theodora von schenck and found her an utterly different kind of woman handsome in her own way but entirely lacking the aristocratic beauty of ambrosine or the ethereal delicacy of eloise but more surprising than her appearance was the fact that like charlotte she was busy with quite ordinary household chores when pitt arrived she was counting linen and sorting into a pile the things that required mending or replacement in fact she did not seem to be ashamed that she had put some aside to be cut down into smaller articles such as pillowcases from worn sheets and linen cloths for drying and polishing from those pieces that were smaller or more worn however for all her frankness she was unable to offer him any assistance about the reasons for minas death she found the idea of suicide pitiful expressing her sorrow that anyone should reach such depths of despair but she did not deny that some shytimes it did happen on the other hand since she had not known mina well she was aware of nothing at all to bring her to such a state theodora herself was a widow with two children which reduced her social connections considerably and she preferred to devote her time to her home and children rather than making social calls or attending soirees and such functions therefore she heard little gossip pitt left no wiser and certainly no happier if he could feel certain that there was some unresolved tragedy as tormod lagarde had seemed convinced then he would be satisfied to leave it decently alone on the other hand ambrosine charrington had been sure that such a thing was utterly out of character if it had been some preposterous accident should he persist until he had done all he could to discover precisely what did he owe it to mina herself to be buried in a suicides grave was a disgrace a stigma not easy to bear for her survivors and did he perhaps owe it to alston spencerbrown to show him that his wife had not been so unhappy as to prefer death to life might not spencerbrown go on torturing himself with hurt and confusion in the belief that she had loved someone else and found life insupportable without him and other peoplewould they be shylieve something secret and perhaps obscure about alston that had driven his wife to such an end was it possible that no matter how ugly or how expensive the facts were better the truth deals only one wound but suspicions a thousand because theodora had mentioned that amaryllis and she were sisters amaryllis denbigh was a complete surprise to pitt with shyout giving it conscious thought he had been expecting someone similar and it was a faintly unpleasant readjustment to meet a woman younger not only in years but jarringly so in fashion manner and deportment she met him with cool civility but the spark of interest was in her eyes and in the suppressed tightness of her body he never for a moment feared that she might decline to talk there was something hungry in her something seeking and yet at the same time contemptuous of him she had not forgotten that he was a policeman of course i understand your situation inspectorpitt she sat down and arranged her skirts with white fingers that stroked the silk delicately he could almost feel its rippling softness himself as if it slid cool beneath his own skin thank you maam he eased himself into the chair across the small table from her you are obliged to satisfy yourself that there has been no wrong done she reasoned and naturally that requires you to discover the truth i wish i could be of more assistance to you her eyes did not leave his face and he had the feeling she knew every line of it every shade but i fear i know very little she smiled coolly i have only impressions and it would be less than fair to represent them as facts i sympathize he found the words hard to say for no reason that he could frame he made an effort to concentrate his mind upon mina and his reason for being here yet if anyone had known facts surely they would have prevented the tragedy it is precisely because there are only impressions and understand shyings that have come with the wisdom of hindsight that these things occur so startlingly and we are left with mysteries and perhaps unjust beliefs he hoped he was not being sententious but he was trying to follow her own line of reasoning and convince her to speak he believed he could judge what to trust and what to discard as malicious or unrelated i had not thought of it like that her eyes were round and blue and very direct she must have looked much like this in feature and expression when she was still in pigtails and dresses to her knees the same frankness the same slightly bold interest the same softness of cheek and throat of course you are quite right then perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me of your impressions he invited disliking himself for it even as he spoke he despised the sort of mischievous speculation that he was encouragingindeed would listen to with the same eager shyness as a gossip selecting dirt to relish and refine before whisper shying it with laughter and deprecation to the next hungry ear she was too subtle to excuse herself again to do so would imply she needed excuse instead she fixed her eyes on a bowl of flowers on a side table against the wall and began to speak of course minathat is mrs spencerbrownwas very fond of mr lagarde as i expect you know she did not look back at him the temptation was there he saw it in the tighten shying of her neck but she resisted it i do not for one moment mean to imply anything improper but there are always people who will misunderstand even the most innocent of friendships i have wondered once or twice if there was someone who so misunderstood minas regard and perhaps was caused great unhappiness by it such as who he asked a little surprised it was a possibil shyity he had not thought of a simple misunderstanding leading to jealousy he had only considered an unrequited love well i suppose the obvious answer is mr spencerbrown she replied facing him at last but then the truth is not always the obvious is it no he agreed hastily but if not him then who she breathed a deep sigh and appeared to reflect for a few moments i really dont know she lifted her head suddenly as if she had newly made up her mind about something i imagine it is possible she stopped well all sort of other thingsother people i know inigo charrington was very attached to eloise at one time she would not even consider him ive no idea why he seems pleasing enough but to her it was as if he did not exist in that sense she was civil enough to him naturally but then one is i dont see what that has to do with mrs spencerbrowns death he said frankly no she gave him a wide blue look neither do i i expect it has nothing at all i am only seeking possibilities people who might have said something at one time or another which could have given rise to misunderstanding i did tell you inspector that i knew nothing you asked me for my impressions and your impression is that mrs spencerbrown was in normally good spirits as far as you knew without intending to he had used tormods words oh yes if something happened to distress her it must have occurred quite suddenly without any warning maybe she learned something appalling again her eyes were wide and round mr lagarde says she was not at all upset when she left his house he pointed out and from the hour her servants have reported it appears she went straight home then perhaps she met someone in the street or there was a letter waiting for her when she arrived a letter was something that had not occurred to him he should have asked the servants if there had been any messages perhaps harris had thought of it it was too late to cover his mistake she had seen it in his face her smile became surer if she destroyed it as indeed would be the natural thing she said softly then we shall never know what it contained and perhaps that is best do you not think not if it was blackmail maam he said tartly he was angry with himself and with her for seeing what he had not and for the feeling he had that it amused her blackmail she looked startled what a terrible idea i can hardly bear to think you are right poor mina poor poor woman she took a deep breath and tightened her fingers on the silk across her thighs clasping till the knuckles shone pale but i suppose you know more about these things than we do it would be childish to close ones eyes the truth will not go away for ignoring it or we could get rid of everything unpleasant simply by refusing to look at it you must have patience with us inspector if we see only reluctantly and more slowly than we should we have been used to the easier things in life and such ugliness cannot always be acknowledged without a little period of adjustment perhaps even some force he knew what she said was true and his reason applauded her perhaps he had been unfair in his judgment prejudice was not confined to the privileged he knew it in himself the bitter aftertaste of opinions forced back and found unjust formed in envy or fear and the need to rationalize hate of course he stood up he wanted no more of the interview she had already given him more than enough to consider and he had mentioned blackmail rather to shock her than because he really thought it a possibility now he was obliged to recognize it as yet i know of no truth pleasant or unpleasant so the less that is said the less pain that will be caused it may well have been no more than a tragic accident her face was quite calm almost serene with its pink and white coloring and girlish lines i do hope so anything else will increase the distress for everyone good day to you inspector good day mrs denbigh he had put the matter out of his mind and was working on a number of fires two of which were in his area and were proba shybly arson when at half past four in the afternoon a constable with black hair plastered neatly to his head with water knocked on his door and announced that there was a visitor a gentleman of quality who is it pitt was expecting no one and his immediate thought was that the man had been misdirected from the chief superintendents office and they would be able to be rid of him with a few words of assistance a mr charrington sir the constable answered a mr lovell charrington of rutland place pitt put the paper he was reading aside facedown on the desk ask him to come in he said with a feeling of misgiving he could imagine no reason at all why lovell charrington should come to the police station unless it was to impart some shything both secret and urgent regarding any ordinary event he could either have sent for pitt to attend upon him or simply waited until he returned in the ordinary course of the investigation lovell charrington came in with his hat still on beaded with rain and his umbrella folded but untied hanging from his hand his face was pale and there was a drop of water on the end of his nose pitt stood up good afternoon sir what can i do for you you are inspector pitt i believe lovell said stiffly pitt had the impression that he did not mean to be rude simply that he was awkward torn between desire to say something difficult for him and a natural revulsion at the place almost certainly he had never been inside a police station before and horrifying ideas of sin and squalor were burning in his imagination yes sir pitt tried to help him would you like to sit down he indicated the hardbacked wooden chair to one side of the desk is it something to do with the death of mrs spencerbrown lovell sat reluctantly yes yes i have beenconsidering weighing in my mind whether it was correct that i should speak to you or not it was remarkable how he managed to look alarmed and faintly pompous at the same timelike a rooster that has caught itself crowing loudly at high noon acutely selfconscious one desires to do ones duty however painful he fixed pitt with a solemn stare pitt was embarrassed for him he cleared his throat and tried to think of something harmless to say that did not stick in his mouth with hypocrisy of course he answered not always easy quite lovell coughed quite so what is it you wish to say mr charrington lovell coughed again and fished in his pocket for a handkerchief you have quite the wrong word i do not wish to say it inspector i feel an obligation which is quite different indeed pitt breathed out patiently of course it is ex shycuse my clumsiness what is it you feel that we should know mrs spencerbrown lovell sniffed and kept the hand shykerchief knotted up in his fingers for a moment before folding it and replacing it in his pocket mrs spencerbrown was not a happy woman inspector indeed i would go so far as to say speaking frankly that she was somewhat neurotic he spoke the word as if it were faintly obscene something to be kept between men pitt was startled and he had difficulty in preventing its show shying in his face everyone else had said the opposite that mina was unusually pragmatic adjusted very precisely to reality indeed he was aware of repeating himself but he was confused what makes you say that mr charrihgton what ohwell for goodness sake man now lovell showed impatience ive had years of observing the woman live in the same street you know friend of my wife been in her house and had her in mine know her husband poor man very unstable woman given to strong emotional fancies lot of women are of course i accept that its in their nature pitt had found most women especially in society to have fancies of an astoundingly practical nature and to be most excellently equipped to distinguish reality from romance it was men who married a pretty face or a flattering tongue women and charlotte had showed him a number of examplesfar more often chose a pleasant nature and a healthy pocket romance pitt said blinking quite lovell said quite so live in daydreams not used to the harsh facts of life not suited for it different from men poor mina spencerbrown conceived a romantic attachment for young tormod lagarde he is a decent man of course upright knew she was a married woman and years older than he is into the bargain i thought she was about thirtyfive pitt interrupted so she was i believe lovells eyes opened wide and sharp good heavens man lagarde is only twentyeight be looking for a girl of nineteen or twenty when he decides to marry far more suitable dont want a woman set in her ways shyno chance to correct her then one must guide a woman you know mold her character the right way anyhow all thats beside the point mrs spencerbrown was already married stands to reason she realized she was making a fool of herself and was afraid her husband would find outand she couldnt bear it anymore he cleared his throat had to tell you damned unpleasant but cant have you nosing around asking questions and raising suspicions against innocent people most unfortunate the whole affair pathetic great deal of suffering poor woman very foolish but terrible price to pay nothing good about it he sniffed very slightly and dabbed at his nose there very seldom is pitt said dryly how do you come to know about this affection of mrs spencerbrowns for mr lagarde sir what pitt repeated the question lo veils face soured sharply that is a highly indelicate question inspectorerpitt i am obliged to ask it sir pitt controlled himself with difficulty he wanted to shake this man out of his narrow idiotic little shelland yet part of him knew it would be useless and cruel i observed it of course lovell snapped i have already told you that i have known mrs spencerbrown for several years i have seen her over a vast number of social occasions do you think i go around with my eyes closed pitt avoided the question has anyone else remarked this affection mr charrington he asked instead if no one else has spoken of it to you inspector it is out of delicacy not ignorance one does not discuss other peoples affairs especially painful ones with strangers a small muscle twitched in his cheek i dislike intensely having to tell you myself but i recognize it as my duty to save any further distress among those who are still living i had hoped you would under shystand and appreciate that i am sorry i appear to have been mistaken he stood up and hitched the shoulders straight on his jacket by pulling on both lapels i trust however that you will still comprehend and fulfill your own responsibility in the matter i hope so sir pitt pushed his chair back and stood up also constable mclnnes will show you out thank you for coming and being so frank he was still sitting looking at the closed door the reports of the arson untouched and facedown when constable mclnnes returned twenty minutes later what is it pitt said irritably charrington had disconcerted him what he had said about mina jarred against everything else he had heard certainly caroline had told him of the affection for tormod lagarde but hand in hand with the conviction that mina was unusually levelheaded now charrington said she was flighty and romantic well what is it he demanded again the reports from the doctor sir mclnnes held out several sheets of paper doctor for a moment pitt could not think what he meant on mrs spencerbrown sir she died of poisoning of belladonna sira right mass of it you read the report pitt said stating the obvious mclnnes colored pink i just glanced at it sir interested likebecause he tailed off unable to think of a good excuse pitt held out his hand for it thank you he looked down and his eye traveled over the copperplate writing quickly on examination it had proved that wilhelmina spencerbrown had died of heart failure owing to a massive dose of belladonna which since she had not eaten since a light breakfast appeared to have been consumed in some gingerflavored tonic cordial the only substance in the stomach at the time of death harris had taken the box of medicinal powder supplied to alston spencerbrown by dr mulgrew and it was still threequarters full the total amount absent including the dosages spencerbrown said he had taken was considerably less than that recovered in the autopsy whatever had killed mina was not a dose of medicine taken either accidentally or by her own intention it came from some other unknown source charlotte spent a miserable day turning over in her mind what she should do about caroline and paul alaric three times she decided quite definitely that it was not so very serious and she would do best to take pitts advice and leave it alone caroline would not thank her for interfering andcharlotte might only cause them both embarrassment and make the whole matter seem more than it really was and then four times she remembered carolines face with the high glow in her skin the tautness of her body and the little gulp of excitement as she had spoken to paul alaric in the street and she could still picture him perfectly herself looking elegant and standing very straight his eyes clear his voice soft she had another vivid recollection of his speech his diction casually perfect each consonant distinct as if he had thought of every shything before he spoke and had intended it exactly as it came yes quite definitely she must do something and quickly shyunless it was too late even now she had already baked a complete batch of bread without any salt and had hurt gracies feelings by telling her to do the kitchen floor when she had just finished it now it was three in the afternoon and she had turned one of pitts shirt collars and stitched it back the same way it had been in the first place she tore it out crossly using a few words she would have been ashamed to have had overheard and decided to write to her sister emily immediately and request that she call upon her as soon as she received the letter whether it was convenient or not emily who had married lord ash worth at just about the time charlotte had married pitt might well have to cancel some interesting social engagement without notice the journey itself however would simply be a matter of calling the carriage and stepping in and charlotte had gone to emily quickly enough when that dreadful business had happened in paragon walk when emily was expecting her baby it was indelicate to remind her of it but at the moment she could not afford polite invitations she found notepaper and wrote dear emily i have been calling upon mama more frequently in the last two weeks and something quite appalling has hap shypened which may hurt her irreparably if we do not step in and take some action to prevent it i would prefer not to put it into writing as it is a long and complicated affair feel i must explain it to you in person and ask your advice as to what we may do before a tragedy occurs and it is too late to do anything i know that you are busy but new events have tran shyspired which make it urgent that we act without delay therefore please cancel any plans you may have and call upon me as soon as you receive this we both know from the past in paragon walk and other places that when disaster strikes it does not wait upon the decent end of soirees and other such enjoyments there has already been one death your loving sister charlotte she folded it up put it into an envelope and addressed it to lady ashworth paragon walk london and sent grade to put it in the postbox immediately she had exaggerated and she knew it emily might well be angry even accuse her of lying by implication there was no reason whatever to suppose that minas death had anything to do with caroline or that caroline herself was in any danger but if she had simply written that caroline was running grave risk of making a fool of herself over a man even paul alaric it would have little effect of course if their father found out it would hurt him deeplyhe would be quite unable to understand the fact that he had in times past taken at least one romance considerably further would be to him completely different what was acceptable for a man to do providing he was discreet had nothing whatsoever to do with what that same mans wife might do and to be honest caroline was not even being particularly discreet all of which would not fetch emily in any haste simply because she would not believe it whereas mention of death and a rather unsubtle reminder of the hideous events at paragon walk would almost certainly bring her as fast as her carriage could negotiate the streets and indeed it did emily knocked very sharply on the front door before noon the following day charlotte opened it herself emily looked elegant even at that hour her fair hair swept fashionably high under a delicious hat and a dress of the limpid shade of green that suited her best she pushed her way in past charlotte and marched down to the kitchen where gracie bobbed a quick curtsy and fled up shystairs to tidy the nursery well emily demanded what on earth has happened for goodness sake tell me charlotte was genuinely pleased to see her it had been some little while since they had spent any time together she put her arms around her in a swift hug emily responded warmly but with impatience what has happened she repeated urgently who is dead how and what has it to do with mama sit down charlotte pointed to one of the kitchen chairs its quite a long story and it wont make a lot of sense unless i tell it from the beginning would you like some luncheon if you insist but tell me who is dead before i explode and what has it to do with mama from the way you wrote she is in danger herself a woman called mina spencerbrown is dead at first it looked like suicide but now thomas says it is almost certainly murder i have onion soupwould you like some no i would not whatever possessed you to cook onion soup i felt like it ive wanted onion soup for days now emily regarded her with a look of pain if you had to have a craving because of your condition couldnt you have made it for something a little more civilized really charlotte onions they are socially impossible where on earth can we go calling after onion soup i cant help it at least they are not out of season or ridiculously expensive you can afford to have a craving for fresh apricots or pheasant under glass if you wish but i cannot emilys face tightened who is mina spencerbrown and what has she to do with mama charlotte if you have got me here simply because you want to meddle in one of thomas casesshe took a deep breath and pulled a facei would love to have an excuse to interfere murder is much more exciting than society even if it terrifies me sick at times and makes me weep because the solution is always so wretchedly sad she clenched her fist on the table i do think you might have told me the truth instead of a pack of silly stories about mama i put off a really rather good luncheon to come here and you offer me boiled onion soup memories flickered through charlottes mind for a moment the terrible corpse in the closed garden in callander square and standing side by side with emily paralyzed with fright when paul alaric found them at the end of the murders in paragon walk then she remembered the present again and all the tingle and beating of the blood vanished it is to do with mama she said soberly she served the soup and bread and sat down it will need salting i forgot do you recall monsieur alaric dont be a fool emily said with raised eyebrows she reached for the salt and sprinkled a little how could i possibly forget himeven if he were not still my neighbor he is one of the most charming men i have ever met he can converse upon almost any subject as if he were interested why on earth does society consider it fashionable to affect to be bored it is really very tedious she smiled you know i never really knew if he was aware quite how fascinated we all were by him did you how much do you think it was merely the challenge of his being a mystery and that each of us wished to outdo the other by winning his attentions only partly charlotte had him so clearly in her mind even now here in her own kitchen it had to be something more than that he was able to laugh at us and yet at the same time make us believe that he liked us indeed emilys eyes widened and her delicate nose flared a little i find that a most infuriating mixture and i am perfectly sure that selena at least desired of him a great deal more than simply to be liked friendship does not arouse that kind of excitement and discomfort in anyone he has become acquainted with mama charlotte hoped for a considerable reaction from emily she was disappointed em shyily was not interested this soup is really rather nice with salt in it she remarked with surprise but i shall have to sit at the far side of the room and shout at everyone you might have thought of that what if mama has met monsieur alaric society is very small mama carries a picture of him in her locket that had the desired effect emily dropped her spoon and stared appalled what did you say i dont believe it she couldnt be soso idiotic she was emily shut her eyes in relief but she stopped no the locket was lostprobably stolen a lot of small things have been stolen from around rutland placea silver buttonhook a gold chain a snuffbox but thats awful emilys eyes were wide and dark with anguish charlotte its simply dreadful i know the servant problem is bad but this is preposterous one owes it to ones friends to see at least that they are honest what if someone finds this locket and knows it is mamas with thatfrenchmanin it what would they say what would papa think exactly charlotte said and now mina spencerbrown is deadprobably murderedalmost next door to mama but she still doesnt mean to stop seeing him ive tried to dissuade her and it has been exactly as if she had not heard me havent you pointed out to her emily began incredulously of course i have charlotte cut her off before she could finish but did you ever take any notice of advice when you were in love emilys face fell dont be ridiculous what on earth do you mean in love mama is fiftytwo and she is married thats just years charlotte said sharply waving away the unimportance of time with her soup spoon i dont suppose one feels any different and to imagine that being married prevents you from falling in love is too naive for words if you are going to grasp at society with both hands emily at least practice some of its realism as well as its sophistry and silly manners emily shut her eyes and pushed her soup dish away charlotte its awful she said in a tight pained voice it would be total disaster have you any idea what happens to a woman who is known to bewithout morals oh it might be all right if it were with some earl or duke or something and one was important enough oneselfbut for someone like mama never papa could even divorce her oh dear heaven it would be the end for all of us i should never be received anywhere again is that all you care about charlotte said furiously being invited out cant you think about mama and how do you imagine papa would feel not to mention whatever it is that has happened to mina spencerbrown emilys face was white anger lost in a sudden sense of shame for her own thoughts you cant possibly think mama had anything to do with murder she said lowering her voice considerably thats inconceivable of course i dont charlotte said but its perfectly conceivable even probable that the murder had something to do with the thefts and that isnt all mama said she has had the feeling for some time that someone has been watching her spying on her that could have something to do with the murder as well two spots of color appeared in emilys cheeks why didnt you tell me about this before her indignation was back again embarrassment forgotten you should have sent for me straightaway i dont care how clever you think you are you should not have tried it on your own look what a mess you have let it grow into you have an overblown opinion of yourself charlotte just because you have stumbled on the truth in one or two of thomas cases you think you are so clever nobody can deceive you and look what you have allowed to happen now i didnt know it was murder until the day before i wrote to you charlotte kept her temper with difficulty she knew emily was frightened and she was also aware at the back of her mind that perhaps she had been a little overconfident of her own abilities it might really have been better if she had called emily sooner at least about caroline and paul alaric emily reached for her soup dish again this is cold i dont know why you cant have a craving for something reasonable like pickles when i was carrying i wanted strawberry jam i had it with everything will you add some more hot from the pan to this please charlotte stood up and ladled out some for both of them she put emilys in front of her then sat down to her own what shall we do she asked quietly emily looked back at her all the anger evaporated she was aware of her own selfishness but it was unnecessary for either of them that she should say so well we had better go immediately this afternoon and persuade mama of the danger she is in and stop her from seeing monsieur alaric againexcept in the most casual way as it is unavoidable of course we do not want to be obvious it would occasion talk then in case it has anything to do with the thefts and somebody has this wretched locket we had better see if we can find out who killed the womanspencerbrown i have enough money i can buy the locket back if it is blackmail charlotte was surprised would you do that emilys blue eyes widened of course i wouldwe should buy back the locket first then call in the police it wouldnt matter what they said afterwardswithout the locket nobody would believe them they would only damn themselves the further for malice we would destroy the picture and mama would deny it monsieur alaric would hardly contradict even if he is foreign he is most certainly a gentleman a shadow passed over emilys face unless of course it was he who killed mrs spencerbrown that paul alaric could be the murderer was an idea peculiarly repugnant to charlotte she had never really thought of him in that light even in paragon walk and it was sharp and ugly to do so now oh i dont think it could be he she said involuntarily emilys stare was very straight why not then perception flashed across her face she knew her sister too well for comfort indeed she had always had a disconcert shyingly acute judgment of most people both about what they wanted and even more uncomfortably why they wanted it it was a facility coupled with a sharp realism in her desires and the restraint to keep a still tongue in her head that had led to her considerable success in society charlotte had far more imagination but it lacked a bridle she failed to take account of social conventions and therefore many of the motives of others eluded her it was only when the darker more elemental and tragic passions were involved that she understood instinctively and often with a sharp and painful wave of pity why not emily repeated finishing her soup do you think that because he is handsome he is therefore decent dont be such a child you ought to know better than to imagine that simply because someone is attractive he is not capable of the most facile and disgusting things as well handsome people are often extremely selfish to be able to charm others is very dangerous to the character it comes as a shock sometimes an unacceptable one to find there is something you want and you may not have it he would not be the first simply to take it if he has been brought up to believe he has only to smile and people will do as he wishes for heavens sake charlotte remember selena she was totally spoiled by having been told she was a beauty you dont need to belabor the point charlotte interrupted her angrily i understand you perfectly i have met spoiled people too and i have not forgotten how everyone twittered over monsieur alaric he had only to show up and half the women in the walk made fools of themselves emily gave her a dry look her own memories less than entirely comfortable then you had better put on your best dress and we shall go and call on mama right away she said briskly before she goes out or receives anyone else we can hardly say what we have to unless we are alone caroline received them with surprise and delight my dears how marvelous do come in and sit down how wonderful to see you both she was dressed in the softest lavenderpink dress high to the throat with a fichu of lace falling gently at any other time charlotte would have envied her it a gown like that would have suited her wonderfully and far more important than the mere look of it would have made her feel beautiful now all she could think of was how flushed caroline was how gaiety and even excitement bubbled just beneath the surface she glanced across at emily and saw the chill of shock in her eyes emily do sit over here where i can see you caroline said cheerfully you havent been here for agesat least it seems like ages it is far too early for tea and i suppose you have had luncheon already onion soup emily said with a little wrinkle of her nose carolines face fell oh my dear whatever for emily reached for her bag opened it and took out her perfume she touched herself liberally with it and then offered it to charlotte mama charlotte tells me you have had some tragic happen shyings here lately she began ignoring the question of the soup im so sorry i wish you had written me i would like to have been here to offer some comfort to you considering how radiant caroline looked the remark seemed somewhat misplaced charlotte had never seen anyone less distressed caroline recollected herself rapidly oh yes mina spencer brown very sad indeedin fact quite tragic i cannot think what drove her to it i wish i had been able to help i feel awfully guilty but i had no idea at all there was anything wrong charlotte was conscious of the minutes ticking away mindful that early callers might come at any time after three she didnt kill herself she said brutally she was murdered there was total silence the light died from carolines face and her body hunched into itself suddenly she looked thinner murdered she repeated the word how could you know are you trying to frighten me charlotte it was precisely what she was trying to do but to admit it would rob at least half its effect thomas told me of course she answered she died of belladonna poisoning but the dose was far more than there had been in the house it must have come from somewhere outside no one else would give her poison for her to kill herself so it can only have been murder cant it i dont understand caroline shook her head why should anyone kill mina she did no harm to anyone she didnt have any money to leave nor was she in line to inherit anything so far as i know there was confusion in her face it doesnt make any sense alston is the last sort of man toto be having an affaire with another woman and wish to no its ridiculous her voice regained its conviction and she looked up thomas must have made a mistakethere is another explanation we simply have not found it yet she sat a little straighter in her chair she must have brought it from somewhere im sure if he looks thomas is an excellent policeman and he does not make mistakes emily said to charlottes amazement it was a very sweeping statement and less than true but emily continued regardless he will have thought of all those things if he says it is murder then it is we had best face it and conduct ourselves accordingly she opened her eyes wide and stared at caroline then shifted them a little unable to look at her and deal the final blow and of course that means police all over the place investigating everything and everyone there wont be any secrets left in the entire neighborhood caroline did not immediately understand she saw the unpleas shyantness of it indeed she could hardly have forgotten cater street and she saw the dangers to those closely involved with mina but not her own peril emily sat back her face tight with pity feeling a sense of guilt because she did not intend to be the one hurt mama she said slowly charlotte says you have lost a pendant and that it is of such a nature that you would prefer if you were not the one to find it that it was not found at all this is a time when the utmost discretion is necessary even quite innocent acts can look very odd if they become public and everyone in society begins to discuss them stories frequently grow in the telling you know they always grow in the telling charlotte thought miserably and almost without exception for the worseunless of course one is telling them oneself she wondered now if she tiad done the right thing in bringing emily here she might have said the same things herself but sitting and looking on listening it sounded so much harsher than she would have wished indeed it had a ring of selfishness to it as if it were emilys reputation that was the first fear and charlotte were merely selfrighteous and inquisitive carried away with her own imagination of herself as a detective they had not been very subtle she looked across at emily and saw the pink in her skin warm even up to her eyes and she knew that emily was sud shydenly conscious of it too charlotte leaned forward and clasped carolines hands they were stiff and she made no effort to respond mama charlotte said we must find out all we can about minas death so that the investigation can be over with before there is time for thomas or anyone else to start thinking about other peoples lives she must have been killed for some reason either love or hate jealousy greedsomething she let out her breath in a sharp little noise or most probably fear mina was clever you said that she was worldly wise she observed a lot maybe she knew something about somebody that was worth killing to hide there is a thief here that is inescapable perhaps mina knew who the thief was and was foolish enough to let the person see that she knew or maybe she was the thief herself and stole something someone would kill to retrieve emily rushed in glad to have something practical to say to overlay the emotions for goodness sake hasnt thomas searched the house he should have thought of that its simple enough of course he has charlotte snapped then realized how her voice sounded she did not need to defend thomas emily thought well enough of him and in her own way liked him considerably they didnt find anything she continued at least not anything they could understand to be important but if we ask questions and investigate a little we may perceive things that they could not people are not going to tell the police more than they can help are they of course not emily said eagerly but they wih talk to us and we can hear things thomas would notinflections liesbecause we know the people thats quite definitely what we must do mama we shall come calling with you this afternoon immediately where shall we begin caroline smiled bleakly there was no point in fighting with alston spencerbrown charlotte replied for her we shall express our deepest sympathy and shock it would be quite appropriate we will be overcome with the tragedy and not able to think of anything else of course emily said standing up and pulling her skirt into the order she wished it i am quite desolated you didnt even know her caroline pointed out emily looked at her coolly one must be practical mama i have met her at several soirees i was most fond of her indeed i am convinced we were just at the beginning of a long and intimate friendship he is not to know the difference what did she look like i will appear foolish if i do not recognize a portrait or a photograph although i could always say i was shortsighted but i dont wish to do that then i should have to fall over things to make it seem true caroline shut her eyes and put her fingers wearily over them she was about your height she said but very slender almost thin and she had a very long neck she looked younger than she was she was fair with an excellent complexion what about her features and her hair oh she had regular enough featuresa little small perhaps and very soft hair sort of light mouse she was really quite charming when she chose and she dressed excellently nearly always in pale shades especially creams very clever of her it gave her an air of delicate innocence that appeals to men good emily said then we are ready to go we dont want to be there with a whole lot of other people we must not stay too long or we will make him suspicious but we must see him alone goodness i hope he is receiving he hasnt taken to his bed or anything i dont think so caroline stood up reluctantly i suppose i would have heard if he had servants always talk charlotte saw the hesitation in her the desire even now to escape the necessity you must come mama we can hardly go alone it would be most awkward you are the only one who knows him i am coming caroline said wearily but i wont pretend i wish to this whole thing is horribly ugly and i wish we had nothing to do with it i wish it had been suicide and we could let her rest in peacebe sorry but not keep on thinking about it i daresay emily said a little sharply but we cant and if we wish to have an acceptable outcome to the affair then we must make it for ourselves charlotte is perfectly right charlotte resented the implication that the whole thing was her idea but there was nothing to be gained by arguing now she followed them out obediently alston spencerbrown received them in a traditionally dark shyened room all the blinds were drawn halfway down the windows and there was black crepe around the mirror several of the photographs and on the piano he himself was dressed in the soberest clothes the only touch of relief the white of his shirt how kind of you to call he said in a small voice he looked stunned shorter and narrower than charlotte had imag shyined him the least we could do caroline murmured unhappily as they accepted the seats he offered we were very fond of mina alston looked a little questioningly at emily obviously not sure who she was or why she was there emily lied without blinking an eye she was very good at it indeed we were she said with a sad smile very fond i met her at several soirees and she was quite charming we were just getting to know one another and found we had so much in common she was such a discerning person indeed she was alston said with a lift of surprise that emily should have noticed a most perceptive woman exactly emily put a wealth of understanding into the word she saw so much that passed by other less sensitive people do you think so charlotte looked from one to the other of them oh yes alston nodded im afraid poor mina was fre shyquently too astute for her own happiness she was able to see in others traits and qualities that were not always attractive he shook his head not always to their credit he sighed heavily and stared from emily to caroline and back again i daresay you observed that yourselves of course emily sat straightbacked rather prim but one cannot help a certainshe hesitated delicatelywisdom in the ways of the world if one has the intelligence to possess it im sure i never heard mina speak ill of people for all that she was not a gossip no he said flatly no she knew how to keep her own counsel poor creature perhaps that was her undoing j charlotte took up the thread before the conversation became j maudlin mina had had a sly tongue even if emily had not had the wit to guess as much but it is almost impossible not to hear things charlotte was surprised to hear her voice continue in precisely the same tone and to see them also if one lives in a small area where everyone sees everyone else i remember quite clearly poor mrs spencerbrown speaking with great sympathyshe gulped on the words hypocrite of the death of mrs charringtons daughter that must have been a dreadful shock and one cannot help but wonder what awful event occurred even if only to know what comfort to offer caroline sat up at a sharp poke from emily yes indeed caroline said no one knows what it was that struck her down so suddenly quite appalling i recall minas mentioning it she was very perceptive alston repeated she knew there was something terribly wrong therefar more than met the eye most people were fooled you know but not mina there was a perverse ring of pride in him she noticed everything his face put on a sober look of course she never spoke except to me but she knew that the charringtons had some tragedy that they dared not speak of she said to me more than once that she would not be surprised if ottilie met her death by violence of course the family would conceal it if it happened somewhere else where we did not see i mean if it were shameful charlottes mind raced did he mean another murder murder by a lover perhaps or had ottilie died bearing an illegitimate childor worse than that as the result of a badly executed abortion or could she have been found in some appalling place a mans bedroomor even a brothel could one die of a socially vile disease at such a young age she thought not surely death by such things was long and very slow a matter of years but one could discover one had contracted itand perhaps even be quietly suffocated by ones own family before the ravages became obvious they were obscene thoughts but not impossible and any one of them worth killing forif mina had been foolish enough to let her knowledge be seen emily was talking again trying to draw out more details without betraying a vulgar curiosity they had passed from ottilie charrington before it became too indiscreet and were now discussing theodora von schenck charlotte and caroline had prepared emily thoroughly of course emily said nodding sagaciously mysteries always make for gossip it is bound to follow i cannot blame mina in the least i confess to wondering myself how theodora has so improved her circumstances you must admitit lacks an explanation she leaned forward expectantly it is only hu shyman to speculate you must not feel badly for it charlotte blushed for her and at the same time felt a little tinge of pride she really was very adroit alston rose to the temptation perfectly oh that is where mina was so perceptive he said with an air of sad satisfaction she did not speak of it because she was very discreet you knownot in the least uncharitable but she saw a great deal and it is my private belief that she knew the truthabout a number of things he sat back looking from one to another of them emilys eyes widened at the marvel do you really think so you know she never whispered a word of it oh how i admire her restraint an ugly squalid idea intruded into charlottes mind and would not be dismissed she too sat forward staring at alston her face hot with the repugnance of the thought inside her she must have been very observant she said quietly she must have seen a great deal oh yes alston said it was remarkable how much she saw i am afraid a great deal must have passed by me without my having the least idea of it suddenly memories overwhelmed him and he was riddled with guilt because his blindness might have held him from preventing the ultimate tragedy if only he also had seen and understood then mina might not have been murdered it was plain in his face in the puckering and down shyturn of his mouth and the evasion of his eyes as they filled with embarrassing tears charlotte could not bear it even though she thought she knew the truth and there was as much anger as pity in her for mina she leaned forward and without selfconsciousness put her hand on alstons sleeve but as you remarked and indeed as we all know she said firmly she was no gossip she was far too wise to repeat her observations i am sure you are the only one who had any idea of herperceptions do you think so he looked at her eagerly seeking to be absolved from the blame for blindness i should so dislike to think sheshe gossiped one shouldprevent such things of course she reassured do you not agree mama emily oh yes they answered although she knew from their eyes that they had only a partial idea of what they were supposed to mean by it charlotte took her hand from his sleeve and stood up now that she had learned as much as he knew she wanted to leave it seemed indecent to stay here muttering sympathy that did not help knowing that none of them really cared except quite impersonally as they would have for anyone emily stayed firmly in her seat you must take great care of yourself she said with concern looking directly at alston of course you cannot go out for some time it would not be appropriate and i am sure you would have no desire to emily knew her social conventions perfectly but you must not permit yourself to become ill caroline stiffened her hands tightening on the arms of her chair she stared across at charlotte charlotte felt her own muscles knot was emily hinting at another murder alstons eyes widened and his grief was swallowed entirely by fear before anyone could collect decent words to say that would not make the appalling thought irretrievable the parlormaid opened the door and announced that monsieur alaric had called and would mr spencerbrown receive him alston muttered something incoherent which the girl took to be assent and after a moments agonized silence in which charlotte glanced at emily but dared not look at caroline paul alaric came in good afternoon he hesitated obviously the maid had not warned him that there were other guests mrs ellison mrs pitt he turned to emily but before he could speak alston rose hastily to the occasion collecting himself in some relief at a clearcut social duty lady ashworth may i present monsieur paul alaric he turned to alaric lady ashworth is mrs ellisons younger daughter alaric shot a glance at charlotte brilliant with inquiry then in perfect soberness he took the hand emily offered him how charming to see you lady ashworth i hope you are well quite well thank you emily replied coolly we called to express our sympathy to mr spencerbrown since we have done so perhaps we should allow you to pay your visit uninhib shyited by the necessity of making courteous conversation with us she rose gracefully and gave him a smile that was barely more than good manners charlotte rose also she had been on the point of excusing them when the parlormaid had come to announce alaric come mama she said briskly perhaps we may call upon mrs charrington i did so like her but caroline remained seated really my dear she leaned back in her chair and smiled if we depart the moment mon shysieur alaric arrives he will think us most uncivil there is plenty of time yet for other calls emily caught charlottes eye with a sudden appreciation of the perverseness that faced them then she turned back to her mother im sure monsieur alaric will not think ill of us this time she flashed a charming smile at him it is sensibility for mr spencerbrown that makes us withdraw and not a lack of wish for monsieur alarics company we must think first of others and not of ourselves is that not so charlotte of course it is charlotte agreed quickly i am sure that if i were feeling distressed there would be times when the company of my own sex would be especially valuable to me she also turned and smiled at alaric and was a little disconcerted to see his eyes bright and faintly puzzled regarding her so closely i should be flattered beyond the point of vanity maam to believe any man would prefer my company to yours he said with a softness in his voice although whether it was irony or merely humor she could not tell then perhaps a little of each charlotte suggested with her eyebrows raised even the sweetest things become boring after a while and one longs for a variety the sweetest things he murmured and this time she knew unquestionably that he was laughing at her although there was nothing to show it in his face and she believed it was lost upon everyone else in the room let alone those with considerable acid to them she said alston had not followed the conversation but his innate good manners overrode his confusion there was an ease in convention the comfort of knowing the rules i cannot imagine wishing you to leave any of you his gesture embraced them all please do remain a little longer you have been so kind caroline accepted immediately and there was nothing char shylotte or emily could do but reseat themselves and with as rnuch grace as they could muster begin a new conversation caroline made it easy for them from being merely polite and silently sympathetic suddenly she was glowing her intensity reaching out until it could be felt throughout the room we were just encouraging mr spencerbrown to take the best care of himself she said warmly looking from alston to alaric it is so easy in ones grief for someone one has loved to forget oneself i am sure you will be able to help him more than we can that is why i called alaric said social gatherings are unacceptable naturally but to remain alone inside the house makes everything harder to bear he turned to alston i thought in the next few days you might like to come for a carriage ride it can be very pleasant if the weather is fine and you would not be required to meet anyone do you think i should alston seemed uncertain why not everyone must bear grief in his own manner and those who wish you well will not grudge you whatever ease you can find music pleases me and contemplating the great works of art whose beauty survives the life and death of their creators to reach out to all pain and all aspiration i would be happy to accompany you to any gallery you chooseor anywhere else do you not think people might expect me to remain in alston frowned anxiously at least until after the funeral that is not for several days yet you know friday yes he blinked of course you know how foolish of me would you care for me to ride with you alaric asked quietly i shall not be in the least offended if you would like to be alone but i rather think if i were in such a situation i should prefer not to be the crease ironed out across alstons brow would you that really is most generous of you charlotte was thinking the same thing and it annoyed her she would much rather have disapproved of paul alaric and have had grounds in her mind for doing so she glanced side shyways at caroline and saw the radiance in her eyes the softness of approval then she looked at emily and knew that she had seen it also how kind of you emily said with an edge to her voice that had far more to do with her own fears than any concern for alston i am sure it is a most excellent act companionship is invaluable at such a time i recall when i was bereaved it was the company of my mother and my sister that gave me the most comfort charlotte had no idea what she was talking aboutsurely not sarahs death that had affected them all equallybut she knew of no other bereavement emily continued regardless and i see no reason why you should not take a small drive if monsieur alaric is good enough to offer his company for that also no one of any sensibility at allno one who could possibly matterwould misunderstand that she lifted her chin people do misconstrue some associations of course but that is more often so when it is a friendship between a lady and a gentleman then people are bound to talk no matter how innocent it may be in truth do you not agree monsieur alaric charlotte watched him closely to see if she could detect in his face even the faintest degree of comprehension of what they really meant the purpose under their superficial words he remained completely at ease seemingly his attention was still upon alston there are always those who will think evil lady ash worth he answered her whatever the circumstances one cannot possibly afford to cater to all of them one must satisfy ones own conscience and observe the most obvious conventions so as not to offend unnecessarily i believe that is all beyond that i think one should please oneself he turned to charlotte his eyes penetrating as if he understood in some sense that she would have said exactly the same were she to be truthful do you not agree mrs pitt she was caught in a dilemma she hated equivocation and her own tongue had caused enough social disasters to make anything but concurrence with him laughable also she would like to have been agreeable because there was a quality in him far beyond elegance or even intellect which drew hera reserve of emo shytion as yet unreached that fascinated like a thunderstorm or the splendor of a rising wind far out at sea dangerous and over shywhelmingly beautiful she shut her eyes then opened them wide i think that can be a very selfish indulgence monsieur alaric she said with primness that made her sick even as she was speaking much as one would like to on occasion one cannot ignore society if it were ever to be only oneself who paid the price for outraging peoples sensibilities no matter how misplaced it would be quite a different matter but it is not gossip also hurts the innocent more often than not we are none of us alone there are families upon whom every stain rubs off the notion that you can please yourself without harming others is an illusion and a most immature one too many people use it as an excuse for all manner of selfindulgences and then plead ignorance and total amazement when others are dragged down with them as if it could not have been foreseen with an ounce of sense she stopped for breath not daring to look at any of them least of all at alaric bravo emily whispered so softly that to the others it must have seemed as if she were no more than sighing charlotte caroline was stunned unable to think what to say how very perceptive of you emily rushed in to fill the hot silence and you have expressed it so well it is a subject which has long needed some plain speaking we delude our shyselves so often to give us excuse for all sorts of behavior perhaps i should not since you are my sister but i do so commend your honesty since it was a precept charlotte had been the last to obey in her own life emilys remark could only be ironic although there was nothing but translucent candor in her blue eyes now charlotte beamed at her daggers in her mind thank you she said sweetly you flatter me she stood up and now i at least must leave or i shall not have left myself time to call upon mrs charrington and i do find her so charming do you care to come with me mama or shall i tell her that you felt it your duty to remain here with mr spencerbrownand monsieur alaric since it was manifestly ridiculous for caroline to think any shything of the sort she had no alternative but to rise as well of course not she said tartly i should be delighted to come with you i am very fond of ambrosine and would like very much to call upon her i must introduce her to emily or do you know her already as well she added waspishly emily was not in the least deterred no i dont believe i do but charlotte has spoken of her so kindly i have been looking forward to meeting her that was also untrue charlotte had never mentioned her but it was an excellent parting line alaric stood up very straight shoulders beautifully square a flicker of the old laughter in his eyes seeing them all so clearly as a foreigner sometimes does you will find her unique he said with a little bow and above all things never ever a bore such a rare quality charlotte murmured blushing never to be boring caroline lost her temper in frustration and reached out to kick charlotte underneath her skirts she missed but the second time she caught her sharply on the ankle the corners of her mouth lifted with satisfaction quite she said then she looked at alston who had also risen to bid them goodbye if there is anything we can do please do let me know curiously she did not mention edward except by implication we are so close by and would be happy in any help or comfort we could offer perhaps in practical arrangements how very kind of you alston replied i should be most grateful charlotte looked straight at alaric and met his eyes she took a deep breath im sure if you felt my father could offer you any help with regard to your assistance at the funeral he would be delighted to do so she lifted her chin perhaps he should call upon you and see what would be convenient we have suffered bereave shyments ourselves and he is a most sensitive person i am quite convinced you would like him she did not look away al shythough she could feel the heat creeping up her face at last she was rewarded by an answering flash of understand shying in the depths of alarics eyes and a slow color under his skin indeed his voice was very quiet i respect your purpose mrs pitt i shall consider it gravely she tried to smile and failed thank you they said their formal farewells and walked to the entrance where the parlormaid was waiting alston having rung for her both doors were opened so that they might pass through without being forced into single file charlotte turned as they stepped into the hall and found to her considerable embarrassment that paul alaric was still facing them and his eyes wide and black were not on caroline or emily who had also looked back but upon herself the last thing she wanted was to look at caroline yet she found herself doing precisely that the gaze that met hers was of one woman to another no more they might never have met before the only element there was the sudden and complete knowledge of rivalry charlotte could hardly wait until pitt returned she made the easiest of meals placed it in the oven to cook itself and then flitted from one job to another accomplishing nothing it was quarter past six when at last she heard the front door open and she instantly dropped the linen cloth in her hand and ran from the kitchen to meet him usually she forced herself to let him come to the warmth of the big cooking range take off his coat and sit down before speaking to him of the day but this time she shouted as soon as his foot was in the passage thomas thomas i saw alston spencerbrown today and i discovered something she ran down the corridor and grasped at both his hands i think i know something about mina perhaps why she was killed he was wet and tired and not in the best of moods his superiors were still clinging to the belief that it must have been suicide while the balance of her mind was upset by some private distress it could all be so much more decently disposed of and without turning over a lot of peoples lives to investigate affairs that were far preferably left alone uncovering causes for enmity was always an ugly and unpopular occupation and seldom prof shyited the career of whoever undertook itat least not if he was of a rank sufficiently advanced that there was no validity in the shield that he was merely following orders pitts superior dudley athelstan was a younger son who had married well and had an ambition that fed on its own success he had spent the latter part of the day trying to persuade pitt that there was no case to investigate there were any number of ways an unbalanced woman might come by sufficient poison to take her own life if that was what she had determined to do when pitt had left him athelstan had been in growing illhumor because he could not convince even himself let alone pitt and sergeant harris that the matter had been answered beyond reasonable doubt for no chemist or apothecary could be found who had sold such a substance and certainly no doctor had prescribed it no matter how diligently they had searched now pitt started to undo his coat it was dripping in the hallway and the day before he had received a very wounded and sober criticism from gracie about the amount of labor it took to get the floor to its degree of polish without inconsiderate people spilling water all over it why did you go and see alston spencerbrown he in shyquired a little sourly hes surely nothing to do with you or your mother charlotte could feel the irritation in him as if he had brought the cold in from the street but she was too excited to take heed the murder is to do with mama she said briskly taking the coat and putting it on a hook to drip further instead of carrying it through to the kitchen to dry we have to get the locket back anyway emily wanted to visit mama and i went with her if the flame of the gas lamp in the hallway had been brighter he might have seen her blush at the halftruth she turned and walked smartly back to the kitchen and the fire mama went to call upon him to express her sympathy she explained anyway thats not important she swung around and faced him i know at least one good reason why mina spencerbrown might have been killedmaybe two she waited glowing with excitement i can think of a dozen he said soberly but no proof for any of them it never lacked possibilities but they are not enough superintendent athelstan wants the case closed suicide leaves them decently alone with their grief not possibilities she burst out with impatience i mean real reasons do you remember i told you mama said she felt as if she were being followed watched all the time no he said honestly i told you mama was aware of someonemost of the time and ambrosine charrington said the same thing well i believe it was mina she spied on peopleshe was what is called a peeping tom alston said so in a roundabout sort of way although of course he didnt realize what he was meaning dont you see thomas if she followed someone with a secret a real secret she may have learned something that was worth killing over and i know from alston of at least two possibilities he sat down and took off his wet boots what dont you believe me she had expected him to receive the news eagerly and now he looked as if he were listening only to humor her he was too tired to be polite i think your mothers affaire is probably not as serious as you imagine plenty of people have a little flirtation especially society women who have little else to do you should know that by now i expect its all dropped handkerchiefs and bunches of flowersabout as real as a piece of embroidery and i daresay if anyone was watching her it was only out of boredom you are making too much of it charlotte if she were not your mother you would take no notice she restrained herself with great difficulty for a moment she considered losing her temper telling him that the outward show might be trivial but the feeling underneath was as real and as potentially violent as anything conducted in the back streets or in less naturally restricted levels of society then she realized how tired he was how discouraged by athelstans desire to hide or ignore what did not suit his ambition anger would communi shycate nothing would you like a cup of tea she said instead looking at his wet feet and the white skin of his hands where the cold had numbed the circulation without waiting for an answer she topped up the kettle and moved it from the back of the stove onto the front after a few moments silence while he put on dry socks he looked up what are these two possibilities she heated the teapot and measured out the tea theodora von schenck has an income lately acquired which nobody can account for her husband left her nothing nor did anyone else apparently when she came to rutland place she had nothing but the house now she has coats with sable collars and mina perhaps put forward some very interesting speculations as to where they might have come from like what he inquired she jiggled the teapot impatiently while the kettle blew faint halfhearted whiffs of steam hot but not yet boiling a brothel charlotte answered or a lover or blackmail there are all sorts of things worth killing to hide where money is concerned maybe theodora was blackmailing people with minas information and they had a fight over the money he smiled sourly indeed your mina seems to have had a most uncharitable turn of imagination and a tongue to go with it are you sure that is what she said and not what you are thinking for her alston remarked several times on how perceptive she was of other peoples characters especially the less pleasant aspects of them but he also said that she never spoke of them to anyone but him she reached for the kettle at last however that is the less likely possibility of the two i think the other possibil shyity i remember mina mentioning myself and with a kind of relish as if she knew something she poured the water onto the tea and put on the lid then brought the pot to the table and set it on the polished pewter stand she let it brew while she went on it has to do with the death of ottilie charrington which was sudden and unexplained one week she was in perfect health and the next the family returned from a holiday in the country and said she was dead just like that no one ever said from what cause no one was invited to any funeral and she was never mentioned again mina apparently hinted that there was something very shameful about itperhaps a badly done abortion she shivered and thought of jemima asleep upstairs in her pink cot or she was murdered by a lover or in some unbearable place like a brothel or possibly even she did some shything so terrible that her own family murdered her to keep it silent pitt looked at her gravely without speaking she poured the tea and passed him his cup i know it sounds violent and unlikely she went on but then i suppose murder always is unlikelyuntil it actually happens andmina was murdered wasnt she you know now that she didnt kill herself no he sipped the tea and burned his mouth his hands were too numb for him to have realized its heat no i think someone else put poison into the cordial wine we found in her stomach in the autopsy we found the dregs in the empty bottle in her bedroom and a glass it was just chance she took it when she did it could have been anytime she felt like it it could have been anyone who put it there anytime not if they wanted to silence her charlotte pointed out if you are afraid of someone you want them dead before they speak which means as soon as possible thomas i really do believe she was a peeping tom the more i think about it the more it makes sense she peeped once too often and saw some shything that cost her her life she stared down into her tea watching the vapor curl off it and rise gently i wonder if people who get murdered are usually unpleasant if they have some flaw in them that invites murder i mean people that arent killed for money of course like shakespearean tragic heroes one fatal deformity of soul that mars all the rest that might have been good she stirred her tea although there was no sugar in it the steam curled thicker curiosity killed the cat if mina had not wanted to know so much about everybody i wonder if she knew about monsieur alaric and mamas locket oddly enough she was not afraid caroline was foolish but there was neither the viciousness nor the fear in her to make her kill and paul alaric had no reason to he looked up sharply and too late she realized she had not mentioned alarics name before of course pitt could not have forgotten him from paragon walk at one time they had sus shypected him of murder or worse alaric he said slowly searching her face she felt herself flush and was furious it was caroline who was behaving foolishly she charlotte had done nothing indiscreet monsieur alaric is the man whose picture mama has in the locjket she said defensively looking straight back at him and then because his eyes were too clear too wise she turned away and stirred her sugarless tea vigorously once again she tried to sound casual did i not mention that no she knew he was still watching her noyou didnt oh she kept her eyes on the swirling tea well he is there were several moments of silence indeed he said at last well im afraid we didnt find the locketor any of the other stolen things for that matter and if mina was a peeping tom stealing for the sake of a sick need to know about other people to possess something of them he saw her shudder and he gave a sigh isnt that what you are saying that she was abnormal perverted i suppose so he tried his tea again and of course there is the other possibility he added maybe she knew who the thief was how tragic and ridiculous she said with sudden anger someone dying over a few silly things like a locket and a buttonhook lots of people have died for less the rookeries came to his mind with their teeming misery and need some for a shilling some by accident for something they didnt have or in mistake for somebody else she sipped her tea are you going to investigate it she said at last theres no choice ill see what i can find out about ottilie charrington poor soul i hate digging through other peoples wretched tragedies it must be bad enough to lose a daughter without the police unburying every indiscretion putting every love or hate under a magnifying glass no one wants to be seen so clearly but the following morning the necessity was just as plain if charlotte was right and mina had been inquiring peeping at other people then it was more than probable that some knowl shyedge gained that way had been the cause of her death he had heard before of people outwardly normal people often respectable who were diseased with a compulsion to watch others to pry into intimate things to follow to lift curtains aside even to open letters and listen at doors this compulsion always led to dislike and fear often to imprisonment it was inevitable that one day it would bring about murder also he could hardly start by going directly to the charringtons there was no excuse for him to question them about their daughters death so long after the event unless he were to tell them of his suspicions and that was obviously impossible at this point it might be slander at best and on so tenuous a thread they would have no obligation to answer him even so instead he went back to mulgrew the doctor had attended most of the families of rutland place and if he had not known ottilie himself he would almost certainly be able to tell pitt who had filthy day mulgrew greeted him cheerfully owe you a couple of handkerchiefs obliged to you act of a gentleman how are you come in and dry yourself he waved his arms to conduct pitt along the hallway streets like a river or perhaps i should say a gutter whats wrong now not sick are you cant cure a cold you know or backache no one can at least if someone can ive not met him he led the way back to an overcrowded room full of photographs and mementos bookcases on every wall cascades of papers and folios sliding off tables and stools a large labrador lay asleep in front of the fire no im not sick pitt followed him with a feeling of relief even elation suddenly the ugly things became more bearable the darkness he must probe less full of shapeless fear but rather known things things that could be endured sit down mulgrew waved an arm widely oh tip the cat off she always gets on there the moment my back is turned pity she has so much white in herdamn white hairs stick to my pants dont mind do you pitt eased the little animal off the chair and sat down smiling not at all thank you mulgrew sat opposite him well if youre not sick what is it not mina spencerbrown again thought we proved she died of belladonna the little cat curled itself around pitts legs purring gently then hopped up onto his knees and wound itself into a knot face hidden and fell asleep instantly pitt touched it with pleasure charlotte had wanted a cat he must get her one one like this are you physician to the charringtons as well he asked mulgrews eyes opened wide in surprise throw her off if you want he said pointing to the cat yes i am why nothing wrong with any of them is there not so far as i know except that their daughter died did you know her ottilie yes lovely girl his face retreated quite suddenly into lines of heavy sorrow one of the saddest things i know her death miss her lovely girl pitt was aware of a genuine grief not the professional sadness of a doctor who loses a patient but a sense of personal bereavement of some happiness that no longer existed he was embarrassed to have to continue he had not expected emotion he had been prepared only for thought academic investigation the mystery of murder was ephemeral even paltry it was the emotions the fire of pain and the long wastelands afterward that were real his hands found the cats warm little body again and he stroked it softly comforting himself as much as pleasing the animal what caused her death he asked mulgrew looked up i dont know she didnt die here somewhere in the countryhertfordshire but you were the family physician didnt they tell you what it was no they said very little didnt seem to want to talk about it natural i suppose shock grief takes people differently it was very sudden i understand mulgrew was looking into the fire his eyes away from pitts seeing something he could not share yes no warning at all and they didnt tell you what it was no didnt you ask i suppose i must have all i can really remember was the shock and how nobody spoke of it almost as if by not putting it into words they could undo it stop it from being real i didnt press them how could i but as far as you know she was perfectly well at the time she left rutland place pitt inquired mulgrew looked at him at last one of the healthiest i know why obviously it matters to you or you wouldnt be here asking so many questions do you imagine it has something to do with mrs spencerbrown i dont know its one of several possibilities what kind of possibility mulgrews face creased in pain ottilie was eccentric even in bad taste to many but there was nothing evil in her she was one of the most truly generous people i ever knew i mean generous with her timeshe was never too busy to listen if she thought someone needed to talk and generous with her praiseshe didnt grudge appreciation or envy other peoples successes so mulgrew had loved her in whatever manner pitt did not need to know more the warmth in mulgrews voice told of the loss still hurting him twisting an emptiness inside it made pitts own thoughts prompted by charlotte the more painful it was sharp enough for him to lie he needed to think about it a little come to it by degrees he did not look at mulgrew when he spoke from evidence ive just heardhe measured his words slowlyit seems possible that mina spencerbrown was inordi shynately curious about other peoples affairs that she listened and peeped does that seem likely to you mulgrews eyes widened and he stared at pitt but he did not answer for several minutes the fire crackled and on pitts knees the cat woke and started kneading him gently with her claws absentmindedly he eased her up to rest on his jacket where she could not reach her claws through to his flesh yes mulgrew said at last never occurred to me before but she was a watcher never missed a thing sometimes people do that knowledge gives them an illusion of power i suppose it becomes compulsive mina could have been one of them intelligent woman but an empty lifeone stupid prattling party after another poor creature he leaned forward and put another piece of coal on the fire all day every day and not really necessary anywhere what a bloody stupid thing to die for some piece of information acquired through idiotic curiosity no use to you at all he turned his face away from the firelight and you think it had something to do with ottilie charrington i dont know apparently mina thought her death was a mystery hinting that there was a great deal more to it than had been told and that she knew what it was stupid sad cruel woman mulgrew said quietly what on earth did she imagine it was i dont know the possibilities are legion he did not want to spell them out and hurt this man still more but he had to mention at least one if only to discount it a badly done abortion for example mulgrew did not move i believe not he said very levelly i cannot swear to it but i believe not do you have to pursue it at least enough to satisfy myself it is wrong then ask her brother inigo charrington they were always close dont ask lovell hes a pompous idiotcant see further than the quality of print on a calling card ottilie drove him frantic she used to sing songs from the music hallsgod only knows where she learned them sang one on a sunday once drinking song it was something about beernot even a decent claret ambrosine called me in she thought lovell was going to take a seizure purple to the hair he was poor fool at any other time pitt would have laughed but the knowledge that ottilie was dead perhaps murdered robbed the anecdote of any humor pity he said quietly we get so many of our priorities wrong and never know it until afterwards when it doesnt matter anymore thank you ill speak to inigo he stood up and put the little cat on the warm spot where he had been sitting she stretched and curled up again totally content mulgrew shot to his feet but that cant be all if mina wretched woman was a peeping tom she must have seen other thingsgod knows what affaires at least theres more than one butler around here should lose his job that i know ofand more than one parlormaid if her mistress knew of it pitt pulled a face i daresay ill have to look at them all by the way did you know there is a sneak thief in rutland place oh god that too no i didnt know but it doesnt surprise me it happens every now and then not a servant one of the residents oh my god mulgrews face fell are you sure beyond reasonable doubt what a wretched business i suppose it couldnt have been mina herself yes it could or it could have been her murderer i thought my job was foul at times id a damned sight rather have it than yours i think i would too at the moment pitt said unfortunately we cant chop and change i couldnt do yours even if you were willing to trade thanks for your help come back if i can do anything mulgrew put out his hand and pitt clasped it hard a few minutes later he was outside again in the rain it took him two and a half hours to find inigo charrington by which time it was past noon and inigo was at the dining table in his club pitt was obliged to wait in the smoking room under the disapproving eye of a dyspeptic steward who kept clearing his throat with irritating persistence till pitt found he was counting the seconds each time waiting for him to do it again finally inigo came in and was informed in hushed tones of pitts presence he came over to him his face a mixture of amusement at the stewards dilemmaand his own as other eyes were raised to stare at himand apprehension about what pitt might want inspector pitt he dropped rather sharply into the chair opposite from the police yes sir pitt regarded him with interest he was slender not more than thirty at the most with an odd quicksilver face and auburn hair something else happened inigo said anxiously no sir pitt regretted having alarmed him somehow he could not picture him having murdered his sister or mina either to keep a scandal quiet there was too much sheer humor in his face no nothing at all that i am aware of but we have still not found any satisfactory answer as to how mrs spencerbrown met her death there seems no explanation so far that makes either accident or suicide possible oh indigo sat back a little i suppose that means it could only have been murder poor soul indeed and i daresay a great deal more pain will be caused before the business is finished inigo looked at him gravely i imagine so what do you want me for i dont think i know anything i certainly didnt know mina very well his mouth turned down in a sour smile i didnt have any reason to kill her although i suppose you can hardly take my word for that i wouldnt be likely to tell you so if i had pitt found himself smiling back hardly what i was hoping for was information he could not afford to be direct inigo was far too quick he would anticipate suspicion and cover any trace of real worth about mina youd do much better asking some of the womeneven my mother shes rather absentminded at times and she gets her gossip a little twisted but underneath it all shes a pretty shrewd judge of character she may get her facts wrong but her feelings are invariably right i shall ask her pitt said but she might speak considera shybly more freely to me if i had approached you first normally ladies such as mrs charrington do not confide their opinions of their neighbors to the police inigos face softened into mercurial laughter gone in an instant very tactfully put inspector i imagine they dont although mama has a taste for the bizarre ill mention it to her this evening she might surprise you and tell you all sorts of things although quite honestly she isnt really a gossip not enough malice in her she used to like to shock people occasionally when she was younger got bored with everyone repeating the same rubbish evening after evening at the same partiesjust different dresses and different houses but all the same con shyversations bit like tillie tillie pitt was lost my sisterottilie better not repeat that my father used to go into an apoplexy when i called her tillie when we were children and she liked to shock people pitt quickly asked loved it never heard anyone laugh like tillie it was beautiful rich the sort of laughter that you have to join in with even if you have no idea what was funny she sounds like a delightful person im sorry i shall not meet her he found it was far more than a sympathetic platitude he meant what he said ottilie was something good that he had missed inigos eyes widened for a moment as if he did not understand then he let out a little sigh oh yes you would have liked her everything seems rather colder now shes gone not the same color in things but that isnt what youre here for what do you want to know i understand she died very suddenly yes why it must have been a great shock im sorry thank you those fevers can be very suddenno warning he tried experimentally what oh yes very but this must be wasting your time what about mina spencerbrown she certainly didnt die of a fever and tillie wasnt given belladonna for treatment i can assure you anyway we were in the country at the time not here you have a country house abbots langley in hertfordshire he smiled but you wont find any belladonna there we all have excellent digestions need to some of the cooks weve had if papa chooses them we have all soups and sauces and if mama does then pies and pastries pitt felt intrusive how could anyone like being a peeping tom i wasnt thinking of belladonna he said honestly i am looking for reasons somewhere mrs spencerbrown must have given somebody cause to want her dead finding the belladonna is less important is it inigos eyebrows rose dont you want to know who more than why of course i do but anyone could make belladonna out of deadly nightshade theres plenty of it about in these old gardens it could have been picked anywhere its not like strychnine or cyanide that most people would have to buy inigo winced what a terrible thoughtgoing out to get something to kill people he paused for a moment but i honestly havent any idea why someone should kill mina i didnt especially like her i always thought she was toohe searched for the word he wantedtoo deliberate too clever all head and no heart she was thinking all the time never missed anything i prefer people who are either stupider or less permanently interested then if i do something idiotic it can be decently forgotten he smiled a little crookedly but you hardly go out and distill poison for someone because you dont like them very much i couldnt even say i disliked herjust that i was not entirely comfortable when she was there which wasnt very of ten it all fitted so easily with what charlotte had said slid into the pattern and coalesced a watcher a listener adding everything together in her mind working out answers understanding things that were intimate but how and for whom had not entirely comfortable changed into intolerable he wanted to think of a useful question something to make inigo believe he was asking about mina not ottilie i never saw her alive was she attractiveto men inigos face creased with spontaneous laughter not very subtle inspector no she wasntnot to me i like something a little less schooled and with more humor if you ask around the place no doubt you will be told my taste runs to the warmhearted slightly eccentric for entertainment and if i were to marryi really dont know who the woman would be someone i really likedcertainly not mina you mistake me pitt said with a dry smile i was think shying of a possible lover even a rejected one they say hell hath no fury like a woman scorned but ive found men take it no less kindly especially vain and successful men there are many people who believe that loving someone puts the person into some sort of debt to you and gives you certain rights more than one man has killed a woman because he thought she wasted herself on someone unworthy of hersomeone other than himself that is ive known men with the notion that they somehow owned a womans virtue and if she stained it she had offended not against herself or against godbut against him inigo stared into the polished surface of the table and smiled very slowly over something he was not prepared to share with pitt something at the same time funny and bitter oh indeed he said sincerely i believe in feudal times if a woman lost her virginity she had to pay a fine to the lord of the manor because she was then worth much less to him come the time someone wished to marry her and naturally had to pay the lord for the privilege we havent changed so much were far too genteel to pay in money of course but we still pay pitt would like to have known what he meant but to ask would have been vulgar and he probably would not have been answered could she have had a lover he went back to the original question or an admirer inigo thought for a few moments before replying mina ive never considered it but i suppose she could have the oddest people do why do you say that she looked as if she had been at least attractive if not even beautiful inigo seemed surprised himself just her personality she didnt seem to have any fire anygentleness but then you said an admirer didnt you she was very delicate she had a feminin shyity about her that would have been just what appealed to somea sort of austere purity and she always dressed to suit it he smiled apologetically but it is pointless asking me who be shycause i have no idea thank you pitt stood up i cant think of anything else to ask you it was most courteous of you to see me especially here hardly inigo stood up as well your presenting yourself didnt give me a great deal of choice i had either to see you or tolook like a pompous assor worse than that as if i had something to hide it had been intentional and pitt would not insult him by denying it he did not go to see ambrosine charrington the following day but instead packed a gladstone bag with clean shirt and socks and took the train from huston station to abbots langley to see what he could discover about ottilie charringtons death he spent two days and the more he learned the more confused he became he had no trouble in locating the house for the charringtons were well known and respected he ate a comfortable lunch at the inn then walked to the local parish churchyard but there were no charringtons buried there neither ottilie nor anyone else oh theyve only been here for twenty years going on the sexton told him reasonably theyre newcomers you wont find any of em here buried in london somewhere like as not but the daughter pitt asked she died here little over a year ago maybe so but she aint buried here the sexton assured him look for yourself and ive been to every funeral here in the last twentyfive years no charringtonsnot a one a sudden thought occurred to pitt how about catholic or nonconformist he asked what other churches are there close by i know every funeral as goes on in this neighborhood the sexton said vehemently its my job and the charringtons werent any of them outlandish things they was gentrychurch of england like everybody else who knows whats good for them church here every sunday theyre in the village if shed been buried anywhere around here it would be in this churchyard reckon as you must be mistaken and she died up in london somewhere leastways if she died here they took her back to london to bury her family vault likely lie alongside your own thats what i always say eternitys a mighty time dont you believe in the resurrection pitt said curiously the sextons face puckered with disgust at any man who would be so crass as to introduce abstract matters of doctrine into the practicalities of life and death now what kind of a question is that he demanded you know when thats going to be do you graves a long time a very long time should be done proper youll be a lot longer in it than any grand house here that was a point beyond argument pitt thanked him and set out to find the local doctor the doctor knew the charringtons but he had not attended ottilie in her last illness nor had he written any death certificate the following midday by which time pitt had seen servants neighbors and the postmistress he caught the train back to london convinced that ottilie charrington had been in abbots langley on the week of her death but that she had not died there the booking clerk at the station recalled seeing her on one or two occasions but he could not swear when and although she had bought a ticket to london he did not know if she had returned it seemed an inescapable conclusion that she had died not in abbots langley but somewhere unknown and of some cause unknown now pitt could not avoid seeing ambrosine and lovell charrington any longer even superintendent athelstan much as it pained him could think of no argument to avoid it and an appointment was duly madepolitely as if it were a courtesy howeverjt was not as pitt had intended he would rather have been casual and preferably have seen lovell and then ambrosine separately but when he had reported on his visit to abbots langley athelstan had taken the matter into his own hands lovell received pitt in the withdrawing room ambrosine was not present yes inspector he said coolly i cannot think what else i can tell you about the unfortunate business i have already done my duty and informed you fully of everything i knew poor mrs spencerbrown was most unstable sad as it makes me to have to say so i do ijot interest myself in other peoples private lives therefore i have no idea what particular crisis may have precipi shytated the tragedy no sir pitt said they were both still standing lovell stiff and unprepared to offer any sop to comfort no sir but it now seems beyond doubt that mrs spencerbrown did not take her own life she was murdered indeed lovells face was white and he suddenly reached for the chair behind him i suppose you are quite sure you have not been too hasty leaped to conclusions why should anyone murder her that is ridiculous she was a respectable woman pitt sat down too i have no reason to doubt that sir he decided to lie at least by implication there was no other way he could think of to approach the subject sometimes even the most innocent people are killed someone insane lovell grasped at the easiest explanation insanity was like diseaseindiscriminate had not prince albert himself died of typhus of course that must be the answer i am afraid i have seen no strangers about the area and all our servants are chosen most carefully we always follow up references very wise pitt heard himself agree hypocrisy dry in his mouth i believe you very tragically lost your own daughter sir lovells face closed over in tight defense almost hostility indeed it is a subject i prefer not to discuss and it has no relation whatever to the death of mrs spencerbrown then you know more of mrs spencerbrowns death than i do sir pitt replied levelly because as yet i have no knowl shyedge as to what caused it or who let alone why lovells skin was white drawn in painful lines around his mouth and jaw cords of muscle stood out in his neck making his high collar sit oddly my daughter was not murdered sir if that is what you imagine there is no question of it therefore it can have no connection do not let your professional ambition give you to see murder where there is nothing but simple tragedy what did cause her death sir pitt kept his voice low aware of the pain he must be inflicting consciousness of it was stronger than the gulf of feeling and belief between the two men an illness lovell replied quite sudden but it was not poison if that has occurred to you as a connection then you are quite mistaken you would do better to employ your time investi shygating mrs spencerbrown rather than going over other peoples family losses and i refuse to permit you to trouble my wife with these idiotic questions she has suffered enough you can have no idea what you are doing i have a daughter sir pitt was reminding himself as much as this stiff little man in front of him what if jemima had died suddenly without warning to the emotionsfull of life one day and nothing but a vivid beautiful and agonizing memory the next would he now find it intolerable to discuss it as lovell did he could not guess if was tragedy beyond the ability of the mind to conjure and yet mina had been someones daughter too where did she die sir lovell stared at him at our house in hertfordshire what possible concern is it of yours and where is she buried sir lovells face flushed scarlet i refuse to answer any more questions this is monstrous impertinence and grossly offensive you are paid to discover the cause of mina spencerbrowns death not to exercise your infernal curiosity about my family and its bereavements if you have anything to ask me about the matter then do so i shall do my best to answer you according to my duty otherwise i request that you leave my house immediately and do not return unless you have legitimate busi shyness here do you understand me sir yes mr charrington pitt said very softly i under shystand you perfectly was your daughter friendly with mrs spencerbrown not particularly i think they were no more than civil to one another there was a considerable difference in their ages a completely random thought occurred to pitt was your daughter well acquainted with mr lagarde they had known each other for some time lovell replied stiffly but there was nohe hesitated while he chose his wordno fondness between them most unfortunate it would have been an excellent match my wife and i tried to encourage her but ottilie had no he stopped his face hardening again that is hardly pertinent to your inquiry inspector indeed it is not pertinent to anything at all now forgive me but i think you are wasting both your time and mine there is nothing i can tell you i bid you good day pitt considered whether to argue to insist but he did not believe that lovell would tell him anything more he stood up thank you for your assistance i hope it will not be necessary to trouble you again good day sir i hope not indeed lovell rose the footman will show you out rutland place was pale with watery sun in one or two gar shydens green daffodil leaves stood like bayonets yellow banners of bloom held above them he wished people would not plant them in ranks like an army whether mina spencerbrown had been right about the ugli shyness of its nature or not there was certainly a mystery about ottilie charringtons death she had neither died nor been buried where her family claimed why should they lie what really had killed her and where the answer could only be that there was something so painful or so appalling that they dared not tell the truth for three days there was no progress at all pitt followed up every material clue he could find and sergeant harris ques shytioned servants both kitchen and outdoor no one told them anything that seemed to be of importance it became more and more apparent that mina had been as charlotte guessed an obsessive watcher little scraps of information impressions gath shyered here and there gradually confirmed it but what had she seen surely something more damning than merely the identity of a petty thief then on the afternoon of the fourth day a little after one oclock charlotte was standing in the parlor opening the french doors onto the small back garden breathing in the air that at last had warmth in it and the smell of sweet earth when gracie came in at a trot her heels scuffing up the new rug oh mrs pitt maam theres a letter come for you by special footman in a carriage and all and he says its terrible urgent and please maam the carriage is still standing there in the street as large as life and ever so grand she held out the envelope at arms length for charlotte to take a glance was sufficient to see that it was carolines writing charlotte tore the envelope open and read my dear charlotte the most appalling thing has happened i hardly know how to tell you it seems so utterly tragic as you know eloise lagarde was most distressed by minas death and the circumstances of it and tormod took her to their country house to rest and recover her spirits my dear charlotte they have returned this morning after the most dreadful accident i have ever known i feel quite sick to think of it it is almost past enduring while out driving returning from a picnic one evening with friends poor tormod was at the reins of the carriage and he slipped from the box and fell right under the wheels as if that in itself was not terrible enough a group of friends were right behind them it was past dusk and they did not see what had happened charlotte they drove straight over him horses and carriage that poor young man hardly older than yourself is crippled beyond any hope he lies on his bed in rutland place and for all we can believe or pray will do so for the rest of his life i am so distressed i cannot think what to say or do how can we help what response is there in the face of such total tragedy i felt you would wish to know as soon as possible and i have sent the carriage for you in case you wish to come this afternoon i would dearly like your company even if only to share with someone my shock at such pain your father is at business and shall be dining out this evening and grandmama is of no comfort at all i have also written to emily and sent the letter by messenger your loving mother caroline ellison charlotte read the letter a second time not that she doubted she had understood it but to give herself time to allow its meaning with the weight of pain it carried to sink into her consciousness she tried to imagine the night the dark road tormod lagarde as she had last seen him with his high pale brow and wave of black hair standing on the driving box then perhaps a horse swerving an unexpected turn in the road and suddenly he was lying in the mud the carriage above him the noise and the rattle the wheels passing over a leg or an arm the crushing weight bones snapped a moments silence the night sky and then the smashing pummeling hooves of the other carriage and the crushing weight agony as his body was broken dear god better infinitely more merciful if he had been killed outright simply never to have known sensibility or light again maam grades voice came urgently maam are you all right you look terrible white i think as you ought to sit down ill get the salts and a good cup of tea she turned to go determined to rise to the occasion and do something useful no charlotte said at last no thank you gracie its all right im not going to faint it is most terrible news but it is an acquaintance not a member of my family or a close friend i shall go and call upon my mother this afternoon it is a friend of hers i cannot say how long i shall be i must put on something more suitable than this dress it is far too cheerful i have a dark dress which is quite smart if the master comes home before i do please show him this letter ill put it in the desk you look terrible pale maam gracie said anxiously i think as you should have a nice cup of tea before you goes anywhere and shall i ask the footman if hed like one too charlotte had forgotten the footman indeed her mind had slipped back to the past and she had not even remembered that the carriage was not her own yes yes please do that that would be excellent i shall go upstairs and change and you may bring my cup of tea there tell the footman i shall not be long yes maam caroline was very somber when charlotte was shown in for the first time since minas death she was dressed in black and there was no lace at her throat thank you for coming so soon she said the moment the maid had closed the door whatever is happening to rutland place it is one unspeakable tragedy after another she seemed unable to sit down she held her hands tightly together and stood in the middle of the floor perhaps it is wicked of me to say so but i feel as if in a way this is even worse than poor mina it is only what the servants say and i should not listen to it but it is the only way of hearing anything she excused herself quite honestly according to maddock poor tormod isshe took a breathcompletely crushed his back and his legs are broken its not wicked mama charlotte shook her head in a tiny gesture putting out her arm to touch caroline if you have any faith death cannot be so terribleonly on occasion the manner of it and surely it would have been better if he is as dreadfully injured as they say that he should have died quickly if he cannot recover and i would not trust to maddock for that i daresay he got it from the cook and she from one of the maids who will have had it from an errand boy and so on do you intend to call to express your sympathies carolines head came up quickly oh yes i feel that would only be civil one would not stay of course but even if only to acknowledge that one is aware and to offer any help that may be possible poor eloise she will be quite shattered they are very close they have always been so fond of each other charlotte tried to imagine what it would be like to love someone so dearly and have to watch him day after day muti shylated beyond reparation awake and sane and be unable to help but imagination stopped short of any sort of reality she could remember sarahs death of course but that had been quick violent and horrible to be surebut thank god there had been no lingering no stretching out of pain day after day what can we possibly do she asked helplessly just to call and say we are sorry seems so wretchedly trivial there isnt anything else caroline answered quietly dont try to think of everything today perhaps in the future there may be somethingat least companionship charlotte received that in silence the sunlight streaming across the carpet picking out the garlands of flowers seemed remote more like a memory than anything present the bowl of pink tulips on the table looked stiff like an ornamental design hier shyatic and foreign the maid opened the door lady ashworth maam the maid bobbed a curtsy and immediately behind her emily came in looking pale and less than her usually immaculate self mama what a fearful thing how ever did it happen she caught hold of charlottes arm how did you hear thomas is not here is he i mean its nothing no of course not charlotte said quickly mama sent the carriage for me caroline shook her head in confusion it was an accident they were out driving it was fine and they had had a picnic somewhere and returned late by a longer and more pleasant way its all perfectly ridiculous for the first time there was anger in her voice as the futility of it struck her it need never have happened a skittish horse i suppose or some wild animal cutting across a country road frightening them or maybe it was an overhanging branch from some tree well thats what one keeps woodsmen for emily said in an explosion of impatience to see that there are no overhang shying branches across carriageways then equally quickly her anger vanished what can we do to help i dont really see what there is except ones sympathy and little use that will be it is still better than nothing caroline moved toward the door at least eloise will not feel that we are indifferent and then if there comes a time when she wishes something even if it is only company she will know that we are ready emily sighed i suppose so it seems like offering a bucket to bail out the sea sometimes merely to know you are not alone is some comfort charlotte said as much to herself as to them out in the hallway maddock was waiting shall you be returning for afternoon tea maam he inquired holding carolines coat for her oh yes caroline nodded and allowed him to put it around her shoulders we are merely going to call upon miss lagarde we will hardly be long indeed maddock said gravely a most terrible tragedy sometimes these young men drive most rashly i have always believed that racing was a highly dangerous and foolish exercise most conveyances are not designed for it were they racing charlotte asked quickly turning to face him maddocks features were without expression he was a ser shyvant and knew his place but he had also been with the ellisons since charlotte was a young girl little she did could surprise him that is what they are suggesting miss charlotte he re shyplied impassively although it would seem a somewhat foolish occupation along a country road and almost bound to cause injury to someone even if only the horses but i have no idea if it is true or merely backstairs speculation one cannot prevent servants from exercising their imaginations about such a disaster no amount of chastisement will silence them no of course not caroline said i wouldnt waste time tryingas long as it is not quite irresponsible she raised her eyebrows a little and they are not neglecting their duties maddock looked faintly hurt naturally maam i have never permitted that in my house no of course not caroline was mildly apologetic for having thoughtlessly insulted his integrity emily was standing at the door and the footman opened it for her the carriage outside was already waiting the distance to the lagardes was only a few hundred yards but the day was wet and the footpath running with water and this was the most formal of calls charlotte climbed in and sat in silence what on earth could she say to eloise how could a person reach from her own happiness and safety across such a gulf none of them spoke before the carriage stopped again and the footman handed them down then he remained standing at the horses heads waiting in the street as a mute sign to other callers that they were there a parlormaid minus her usual white cap opened the door and said in a tight little voice that she would inquire whether miss lagarde would receive them it was some five minutes before she returned and conducted them into the morning room at the back of the house overlooking the rainswept garden eloise rose from the sofa to greet them it was excruciating to look at her the translucent skin was as white as tissue paper with the same lifeless look her eyes were sunken and enormous seeming to stretch till the bruises beneath were part of them her hair was immaculate but had obviously been dressed by the maid as had she her clothes were delicate and neat but she wore them as if they were artificial windingsheets on a body for which the spirit no longer had any use she seemed even thinner her lacedin waist more fragile the shawl charlotte had previously seen her wear was gone as if she no longer cared if she was cold or not mrs ellison her voice was completely flat how kind of you to call she might have been reading a foreign language without any comprehension of its meaning lady ashworth mrs pitt please do sit down uncomfortably they obeyed charlotte felt her hands chill and yet her face hot with a sense of embarrassment at having in shytruded into something too exquisitely painful even for the rituals of pride and the need for privacy to cover she was overwhelmed by anguish like this it filled the room charlotte was stunned into silence even caroline fumbled for words and found none only emilys unrelenting social disci shypline carried her through no expression of our sympathy could possibly meet such distress as you must feel she said quietly but do be assured we grieve for you and in time if there is anything we may do to be of comfort we would be only too willing thank you eloise replied without expression that is generous of you it was as if she were hardly aware of them only of the need to reply or at least to acknowledge each time someone spoke her sentences were formal things she had prepared herself to say charlotte searched her mind for anything at all that did not sound idiotic perhaps presently you would care for a little company she suggested or if you have somewhere to go perhaps you would prefer not to go alone it was a suggestion for emily or caroline rather than herself since she had neither frequent oppor shytunity to visit rutland place nor a carriage available eloises eyes met hers for a moment then slid away into something frighteningly like complete vacancy as if all the world she knew was inside her head thank you yes i expect that may be although i fear i shall hardly be pleasant company my dear that is not at all true caroline said she lifted her hands as if to reach forward but there was some barrier around eloise an almost tangible remoteness and she let them fall again without touching her i have never known you anything but sympathetic she finished helplessly sympathetic eloise repeated the word and for the first time there was emotion in her voice but it was hard stained with irony do you think so caroline could do nothing but nod silence closed in on them again stretching as long as they would suffer it to exist again charlotte racked her mind to think of something to say just for the sake of sound but it would be offensive almost prurient to inquire how tormod was faring or what the doctor might have said and yet to speak of anything else was unthinkable the moments ticked on the room seemed to grow enormous and the rain outside far away even the sound of it was removed the nightmare horses galloped through all their minds the wheels crashed eventually when charlotte was just about to say something however absurd to break the pressure the maid returned to announce amaryllis denbigh much as charlotte disliked amaryllis she felt a rush of gratitude merely to be relieved of the burden amaryllis came a few steps behind the maid she stood in the doorway and stared from one to the other of them aghast although surely she must have seen the carriage outside her eyes fastened on charlotte accusingly she was whitefaced and her usually lush hair was awry and the pink salve on her lips smudged mrs pitt i had not expected to find you here there was no civil reply to this so charlotte attributed it to natural distress and ignored it altogether i am sure you have called in sympathy as we have she said level ly she waited a second or two for eloise to say something then as she did not charlotte added please do sit down this sofa is most comfortable how can you talk of comfort at such a time amaryllis demanded in a sudden gust of fury tormod will get better of course but he is in agony she shut her eyes and hot tears ran down her cheeks absolute agony and you sit there as if you were at a soiree and talk about comfort charlotte felt anger and pain well up inside her because amaryllis spoke out of her own passion without thought for the pain she must be causing eloise then stand if you prefer to she said tartly if you imagine it will be of some conceivable service im sure no one will mind amaryllis seized a chair and sat down her silk skirts everywhere at least if he will get better then that is hope emily said trying to ease the electric harshness a little amaryllis swung round opened her mouth then closed it again eloise was sitting perfectly motionless her face blank her hands lifeless in her lap he will not she said without a shadow of expression as if she had faced death itself and grown accustomed to it and ac shycepted it without hope he will never stand again thats not true amaryllis voice rose almost to a shriek how dare you say anything so dreadful that is a lie a lie he will stand and in time he will walk he will i know it she stood up went over to eloise and stopped in front of her shaking with emotion but eloise neither looked up nor flinched you are dreaming eloise said very quietly one day you will know the truth however long it takes it is always there and it will come to you youre wrong youre wrong the color flamed up amaryllis face i dont know why youre saying all this you have your own reasonsgod in heaven knows what they are there was accusation in her voice shrill and uglyfrightened he will get better i refuse to give in to surrender eloise looked at her as if she were transparent or of no importance as if she were unreal as inconsequential as a magiclantern slide if that is what you wish to believe she said quietly then do so it really makes no difference to anyone except i would ask you not to keep repeating it especially if the time should come when tormod is well enough to receive you amaryllis body became rigid her arms like wood her bosom high you want him to lie there she cried almost gulping the words you evil woman you want to keep him a prisoner here just you and he all the rest of his life youre mad youre never going to let him goyou suddenly charlotte woke into action she jumped to her feet and slapped amaryllis sharply across the face dont be idiotic she said furiously and so utterly selfish who on earth do you imagine you are helping standing there shrieking like a servant girl pull yourself together and remem shyber that it is eloise and not you who has to bear the hardship of this it is she who has cared about him all her life can you possibly believe that poor mr lagarde wishes to have his sister subjected to abuse on top of everything else the doctor is the only one who can say whether he will recover or not and false hope is more painful than learning to accept with patience the truth whatever it may be and await the outcome amaryllis stared at her quite possibly it was the first time in her life anyone had struck her and she was too appalled to react and the insult that she had behaved like a servant was a mortal one emily stood up also and took charlotte aside then guided amaryllis back to her seat eloise sat through it all as if she had neither seen nor heard them absorbed in her own thoughts they could have been shadows passing across the lawn for any mark they made upon her mind it is natural you should be shocked emily said to amaryl shylis with a supreme effort at calmness but these dreadful things affect people in different ways and you must remember that eloise has spoken with the doctor and knows what he has said it would be best if we were all to await his advice i daresay mr lagarde needs as little disturbance as can be she turned to eloise is that not so eloise was still looking at the floor yes she raised her eyebrows a little almost with surprise yes we should not distress him with our feelings restthat is what dr mulgrew said time time will tell is he to call again soon caroline inquired would you care to have someone with you when he does my dear for the first time eloise smiled very faintly as if at last she had heard not only the words but their meaning that is most kind of you if it is not a trouble i am expecting him momentarily of course not we shall be happy to stay caroline assured her her voice rising with pleasure that there was something they could do amaryllis hesitated when they all turned to look at her then changed her mind i think there are other calls it would be courteous for us to make while i am in the neighborhood emily said charlotte can remain here perhaps mrs denbigh would care to come with me she spoke with exquisite ease i should be most happy for your company amaryllis eyes widened obviously it was a contingency she had not foreseen and she was about to protest but caroline grasped the opportunity what an excellent idea she rose straightening her skirts to make them fall elegantly behind her charlotte will be delighted to remain here and i shall accompany you so we may continue with our visiting i am sure ambrosine would be pleased to see us you would be happy to do that wouldnt you my dear she looked to charlotte nervously of course charlotte agreed quite sincerely for once mina and the mystery surrounding her death were banished from her mind and she was aware only of eloise i think that is most certainly what you should do and it is only a step i can quite easily walk back when it is time amaryllis stood a few moments longer still trying to think of some acceptable excuse to stay but nothing came to her and she was obliged to follow emily out into the hallway as caroline took her arm and walked with her and the maid closed the door behind them dont let her distress you charlotte said to eloise after a moment she would not be fatuous enough to suggest that what was said was not meant it was blindingly obvious that it had been fully intended i daresay the shock has affected her judgment eloises face shadowed with a ghost of humor wraithlike and bitter her judgment perhaps she answered but only insofar as previously she would have thought the same whereas good manners would have prevented her from saying it charlotte slid more comfortably into her seat dr mulgrew mightyet be some time she is not the pleasantest of persons she observed eloise met her eyes for the first time she appeared actually to see her not some inward scene of her own you do not care for her it was a statement not a great deal charlotte admitted perhaps if i knew her better she left the suggestion as a polite fiction eloise stood up and walked slowly over toward the french windows and stood facing the rain i think a great deal of what we like about people is what we do not know but imagine to be there that way we can believe the unknown is anything we wish can we charlotte looked at her back very slender with shoulders square surely to continue to believe what is not true is impossible unless you leave reality altogether and sink into madness perhaps eloise suddenly lost interest again and her voice was weary it hardly matters charlotte considered arguing purely as a principle but she was overwhelmed by the grief and futility that drowned the room while she was still struggling to think of anything to say that had meaning the parlormaid returned to announce that dr mulgrew had arrived shortly afterward when the doctor was upstairs with tormod and eloise was waiting on the landing the maid returned to ask charlotte if she would receive monsieur alaric until eloise should reappear oh she caught her breath of course it would be impossi shyble to refuse yes pleaseask him to come in i am sure miss lagarde would wish it j yes maam the girl withdrew and after a moment paul alaric appeared soberly dressed his face grave j good afternoon mrs pitt he showed no surprise so he f must have been forewarned of her presence i hope you are well quite thank you monsieur miss lagarde is upstairs with the doctor as i imagine you already know yes indeed how is she most terribly distressed she answered frankly i cannot remember having seen anyone look so shocked i wish there was something we could say or do to comfortit is frightening to be so helpless she had been afraid almost angry in anticipation of it that he might say something trite but he did not i know his voice was very quiet his mind seeking to understand the pain i really dont feel i can be of any use but not to call seems so indifferent as if i did not care are you a great friend of mr lagardes she inquired with surprise she had not considered a realm of his life where he might find company with a man as much younger and as rela shytively slight in his pursuits as tormod lagarde please do sit down she offered as composedly as she could i daresay they will be a little while as yet thank you he said moving the skirts of his coat so he did not sit on them no i cannot say that i found much in common with him but then tragedies of this sort override all trivial differences dont they she looked up to find his eyes on her curious and quite devoid of the impersonal glaze she was accustomed to in social conversation she smiled slightly to show she was calm and grave and composed then as an afterthought she smiled again to show that she agreed with him i see it has not kept you away he continued it would have have been quite excusable for you to have found other business and avoided what can only be painful you do not know the lagardes well believe and yet you felt a desire to come i fear to little enough good she said with sudden unhappiness except perhaps that mama and emily removed mrs denbigh he smiled and the irony inside him went all the way to his eyes ah amaryllis yes i imagine that was something of a kindness in itself i dont know why but there seems to be little love lost between her and eloise it would have been a source of considerable pain had they become sistersinlaw you dont know why charlotte was surprised surely he could not be so blind amaryllis was intensely possessive and her feeling for tormodwas almost devouring in its heatthe thought of living in a household with eloise would be unbearable to her when two women shared a house there was always one who became superior that it should be eloise was unlikely and for amaryllis intolerable but if eloise were driven however subtly into a subordinate position then tormod would feel a sense of obligation even of pity toward her and that might be worse no if paul alaric could not see why amaryllis felt as she did he was disappointingly lacking in imagination then she looked at his face and realized he had not understood that eloise would remain with them but tormod could hardly leave her alone she was young and desperately vulnerable even if it would be socially acceptable which it was not i had formed the impression that mrs denbigh was ex shytremely fond of mr lagarde she began what a ridiculously inadequate use of words for the violence of feeling she had seen in amaryllis the appetite of mind and body that boiled so close below the surface slowly he smiled without pleasure he had seen it too perhaps i have too little insight but a wife and a sister do not seem mutually exclusive really monsieur suddenly she was impatient with him if you were totally in love with someone if you can conceive of such a feelingthe acid of her rage for caroline dripped through her voicewould you care to share your daily life with somebody who knew that person infinitely better than you did who had a lifetime of memories in common all the laughter and secrets the friends the childhood echoes all right charlottei understand suddenly he reverted to the moment of friendship they had shared in those terrible days in paragon walk when other jealousies and hatreds had seethed into murder i have been insensitive even stupid i can see that to someone like amaryllis it would be unendurable however if tormod is as badly injured as i have heard then the question of marriage will never arise it was a statement of a truth that must have been obvious yet the words fell like ice into the room they were still silent each wrapped in his own conception of its enormity when eloise returned she regarded alaric without interest as if she did not recog shynize him except as a shape another figure that required acknowledgment good afternoon monsieur alaric it is kind of you to call the sight of her face stiff eyes sunken with shock affected him more than anything charlotte could have said he forgot his manners a lifetime of polite expressions there was nothing in him but untutored emotion he put out his hand and grasped hers his other hand touching her arm very gently as if her skin might bruise eloise im so sorry dont give up hope my dear one cannot know what may be possible with time she stood quite still not moving away from him although it was not plain whether she was comforted by his closeness or simply oblivious to it i dont know what to hope for she said simply perhaps that is very wrong of me no not wrong charlotte said quickly you would have to be omniscient to know what is best you cannot blame yourself and please do not even think of it eloise shut her eyes and turned away pulling her arm from alaric leaving him standing confused aware he was on the outside of some tremendous grief and unable to reach it or share it charlotte felt a certain compassion for him but her first feeling was for eloise she stood up and went to her putting her arms around her and holding her tightly eloises body was yielding lifeless but charlotte held on to her just the same out of the comer of her eye she saw alarics face tight with pity and then silently he turned and left closing the door behind him with a tiny click as the latch went home eloise did not move nor did she weep it was as if charlotte were holding a sleepwalker whose nightmare imprisoned her mind and soul elsewhere yet charlotte felt that her presence the contact of her warmth was worth something minutes went by someone clattered up the back stairs rain drove in a gust against the windows still neither of them spoke at last the door opened and the maid spoke then was over shycome with embarrassment mr inigo charringtoni maam shall i tell him you are not at home if you would inform mr charrington that miss lagarde is not well charlotte said quietly ask him to wait in the withdrawing room and i shall go to him in a few moments yes maam the girl withdrew gratefully without waiting for eloise to confirm the command charlotte stood for a moment longer then guided eloise to the sofa and laid her on it kneeling beside her do you not think you woujd be better to lie down for a while she suggested perhaps a dish of tea or an herbal tisane if you wish eloise obeyed because she had no will to argue charlotte hesitated still not sure if there was anything else she could do then accepted at last that it was futile and went to the door charlotte she turned for the first time there was expression in eloises face even her eyes thank you you have been kind i may not appear as if i value it but i do you are right perhaps i shall drink something and sleep for a while i feel very tired charlotte felt a surge of relief as if hard knots inside her had slipped loose ill tell your maid to see that no one else is admitted for today thank you after delivering the directions to the maid and the footman charlotte went into the withdrawing room where inigo charrington stood by the mantelshelf his face creased with anxiety his coat still over his arm as if he were unsure whether to stay or go is she all right he said without any pretense at formality no charlotte replied with equal honesty no she isnt but i dont know of anything else we can do to help should you have left her inigos face creased the last thing i want is for my calling to cause further distress i sent the maid for a dish of tisane then i think she will rest for a time sleep will not alter the facts she will still have to face them when she awakes but she may have a little more strength for it its absolutely bloody he said with sudden anger first poor mina and now this charlotte was appalled to hear herself reply and your own sister what his quicksilver face was blank almost comically empty this time embarrassment made her hold her tongue oh then he realized what she had said oh yes you mean ottilie she wanted to apologize to undo her intrusion but she knew how close it could lie to minas death and murder and she had learned only too dreadfully how one murder could beget another and another mina was not necessarily the last victim i believe her death was very suddeni mean quite unexpected it must have been a devastating shock she had meant to be subtle and ended by sounding crass unexpected again he repeated her words mrs pitt of course how stupid of me the policeman but why the interest in ottilie she was eccentric to put it at its mildest but she certainly never harmed anyoneleast of all mina that is the third time someone has said that she was eccentric charlotte said thoughtfully was she really so very unusual oh yes he smiled at memory she did some appalling things once she got up on the dining table at dinner and sang a bawdy song i thought papa would die of it thank god no one else was there but the family and one or two of my friends his eyes were alight gleaming with the memory laughter and softness in them embarrassing if it were to be repeated charlotte was confused by him surely no man could act affection so perfectly and be lying one cannot afford a great deal of that if one is to remain in society his face was bright with mockery in it but no malice as if he himself were part of the joke you know mrs pitt i have the strongest feeling that in spite of your afternoontea behavior you are a good deal more your husbands wife than your mothers daughter you think we quietly suppressed ottilie somewhere dont you perhaps impris shyoned her in our country house locked in a disused wing withan old family retainer to guard her charlotte felt the crimson heat flood up her face she was blundering and yet she must not stop there would not be another chance actually i thought you might have murdered her she said tartly furious with herself for her clumsiness and perhaps mina knew it she was a peeping tom you know and maybe a thief as well his eyes opened wide in surprise a peeping tom yes but a thief whatever gave you that idea several things have gone missing in rutland place recently she could still feel the scarlet under her skin none of them arc very valuable of themselves but at least one holds a secret which would be most embarrassing if it were to become known per shyhaps mina was the thief and she was killed to retrieve whatever it was no he said with conviction whatever she was killed for it had nothing to do with the thefts anyhow most of the things have been returned they always are she stared at him returned how do you know he took a long slow breath i do just accept that i have seen the things ask the people who lost them theyll tell you my mother lost something she did not say she has it back presumably it was the article containing the embarrassing secret you spoke of since you are aware of it maybe she was afraid you would think she stole it back you have a highly suspicious mind mrs pitt i would hardly suspect my own mother of she stopped killing mina he finished for her perhaps notbut would the police be so welldisposed where did ottilie die it was not at your country house as you said oh for several minutes he remained silent standing with one foot on the hearth and she waited tell you what he said at last come with me and ill show you she exploded in frustration dont be ridiculous if it is something so secret bring your own carriage he interrupted and your own footman if you like policemen do not have carriages she snapped or footmen no i suppose they dont sorry bring your mothers ill prove to you we didnt murder ottilie her mind raced to find a way of accepting that was not wildly foolish if he or his family had killed ottilie and then mina they would not balk at killing her just as easily yet perhaps she was being offered the solution and if the stolen articles had really been returned how did inigo charrington know it why had caroline not told her anyway why would a thief take them and then return them it made no senseunless it was involved with the murder had mina been the thief and had the murderer retrieved all the stolen things to mask the recovery of the one thing that would have damned him suddenly the solution came to her emily would never permit such an opportunity to escape and she could provide the means for charlotte to accept i shall take my sisters carriage she replied with an assur shyance she hoped she could justify and naturally i shall tell her for what purpose and who is to accompany me excellent have you considered joining the police force yourself dont be impertinent she said acidly but inside excite shyment was boiling up he smiled i think you would enjoy it enormously actually think i might myself i shall collect you at six oclock what you are wearing will be adequate if you take off that thing from the neck at six oclock she was startled why not now because it is barely half past three and far too early she did not understand but at least by six oclock she would have had opportunity to make some arrangement with emily both to borrow the carriage and to be perfectly sure that inigo charrington did not imagine he could harm her in any way and remain at liberty himself when she arrived at her mothers house and explained the matter to her sisterout of carolines hearing of course emily was aghast her immediate reaction was that inigo had undoubtedly murdered his sister and now intended to do away with charlotte as well he would hardly be so foolish charlotte replied trying to weight her voice with conviction after all if anything were to happen to me when you all know i am in his company then he would damn himself completely i believe he really is going to tell me how ottilie died and show me some proof of it i certainly will not believe it without proof then i shall come with you emily said instantly it was only with difficulty that charlotte succeeded in persuad shying her that her presence might risk the whole venture if the nature of ottilies death had been such that the family was prepared to have it known then pitt would have discovered it in his own attempts she could think of no satisfactory reason why inigo was now willing to tell her except that perhaps fear of the still greater danger of being suspected of murder hung over them but if it were a matter of desperate embarrassment even of humiliation then the fewer people who were aware of it the easier for the family and also since charlotte was not of their own social circle perhaps they would not suffer so acutely for her knowing the truth emily accepted the argument with reluctance but she was obliged to concede its validity at least she made no protest about lending both her carriage and her footman she would take the use of her mothers to return to her home inigo called at six oclock precisely dressed in an elegant coat of darkest green with a fine top hat it was on the tip of charlottes tongue to ask him where on earth they might be going but she bit back the words remember shying the need for discretion caroline had already delivered her shyself of her opinion of charlottes behavior and she forbore expressing it again in front of inigo inside the carriage he made sure that she was comfortable then offered no further remark but sat silent a smile curving his mouth while they drove through gaslit streets charlotte had not seen before seemingly toward the heart of the city she lost track of time they turned endless corners till her sense of direction which had never been good vanished and when at last they pulled up she could not have made even a guess where they were inigo climbed out and handed her down the lamps were brilliant in the street and some on the front of a large building were of different colors j electric he said cheerfully there are quite a few of them i now she stared around her there was music coming from somewhere and a dozen or more people on the pavement mostly men some of whom were in evening dress where are we she asked in bewilderment where is this it is a music hall my dear he said with a sudden flashing smile one of the best ada church is singing here tonight and shell pack em in i a music hall charlotte was stunned she had been expect ing a cemetery a clinic or even a madhousebut a music hall it was preposterouslike a black farce come on he took her arm and pushed her toward the doorway she thought of resisting she was both frightened and intensely curious she had heard of ada churchshe was said to be very handsome and had one of the best music hall acts even pitt had once commented that she had beautiful legsof all things he had smiled as he said it and she had recognized that he was teasing so she had refrained from asking him how he knew good evening mr charrington sir the doorman raised his hand in a little salute although his eyes registered surprise at charlotte good to see you again sir youve been here before charlotte accused him and often oh yes she stopped pulling against his arm and you have the impertinence to bring me with you i know i am a policemans wife but i do not frequent places like this ill have you remem shyber that there are a great many things men may do and women may not now you have had your rather cheap joke i accept that it was tasteless and cruel of me to ask what happened to your sister you have your revenge and my apologies now please take me home he held on to her arm tightly too tightly for her to break away dont be so pompous he said quietly you arent any good at it you wanted to know what happened to ottilie im going to tell you and prove it now stop making a scene and come in youll probably even enjoy it if you let yourself and if you dont want to be seen here then dont stand in the entranceway where everybody can look at you making a specta shycle of yourself his logic was irrefutable she jerked her head in the air and sailed in on his arm looking neither right nor left and permitted him to seat her at one of the numerous tables in the center of the floor she was dimly aware of tiers of boxes and balconies like a theater of a brilliantly lit stage of gaudy colors flounced dresses low off the shoulders and the black and white of rich mens clothes mixed with the duller browns of those less comfortable and even the checks of men come from the local streets waiters wove their way through the throng glasses sparkled as they were raised and lowered and all the time there was the murmur of voices and the lilt of music inigo said nothing but she was conscious of his bright face watching her curiosity and laughter so close to the surface she could feel it as if he touched her a waiter came over and he ordered champagne which in itself seemed to amuse him when it came he poured lifted his glass and toasted her to detectives he said his eyes silver in the light would to god all mysteries were so simple im beginning to think it is the detectives who are simple she replied acidly but she accepted the champagne and drank it it was pleasantly sharp neither sour nor sweet and she felt less angry after it when he poured more she accepted that too presently a juggler came onto the stage and she watched him without particular interest she granted that what he was doing was extremely difficult but it seemed hardly worth the effort he was followed by a comic who told some very odd jokes but the audience seemed to find them hilarious she had a suspicion she had failed to understand the point the waiter brought more champagne and she became aware that she was beginning to find the colors and the music rather pleasing a chorus of girls appeared and performed a song she was sure she had heard before and then a man popped up and twisted himself into the oddest contortions at last there was silence and then a roll of drums the an shynouncer held up his hands ladies and gentlemen for your exclusive entertainment and enchantment the culmination of your entire evening the quintes shysence of beauty of daring of sheer dazzling delightmiss ada church there was a thunder of applause even whistles and shouts and the curtain went up there was only one woman on the stage slender with a tiny waist and long long legs encased in black trousers a tailcoat and white shirt hid nothing of her figure and a top hat was perched at a rakish angle on a pile of flaming red hair she was smiling and the joy seemed to radiate out of her to fill the whole hall bravo ada someone shouted and there was more clapping as the orchestra started to play her rich throaty voice rang out in a gay surging bawdy song it was less than vulgar but there was an intimacy to it full of suggested secrets the audience roared its approval and sang the chorus along with her by the third song charlotte found to her horror that she was joining in as well music swelling up inside her with a pleasant tingling happiness rutland place seemed a thousand miles away and she wanted to forget its darkness and its miseries all that was good was here in the lights and the warmth singing along with ada church and the vitality that conquered everything it would have shocked caroline rigid but now charlotte was singing as loudly as the rest in the rollicking chorus champagne charlie is my name when at last the curtain came down for the final time she stopped clapping and turned to find inigo staring at her she ought to have felt embarrassed but somehow she was so exhila shyrated it did not seem to matter he held up the last bottle of champagne but it was empty he signaled for the waiter to bring another inigo had barely opened it when charlotte saw ada church herself walking toward them giving a little wave of her arm but gracefully avoiding the hands stretched out at her she stopped at their table and inigo stood up immediately and offered her his chair she kissed him on the cheek and he slipped an arm around her hello darling she said casually then turned a dazzling smile on charlotte inigo bowed very slightly mrs pitt may i present my sister ottilie tillie this is charlotte pitt the daughter of one of my neighbors who has rather let her family down by marrying into the police she fancied we had done away with you so i brought her here to see that you are in excellent health for once charlotte was staggered beyond words done away with me ottilie said incredulously how absolutely marvelous you know i do believe the thought oc shycurred to papa only he didnt have the nerve she began to laugh it rose bubbling in her throat and rang out in rich delight how superb she clung onto inigos arm do you mean the police are actually questioning papa as to what he did with me because they suspect him of murder i do wish i could see his face as he tries to explain himself out of that hed almost rather die than tell anyone what i really am inigo kept his arm around her but suddenly his humor vanished its a good deal more than that tillie there has been a murder a real one mina spencerbrown was poisoned she was a peeping tom and it rather looks as if she saw something worth killing to keep secret not unnaturally it occurred to the police that your disappearance might be that something ottilies laughter vanished instantly and her hands tightened over his arm long slender hands with knuckles white where they gripped the stuff of his sleeve oh god you dont think no he said quickly its not that papa has no ideaand i really dont think mama cares in fact it has occurred to me looking at her face across the table that half of her rather wants everyone to know especially him but you put them back she said urgently you promised of course i did once i knew where they belonged no one else knows he turned to charlotte im afraid my mother has a regrettable habit of picking up small things that do not belong to her i do my best to replace them as soon as possible im also afraid i took rather longer than usual with your mothers locket because she said nothing about losing it so i didnt know to whom it belonged i doubt i need to explain all the reasons for that no charlotte said quietly no better not she was puzzled she liked ambrosine charrington why on earth should she resort to petty stealing inigo pulled over another chair and he and ottilie sat down seeing them so close together charlotte realized the resem shyblance was quite marked there could be no doubt who ada church was escape ottilie said simply looking at charlotte perhaps you cant understand that but if you had lived with papa for thirty years you might sometimes you get to feel so imprisoned by other peoples ideas and habits and expectations that part of you grows to hate them and you want to break their ideals smash them shock those people into really looking at you for once reaching through the glass to touch the real flesh beyond its all right charlotte shook her head you dont need to explain ive wanted to stand on the table and scream myself once or twice tell everybody what i really thought perhaps after thirty years i would have do you like it here she looked around at the tables the sea of bodies and faces ottilie smiled without pretense yes i love it ive cried myself to sleep a few times and ive had long lonely daysand nights and a good few times ive thought i was a fool or worse but when i hear the music the people singing with me and the applauseyes i love it i daresay in ten years or fifteen i shall have nothing but vanity and memories and wish id stayed at home and married suitablybut i dont think so charlotte found herself smiling as well the champagne still glowed inside her you might marry well anyway she said and then suddenly her tongue felt awkward and the next sentence did not sound quite as she had intended it should people from music halls sometimes do so someone saiddidnt they ottilie looked at her brother youve been filling her with champagne she accused of course that way shell have an excuse in the morning and i daresay not recall quite how much she enjoyed slumming he stood up have some yourself tillie i must take charlotte home before her husband sends half the metropolitan police out for her charlotte did not hear what he said the music had started in her head again and she was happy for him to lead her to the door collect her cloak and send for the carriage the air outside was sharp its coldness made her feel a little dizzy he handed her up and closed the door and the horses clopped gently through silent streets charlotte began to sing to herself and was still going through the chorus for the seventh time when inigo helped her down outside her own front door champagne charlie is my name she sang cheerfully and rather loudly champagne drinking is my game there is noth shying like the fizz fizz fizz ill drink every drop there is is is im the darlingshe hesitated then rememberedof the barmaids and champagne charlie is my name the door swung open and she looked up to see pitt staring at her his face white and furious the gas lamp in the hallway behind him making a halo around his head shes perfectly safe inigo said soberly i took her to meet my sisterafter whom i believe you have been inquiring i charlotte hiccuped and slid neatly to the floor sorry inigo said with a slight smile good night charlotte was not even aware of pitt bending down to pick her up and heave her inside with a comment that would have blis shytered her ears had she heard it charlotte woke up with the most appalling headache she could ever remember pitt was standing at the far side of the bedroom opening the curtains and she could not even see the red flowers on them the light was painful she closed her eyes in defense against it then rolled over to hide her face in the pillow the movement was a mistake hammer blows shivered through her skull and shot round her forehead tightening the very bones she had never felt like this carrying jemima a little sickness in the mornings certainlybut never a head as if her brains were trying to beat their way out good morning pitts voice cut through the thick silence cold and definitely far from solicitous i feel awful she said pathetically im sure you do he said she sat up very slowly holding her head with both hands i think i may be sick i shouldnt be in the least surprised he was distinctly unmoved thomas she hauled herself out of bed ready to cry with misery and an awful feeling of unexplained rejection then suddenly the whole evening returned to herthe music hall ottilie inigo charrington the champagne and the silly song oh god her legs folded under her and she sat down on the edge of the bed sharply she was still in half her underwear and there were pins in her hair uncomfortable poking into her head oh thomas im so sorry j are you going to be sick he asked with only slightly more f concern i yes i think so he came over and picked up the chamber pot from under the bed he put it in her lap for her and pushed back her hair i suppose you realize what could have happened to you he said the ice in his voice changing to anger if inigo charrington or his father had killed ottilie it would have been the simplest thing in the world for them to have killed you too it was several minutes before charlotte was well enough to defend herself to explain all her precautions i i took emilys carriage and emilys footman she said at last gulping to get her breath im not entirely stupid k he took the pot from her and offered her a glass of water and f a towel thats a subject i wouldnt try debating just now if i were you he said sourly do you feel better now yes thank you she would like to have been dignified even aloof but she had placed herself in an impossible position for it everyone knew i was with him he couldnt have done anything and got away with it and i made sure he was as aware of that as i everyone his eyebrows rose and there was a dangerously light tone in his voice mercifully she realized her omission before he was obliged to tell her i mean mama and emily she corrected it occurred to her to say she had sent the footman with a message for him but she had never been able to lie to him successfully and her head was too thick to be able to sort out enough wit to be consistent now and consistency was vital to a good lie i didnt tell you because i thought i should be home before you were she began to sound indignant i didnt know it was going to be a music hall he simply said he would show me what had hap shypened to ottilie and prove they had not harmed her a music hall for a moment he forgot to be angry she sat upright on the edge of the bed at least the nausea had gone and it was easier to achieve a little dignity well where did you imagine i had been i was not in a public house if thats what you think and why was it necessary to look for ottilie charrington in a music hall he said skeptically because thats where she was she answered with some satisfaction she ran away to go on the halls shes ada church a sudden memory came back to her you know the one with the nice legs she added spitefully pitt had the grace to color i saw her professionally he said tartly your profession or hers charlotte inquired at least i came home sober his voice rose with offended justice her head was splitting like a boiled egg being sliced off at the top and she did not in the least wish to quarrel with him any further thomas im sorry i really am i didnt realize it would affect me like this it was just fizzy and nice and i went there to find ottilie charrington she pushed her hair back and began to take out the most painful of the pins after all someone killed mina if it wasnt the charringtons then maybe it was theodora von schenck he sat down on the end of the bed his shirttails hanging out his tie undone is ada church really ottilie charrington he asked seriously charlotte are you absolutely sure it wasnt some obscure joke no im sure for one thing she looked a lot like inigo you could see they were related and something else i forgot ambrosine is the thief apparently shes been doing it for some time inigo always puts everything back as soon as he can when he knows who they belong to i suppose nobody admitted to finding them this time in case you suspected them of having murdered mina for the things ambrosine charrington he stared at her confused and disbelieving but why why ever should she steal things charlotte took a deep breath do you mind if i lie down again grace will look after jemima i dont think i can if i stand up my head will fall off why should ambrosine charrington steal things he repeated she tried to remember what ottilie had said as far as she could recall she had understood it very well at the time because of lovell she struggled for a way of explaining it hes ossified she lay down very carefully and a little of the pain subsided hes what ossified she said again the word pleased her gone to bone he doesnt listen and he doesnt look i think part of her hates him after all her daughters gone away and they have to pretend shes dead for heavens sake charlotte people of that class dont have daughters on the halls it would be unthinkable to him i know that she pulled the covers closer around her chin quite suddenly she was cold but that wouldnt stop ambrosine from loving ottilie ive met her shes really very nicethe sort of person you want to smile at she makes everything seem a little better maybe if lovell wasnt such a prune she wouldnt have gone on the halls she might have found it all right just to kick over the traces at home every now and again pitt sat still for a few moments poor ambrosine he said presently a dreadful thought occurred to charlotte she sat bolt upright dragging all the clothes with her you arent going to arrest her she demanded he looked appalled no of course not i couldnt even if i wanted to theres no proof and inigo would certainly deny it not that i shall ask him he pulled a face still it removes the thefts as a motive for minas deathalthough the charringtons could still have killed her i suppose why ottilie isnt dead his face took on a look of infinite scorn and how do you imagine lovell would care for it to be known in society that ada church the toast of the halls is his daughter hed probably sooner be charged with her murder at least it wouldnt be so damned funny she twisted up her face painfully torn between irony and frustration she wanted to laugh but the very idea hurt what are you going to do she asked write a letter to dr mulgrew she did not understand the answer seemed ridiculous dr mulgrew why he smiled at last because he is in love with ottilie he might like to know shes alive after all i dont imagine hell care very much about her being on the halls anyway he should have the right to find out charlotte leaned back on the pillow with a deep sigh of satisfaction you are interfering she said pleasantly she liked to think of ottilie finding someone who would love her he grunted and tucked in his shirttails rather untidily i know that just before eleven oclock when charlotte was still asleep she dimly heard a knock on the door and the next moment emily was beside her whats the matter with you emily demanded grade wouldnt let me in are you ill charlotte opened her eyes she didnt make a very good job of it she squinted up at emily sideways without moving ive got a terrible headache is that all never mind that emily dismissed it and sat down on the bed what happened what about ottilie charrington how did she die and did her family do it if you dont tell me i shall shake you till you are really sick dont touch me im sick now she isnt dead shes excel shylently alive and singing in the music halls dont be ridiculous emilys face creased with disbelief who told you that nobody told me i went to the music hall and saw her myself thats why i feel so awful now you what emily was incredulous you went to a music hall what on earth did thomas say honestly yes i did and thomas wasnt very pleased then memo shyries came back and charlotte began to smile yes i did with inigo charrington and i drank champagne actually it was rather fun once i got started a comical mixture of expressions chased across emilys face shock laughter and even envy serves you right youre sick she said with some satisfaction i wish id been there what was she like marvelous she really can sing and in a way that makes you want to sing with her shesso very alive emily tucked up her legs more comfortably so no one murdered her then that cant be why mina was killed yes it could charlotte recalled pitts argument they might have wanted to keep that hidden after all shes ada church well who is ada church emily was puzzled ottilie is dont be stupid whats that supposed to mean emily was too curious to be offended ada church is one of the most famous singers on the halls is she i dont know the music halls as well as you do there was distinct acid in her tone but that would be worth hiding and theres always theodoras income to look into i expect thomas is doing that but we still have to do something about mama and monsieur alaric oh yes i forgot about the locket she has it back she never told me emily was angry affronted by the callousness of it charlotte sat up very slowly and was surprised that her head felt considerably better she didnt tell me either inigo charrington did it was his mother who took it and he put it back ambrosine charrington took it whatever for explain yourself charlotte did you get drunk yes i think i did on champagne but thats what he said i wasnt drunk then she explained with care what she could remember but that doesnt mean mama can go on with her relationship with monsieur alaric no of course not emily said wed better do something and before it gets any worse ive been giving it some thought lately and ive come to a decision we must try to persuade papa to pay more attention to her flatter her more spend time with her then she will have no need of monsieur alaric she looked up at charlotte challenging her to argue she would leave the matter of ambrosine charrington and charlottes cham shypagne to another time charlotte considered it for a moment or two in silence it would not be easy to convey to edward the importance of such a course and the change it would necessitate in his behavior without allowing him to understand the reason for their concern the danger of caroline beginning a real affaire with paul alaric not just suppressed passion anymore but something that might end up in the bedroom she frowned and took a deep breath oh not you emily said immediately i just want you for moral support to agree with me dont you say anything or youll bring on a complete disaster it was not a time to take issue defense could wait for a more suitable time when are you going charlotte asked as soon as you have dressed and you had better wash your face with cold water and pinch your cheeks a bit you are very pasty charlotte gave her a sour look and youd better wear something bright emily went on do you have a red dress no of course i dont charlotte crawled out of bed where should i wear a red dress to ive got a winecolored skirt and coat well put it on and have a cup of tea then well go and call on papa ive arranged it i know he is at home today and mama has a luncheon engagement with a friend of mine did you arrange that as well of course i did emily spoke with deliberate patience as if to a rather tiresome child we dont want her coming home in the middle now hurry up and get ready edward was delighted to have the company of both his daugh shyters and sat at the head of the luncheon table with a smile of complete contentment on his face how very pleasant to see you my dear he said to charlotte im so glad emily found you at home and able to come it seems a long time since i saw you last you have not been home when we have called lately charlotte took her cue without waiting for emily no i suppose not edward said without giving it thought we have been quite frequently emily said casually taking a little roast chicken on her fork and then gone out visiting with mama quite an agreeable way to spend ones time provid shying one is not required to do too much of it it can become tediousthe conversations are so much the same i thought it was an occupation you enjoyed edward looked mildly surprised he had not considered the matter greatly merely taken it for granted oh we do emily ate the chicken and then frowned at him but incessant female company has very limited pleasures you know im sure that if george did not offer me his companion shyship in the evening and take me to dinner elsewhere occasionally i should find myself longing for the conversation of some other gentleman a woman is not at her best unless there is a man she admires to observe her you know edward smiled indulgently he had always found emily the easiest of his daughters without being aware that it was largely because she was also the most skilled at judging his moods and masking her own feelings accordingly sarah had been too impa shytient and being the eldest and the prettiest a little selfish and charlotte was far too blunt and would talk about totally unsuit shyable things which embarrassed him george is a fortunate man my dear he said helping himself to more vegetables i hope he appreciates it i hope so too emilys face suddenly became serious it is one of the saddest things that can happen to a woman papa for her husband to lose his regard for her his desire for her company his general observance of her wellbeing you have no idea how many women i have seen begin to look elsewhere for admiration because their husbands have grown to ignore them to look elsewhere he was a little startled really emily i hope you do not mean what that sounds like i would not care to think of you associating with such women others might think the same of you i should dislike that very much she was perfectly grave i have never given george the least cause for displeasure with my conduct especially on that subject she opened her eyes very wide and blue and yet on the other hand i cannot find it in my heart entirely to blame a woman whose husband has begun to treat her with indifference if some other man with pleasant manners and agreeable nature should find her attractive and tell her soand she should in her loneliness be equally drawn to him emily now he was shocked are you condoning adultery because that is unfortunately close to what it sounds like oh certainly not she said with feeling such a thing will always be wrong but there are some situations when i cannot find it in me to say that i do not understand she smiled at him take monsieur alaric the frenchman for instance such a handsome man so beautifully mannered and such an air about him do you not agree charlotte i wondered once or twice if perhaps poor mina was in love with him and not tormod lagarde at all monsieur alaric has so much more maturity dont you think even a touch of mystery about him which is most compelling i have often wondered if he is really french we have only assumed it now if alston spencerbrown had been devoting too much of his attention to his business affairs and had begun to grow so accustomed to mina that he seldom paid her a compliment anymore or bothered with any little romantic gestures such as flowers or a visit to the theatershe drew breaththen monsieur alaric would only have to flatter her a little exhibit the merest admiration and she would be enchanted with him he would be the answer to all her unhappiness and her feeling of no longer mattering that is no excuse he began but his face was noticeably paler and he had forgotten the chicken and you should not speculate about people in such a disgraceful way emily the poor woman is dead and quite unable to defend herself emily was unperturbed i am not suggesting it as an excuse papa one does not need excusesonly reasons she finished the last of her meal and set down her knife and fork now that poor mina is dead i have observed that monsieur alaric has found mama most pleasant and has sought her company to walk with and to talk with she smiled brightly which shows him to be a man of improving taste indeed charlotte has said he seems most sympathetic i do believe charlotte was quite drawn to him herself charlotte looked across the table at emily with less than affection there seemed to be a shade of malicious pleasure in her tone charming she agreed avoiding her fathers eye but i presume that mama is not in mrs spencerbrowns unfortunate situation edward stared from one to the other of them twice he opened his mouth to demand that they speak more clearly what they meant and twice he decided he did not wish to know the maid came and cleared away the dishes and then brought in the pudding it has been some time since we went to the theater edward remarked at last very casually as if it were a totally new thought there must be something new of gilbert and sullivan out now perhaps we should go and see it an excellent idea emily answered equally lightly i can recommend a good jeweler if you have a fancy to give mama some small keepsake he has a most romantic turn of mind and is not overly expensive i know he has quite lovely cameos because i wished george to buy me one i always think they are so personal dont organize me emily im sorry papa she smiled at him charmingly it was only a suggestion i am sure you will do much better yourself thank you he looked at her with dry humor but his hands were still tight on his napkin and he sat very upright in hrs chair emily took a little more pudding this is delicious papa she said sweetly it was so nice of you to invite us edward forbore commenting that she had invited herself at half past two edward returned to the city what are you going to do about mina emily asked as soon as she and charlotte were alone we still have no idea who killed her or even why well the obvious reason is that she snooped once too often charlotte answered i had imagined that for myself emily was a little waspish now that the tension of the interview with edward was over but upon whom it could have been the charringtonsif not over ottilie then maybe over ambrosine taking things charlotte was thinking aloud but personally i think theodora von schenck is more likely i can remember mina making remarks about her income and where it came from i think maybe she already knew and she was having fun stirring up our suspicions perhaps in time she would even have told us her face darkened as the ugliness of the reality opened up in front of her thats pathetic isnt itseeking to impress people and make yourself interesting by spreading pieces of gossip about people hinting that you know terrible secrets its damnably dangerous emilys mouth pulled into a hard unforgiving line think of the harm she could do to other people never mind what happened to her i suppose she hardly deserved to be killed for it but its a wicked thing to do nevertheless and pathetic charlotte insisted she must have had noth shying of her own inside herself to be forever staring outwards needing to know about other peoples lives that hardly excuses her emily was angry everybodys unhappy some time or otherwe dont all go around prying and repeating charlotte did not bother to argue she was worse than that she said she invented sowing seeds of all sorts of vicious things i suppose there is an ugly side to most peoples imaginations if you want to reach for it she changed her expression entirely you were excellent with papa but we still have to discourage monsieur alaric a little i have heard he knows theodora quite well i shall go and call on him this afternoon and see if he has any idea where her money comes from emilys eyebrows rose indeed and how do you propose to introduce yourself to such a call let alone elicit that kind of information from him i shall throw myself on his mercy charlotte made a rapid and rather violent decision youll do what emily was startled j with regard to mamayou fool charlotte snapped her face suddenly hot i shall contrive to let him know that papa is aware of thefriendshipand that he does not look kindly on it you never contrived anything in your life i didnt say i was going to be subtle then when i have done that i shall talk about mina and how upset everyone is why what are you going to do if that is what you are going to do then i shall go and call upon theodora at the same time before monsieur alaric has an opportunity to warn her if by chance they are in it together if there is anything to be in it will be a little difficult because i dont know her but if you can go to a music hall with inigo charrington i daresay i shall manage an unintroduced call upon madame von schenck you need not have brought up the music hall again char shylotte said sourly that was unnecessary well dont worry i shant tell thomas you went alone to call on monsieur alaric emily returned in fact i think you would be wise not to let him know you have any continued interest in the affair at all if you imagine he will suppose i have forgotten it you hardly know thomas charlotte made a rueful face he wouldnt believe it for a moment then use a little senseand at least make sure you stay sober emily responded you can take my carriage to mon shysieur alarics house and i shall walk that way it will be marginally more respectable thank you charlotte had misgivings as soon as the carriage turned out of rutland place and were it not that she would appear such a fool she would have called the driver and told him to return her at once but she was committed it was an extraordinary thing to do and possibly alaric would misinterpret her motives her face flushed hot at the thought of it caroline was certainly not the only woman to have become so dazzled by him as to have lost all sense of proportion by the time the carriage pulled to a stop in paragon walk and the footman handed her out she sincerely hoped that paul alaric was not at home and she would be spared the whole affair and could retire with integrity but fortune was against herhe was not only at home but received her with pleasure how charming to see you charlotte he stood a little away from her smiling and if he was surprised he concealed it entirely but of course he would not to do so would be discourteous that is very generous of you monsieur alaric she replied then instantly felt stiff she was barely through the door and already her interview was not going the way she had intended perhaps in france or wherever he came fromthey had all assumed he was french but no one recalled his saying soit was less familiar there to use a persons christian name he was still smiling and she collected her scattered wits with an effort please forgive my calling upon you without either invitation or having left my card beforehand that was ridiculous and he knew it as well as she did but it afforded her a way to begin i am sure the circumstances are quite unusual he said gently may i offer you some refreshmenta dish of tea it would give her something to occupy her hands graciously and would mean that her stay would be at least half an hour thank you she said that would be most pleasant she sat down on the most comfortablelooking chair and he rang the bell gave the maid instructions and then sat opposite her on a simple dark velvet sofa the room was unusually spare of ornament there were great numbers of leatherbound goldtooled books in a mahogany case a soft gray seascape above the mantel and a turkish prayer rug so brilliant it was like a cathedral window the whole was alien and beautiful he was sitting easily still smiling one leg crossed over the other but there was a seriousness about his eyes he knew she would not have come over any trivial or social matter and he was waiting for her to begin her mouth was dry all small talk eluded her emily and i have been dining with papa she said rather abruptly he did not interrupt still watching her steadily frankly she took a breath and plunged on we were obliged to discuss a rather painful subjectquite apart from minas death or poor tormods injury a shadow of concern crossed his face im sorry she had very little knowledge how much of the relationship was purely on carolines part she must be careful as she had so far seen him display nothing beyond extreme courtesy either he was far more discreet than caroline ormore probablyhe wasj unaware of the depth of her feeling after all he did not know caroline as charlotte did she cleared her throat now that she must either commit herself or allow the subject to drop and talk of something else she found it unexpectedly difficult she was very conscious of him sitting only a few feet away from her once she had considered him as the leader of a black magic ritualthat seemed preposterous now but was she crediting him with less vanity and more compassion than he possessed might he not enjoy the fascination he held for them seemingly without effort she swallowed and began again sounding far more pompous than she wished it seems that papa has been too much engaged in his business lately and has not paid the attention to his domestic life that he should poor mama has felt a little neglected i think of course she has not complained one cannot ask for small signs of affection from ones husband because even if he responds they are then of no valueyou feel you have prompted them yourself and he does not truly mean them so you and your sister have prompted him he suggested understanding beginning to show in his eyes quite she agreed quickly we would be deeply dis shytressed to see our family hurt by a misapprehension in fact we do not intend to allow it to happen these things grow out of hand very quicklynew affections form other parties are drawn in and before you can undo it there is he was looking directly at her and she found herself unable to go on it was quite obvious now that he knew what she meant a domestic tragedy he finished for her she noticed with surprise that there was a faint color under his skin a conscious shyness of himselfa raw and unpleasing light suddenly with a rush of warmth for him she realized he had been unaware of his power underrating its depth completely either he had not understood other women in the past or he had considered their own natures the cause and himself merely the unfortunate catalyst i think tragedy is the appropriate word she continued perhaps we should look a little more closely at what passions can do for example take mrs denbigh you have seen her her despair over mr lagarde would hardly be covered by so gentle and commonplace a term as unhappiness do you think for several minutes he was silent and she began to grow uncomfortable as she became aware of his eyes on her she was very sensitive to being alone in the room with him visiting him by herself in his home was a ridiculous thing to have done and she should have insisted that emily come with her someone was bound to have seen her there was always a servant about there would be talk she had no reputation to loseparagon walk did not care about herbut what about emily someone might have recognized charlotte from the time when she had stayed with emily during the murders here and what of paul alaric himself she blushed with discomfort at her own thoughtlessnessand yet she had not wished emily to accompany her very slowly she raised her eyes to meet his and was startled by the perception in them a closeness as if he and she had touched as if her skin had felt a sudden warmth a tingling she must leave she had said what she came for emilys carriage was at the door and would take her back to rutland place she could join emily at theodora von schencks house thought of theodora reminded her of the other purpose of her visit she must force herself to ask him now the idea of return shying was unthinkable the maid brought the tea and retired she took a sip of it gratefully her mouth was dry and her throat tight emily has called to see madame von schenck she re shymarked as conversationally as she was able i believe you know her quite well he was surprised and his dark eyes widened moderately the acquaintance is more a business one than social although i find her very congenial now it was she who was startled she had hardly expected him to be so frank business what sort of business do you mean then realizing how blunt that sounded she went on i did not know madame von schenck had business or did you perhaps know her husband she stammered ii mean no he smiled faintly at her embarrassment but there was no unkindness in it i did not although i believe he was a most charming man so much so that she has never desired to remarry charlotte pretended that she found such a thing hard to understand although in truth the thought of remarrying should anything happen to pitt was quite absurd to her not even for the security of having a husband she tried to sound sincere after all she has two children to support and an excellent business head he was quite openly amused now not in the least a fashionable thing to have which i imagine is why she is discreet about it especially since her particular interest lies in the area of bathroom furniture his smile broadened not exactly what the ladies of rutland place would find suitablethe design of baths and other such hardware and she is most imaginative in selling and precise in her finances i think she has begun to make a considerable profit she knew there was a silly smile on her face it was all so ridiculously harmless even funny that she wanted to laugh she gathered herself and was ready to rise but before she could frame the words to excuse herself the maid opened the door again to bring in a choice of cakes and was followed immedi shyately by caroline charlotte froze halfway to her feet the smile dead on her lips for an instant caroline did not see her her face was turned to alaric soft with excitement and pleasure then she saw charlotte and every vestige of color bleached out of her skin she looked at her as she might have at some horned thing risen out of the ground there was absolute silence in the room the maid was too frightened to let go of the trolley with a tremendous effort caroline took a deep breath and then another i beg your pardon monsieur alaric she said in a shaking voice i appear to have interrupted you do excuse me she stepped backward past the maid and out the door charlotte glanced for a moment at paul alaric and saw his face as white and appalled as she knew hers must be mirroring the same realization and guilt that she felt then she ran across the room pushed the maid aside and swung the door open mama caroline was in the hallway and could not have failed to hear her but she did not turn her head mama the footman opened the front door and caroline walked out into the sun charlotte went after her snatching her cloak from the footman as she passed she clattered down the steps and out onto the street she caught up with caroline and took her arm it was stiff and caroline shook her off sharply she kept her face straight ahead how could you she said very quietly my own daughter is your vanity so much that you would do this to me charlotte reached for her arm again dont speak to me caroline jerked away roughly dont speak to me please not ever again i dont wish to know you youre being stupid charlotte said as fiercely as she could without raising her voice for the whole street to hear i went there to find out if he knew how theodora von schenck got her money dont lie to me charlotte im perfectly capable of seeing for myself what is going on are you charlotte demanded angry with her mother not for misjudging her but for being so vulnerable for allowing herself to be swept away by a dream till the awakening threatxened everything that really mattered are you mama i think if you could see anything at all you would know as well as i do that he doesnt love you in the least she saw the tears in carolines eyes but she had to go on it isnt anything to do with me or any other woman he is simply unaware that your feeling for him is anything more than pleasanta little relief from boredoma courtesy you have built up a whole romantic vision around him that has nothing to do with the kind of person he is underneath you dont even know him really all you see is what you want to she held on to carolines arm this time too hard for her to snatch it away i know exactly how you feel she went on keeping up with her i did the same with dominic i pinned all my romantic ideals onto him put them over him like a suit of armor till i had no idea what he was like underneath them it isnt fair we havent the right to dress anyone else in our dreams and expect them to wear them for us that isnt love its infatuation and its childishand dangerous just think how unbearably lonely it must be would you like to live with someone who didnt even look at or listen to you but only used you as a figure of fantasy someone to pretend about someone to make responsible for all your emotions so that they are to blame if you are happy or unhappy you have no right to do that to anyone else caroline stopped and stared at her tears running down her face those are terrible things to say charlotte she whispered her voice difficult and hoarse terrible no they arent charlotte shook her head hard it is just the truth and when youve looked at it a bit longer youll find you like it please god that could be true like it you tell me i have made a ridiculous fool of myself over a man who doesnt care for me at all and that even the feeling i had was an illusion and selfish nothing to do with loveand i shall come to like that charlotte threw her arms around her because she wanted to be close to her share in her pain and comfort her besides looking at her face right now would be an intrusion into privacy too deep to allow forgetting afterward maybe like it was a silly phrase but when you see it is true you will find the lies something you dont even want to remember but believe me everyone who was ever capable of passion has made a fool of themselves at least once we all fall in love with a vision sometime the thing is to be able to wake up and still love for a long time neither of them said anything more but stood in the footpath with their arms around each other then very slowly caroline began to relax her body lostits stiffness and the pain changed from anger to simple weeping im so ashamed of myself she said softly so terribly ashamed charlottes arms tightened there was not anything else to say time would ease it away but words could not in the distance there was the sound of hooves someone else making an early visit caroline straightened up and sniffed hard for a moment her hand lingered on charlottes then she withdrew it and fished in her reticule for a handkerchief i dont think i shall make any more calls this afternoon she said calmly perhaps you would like to come home for tea thank you charlotte said they began to walk again slowly you know mina was quite wrong about theodora her money doesnt come from a brothel at all or blackmailshe has a business for selling bathroom furniture caroline was stunned her eyebrows shot up you mean yes water closets oh charlotte two days later pitt was still as confused as ever about who had killed mina spencerbrown he had a wealth of facts but no conclusions that were subject to proofand worse than that none that satisfied his own mind he stood still on the pavement of rutland place in the sun it was warm there sheltered from the east wind by the high houses and he stopped to collect his thoughts before going on to alston for yet more questioning he had been talking to ambrosine charrington and the inter shyview had left him less sure than he had been before he went it was always possible that mina had observed ambrosine in the act of stealing and ambrosine had been unable to deny it if that had been so mina might have threatened her with exposure but would ambrosine have minded from what charlotte had told him that was far from the case she might even have been perversely pleased by the disgrace ottilie had said it was her motive for doing it in the first place a desire to shock and distress her husband to break out of the mold into which he had cast her of course she might well not see it so lucidly herself but he found it impossible to believe she would commit murder to protect a secret she half wanted known did she hate lovell enough to have allowed mina to blackmail him in theory it was possible it had an irony that would appeal to ambrosine and yet he felt that he would have had some sense of the anger and the tension in lovell and of the bitter taste of satisfac shytion in ambrosine herself and he had not to him she seemed just as elegantly imprisoned as before and lovell just as undis shyturbed in his massive impregnable security mention of ottilie had shaken lovells composure most markedly and he had become whitelipped sweatbrowed he had tried intensely to hide the whole affair yet ambrosine left pitt entirely comfortable perhaps it was alston spencerbrown after all maybe minas longstanding involvement with tormod lagarde had finally proved too much for him and when alston had learned that she was still enamored he had procured more belladonna from some other doctor in the city poured it into the cordial and left it to do its work all pitts investigations had pointed to the conclusion that minas infatuation with tormod had been discreet but very real many a husband had killed for less and alstons ordinary exterior could hide a violent possessiveness a sense of outrage where murder might seem to him no more than justice pitt was driven back to the facts the cordial wine was homemade a mixture of elderberry and currants people in rutland place did not make their own wines of course it was impossible to tell who might have been given some and if they had used it to mask poison they would hardly own to its possession now the belladonna could have been distilled by anyone or even crushed from the deadly nightshade plant itself which while less common than the brightly flowered woody nightshade was far more lethal it did not need the fruit that ripened in the autumn even the leaves were sufficient and they might be found in hedgerows or woodlands in any wild area in the south shyeast of the country it was perhaps a little early for a biennial plant but in a sheltered placeror even blown and taken root in a conservatory or hothouse a few shoots above the ground would be enough the facts proved nothing anyone could have given her the bottle at almost any time minas servants had not seen i before or any like it but then one does not always tell servants of cordial wine it is not drunk at table anyone could have picked the nightshade and crushed the leaves it required no skill no special knowledge it was wellknown lore that the plant killed every child was warned even its name told as much he was driven back again to motive although you could not damn anyone on motive alone one man will kill for sixpence or because he feels he has been insulted another will lose reputation fortune and loveanything rather than commit murder he was still standing in the sun when a hansom cab swung around the far corner and clattered down the place jolting to a stop in front of the lagardes entrance pitt was close enough to see dr mulgrew practically fall out clutching his bag and scramble up the steps the door opened before he got to it and mulgrew disappeared inside pitt hesitated natural instinct prompted him to wait there a while and see what should happen next but then since there was a man in desperate injury in the house an emergency call for the doctor was not surprising and probably had nothing whatsoever to do with minas death if pitt were honest he would admit that he was using the doctors arrival as an excuse to put off the next round of questions when pitt got to the spencerbrowns alston was out which in a way was a relief although it only postponed what would have to be done another time he contented himself with talking to the servants again going over endless recollections impressions opinions he was still there sitting in the kitchen accepting with consid shyerable pleasure the cooks offer of luncheon with the rest of the servants when the scullery door burst open a maid ran in and the smells of stew and puddings were dissipated by the scents of sharp wind and earthy vegetables for goodness sake elsie close that door the cook snapped where were you brought up girl elsie kicked at the door with one foot obeying out of habit mr lagardes dead mrs abbotts she said her eyes like saucers just died this morning so may from over the way says seen the doctor come she did and go again a mercy i says poor gentleman so beautiful he was reckon as he was destined to die some of us is shall i go and shut the blinds no you will not the cook said tartly he didnt die in this house mr lagardes passing is not our business weve enough of our own griefs you just get on with your work and if youre late for luncheon youll go hungry my girl elsie scuttled off and the cook sat down sharply dead she regarded pitt sideways i suppose i shouldnt say so but perhaps it is as well poor creature youll excuse me mr pitt but if he was as terrible hurt as they say could be the lords mercy hes gone she mopped her brow with her apron pitt looked at her a buxom woman with thick graying hair and an agreeable face now twisted with a mixture of relief and guilt a nasty shock all the same he said quietly on top of all else that has happened lately bound to upset you you look a bit poorly how about a drop of brandy do you keep any about the kitchen she looked at him through narrow eyes suspicion aroused im used to such things he said reading her thoughts perfectly but you arent let me get you some she bridled a little like a hen fluffing out her feathers wellif you think on the top shelf over there behind the split peas dont you let that mr jenkins see it or hell have it back in his pantry before you can say knife pitt hid his smile and stood up to pour a generous measure into a cup and pass it to her how about yourself she offered with a little squint no thank you he said and put the bottle back replacing the split peas strictly for shock and im afraid its my business to deal with death on occasion she drank the cup to the bottom and he took it and rinsed it out in the scullery sink most civil of you mr pitt she said with satisfaction pity as we cant help you but we cant and thats a fact we never seen any cordial wine like that nor any bottle neither and we dont know anything as to why anyone should want to murder the mistress i still say as its someone whats mad he was torn between duty to continue with questionsso far totally unprofitableand an intense desire to forget the whole thing and abandon himself to the pleasures of mrs abbotts luncheon he settled for the luncheon i afterward he considered whether to continue his questioning but the shock of tormods death hung heavy over everything ib many houses curtains were drawn and a silence muffled even the usual civil exchanges till they seemed an indecency a little after two oclock he gave up and returned to the police station he pulled out all the evidence they had collected to date and began to read it over again in the somewhat forlorn hope that a new insight would emerge a relationship between facts that he had overlooked before he had discovered nothing by quarter to five when harris poked his head around the door and announced amaryllis denbigh pitt was startled he had expected that with the blow of tormods death she would be prostrated with grief even in need of medical care so fierce had been her anguish over his accident according to charlotte and he trusted charlottes judgment of people if not always of her own behavior although in truth he was less outraged by the music hall incident now that he thought about it than he intended she should know but why on earth was amaryllis here shall i send her in sir harris said irritably she looks in a right state to me you want to be careful of her yes i suppose youd better and stay here yourself in case she faints or becomes hysterical pitt said the thought was an extremely unpleasant one but he could not afford to deny her entrance perhaps at last this was the catalyst and she might give him the sliver of fact he so desperately needed yes mr pitt sir harris withdrew formally signifying his disapproval and a moment later followed amaryllis in i amaryllis was whitefaced iier eyes glittering her hands moving over the folds of her skirt into her muff and out again over her skirt she had entered the room with black veiling over her face but now she threw it off inspector pitt she was so stiff her body shook yes mrs denbigh he did not like her yet in spite of himself he was moved to pity please sit down you must be feeling distressed may we offer you some refreshment a cup of tea no thank you she sat down with her back to harris i should like to speak to you in private what i have to say is very painful pitt hesitated he did not want to be alone with her she was obviously on the border of hysteria and he was afraid of a storm of weeping that would be completely beyond his abilities to deal with he thought of sending for the police surgeon his eyes flickered to harris if you please amaryllis voice was harsh rising in a kind of desperation this is my duty inspector because it concerns the murder of mrs spencerbrown but it is extraordinarily painful for me and i do not wish the added mortification of having to repeat it in front of a sergeant of course pitt said immediately he could not drawback now sergeant harris will wait outside harris stood up with a sour look of warning to pitt over amaryllis shoulder then went out closing the door firmly well mrs denbigh pitt asked it was a strange moment he knew so much about these people had studied them until they stalked his sleep and yet now it was she quite casually walking in here unasked who was about to tell him what might be the solution to the whole matter her voice was grating low as if the words hurt her i know who killed mina spencerbrown mr pitt i did not tell you before because i could not betray a friend she was dead and there was nothing to do for her now it is different tormod is dead too her face was white and empty like an unpainted doll there is no reason now to lie he was too noble he protected her all her life but i shant justice can be done i shall not stand in its way i think you had better explain mrs denbigh he wanted to encourage her yet there was something inexpressibly ugly in the room and he could feel it as surely as damp in the air what lies have there been who was mr lagarde protecting her eyes flashed wider his sister of course her voice shook eloise he was surprised but he stopped before speaking masked his feelings and looked across at her calmly eloise killed mrs spencerbrown yes how do you know that mrs denbigh she was breathing in and out so deeply he could see the rise and fall of her bosom i suspected it from the first because i knew how she felt she began she adored her brother she possessed himshe built her whole life around him their parents died when they were both young and he has always looked after her to begin with of course that was all quite natural but as time passed and they grew older she did not let go of the childish dependence she continued to cling onto him to go everywhere with him demand his entire attention and when hesought any outside interests she would become jealous pretend to be illanything to bring him back to her she took a long breath she was watching pitt watching his eyes his face of course if tormod showed any natural affection for any other woman eloise was beside herself she continued she never rested until she had driven the woman away either with lies or by feigning sickness or else worrying at poor tormod until he found it hardly worth his while to try anymore and he was so kindhearted he still protected her in spite of the cost to himself im sure you have found out in all your questions that mina was very attracted to tormod in fact she was in love with him it is stupid now to try to cover it with genteel words it cannot hurt her anymore naturally that drove eloise into a frenzy of jealousy the thought that tormod would give any of his attention to another woman was more than she could bear it must have turned the balance of her mind she poisoned the cordial you have been so assiduously seeking i have had it offered to me in their house they bring it from the country with them when they come back from visiting hertfordshire i have drunk it on occasion myself she was sitting very upright in the chair her eyes still fixed on pitts mina went to their house that day to visit eloise as you already know eloise gave her the cordial wine as a parting present she drank it when she got homeand diedas eloise had planned that she should tormod protected hernaturally he had brought her up from a child i daresay he felt responsiblealthough god knows why he should in time he would have had to have her put away in a sanatorium or somewhere i think in his heart he knew that but he could not bear to do it yet ask anyone who knew them they will tell you that eloise hated me alsobecause tormod cared for me pitt sat without moving it all made sense he remembered eloises face her dark eyes full of inward vision absorbed in pain she was the sort of woman who cried out for protection she seemed as frail as a dream herself as if she would vanish at a sudden start or a shout he did not want to think she had receded into madness and murder and yet he could think of no argument to refute it nothing false in what amaryllis had said thank you mrs denbigh he said coldly it is late now but tomorrow i shall go to rutland place and investigate fully what you have said he could not resist adding a pity you were not as frank with me before there were faint spots of color in her face i couldnt and it would not have done any good anyway tormod would have denied it he felt responsible for her she had driven him into that over the years she is a parasite she never wanted him to have any separate being and she succeeded she spent her whole life every day all day trying to make sure he felt guilty if he ever did anything without her went anywhere without hereven if he laughed at a joke without her laughing too her voice was rising again shrill and hard shes mad youve no idea what it did to him she destroyed him she deserves to be locked awayforever and ever mrs denbigh he wanted to silence her to get rid of that glittering face with its girlishly soft lines and its hollow hatebright eyes mrs denbigh please dont distress yourself again i will go tomorrow and talk to miss lagarde i shall take sergeant harris and we shall look for the evidence you say is there if we find any proof at all then we shall act accordingly now sergeant harris will accompany you to your carriage and i suggest you take some sedative and go to your bed early this has been a most terrible day for you you must be exhausted she stood in the middle of the floor staring at him apparently weighing in her mind whether he was going to do as she intended i shall go tomorrow he acceded a little more sharply without replying she turned and walked out closing the door behind her leaving him alone and unaccountably miserable there was no way he could avoid it this duty that gave himno satisfaction at all no sense of resolution but then murder always brought tragedy he dispatched harris to search yet again this time particularly bedrooms and dressing rooms for any cordial wine similar to that which mina had drunk or any empty bottles like the one found in minas room he also took the precaution of showing harris a picture of the deadly nightshade plant so that he might look for it in the conservatory and outhouses neither its pres shyence nor its absence would prove anything however except that it was a country plant and would be unusual in the middle of london but the lagardes had a country house there might be nightshade in every hedge or wood in hertfordshire for all he knew eloise received him dressed completely in black the blinds were drawn halfway in traditional mourning the servants whitefaced and somber she sat on a chaise longue close to the fire but she looked as if its heat would never again reach her im sorry pitt said instinctivelynot only for his intrusion but for everything for her loneliness for death for being unable to do anything but add to the burden she said nothing what he did perhaps what anyone did no longer mattered to her she was in a desolation beyond his power to touch for good or ill he sat down he felt ridiculous standing as if his hands and feet might knock something over there was no point in stringing it out trying to be tactful that somehow made it worse almost obscene as if he did not recognize death mrs spencerbrown came to see you the day she died it was a statement no one had ever denied it yes she was uninterested did you give her a bottle of cordial wine she was staring into the flames cordial wine no i dont think so didnt you ask that before yes does it matter yes miss lagarde because the poison was in it a smile passed over her face as shadowy as a ripple of cold wind over water and you think i put it there i did not but you did give her the wine i dont remember i may have perhaps she was looking peaked and said she was tired or something like that we do have cordial wine a neighbor in hertfordshire gives it to us do you still have any i expect so i dont like it but tormod did its kept in the butlers pantryits safe there its quite strong miss lagarde she did not appear to understand the consequence of what they were discussing she was removed from it as though it were all a story about someone else miss lagarde it is a very serious matter she looked up at him at last and he was stricken by the pain and horror in her eyesnot for him but for something else something only she could see her expression was devoid of any kind of anger any hatredonly horror endless immeasurable horror was this madness he was seeing or perhaps the knowledge of madness in one still sane enough to see herself and know what lies ahead the irrevocable descent into the black corridors of lunacy no wonder tormod had tried to protect her he yearned to do so himself to prevent it to bring her back any way he knew how he could not think of anything to say there was nothing large enough to encompass the enormity of what he thought he had seen he could not bear it he stood up there was no need to twist the knife with questions the evidence was what mattered without that there was nothing they could do anyway whatever he knewor guessed im sorry to have disturbed you he said awkwardly ill go and help sergeant harris if there is anything else i shall ask one of the servants ill try not to interrupt you again thank you she sat quite still and did not even turn to watch as he walked to the door and opened it he left her motionless looking neither at the fire nor at the white flowers on the table but at something he could not see and had never seen it did not take them long to find at least one answer sergeant harris had brought the empty bottle found in minas bedroom and shown it to the servants the butler recognized it did you give one of these to miss lagarde before mrs spencerbrown came here the day she died pitt asked him grimly the man was not unintelligent he saw the importance of the question and his face was pale a small muscle ticking in his jaw no sir miss eloise never cared for it mr bevan pitt began no sir i understand what you are saying we bring half a dozen bottles or so when we come back from the country but miss eloise never had any of it she disliked it neither does she have keys to my pantry i have one set and mr tormod had the other but he left them in abbots langley last year at christmas and they are still there pitt took a deep breath there was nothing to be served by shouting at the man mr bevan he began again patiently i know what you are going to say sir bevan cut in i gave the wine to mr tormod a bottle at a time as he asked for it he had a bottle the night before mrs spencerbrown came he used to drink it sometimes and i thought nothing of it pitt could not blame him when he and harris had been there before they had searched discreetly but fearing a guilty or even a protective servant would destroy the bottle they had not described it or brought the one they had what happened to the bottle do you know he asked may i speak to the upstairs maid that will not be necessary sir ive asked her just now since mr harris came she doesnt know sir she hasnt seen it again then it could be the one given to mrs spencerbrown yes sir i imagine it must be is every other bottle accounted for yes sir it is rather strong stuff so i keep a check on it why did you not mention it when we asked before mr bevan it is not a table wine sir so i imagine the other servants had not seen it such things are more usually kept in a medicine chest or by a bedside since that was the last bottle when a search was made no more would have been found pitt was irritated that a butler should explain his job to him so thoroughly or perhaps he was still thinking of eloise alone and unreachable this man was not to blame he could not have known the composition of the wine with which mina was poisoned so mr tormod had the last bottle yes sir in his bedroom yes sir the mans face was very solemn did he complain of missing it no sir and i would have heard of it if he had we are most strict about intoxicating liquors so when had eloise poisoned it and given it to mina bevan moved from one foot to the other if youll excuse me sir what makes you think miss eloise had the wine or gave it to mrs spencerbrown information pitt said dryly not from anyone in this house sir no there was no point in being coy mrs denbigh sevans face changed indeed mrs denbigh is a very wealthy lady sir if youll pardon me for making so illmannered an observation very wealthy indeed and handsome too she was remarkably fond of mr tormod and i believe they might well have married always providing of course mr tormod had no other involvements pitt took his meaning perfectly are you suggesting mr bevan that it was mr tormod and not miss eloise who murdered mrs spencerbrown bevan met his gaze without flinching it would seem so sir why should miss eloise kill her jealousy over her brothers affection pitt replied the relationship with mrs spencerbrown was over some time ago sir if he had married it could never have been mrs spencerbrownbut it could well have been mrs denbigha rich and handsome lady free to marry and if youll pardon me more than willing and yet mrs denbigh is alive and well pitt turned to harris have you looked in the conservatory harris yes sir no nightshade but thats not to say it was never there i dont imagine our murderer would be foolish enough to leave it no pitts face tightened no probably not will there be anything else sir bevan inquired no thank you not now pitt was reluctant to say it but it was the mans due thank you for your help bevan bowed very slightly you are welcome sir damn pitt swore as soon as he judged the butler to be out of earshot hellfire and damnation ill lay any odds you like hes right harris said with sincerity makes a lot of sense rich and handsome widow like he says old mistress making trouble threatening to tell all very embarrassing stand in the way of a lot of very nice money wouldnt be the first time never prove it i know that pitt said furiously damn it man i know that they walked through to the hallway and found dr mulgrew coming down the stairs he looked blearyeyed and his hair stood up in a quiff at the top of his head he must have been there to treat eloise good morning pitt said tersely perfectly bloody mulgrew agreed not with pitts words but with his tone of voice weve lost tormod you know injuries proved too much for himheart finally carried him off then he gave a sheepish smile ive got a head like a tin bucket need a hair of the dog i think much obliged to you pitt youre a good man join me in a drink call for bevan i need something to clear this headache shouldnt drink cham shypagne at my age and then get up at dawn not natural champagne pitt glared at him yes you know fizzy stuff there is nothing like the fizz fizz fizz he sang very softly in a remarkably pleasant baritone ill drink every drop there is is is pitt was forced to smile although it hurt thanks mulgrew said clasping him by the arm youre a generous man when pitt arrived home in the evening charlotte was waiting for him as soon as he entered the door she knew from his face something had happened that had saddened and confused him the day had been warm and the parlor faced south she had had the windows open onto the garden and the smell of fresh grass was in the air a few white narcissus sat in a slender jug their fragrance as sharp and clean as spring rain what is it another time she might have waited but not tonight what happened thomas tormod is dead he took his coat off and let it fall onto the sofa he died this morning she did not bother to pick it up oh she looked at his face trying to match the news to the pain in him she knew it was not enough what else he smiled and there was a sudden sweetness in it he put out his hand and took hers she clung onto it hard what else she repeated amaryllis denbigh came to the police station and told me it was eloise who killed mina she said she had guessed it a long while ago but had said nothing to protect tormod now that he was dead she didnt care anymore do you believe her she asked carefully her own mind wanted to reject the idea but she knew that murder did not always lie where it was easy to understand or to hate some shytimes there is darkness underneath what seems to be light i went to look he sighed and sat down pulling her down next to him i found evidence i dont know whether it would stand in courtit might but it doesnt matter because all i could say is that it was someone in that house and the butler swears it must have been tormod hell stick to thatbut whether its the truth or to protect eloise i dont know i probably never will why should eloise kill mina she asked jealousy she was intensely possessive of tormod then she would have killed amaryllis amaryllis was the one he could have married she argued he wouldnt have married minashe was no danger she could never have been anything more than a mistress and i doubt she was even that thats what bevan said the butler yes amaryllis is the possessive one charlotte was thinking turning ideas over in her mind memories she hates eloise enough to come to you and tell a lie like that even with tormod dead she still hates well dont worry i shant arrest eloise he tightened his arm around her i havent any proof she pulled away and looked straight at him what do you believe he thought about it for a moment his eyes on her as if he would explore her thoughts also i think it was tormod he answered at last i think mina was being troublesome pestering him and he wanted to marry amaryllisfor her money among other thingsand he killed mina to keep her quiet perhaps she was threatening him charlotte sat back slowly thinking poor amaryllis had been so infatuated with tormod that it had destroyed the gentleness in her all the power of friendship and had left no room for other loves or even decencies now she and eloise could not even comfort each other strange what obsession can do she said aloud its very frightening it seems to devour everything else all your other values get eaten up she thought of caroline and paul alaric but she did not want to say it aloud better it was forgotten even by pitt especially now that edward showed signs of reforming last evening he had escorted caroline to the savoy theater to see the mikado and had presented her with a garnet brooch besides had paul alaric ever glimpsed the power he possessed to arouse womens emotions he had the kind of face that sug shygested great currents of passion underneatha suggestion built upon all too easily by romantic women needing mystery escap shying from familiar men they believed they read without effort whether he had ever felt such great tides of passion himself she could riot know but in that last moment when she and caroline had left him staring at them helplessly the shock of their passing had been like a wound in his face for that alone she would always think well of him tormod had awoken an even wilder hunger in amaryllis something about him some quality of body or mind had enrap shytured her till she could think of nothing and no one else he must have had an overwhelming charm a magnetism that obliterated all other judgment and naturally eloise had loved him they had spent all their lives together no wonder amaryllis was jealous excluded from all those years suddenly an appalling thought flashed across her mind so ugly she could not even name it and yet the breath of it left her body cold whats the matter pitt asked youre shivering the thought had been so hideous she was not prepared to give it words even to him now that it had come to her she would have to talk to eloise and see if it was true but not tonightand perhaps she would not tell pitt just glad its over she answered and moved closer to him she took his hand again and held it the lie did not bother her after all it was only an idea in the morning she dressed in her darkest clothes and caught the omnibus she got off at the nearest stop to rutland place and walked the rest of the way she did not call on caroline in fact if she was not seen she did not mean to mention her visit at all the footman opened the door good morning mrs pitt he said in a hushed voice stepping back to allow her in good morning she replied gravely i have called to express my sympathies is miss lagarde well enough to receive me i will inquire maam if you care to come this way mr tormod is in the morning room but you will find it very chill in there for a moment she was startled by the mention of tormod as if he were alive then she realized that naturally he would be laid out and there would be those whose last respects included a look at the dead perhaps it was expected of her also thank you she hesitated then went to view the dead man the room was dark and as chill as the footman had said possessed of the peculiar coldness of decay black crepe fes shytooned the walls and the table legs and there was a black cloth on the sideboard tormod was in a dark polished coffin on the table in the center and the gas lamps were unlit the outside sun filtered through the blinds gave a diffuse light quite clear and she was compelled against her will to go over and look at him the eyes had been closed and yet she felt as if the expression were unnatural there was no peace in the face death had taken the spirit but his features held the unmistakable impression that his last emotion had been one of hatred impotent and corroding hatred she looked away frightened by it trapped by something cold and allpervasive that grew in her mind and rooted firmer and firmer the door opened silently and eloise stood still a moment before coming in now that they were face to face with the corpse between them it was far harder than charlotte had expected im sorry she said awkwardly eloise im so sorry eloise said nothing but her eyes stared straight back at charlottedirect almost curious you loved him very much charlotte went on there was a flicker across eloises face but still she said nothing did you hate him as well charlotte found the words coming more easily pity was stronger than embarrassment or fear she wanted to reach out and touch eloise put her arms around her hold her close enough to give her warmth feed her own life into her frozen body eloise breathed in hard and gave a little sigh how did you know charlotte had no answer it had come from impressions gathered a look a word things remembered from the dark understandings of the mind hidden from thought because they are forbidden too ugly to own that was what mina knew wasnt it charlotte said that was why he killed herit had nothing to do with past affaires or marrying amaryllis he would have married amaryllis eloise said softly i wouldnt have minded that even his notloving me anymore but she wouldnt have married him charlotte replied not if mina had told everyone that you and tormod were lovers as well as brother and sister now that the words were out they were not so frighteningthey could be said the truth of them faced perhaps not eloise was looking down at the dead face she did not seem to care and charlotte knew suddenly that she had not reached the core of it yet there was more truth to come and worse the selfhatred in eloise the despair was more than a knowledge of incest and then rejection deeper than anything she had yet understood how old were you when it began charlotte asked eloise reached out and touched the windingsheet thirteen charlotte felt the tears well up inside her and she experienced an overwhelming hatred of tormod so profound she could look on his mangled body and his dead face without regret so coldly as if he were fish on the market slab you didnt kill mina did you eloise shook her head no but it doesnt matter if the police think i did because im guilty anyway charlotte opened her mouth then closed it again i let tormod kill my baby eloises voice was no more than a whisper i was with child about four months i didnt realize for a long timei didnt know enough then when i did realize i told tormod that was when i first met you we didnt go to the country because of minas death i went to get an abortion i didnt know till we got there tormod said i had to because i am not married and what we were doing was wrong he said the child was not formed that it would only be likelike a little blood she was so ashen charlotte was afraid she would not be able to stand but she dared not move to help her these words came from an agony so deep it must burst he lied to me it was my child charlotte felt the tears run down her face and without thinking her hands went to the surface that contained her womb and the child in it it was my baby eloise said they never let me touch it they just got rid of it silence filled the room but it seemed nothing could be vast enough to contain the pain that is why i killed him eloise said at last as soon as i was well enough he took me out for a drive in the carriage i pushed him off and the other carriage and horses drove over him it didnt kill him it only crippled him we brought him back here to lie in that bed upstairs tormented with pain knowing he would never walk again i used to go in and look at him he was paralyzed did you know he couldnt move couldnt even speak he would just stare at me with hatred so strong i felt it would burn his body up my own brother whom i had loved all my life i stood at the end of the bed and stared back i wasnt sorry i hated myself and i hated him i even thought of killing myself im not sure why i didnt do it but i wasnt sorry for him i couldnt pity him i can still see my babys bodyin my mind the doctor said i shall never have another it was something they did charlotte moved at last she walked around the coffin and closed the lid then very gently she took eloises hand holding it in both her own are you going to tell the police eloise said quietly no charlotte put her arms around her and held her hard the sobs inside her struggling to get out she must control herself she took a deep breath no he killed minahe would have been hanged for that anyway it was wrong to kill him but its done now i shall never speak of it again slowly eloise relaxed and let her head rest on charlottes shoulder at last for the first time since she had seen the tiny body of her child she began to weep for a long time beyond counting they stood together beside the closed coffin letting the tears come sharing the pain it was not until inigo charrington stood in the doorway his eyes full of sympathy and affection that at last charlotte let go of eloise
