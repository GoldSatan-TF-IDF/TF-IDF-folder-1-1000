anne perry resurrection row the fog swirled thick and sour down the street obscuring the distances and blurring the gas lamps above the air was bitter and damp catching in the throat yet it did not chill the enthusiasm of the audience pouring out of the theatre a few bursting into impromptu snatches of song from gilbert and sullivans new opera the mikado one girl even lilted from side to side in imitation of the little japanese heroine before her mother told her sharply to remember herself and behave with the decorum her family had a right to expect two hundred yards away sir desmond and lady cantlay were walking slowly in the general direction of leicester square intending to hail a cab they had not brought their own carriage because of the difficulty of finding a suitable place to meet afterwards on such a january night one did not wish to keep the horses standing or roaming the area to pick one up it was too hard to come by a really excellently matched pair to risk their health in such an unnecessary fashion cabs were plentiful enough and naturally gathered at the coming out of any theatre i did enjoy that lady gwendoline said with a sigh of pleasure that turned into a shiver as a swirl of fog wreathed her and the damp touched her face i must purchase some of the music to play for myself it really is delightful especially that song the hero sings she took a breath coughed and then sang in a very sweet voice a wandering minstrel i a thing of rags and patcheserwhat was next desmond i recall the tune but the words escape me he took her arm to draw her away from the curb as a cab swished by splashing manure where the street sweeper had gone home too early to clear it i dont know my dear im sure it will be in the music it really is a miserable night it is no pleasure at all to walk we must find a cab immediately i can see one coming now wait here and ill call him he stepped out into the street as a hansom loomed out of the mist its slow hooves muffled in the blanketing damp the horse dragging head down almost directionless come on sir desmond said irritably whats the matter with you man dont you want a fare the horse drew level with him and raised its head ears coming forward at the sound of his voice cabby desmond said sharply there was no reply the driver sat motionless on the box his greatcoat collar turned up hiding most of his face the reins slack over the rail cabby desmond was growing increasingly annoyed i presume you are not engaged my wife and i wish to go to gadstone park still the man did not stir or steady the horse which was moving gently shifting from foot to foot making it unsafe for gwendoline to attempt to climb into the cab for heavens sake man whats the matter with you desmond reached up and grabbed at the skirts of the drivers coat and pulled sharply control your animal to his horror the man tilted toward him overbalanced and toppled down falling untidily off the box over the wheel and onto the pavement at his feet desmonds immediate thought was that the man was drunken insensible he would not be by any stretch the only cabby to fortify himself against endless hours in the bitter fog by taking more alcohol than he could handle it was an infernal nuisance but he was not without a flicker of understanding for it were he not in gwendolines hearing he would have sworn fluently but now he was obliged to hold his tongue drunk he said with exasperation gwendoline came forward and looked at him cant we do something about it she had no idea what such a thing might be desmond bent down and rolled him over till the man was lying on his back and at the same moment the wind blew a clear patch in the fog so the gaslight fell on his face it was appallingly obvious that he was deadindeed that he had been dead for some time even more dreadful than the livid puffy flesh was the sweet smell of putrefaction and a crumble of earth in the hair there was an instants silence long enough for the indrawing of breath the wave of revulsion then gwendoline screamed a high thin sound smothered immediately by the night desmond stood up slowly his own stomach turning over trying to put his body between her and the sight on the pavement he expected her to faint and yet he did not know quite what to do she was heavy as she sank against him and he could not maintain her weight help he called out desperately help me the horse was used to the indescribable racket of the london streets and it was barely stirred by gwendolines scream desmonds shout did not move it at all he cried out again his voice rising as he struggled to prevent her sliding out of his grip onto the filthy pavement and to imagine some way of dealing with the horror behind him before she regained her senses and became completely hysterical it seemed like minutes standing in the wreaths of coldness the cab looming over him silent except for the breathing of the horse then at last there were footsteps a voice and a shape what is it whats wrong an enormous man materialized out of the fog muffled in a woolen scarf coattails flapping what happened have you been attacked desmond was still holding gwendoline who was at last beginning to stir he looked at the man and saw an intelligent humorous face of undoubted plainness in the halo of the gaslight he was not so enormous merely tall and dressed in too many layers of clothes none of which appeared to be done up correctly were you attacked the man repeated a little more sharply desmond jerked himself into some presence of mind no he grasped gwendoline more tightly pinching her without meaning to no thethe cabby is dead he cleared his throat and coughed as the fog caught him i fear he has been dead some time my wife fainted if you would be kind enough to assist me sir i shall endeavor to revive her and then i imagine we should summon the police i suppose they take care of such things the poor man is an appalling sight he cannot be left there i am the police the man replied looking past him to the form on the ground inspector pitt he fished absently for a card and turned up a penknife and a ball of string he abandoned the effort and bent down by the body touching the face with his fingers for a moment then the earth on the hair hes dead desmond began in factin fact he looks almost as if he had been buriedand dug up again pitt stood up running his hands down his sides as though he could rub off the feel of it yes i think youre right nasty very nasty gwendoline was now coming fully to consciousness and straightened up at last taking the weight off desmonds arm although she still leaned against him its all right my dear he said quickly trying to keep her turned away from pitt and the body the police are going to take care of it he looked grimly at pitt as he said this trying to make something of an order of it it was time the man did something more useful than merely agree with him as to the obvious before pitt could reply a woman came out of the darkness handsome and with a warmth in the curves of her face that survived even the dankness of this january street what is it she looked straight at pitt charlotte he hesitated debating for an instant how much to tell her the cabby is dead looks as if hes been dead a little while i shall have to see that arrangements are made he turned to desmond my wife he explained leaving the words hanging desmond cantlay desmond resented being expected to introduce himself socially to a policemans wife but he had been left no civil alternative lady cantlay he moved his head fractionally toward gwendoline how do you do sir desmond charlotte replied with remarkable composure lady cantlay how do you do gwendoline said weakly if you would be good enough to give me your address pitt asked in case there should be any inquiry then im sure you would prefer to find another cab and go home yes desmond agreed hastily yeswe live in gadstone park number twentythree he wanted to point out that he could not possibly help in any enquiry since he had never known the man or had the least idea who he was or what had happened to him but he realized at the last moment that it was a subject better not pursued he was glad enough simply to leave it did not occur to him until after he was in another cab and halfway home that the policemans wife was going to have to find her own way or else wait with her husband for the mortuary coach and accompany him and the body perhaps he should have offered her some assistance stillit was too late now better to forget the whole business as soon as possible charlotte and pitt stood on the pavement beside the body pitt could not leave her alone in the street in the fog nor could he leave the body unattended he searched in his pockets again and after some moments found his whistle he blew it as hard as he could waited and then blew it again how could a cabby have been dead for more than an hour or two charlotte asked quietly wouldnt the horse take him home pitt screwed up his face his long curved nose wrinkled i would have thought so how did he die she asked cold there was pity in her voice he put out a hand to touch her gently a gesture that said more than he might have spoken in an hour i dont know he answered her very quietly but hes been dead a long time maybe a week or more and theres earth in his hair charlotte stared at him her face paling earth she repeated in london she did not look at the body how did he die i dont know the police surgeon but before he had time to finish his thought a constable burst out of the darkness and a moment later another behind him briefly pitt told them what had happened and handed over responsibility for the entire affair it took him ten minutes to find another cab but by quarterpast eleven he and charlotte were back in their own home the house was silent but warm after the bitter streets jemima their twoyearold daughter was spending the night with mrs smith opposite charlotte had preferred to leave her there rather than disturb her at this hour pitt closed the door and shut out the world the cantlays dead cabbies the fog everything but a lingering of music from the gaiety and color of the opera when he had first married charlotte she had given up the comfort and status of her fathers house without a word this was only the second time he had been able to take her to the theatre in the city and it was an occasion to be celebrated all evening he had looked at the stage and then at her face and the joy he saw there was worth every careful economy every penny saved for it he leaned back against the door smiling and pulled her towards him gently the fog turned to rain and then sleet two days later pitt was sitting at his desk in the police station when a sergeant came in his face puckered with unhappiness pitt looked up what is it gilthorpe you remember that dead cabby you found night before last sir what about him it was something pitt would have preferred to forget a simple tragedy but a common enough one except for the amount of time he had been dead well gilthorpe shifted from one foot to the other well it looks like e wasnt no cabby we found an open grave pitt froze somewhere pressed to the back of his mind had been a fear of something like this when he had seen the puffy face and the touch of wet earth something ugly and obscene but he had ignored it whose he said quietly gilthorpes face tightened a lord augustus fitzroyhammond sir pitt shut his eyes as if not seeing gilthorpe might take it away e died just short o three weeks ago sir gilthorpes voice went on inexorably buried a fortnight very big funeral they say where pitt asked mechanically carrying on while his brain still sought to escape st margarets sir we put a guard on it naturally whatever for pitt opened his eyes what harm is anyone going to do an empty grave sightseers sir gilthorpe said without a flicker someone might fall in very ard to get out of a grave it is sides is steep and wet this time o year and o course the coffin is still there he stood a little more upright indicating that he had finished and was waiting for orders from pitt pitt looked up at him i suppose i had better go and see the widow and have her identify our corpse from the cab he climbed to his feet with a sigh tell the mortuary to make it look as decent as possible will you its going to be pretty wretched whether its him or not where does she live gadstone park sir number twelve all very big ouses there very rich i shouldnt wonder they would be pitt agreed drily curious the couple who had found the corpse had lived there also coincidence right gilthorpe go and tell the mortuary to have his lordship ready for viewing he picked up his hat and put it hard on his head tied his muffler round his neck and went outside into the rain gadstone park was as gilthorpe had said a very wealthy area with large houses set back from the street and a welltended park in the center with laurel and rhododendron bushes and a very fine magnoliaat least that was what he guessed it to be in its winter skeleton the rain had turned back to sleet again and the day was dark with coming snow he shivered as the water seeped down his neck and trickled cold over his skin no matter how many scarves he put on it always seemed to do that number twelve was a classic georgian house with a curved carriageway sweeping in under a pillared entrance its proportions satisfied his eye even though he would never again since his childhood as a gamekeepers son live in such a place it pleased him to see it these houses graced the city and provided the stuff of dreams for everyone he jammed his hat on harder as a gust of wind rattled a monumental laurel by the door and showered him with water he rang the bell and waited a footman appeared dressed in black a thought flickered through pitts mind that he had missed his vocation in lifenature had intended him for an undertaker yessir there was the barest hesitation as the man recognized one of the lower classes and immediately categorized him as someone who should have known well enough to go to the back door pitt was long familiar with the look and was prepared for it he had no time to waste with layers of relayed messages and it was less cruel to tell the news once and plainly than ooze it little by little through the hierarchy of the servants hall i am inspector pitt of the police there has been an outrage with regard to the grave of the late lord augustus fitzroyhammond he said soberly i would like to speak to lady fitzroyhammond so that the matter can be closed as soon and as discreetly as possible the footman was startled out of his funereal composure youyou had better come in he stood back and pitt followed him too oppressed by the interview ahead to be glad yet of the warmth the footman led him to the morning room and left him there possibly to report the shattering news to the butler and pass him the burden of the next decision pitt had not long to wait lady fitzroyhammond came in whitefaced and stopped when she was barely through the door pitt had been expecting someone considerably older the corpse from the cab had seemed at least sixty perhaps more but this woman could not possibly be past her twenties even the black of mourning could not hide the color or texture of her skin or the suppleness of her movement you say there has been anoutrage mr she said quietly inspector pitt maam yes im very sorry someone has opened the grave there was no pleasant way of saying it no gentility to cover the ugliness but we have found a body and we would like you to tell us if it is that of your late husband for a moment he thought she was going to faint it was stupid of him he should have waited until she was seated perhaps even have sent for a maid to be with her he stepped forward thinking to catch her if she crumpled she looked at him with alarm not understanding he stopped aware of her physical fear can i call your maid for you he said quietly putting his hands by his sides again no she shook her head then controlling herself with an effort she walked past him slowly to the sofa thank you i shall be perfectly all right she took a deep breath is it really necessary that i should unless there is someone else of immediate family he replied wishing he could have said otherwise is there perhaps a brother or he nearly said son then realized how tactless it would be he did not know if she was a second wife in fact he had neglected to ask gilthorpe the age of his lordship presumably gilthorpe would not have brought the matter to him at all if he could not have been the man on the cab no she shook her head there is only veritylord augustuss daughter and of course his mother but she is elderly and something of an invalid i must come may i bring my maid with me yes of course in fact it might be best if you did she stood up and pulled the bell cord when the maid came she sent the message for her personal maid to bring her cloak and make herself ready for the street the carriage was ordered she turned back to pitt wherewhere did you find him there was no point in telling her the details whether she had loved him or it had been a marriage of arrangement it was not necessary for her to know about the scene outside the theatre in a hansom cab maam her face wrinkled up in a hansom cab butwhy i dont know he opened the door for her as he heard voices in the hallway led her out and handed her into the carriage she did not ask again and they rode in silence to the mortuary the maid twisting her gloves in her hands her eyes studiously avoiding even an accidental glimpse of pitt the carriage stopped and the footman helped lady fitzroyhammond to alight the maid and pitt came unassisted the mortuary building was up a short path overhung by bare trees that dripped water startling and icily cold in incessant random splatters as the wind caught them pitt pulled the bell and a young man with a pink face opened the door immediately inspector pitt with lady fitzroyhammond pitt stood back for her to go in ah good day good day the young man ushered them in cheerfully and led them down the hallway into a room full of slabs all discreetly covered with sheets youll be after number fourteen he glowed with cleanliness and professional pride there was a basketsided chair close to the slab presumably in case the viewing relatives should be overcome and a pitcher of water and three glasses stood on a table at the end of the room the maid took out her handkerchief in preparation pitt stood ready to offer physical support should it be necessary right the young man pushed his spectacles more firmly on his nose and pulled back the sheet to expose the face the cabbys clothes were gone and they had combed the sparse hair neatly but it was still a repellent sight the skin was blotched and in places beginning to come away and the smell was cloying sick lady fitzroyhammond barely looked at it before covering her face with her hands and stepping back knocking the chair pitt righted it in a single movement and the maid guided her into it no one spoke the young man pulled the sheet up again and trotted down the room to fetch a glass of water he did it as imperturbably as if it were his daily habitas indeed it probably was he returned and gave it to the maid who held it for her mistress she took a gulp then clutched onto it her fingers white at the knuckles yes she said under her breath that is my husband thank you maam pitt replied soberly it was not the end of the case but it was very probably all he would ever know grave robbing was of course a crime but he did not hold any real hope that he would discover who had made this obscene gesture or why do you feel well enough to leave now he asked im sure you would be more comfortable at home yes thank you she stood up wavered for a moment then followed closely by the maid walked rather unsteadily towards the outer door that all the young man inquired his voice a little lowered but still healthily cheerful can i mark him as identified and release him for burial now yes you may lord augustus fitzroyhammond no doubt the family will tell you what arrangements they wish pitt answered nothing odd about the body i suppose nothing at all the young man responded ebulliently now that the women were beyond the door and out of earshot except that he died at least three weeks ago and has already been buried once but i suppose you knew that he shook his head and was obliged to resettle his glasses cant understand why anybody should do thatdig up a dead body i mean not as if theyd dissected him or anything like medical students used toor black magicists quite untouched no mark on him pitt did not know why he asked he had not expected any it was a pure case of desecration nothing more some lunatic with a bizarre twist to his mind none at all the young man agreed elderly gentleman well cared for well nourished a little corpulent but not unusual at his age soft hands very clean never seen a dead lord before so far as i know but thats exactly what i would have expected one to look like thank you pitt said slowly in that case there is little more for me to do pitt attended the reinterment as a matter of course it was just possible that whoever had committed the outrage might be there to see the result of his act on the family perhaps that was the motive some festering hatred still not worked through even with death it was naturally a quiet affair one does not make much of burying a person a second time however there was a considerable group of people who had come to pay their respects perhaps more out of sympathy for the widow than further regard for the dead they were all dressed in black and had black ribbons on their carriages they processed in silence to the grave and stood heads bowed in the rain only one man had the temerity to turn up his collar in concession to comfort everyone else ignored the movement in pretense that it had not happened what was the small displeasure of icy trickles down the neck when one was faced with the monumental solemnity of death the man with the collar was slender an inch or two above average height and his delicate mouth was edged with deep lines of humor it was a wry face with crooked brown eyebrows certainly there was nothing jovial in it the local policeman was standing beside pitt to remark any stranger for him who is that pitt whispered mr somerset carlisle sir the man answered lives in the park number two what does he do hes a gentleman sir pitt did not bother to pursue it even gentlemen occasionally had occupations beyond the social round but it was of no importance thats lady alicia fitzroyhammond the constable went on quite unnecessarily very sad only married to him a few years they say pitt grunted the man could take it to mean anything he chose alicia was pale but quite composed probably relieved to have the whole thing nearly over beside her also in utter black was a younger girl perhaps twenty her honeybrown hair pulled away from her face and her eyes suitably downcast the honorable miss verity fitzroyhammond the constable anticipated him very nice young lady pitt felt no reply was required his eye traveled to the man and woman beyond the girl he was well built probably had been athletic in youth and still stood with ease his brow was broad his nose long and straight only a certain flaw in the mouth prevented him from being completely pleasing even so he was a handsome man the woman beside him had fine dark eyes and black hair with a marvelous silver streak from the right temple who are they pitt asked lord and lady st jermyn the constable said rather more loudly than pitt would have wished in the stillness of the graveyard even the steady dripping of the rain was audible the burial was over and they turned one by one to leave pitt recognized sir desmond and lady cantlay from the street outside the theatre and hoped they had had the tact not to mention their part in the matter perhaps they would sir desmond had seemed a not inconsiderate person the last to leave accompanied by a rather solid man with a plain amiable face was a tall thin old lady of magnificent bearing and an almost imperial dignity even the gravediggers hesitated and touched their hats waiting until she had passed before beginning their work pitt saw her clearly for only a moment but it was enough he knew that long nose the heavylidded brilliant eyes at eighty she still had more left of her beauty than most women ever possess aunt vespasia he was caught in his surprise and spoke aloud beg pardon sir the constable started lady cumminggould isnt it pitt swung round to him that last lady leaving yes sir lives in number eighteen just moved ere in the autumn old mr staines died in the february of thatd be just short a year ago lady cumminggould bought it back end o the summer pitt remembered last summer extremely well that was when he had first met charlottes sister emilys greataunt vespasia during the paragon walk outrage more precisely she was the aunt of emilys husband lord george ashworth he had not expected to see her again but he recalled how much he had liked her asperity and alarming candor in fact had charlotte married above herself socially instead of beneath she might have grown in time to be just such a devastating old lady the constable was staring at him eyes skeptical you know er then do you sir another case pitt did not want to explain have you seen anyone here who doesnt live in the park or know the widow or the family no no one ere except what youd expect maybe grave robbers dont come back to the scene o the crime or maybe they come at night pitt was not in the mood for sarcasm especially from a constable on the beat perhaps i should post you here he said acidly in case the constables face fell then lightened again as suspicion hit him that pitt was merely exercising his own wit if you think it would be productive sir he said stiffly only of a cold in the head pitt replied im going to pay my respects to lady cumminggould you stay here and watch for the rest of the afternoon he added with satisfaction just in case someone comes to have a look the constable snorted then turned it into a rather inefficient sneeze pitt walked away and lengthening his stride caught up with aunt vespasia she ignored him one does not speak to the help at funerals lady cumminggould he said distinctly she stopped and turned slowly preparing to freeze him with a glance then something about his height the way his coat hung flapping at his sides struck a note of familiarity she fished for her lorgnette and held it up to her eyes good gracious thomas what on earth are you doing here oh of course i suppose you are looking for whoever dug up poor gussie i cant imagine why anyone should do such a thing quite disgusting makes a lot of work for everyone and all so unnecessary she looked him up and down you dont appear to be any different except that you have more clothes on cant you get anything to match wherever did you purchase that muffler its appalling emily had a son you know yes of course you know going to call him edward after her father better than calling him george always irritating to call a boy after his father no one ever knows which one you are talking about how is charlotte tell her to call upon me im bored to tears with the people in the park except the american with a face like a mud pie homeliest man i ever saw but quite charming he hasnt the faintest idea how to behave but rich as croesus her eyes danced with amusement they cannot make up their minds what to do about him whether to be civil because of his money or cut him dead because of his manners i do hope he stays pitt found himself smiling in spite of the rain down his neck and the wet trouser cuffs sticking to his ankles i shall give charlotte your message he said bowing slightly she will be delighted that i have seen you and you are well indeed vespasia snorted tell her to come early before two then she wont run into the social callers with nothing to do but outdress each other she put her lorgnette away and swept down the path ignoring the skirts of her gown catching in the mud on sunday alicia fitzroyhammond rose as usual a little after nine and ate a light breakfast of toast and apricot preserve verity had already eaten and was now writing letters in the morning room the dowager lady fitzroyhammond augustuss mother would have her meal taken up to her as always on some days she got up far more often she did not then she lay in her bed with an embroidered indian shawl around her shoulders and reread all her old letters sixtyfive years of them going back to her nineteenth birthday july exactly five years after the battle of waterloo her brother had been an ensign in wellingtons army her second son had died in the crimea and there were old love letters from men long since gone every so often she would send her maid nisbett down to see what was going on in the house she required a list of all callers when they came and how long they stayed if they left cards and most particularly how they were dressed alicia had learned to live with that the thing she still found intolerable was nisbetts constant inquiry into the running of the house passing her finger over the surfaces to see if they were dusted every day opening the linen cupboard when she thought no one was looking to count the sheets and tablecloths and see if all the corners were ironed and mended this sunday was one of the old ladys days to get up she enjoyed going to church she sat in the family pew and watched everyone arrive and depart she pretended to be deaf although actually her hearing was excellent it suited her not to speak except when she wanted something and occasional failure to know what was said could be not inconvenient she was dressed in black also and she leaned heavily on her stick she came into the dining room and banged sharply on the floor to attract alicias attention good morning mamainlaw alicia said with an effort im glad you are well enough to be up the old lady walked towards the table and the everpresent nisbett pulled out her chair for her she stared at the sideboard with displeasure is that all there is for breakfast she demanded what would you like alicia had been trained all her life to be polite its too late now the old lady said stiffly i shall have to put up with what there is nisbett fetch me some eggs and some of that ham and kidneys and pass me the toast i assume you are going to church this morning alicia yes mama do you care to come i never shirk church unless i am too ill to stand upon my feet alicia did not bother to comment she had never known precisely what ailed the old lady or if indeed there was anything at all the doctor came to call regularly and told her she had a weak heart for which he prescribed digitalis but alicia privately thought it was little more than old age and a desire to command both attention and obedience augustus had always catered to her possibly out of lifelong habit and because he hated unpleasantness i presume you are also coming the old lady asked with raised eyebrows then put an enormous forkful of eggs into her mouth yes mama the old lady nodded her mouth too full to speak the carriage was called at halfpast ten and alicia verity and the old lady were helped into it one by one and then out again at st margarets church where for over a hundred years the family had had its own pew no one who was not a fitzroyhammond had ever been known to sit in it they were early the old lady liked to sit at the back and watch everyone else arrive then go forward to the pew at one minute before eleven today was no exception she had survived the deaths of every member of her own blood except verity with the supreme composure required of an aristocrat the reburial of augustus would not be different at two minutes before eleven she stood up and led the way forward to the family pew at the end she stopped short the unthinkable had happened there was someone else already there a man with collar turned up leaning forward in an attitude of prayer who are you the old lady hissed remove yourself sir this is a family pew the man did not stir the old lady banged her stick sharply on the ground to attract his attention do something alicia speak to him alicia squeezed past her and touched the man gently on the shoulder excuse me she got no further the man swayed and fell sideways onto the seat face up alicia screamedat the very back of her mind she knew what the old lady would say and the congregationbut it tore out of her throat beyond her helping it was augustus again his dead face livid and bloodless gaping up at her from the wooden seat the gray stone pillars wavered round her and she heard her own voice go on shrieking like a quite disembodied sound she wished it would stop but she seemed to have no control over it blackness descended her arms were pinned to her sides and something had struck her in the back the next thing she knew she was lying propped up in the vestry the vicar pastyfaced and sweating was crouching next to her holding her hand the door was open and the wind rushed in in an icy river the old lady was opposite her black skirts spread round her like a grounded balloon her face scarlet there there the vicar said helplessly youve had a most appalling shock my dear lady quite appalling i dont know what the world is coming to when the insane are allowed loose amongst us like this i shall write to the newspapers and to my member of parliament something really must be done it is insupportable he coughed and patted her hand again and of course we shall all pray the position became too uncomfortable for him he was beginning to get a cramp in his legs he stood up i have sent for the doctor for your poor mama dr mcduff isnt it he will be here any moment a pity he was not in the congregation there was a note of affront in his voice he knew that the doctor was a scot and a presbyterian and he disapproved vehemently a physician to such an area as this had no business to be a nonconformist alicia struggled to sit up her first thoughts were not for the old lady but for verity she had not seen death before and augustus had been her father even though they had not been close verity she said with a dry mouth what about verity dont distress yourself his voice became agitated at the thought of imminent hysteria he had no idea how to cope with such a thing especially in the vestry of the church the morning service was already a complete disaster the congregation had either gone home or was standing outside in the rain impelled by curiosity to watch the last gruesome act of the affair the police had been sent for right here to the church and the whole business was become a scandal beyond retrieval he dearly wanted to go home and have luncheon where there would be a fire and a sensible housekeeper who knew better than to have emotions my dear lady he started again please be assured miss verity has been taken care of with the utmost sensibility lady cumminggould took her home in her carriage she was most distressed of course who would not beit is all quite dreadful but we must bear these burdens with the grace of god to help us oh his face lit up with something akin to delight as he saw the thick figure of dr mcduff come in and slam the vestry door professional responsibility could be shed at lastperhaps even shifted entirely after all the doctor must care for the living and he himself was dutybound to see to the dead because no one else was properly qualified mcduff went straight to the old lady ignoring the other two he took her wrist and felt it for several seconds then peered at her face shock he said succinctly severe shock i advise you to go home and take as much rest as you feel you need have all your meals brought up and dont receive any visitors except the immediate family and not them if you dont choose do nothing strenuous and do not allow yourself to become upset about anything at all the old ladys face eased with satisfaction the fierce color ebbed a little good she said climbing to her feet with his help knew you would know what to do cant take any more of thisi dont know what the world is coming tonever had anything like this when i was young people knew their places then and kept them too busy working to go around desecrating graves of their betters too much education of the wrong people nowadays thats whats responsible you know now theyve got curiosities and appetites that are no good for them it isnt natural see whats happened here even the church isnt safe anymore its worse than if the french had invaded after all with that parting shot she stumped out banging her stick furiously against the door poor dear lady the vicar muttered what a quite dreadful shock for herand at her age too one would think she had earned a little respite from the sins of the world alicia was still sitting on the vestry bench in the cold she suddenly realized how much she disliked the old lady she could never recall a moment since the time she had become betrothed to augustus when she had felt at ease with her until now she had hidden it from herself for augustuss sake but there was no need any longer augustus was dead with a lurch she remembered his body in the pew and on the slab in that bitter mortuary with the little man in the white coat who was so terrifyingly happy all the time in his room full of corpses thank goodness the policeman at least had been a little more sober in fact quite pleasant in his way as if she had conjured him out of her thoughts the door swung open and pitt appeared in front of her shaking himself like a great wet dog and spraying water from his coattails and off his sleeves she had not thought of the police coming and now all sorts of ugly fears crowded into her mind why why had augustus risen out of his grave again like some persistent obscene reminder of the past preventing her from stepping out of it into the future the future could hold so much promise she had met new people especially one new person slim elegant with all the laughter and charm augustus had lost perhaps he had been like that in his youth but she had not known him then she wanted to dance to make jokes of trivial things to sing something round the spinet other than hymns and solemn ballads she wanted to be in love and say giddy and uproarious things have a past worth remembering like the old lady who sat rereading her youth from a hundred letters no doubt there was sadness in them but there was passion too if there was any truth in her retelling the policeman was staring at her with bright gray eyes he was the untidiest creature she had ever seen not fit to be in a church im sorry he said quietly i thought wed seen the end of it she could think of no answer do you know of anyone who might be doing this maam he went on she looked up at his face and a whole abyss of new horror opened up in front of her she had presumed it was an anonymous crime the work of insane vandals of some sort she had heard of grave robbing body snatchers but now she realized that this extraordinary man thought that it might be personal deliberately directed at augustusor even at her no she gulped and the breath caught in her throat she swallowed hard no of course not but she could feel the heat burning up her face what would other people think twice augustus had been uncovered out of his grave almost as if someone were unwilling to let him restor more pointedly unwilling to let her forget him who would do such a thing the only one she knew was the old lady she would certainly be annoyed if she thought alicia could marry again and so soon this time for love i have no idea she said as calmly as she could if augustus had any enemies he never spoke of them and i find it hard to imagine that anyone he was acquainted with whatever their feelings would do such a thing as this yes pitt nodded it is beyond ordinary vengeance even to us its wretchedly cold in here youd better go home and warm yourself take some food theres nothing you can do now well take care of it see hes handled decently i think your vicars already ordered the proper observations he walked toward the door then turned i suppose you are quite sure it was your husband maam you did see his face quite clearlyit wasnt someone else perhaps alicia shook her head she could see the corpse with its graywhite skin in front of her sharply more real than the cold walls of the vestry it was augustus mr pitt there is no doubt of that at all thank you maam im extremely sorry he went out and closed the door behind him outside pitt stopped for a moment to glance at the remnants of the congregation all affecting attitudes of sympathy or else pretending to be there by chance and about to move then he strode down the path and out into the street the business had shaken him far more than the relative seriousness of the crime warranted far worse things were going on dailybeatings extortions and murdersand yet there was a relentless obscenity about this that disturbed some previously silent portion of his mind an assumption that death at least was untouchable why on earth should anyone keep on digging up the body of some elderly aristocrat whose death had been perfectly natural or was this a bizarre but unignorable way of saying that it had not was it conceivable that lord augustus had been murdered and someone knew it after a second disinterment it was a question he could not overlook they could not simply replace him againand wait there was nothing he could do today it would be indiscreet he needed to observe decorum or he would get no cooperation at all from those closest to him and most likely to know or suspect not that he expected much help no one wanted murder no one wanted police in the house investigations and questions added to which sunday was his own day off he wanted to be at home he was making an engine for jemima that pulled along on a string it was proving harder than he had expected to make wheels round but she was delighted with it anyway and talked to it incessantly in a mixture of sounds quite unintelligible to anyone else but obviously of great significance to her it gave him immeasurable happiness late on monday morning he set out through a fine thick mist to ride to gadstone park and begin the questions it was not as dismal as might be supposed because he intended to call first upon greataunt vespasia the memory of her in paragon walk brought a glow of pleasure to his mind and he found himself smiling alone in the hansom cab he had chosen his time with care late enough for her to have finished breakfast but too early for her to have left the house for any morning business she might have surprisingly the footman informed him that she already had company but he would acquaint her ladyship with pitts arrival if he desired pitt felt a surge of disappointment and replied a little tartly that yes he did desire and then allowed himself to be taken into the morning room to wait the footman came back for him unexpectedly soon and ushered him into the withdrawing room vespasia was sitting in the great chair her hair piled meticulously on her head and a chinhigh blouse of guipure lace giving her a totally deceptive air of fragility she was about as delicate as a steel sword as pitt knew the others in the room were sir desmond cantlay lady st jermyn and somerset carlisle closer to pitt observed their faces with interest hester st jermyn was a striking woman the silver streak in her hair appeared quite natural and was startling against its black somerset carlisle was not so thin or so angular as he had seemed in black by the graveside yet there was still the same suggestion of humor about him the slightly aquiline nose and the sharp brows good morning thomas vespasia said drily i was expecting you to call but not quite so soon i admit i imagine you have already made yourself acquainted with the rest of the company if not they with you she glanced round them i have met inspector pitt before her voice crackled with a world of unexplained meaning hester st jermyn and sir desmond both looked at him with amazement but carlisle kept his face impassive except for a small smile he caught pitts eye vespasia apparently did not intend to explain we are discussing politics she offered to pitt an extraordinary thing to do in the morning is it not are you familiar with workhouses pitts mind flew to the dour airless halls he had seen crammed with men women and children picking apart and resewing new shirts from old for the price of their keep their eyes ached and their limbs stiffened in the summer they fainted from heat and in the winter bronchitis racked them but it was the only shelter for those with families or women alone who were too old too ugly or too honest to go on the streets he looked at vespasias lace and hesters minuscule pin tucks yes he said harshly i am vespasias eyes gleamed in instant recognition of his thoughts and you do not approve she said slowly abominable places especially where the children are concerned yes pitt agreed nevertheless necessary and all the poor law allows she continued yes the word came hard politics have their uses she barely moved her head to indicate the others that is how things are changed he reversed his opinion of her mentally apologizing you are moving to change them it is worth trying but no doubt you have come about that disgusting business yesterday in the church a piece of the most appalling distaste if you please i would appreciate speaking with you if you will certain investigations might be accomplished morediscreetly she snorted she knew perfectly well he meant that they might be accomplished with a good deal less trouble and probably more accurately but the presence of the others prevented her from saying so he saw it in her face and smiled she understood precisely and her eyes lit up but she refused to smile back carlisle stood up slowly he was more solid and probably stronger than he had appeared at the internment perhaps there is little more that we can do at the moment he said to vespasia i will have our notes written up and we can consider them again i fancy we have not yet all the information we must supply st jermyn with everything there is otherwise he will not be able to argue our case against those who have a few contradictions to it however ill conceived hester rose also and desmond followed her yes he agreed im sure you are correct good morning lady cumminggould he regarded pitt indecisively not able to address a policeman as a social equal and yet confounded because he was apparently a fellow guest in the withdrawing room of his hostess carlisle rescued him good morning inspector i wish you a rapid success in your business good morning sir pitt bowed his head very slightly good morning maam when they had gone and the door was closed vespasia looked up at him for goodness sake sit down she ordered you make me uncomfortable standing there like a footman pitt obeyed finding the overstuffed sofa more accommodating than it appeared it was soft and spacious enough for him to spread himself what do you know about lord augustus fitzroyhammond he asked suddenly the lightness had evaporated and there was only death leftand perhaps murder augustus she looked at him long and steadily do you mean do i know anyone who might hire lunatics to disinter the wretched man no i do not he was not a person i cared for no imagination and therefore of course no sense of humor but that is hardly a cause to dig him uprather the opposite i would have thought so would i pitt agreed very softly in fact every reason to wish him in his grave vespasias face changed it was the only time he could recall her losing that magnificent composure good god she breathed out a long sigh you dont think he was murdered i have to consider it he answered at least as a possibility he was dug up twice now that is more than coincidence it may be insanity but it is not random insanity whoever it is means lord augustus to remain unburiedfor whatever reason but he was so very ordinary she said with exasperation and a touch of pity he was wealthy but not exceptionally so the title is not worth anything and anyway there is no one to inherit it he was pleasing enough to look at but not handsome and far too pompous to have a romantic affaire i really can think of she stood with a tired little gesture of her hands he waited there was sufficient understanding between them that it would have been faintly insulting for him to have reasoned with her she was as capable as he of seeing the nuances the shadings of suspicion and fear i suppose it is better that i tell you than you learn it from backstairs gossip she said irritably angry not with him but with the circumstances he understood and probably more accurate he agreed alicia she said simply it was an arranged marriage as what else could it be between a sheltered girl of twenty and a comfortable unimaginative man in his midfifties she has a lover he stated the obvious an admirer she corrected him to begin with no more than a social acquaintance i wonder if you have any idea how small london society really is in time one is bound to meet practically everybody unless one is a hermit but now it is more than an acquaintance naturally she is young and has been denied the dreams of youth she sees them parading in the ballrooms of londonwhat else do you expect her to do will she marry him she raised silver eyebrows very slightly her eyes bright there was a dry recognition of social difference in them but whether there was amusement at it or not he was not sure thomas one does not remarry or even allow oneself to be seen considering it within a year of ones husbands death whatever one may feel or indeed do in the privacy of the bedroom provided of course that the bedroom is in someone elses house at a weekend or some such thing but to answer your question i should imagine it is quite likely after the prescribed interval what is he like dark and extremely handsome not an aristocrat but sufficient of a gentleman he has manners enough and most certainly charm money how practical of you not a great deal i think but he does not appear to be in need of it at least not urgently lady alicia inherits with the daughter verity the old lady has her own money you know a great deal about their affairs pitt disarmed it with a smile she smiled back at him naturally what else is there to occupy oneself with in the winter i am too old to have any affaires of interest myself his smile widened to a grin but he made no comment flattery was far too obvious for her what is his name and where does he live i have no idea where he lives but im sure you could find out easily enough his name is dominic corde pitt froze there could not be two dominic cordes not both handsome both charming both young and dark he remembered him so clearly his easy smile his grace his obliviousness of his young sisterinlaw charlotte so painfully in love with him it had been four years ago before she met pitt at the start of the cater street murders but do the echoes of first love ever die away doesnt something linger perhaps more imagination than fact the dreams that never came true but painful thomas vespasias voice invaded his privacy drawing him back to the present gadstone park and the disinterment of augustus fitzroyhammond so dominic was in love with lady alicia or at least sought after her he had seen her only twice yet had gathered an opinion that she was utterly unlike charlotte far more a memory of dominics first wife charlottes sister sarah who had been murdered in the fog pretty rather pious sarah with the same fair hair as alicia the same smooth face he could think only of charlotte and dominic thomas vespasias face swam up at him as he lifted his head she was leaning forward touched with concern now are you quite well yes he said slowly you said dominic corde you know him it was a statement rather than a question she had lived a long time known many loves and hurts little escaped her understanding he knew she would recognize a lie yes he was married to charlottes sister before she died good gracious if she read anything more into it than that she was far too tactful to say so so he is a widower i dont recall his mentioning it pitt did not want to talk about dominic he knew it would have to come but he was not ready yet tell me about the rest of gadstone park he asked she looked a little surprised he pulled a small ironic face i cant imagine alicia dug him up he said meeting her eyes or dominic her body relaxed altering the line of the high lace neck no she sighed wearily of course not they would be the last ones to wish him back it would appear unless the whole thing is fortuitous after all that either one of them murdered augustus or someone believes they did tell me about the other people in the park he repeated the old lady is a fearful creature vespasia seldom minced words sits upstairs in her bedroom all day devouring old love letters and letters of blood and military vainglory from waterloo and the crimea in her own eyes she is the last of a great generation she savors over and over again every victory in her life real or imagined up to the last minute so she can wring life dry before it is snatched away from her she doesnt like alicia thinks she has no courage no style a sudden dry twist lit up her face i really dont know whether she would like her better or worse if she thought her capable of having murdered augustus pitt hid a smile by turning it into a grimace what about the daughter verity nice girl dont know where she gets it from must be her mothers side not especially goodlooking but quite a bit of life to her underneath the welldrilled manners hope they dont marry her off before she has a little fun how does she get on with alicia well enough so far as i know but you neednt look at her she would have no idea where to employ a grave robber and she could hardly do it herself but she might prompt someone else pitt pointed out someone in love with herif she thought her stepmother had murdered her father vespasia snorted dont believe it far too devious shes a nice child if she thought such a thing she would have come out and accused her not gone around persuading someone to desecrate her fathers grave and she seems genuinely fond of alicia unless shes a far better actress than i take her for pitt had to agree the whole thing was preposterous perhaps after all it was the work of a lunatic and the fact that it was the same body both times only a grotesque mischance he said as much to vespasia i tend to disbelieve in coincidences she replied reluctantly but i suppose they do occur the rest of the park are ordinary enough in their way lord st jermyn i cannot fault neither can i like him in spite of the fact that it is he who will sponsor our bill through parliament hester is a good woman making the best of an indifferent situation they have four children whose names i cannot remember major rodney is a widower he was not at the interment so you have not seen him yet he fought in the crimea i believe no one can recall his wife who must have died thirtyfive years ago he lives with his maiden sisters miss priscilla and miss mary ann they talk too much and are always making jam and lavender pillows but are otherwise perfectly pleasant there is nothing to say about the cantlays i believe they are precisely what they seem to be civil generous and a little bored carlisle is a dilettante plays the piano rather well tried to get into parliament and failed a bit too radical wants to reform good family old money the only one of any interest is that appalling american who bought number seven virgil smith i ask you she raised her eyebrows as high as they would go who on earth but an american would call a child virgil and with a name like smith hes as plain as a ditch and with manners to suit he has not the least idea how to conduct himself which fork to eat with or how to address a duchess he talks to cats and dogs in the streets pitt had spoken to cats and dogs himself and he found he was warming to the man immediately did he know lord augustus he asked of course not do you imagine lord augustus kept the company of people like that he had not the imagination her face softened fortunately i am old enough for it not to matter anymore what company i am seen to keep and i rather like him at least he is not a bore she looked at pitt rather pointedly and he knew that he himself was included in the same bracket of socially impossible people who redeem themselves by not being bores he could learn no more from her at present so after thanking her for her frankness he took his leave this evening he would have to tell charlotte that dominic corde was involved and he wanted to prepare himself charlotte had not taken more than a cursory interest in the case of grave robbing it did not concern anyone she knew not like the murders at paragon walk the previous year she had plenty to keep her busy in the house and jemima was consumed with curiosity every minute she was awake charlotte spent half her day in household duties and the other half deciphering jemimas questions and supplying answers to them time after time she could with a flash of instinct understand what jemima meant and repeat the words over clearly to be imitated with solemn diligence by six oclock when pitt came home cold and wet she was tired herself and as glad as he to sit down it was in the comfortable silence after dinner that he told her he had debated how to phrase it whether to lead up to it or simply be bold in the end his own urgency overtook him i went to see aunt vespasia today he looked at her then away again into the fire about the grave robbing she knows everyone in gadstone park charlotte waited for him to continue usually he was good at being evasive coming to things in his own way but this was too powerful it forced itself to be said dominic is involved dominic she was incredulous it was too unbelievable too unexpected to have sense what do you mean dominic corde is involved with the fitzroyhammonds lord augustus died a few weeks ago and his corpse has been unburied twice and left to be found once on the box of a hansom cab and once in his own pew in church alicia his wife now his widow had an admirer and has had for some timedominic corde she sat quite still repeating his words over inside her head trying to grasp them she had not even thought of dominic for months now all her adolescent dreams flooded back embarrassing in their gaucheness and their fervor she felt the color burn up her face and wished pitt had never known anything about it that she had been less transparent in her infatuation when he had first met her in cater street then she began to realize the enormity of it he had said dominic was involved did he really imagine dominic had had something to do with disinterring the body she could not imagine itnot because of the cruelty or the desecration of it but because she did not believe dominic had the heat of emotion or the courage in him to do such a wild thing how involved she asked i dont know his voice was unusually sharp i should imagine he means to marry her for once he had misunderstood her i mean how is he involved with digging up the body she corrected surely you dont think he could have done it why should he he hesitated searching her eyes trying to gauge what she was thinking how much it mattered to her he had seen the color in her face at the mention of dominics name and it brought a coldness to him an uncertainty he had not known for years not since his father had lost his job and the family had left the great estate where he had been born and grown up i dont imagine he did he answered but i have to consider the possibility that lord augustus did not die as naturally as was supposed at the time the blood drained out of her face you mean murder her tongue was dry you think dominic might have murdered him oh noi dont believe it i know himhe is not she could not think of a way to say it without cruelty and less than justice not what he asked the edge back in his voice not capable of murder no she said simply i dont think so not unless he was very frightened or perhaps in a fit of temper by accident but if he did he would give himself away afterwards he would never be able to live with it he has such a delicate conscience pitt said sarcastically she was hurt by the hardness in him she had no idea why it should be had he remembered her youthful foolishness and been angered by it found her silliness annoying even after all this time surely he could not be so unforgiving of what had after all been no more than a girls romanticism she had tortured no one but herself with it she remembered all that had happened at cater street very clearly even sarah had been unaware of her feelings and dominic certainly had we all have sides of ourselves we prefer not to acknowledge she said quietly sides we reason away with all sorts of arguments why it is wrong for others but in our case quite justified dominic is as good at it as most perhaps in some things better but his were only the faults he was brought up to he learned his values from other people just as we all do he could excuse himself easily enough for an affaire with a maid because that is something most gentlemen accept but nobody accepts murdering someone in order to marry his widow there is no way dominic could excuse that to himself or to anyone else after he had done it he would be terrified that is what i meant oh he sat quite still for several minutes there was no noise but the crackle of the fire how was aunt vespasia she asked at length the same as always he replied politely then he wanted to say more to establish contact again without exactly apologizing because that would be to admit to the thoughts he had had she asked that you should call upon her sometime she said that when i saw her at the interment and i forgot to mention it will they inter him again she asked it seems a bitridiculous i suppose so but i shant let them do it immediately the body is in police custody now i want a postmortem a postmortem you mean cut him up if you must put it that way slowly he smiled and she smiled back suddenly the warmth flooded into him again and he sat grinning idiotically like a boy the family wont be pleased she pointed out theyll be furious he agreed but i mean toi have no choice now it was inevitable the next day that pitt should call on alicia no matter how distasteful it was he must question her obliquely about lord augustus about her relationship with him and with dominic corde then of course he would have to meet dominic again they had not met since pitts wedding to charlotte nearly four years ago then dominic had been newly a widower still numb from his fear in the cater street murders and pitt had been too amazed at his own success in winning charlotte to be more than dimly aware of anyone else now it would be different dominic would be over the shock and would have found a new life for himself away from the ellisons and memories of sarah he was bound to marry again he could not be more than thirtytwo or three and eminently eligible even if he did not have it in mind himself pitt knew enough of society to know that some ambitious mother would grasp him for her unmarried daughter it would merely be a competition as to who would succeed first he did not dislike dominic for himself only for his relationship with charlotte and the dreams she had woven about him and he felt guilty that he had to be the one to drag him again into the shadow of murder if indeed he could not clear up the affair before murder need be put into words it was a gray sullen morning with a sky threatening snow when pitt pulled the bell of number twelve gadstone park and the funereal butler let him in with a sigh of resignation lady fitzroyhammond is at breakfast he said wearily if you care to wait in the morning room i will inform her that you are here thank you pitt followed him obediently passing a small elderly maid in a neat whitelaceedged uniform her thin face sharpened as she saw him and her eyes glittered she turned around and retraced her steps upstairs whisking across the landing and disappearing as he went into the silent icechill morning room alicia came in about five minutes later looking pale and a little hurried as if she had left the breakfast table without finishing her meal good morning maam he remained standing the room was too cold to conduct any discussion especially the relaxed rather rambling exploration he needed now she shivered what more can there possibly be to speak of the vicar has assured me he will take care of all thearrangements she hesitated ii am not sure how it should be doneafter allthere has already been a funeraland she frowned and shook her head a little i dont know anything more to tell you perhaps we could talk somewhere more convenient he suggested he did not wish to say precisely somewhere warmer she was confused discuss what i dont know anything else he spoke as gently as he could desecration of a grave is a crime maam to disinter the same body twice seems unlikely to be merely an insane coincidence the blood drained out of her face she stared at him speechless could we go to some room where we may speak comfortably this time he made it rather more of guidance as one would instruct a child still without answering she turned and led him to a smaller very feminine withdrawing room at the side of the house a fire was already burning strongly and there was a radiance of warmth from it as soon as they were inside she swung round her composure was regained what is it you are supposing inspector more than a madman something intentional im afraid so he replied soberly madness is not usually sodirected directed at what she closed the door and walked over to sit down on the settee he sat opposite her feeling the warmth ease out the muscles knotted with cold that is what i must find out he replied if i am to make sure it does not happen again you said before that you knew of no enemy who would have wished your husband such harm or could conceivably have behaved in such a manner i dont then i am left to consider what other motives there could be he said reasonably she was more intelligent than he had expected calmer he began to understand how dominic might be very genuinely attracted to her neither money nor position need be involved he thought of what vespasia had said about laughter and the dreams of youth and he was angry at the restrictions the insensitivities of a social convention that could have married her to a man like augustus fitzroyhammond and bred into her compliance with such a thing or who else might be the intended victim he finished victim she repeated turning it over in her mind yes i suppose you are right in a sense we are all victims of thisthe whole family he was not prepared yet to ask her about dominic tell me something about his mother he said instead she was in the church wasnt she does she live here yes but i dont know what i can tell you could she be the one intended to be hurt do you think there was a small flicker over her face like recognition even perhaps a momentary harsh selfmocking humor or perhaps that was something he imagined because it was in his own feelings are you asking me if she has enemies she was looking at him very directly has she it was now no longer a secret between them he understood and she had seen it of course no one can live to her age without earning enemies she agreed but by the same token most of them are dead all the rivals from her youth or the days of her social power they are gone or too old to care i imagine most scores have been settled long ago there was too much truth in that to argue and the daughter miss verity he went on oh no she shook her head immediately she has only been out for a season there is no spite in her and she has done no one harm even inadvertently he was not quite sure how to say the inevitable usually it was hard to frame the words that led to accusation especially when the person could not see them coming but he had grown accustomed to it over the years as one lives with early rheumatism knowing there will be pain now and again moving to accommodate it anticipating when the prick would come growing used to it but this time it was harder than usual at the last moment he became oblique again could there not be envy he asked she is a charming girl alicia smiled and there was patience in it for his ignorance the only people to envy young ladies of society are other young ladies of society do you really imagine inspector that one of them hired men to disinter her dead father he felt foolish no of course not this time he abandoned tact he was being clumsier with it than without then if it is not the dowager lady fitzroyhammond and it is not miss verity could it be you she swallowed and waited a second before replying her fingers were stiff on the carved wooden arm of the settee grasping onto the fringe i had not thought anyone hated me so much she said gently he plunged in he could not afford to let pity hold his tongue she would not be the first murderess to be the supreme actor there has been more than one crime committed from jealousy she sat perfectly still for a while he thought she was not going to answer do you mean murder inspector pitt she said at last it is horrible sick and nightmarish but it is not murder augustus died of heart failure he had been ill for over a week ask dr mcduff perhaps someone wishes us to think it was murder pitt kept his voice calm almost unemotional as if he were examining an academic problem not talking of lives suddenly she perceived what he was thinking you mean they aredigging augustus up to make the police take notice do you think someone could hate one of us so much is it not possible she turned a little to look into the fire yesi suppose it is it would be foolish to say it couldnt be but it is a very frightening thought i dont know whoor why im told you are acquainted with a mr dominic corde now it was said he watched the color rise up her cheeks he had expected to dislike her for it to disapprove after all she was newly widowed yet he did not he found himself sorry for her embarrassment even for the fact that she was probably in that uncertain stage of love when you can no longer deny your own feelings and are not yet sure of the others she still looked away from him yes i am she picked at the fringe of the settee her hands were very smooth used to embroidery and arranging flowers she was impelled to say more not simply to leave the subject why do you ask now he was more delicate do you think someone else might be jealous of your friendship i have met mr corde he is a most charming man and eligible for marriage the color deepened in her face and perhaps feeling its heat her embarrassment became more painful that may be mr pitt her eyes came up sharply he had not noticed before but they were golden hazel but i am newly a widow she stopped possibly she realized how pompous it sounded she began again i cannot imagine anyone being so deranged as to do such a thing because of a social envy even over mr corde he was still sitting opposite her only a few feet away can you think of any kind of sane reason for a person to do it maam there was silence again the fire crackled and fell in sparks he reached forward for the tongs and put on another piece of coal it was a luxury to burn fuel without thought of price he put on a second piece and a third the fire blazed up in yellow heat no she said gently you are quite right before he could say anything else the door swung open and a stout old lady in black came in banging ahead of herself with a stick she surveyed pitt with disdain as he automatically stood up alicia stood up also mama this is inspector pitt from the police she turned to pitt my motherinlaw lady fitzroyhammond the old lady did not move she did not intend to be introduced to a policeman as if he were a social acquaintance and certainly not in what she still considered her own house indeed she said sourly i had assumed so i imagine you have some duties to attend to alicia the house does not grind to a halt because someone has died you know you cannot expect the servants to supervise themselves go and see to the menus for the day and that the maids are properly employed there was dust on the window ledge in the upstairs landing yesterday i soiled my cuff on it she drew in her breath well dont stand there girl if the policeman wants to see you again he can call again alicia glanced at pitt and he shook his head fractionally she accepted his dismissal with the civility and the respect for the old that had been bred in her after she was gone the old lady waddled over to the settee and sat down still holding her stick what are you here for she demanded she had on a white lace cap and pitt noticed that underneath it her hair was not yet dressed he guessed she had heard his arrival reported by a maid and risen hurriedly in order not to miss him to see if i can discover who disinterred your son he replied baldly what in goodness do you imagine it was one of us her disgust at his stupidity was immense and she took care he should be aware of it hardly maam he answered levelly it is a mans job but i think it very likely it was directed at one of you since it has happened twice we cannot assume it coincidence she banged her stick on the floor you should investigate she said with satisfaction her fat cheeks tight inside their skin find out everything you can a lot of people seem to be what they arent i would start with a mr dominic corde if i were you her eyes never wavered from his face much too smooth that one after alicias money shouldnt wonder take a good look at him sniffing round here before poor augustus was dead long before turning her head with his handsome face and easy mannersstupid girl as if a face were worth anything why when i was her age i knew twenty just like him she snapped her fingers sharply courts of europe are full of them grow a crop of them every summer just like potatoes good for a season then theyre gone rot unless they marry some rich woman whos taken in by them you go and inquire into his means see what he owes pitt raised his eyebrows he would have given a weeks pay to have been rude to her unfortunately it would have been a lifetimes do you think he could have disinterred lord augustus he asked innocently i dont see why he should dont be such an idiot she spat if anything he murdered him or put that silly girl up to it i dare say someone knows and dug up augustus to show it he faced her without blinking did you know maam she glared at him with stonefaced anger while she decided which emotion to show dig up my own son she said at last you are a barbarian a cretin no maam pitt refused to rise to her bait you mistake me i meant did you suspect that your son had been murdered suddenly she realized the trap and her temper vanished she looked at him with wary little eyes no i did not not at the time although now i am beginning to consider the possibility so are we maam pitt stood up he needed to learn everything he could but venomous gossip from this old woman would only cloud the issue so early on murder was no more yet than a possibility and there were still others lefthatred or simply vandalism she snorted held out her hand to be helped up then remembered he was a policeman and withdrew it again climbing to her feet unaided she banged her stick on the floor nisbett the ubiquitous maid appeared as if she had been leaning against the door show this man out the old lady ordered lifting her stick in the air to point and then bring me a cup of chocolate up to my room i dont know whats the matter with the world it gets colder every winter it never used to be like this we knew how to heat our houses properly she stumped out without looking at pitt again pitt followed nisbett into the hallway and was about to go out when he heard voices in the withdrawing room to his left one was a mans not loud but very clear with words precisely spoken it brought back a tide of memoryit could only be dominic corde he gave nisbett a flashing smile leaving her startled and not a little alarmed and turned sharply to the door brushed it with his knuckles in the briefest of knocks and strode in dominic was standing with alicia by the fireplace they both looked round with surprise as he burst in alicia flushed and dominic made as if to demand an explanation then he recognized pitt thomas his voice rose a little in surprise thomas pitt then his composure returned and he smiled putting his hand out it was genuine and pitts dislike evaporated in spite of himself but he could not afford to forget why he was here there might be murder and either one of these two or even both could be involved even if it were only grave robbingthen surely they were the intended victims of malice he took dominics outstretched hand good morning mr corde dominic was quite innocent as he had always been good morning how is charlotte pitt felt a strange mixture of elation because charlotte was his wife now and resentment because dominic asked so easily so naturally but after all he had lived in the same house with her all the years of his marriage to sarah he had seen her grow up from an adolescent to a young woman and all the time it had never entered his head that charlotte was infatuated with him but this was different he was thirty now surely more mature wiser to his effect upon women and this was alicia not his young sisterinlaw in excellent health thank you pitt replied he could not resist adding and jemima is two years old and full of conversation dominic was a little startled perhaps he had not thought of charlotte with children he and sarah had not had anyinstantly pitt regretted his bragging already with these few emotiondriven words he had made detachment impossible destroyed the professionalism he had intended to observe i hope youre well he floundered a little this is a very wretched business about lord fitzroyhammond dominics face colored then the blood drained away ghastly he agreed i hope you can find whoever did it and have him put away surely he must be mad and not too hard to recognize unfortunately insanity is not like the pox pitt replied it doesnt give you a rash that can be seen by the eye alicia stood silently still absorbing the fact that the two men obviously knew each other and that it was no chance or merely formal acquaintance not by the untrained eye dominic agreed but you are not untrained and havent you doctors or something before you can do anything with a disease you need to be familiar with it pitt pointed out and grave robbing is not something that happens more than once in a policemans career what about selling them for medical research wasnt there a trade im sorry alicia he apologized resurrectionists that was quite a while ago pitt replied they get cadavers quite legally now then it cant be that dominics shoulders slumped its grisly do you thinkno it cant be they didnt harm the body it cant be necromancers or satanists or anything like that alicia spoke at last mr pitt is obliged to consider the possibility that they did not choose augustus by chance but quite deliberately either out of hatred for him or for one of us dominic was not as surprised as pitt would have expected the thought occurred to him that perhaps she had already said as much before he came into the room perhaps that was even what they were discussing when he had broken in on them i cant imagine hating anyone so much dominic said flatly it was pitts chance and he took it there can be many reasons for hatred he said trying to make his voice lighter again as though he were speaking impersonally fear is one of the oldest although i have not yet been able to discover any reason why anybody should have feared lord augustus it might turn out he had a power i know nothing of a financial power or even a power of knowledge of something someone else would greatly prefer kept secret he may have learned of something even unintentionally then he would have kept it so alicia said with conviction augustus was very loyal and he never gossiped he might consider it his duty to speak if the matter were a crime pitt pointed out neither alicia nor dominic spoke they were both still standing dominic so close to the fire his legs must be scorching or revenge pitt continued people can harbor a desire for revenge nursing it over the years till it becomes monstrous the original offense need not have been grave indeed it may not have been a genuine offense at all merely a success where the other failed something quite innocent he drew in breath and came a little closer to what he really wanted to say and of course there is greed one of the commonest motives in the world it may be that someone stood to benefit from his death in ways that are not immediately obvious the blood ebbed out of alicias face and then rushed back in scarlet pitt had not meant anything quite so simple as inheritance but he knew she thought he did dominic too was silent shifting from one foot to the other it may have been unease or merely that he was too close to the fire and unable to move without asking pitt to move also or jealousy pitt finished a desire for freedom perhaps he stood in the way of something someone else wished for desperately now he could not look directly at either of them and he was aware they did not look at each other lots of reasons he backed a little to allow dominic away from the heat any one of them possible until we find otherwise alicia gulped areare you going to investigate all of them it may not be necessary he answered feeling cruel as he said it and hating his job because already the suspicion was taking form in his mind and shaping like a picture in the fog we may discover the truth long before that it was no comfort to her as indeed he had not intended it to be she came forward a little standing between pitt and dominic it was a gesture he had seen a hundred times in all manner and walk of women a mother defending an unruly child a wife lying about her husband a daughter excusing her drunken father i hope you will be discreet inspector she said quietly you may cause a great deal of unnecessary distress if you are not and wrong my husbands memory not to mention those you imply may have had such motives of course he agreed facts may have to be inquired into but no implications will be made she did not look as if she were able to believe him but she said no more pitt excused himself and the footman made sure that he left this time outside the cold caught at him seizing his body even through his layers of coat and jacket chilling the skin and tying knots in the muscles of his stomach the fog had blown away and there was sleet on the wind it sighed through the laurel and magnolia and the rain blackened everything there was no alternative now but to press for a postmortem of augustus fitzroyhammond the possibility of murder could not be ignored discreetly tucked away because it could hurt too many people he had previously discovered where to find dr mcduff and he took himself straight there the less time he had to think about it the better he would face telling charlotte when he had to dr mcduffs house was spacious and solid and conventional like the man it had nothing to wake the imagination nothing to risk offending the complacent pitt was shown into yet another cold morning room and told to wait after a quarter of an hour he was conducted to the study lined with leatherbound books a little scuffed where he stood before a vast desk to answer as a schoolboy might to a master at least here there was a fire good morning dr mcduff said dourly he may have been comely enough in his youth but now his face was wrinkled with time and impatience and selfsatisfaction had set unbecoming lines round his nose and mouth what can i do for you pitt pulled up the only other chair and sat down he refused to be treated like a servant by this man after all he was only another professional like himself trained and paid to deal with the less pleasant problems of humanity you were the physician in attendance to the late lord augustus fitzroyhammond up to the time of his death he began indeed dr mcduff replied that is hardly a matter for the police the man died of a heart attack i signed the certificate i know nothing about this appalling desecration that has taken place since that is your affair and the sooner you do something about it the better pitt could feel the antagonism in the air to mcduff he represented a sordid world beyond the grace and comfort of his own circle a tide that must be forever held back with sandbags of discrimination and social distinction if he were to get anything from him at all it would not be by a headlong charge but with deviousness and appeal to his vanity yes it is an appalling business he agreed i have not had to deal with anything like it before i would value your professional opinion as to what manner of person might be affected with such an insane desire mcduff had opened his mouth to disclaim anything to do with it but his professional standing had been called on it was not what he had been expecting pitt to say and he was momentarily off guard ah he sought to rearrange his thoughts rapidly ah now thats a very complex matter he had been going to say he knew nothing about it either but he never admitted ignorance outright after all his years of experience had given him immense wisdom knowledge of human behavior in all its comedies and tragedies you are quite right it is an insanity to dig a mans corpse out of its grave no question about it do you know of any medical condition that would lead to such a thing pitt inquired with a perfectly sober face perhaps some sort of obsession obsession with the dead mcduff turned it over in his mind casting about for something positive to say necrophilia is the term you are seeking yes pitt agreed perhaps even an obsessive hatred or envy of lord augustus himselfafter all the wretched creature has dug him up twice that hardly seems like coincidence mcduffs face stiffened to even harder lines of dislike it was his own world that was being threatened now his social circle pitt saw it and turned it into necessity naturally your professional ethics would not permit you to mention names dr mcduff he said quickly even obliquely but you can tell me as a man of long experience in medicine if there is any such conditionthen i must search for myself to see if i can find its victim it is the duty of both of us to see that lord augustus is decently buried and allowed to restand of course his unfortunate family his widowand his mother dr mcduff remembered the purse strings of course he said immediately i will do everything i canwithin the bounds of ethical discretion he added but i cannot readily think of any disease whatever which would produce such a repulsive form of madness i will give the matter deep thought and if you care to call again i will have a more considered opinion thank you very much pitt stood up and moved to the door then just before he opened it he turned by the way there are some very unpleasant suggestions that lord augustus might have been murdered and someone knows of it and is digging up his body to draw our attention to the factforce us to investigate i suppose his death was perfectly naturalexpected mcduffs face darkened of course it was perfectly natural man do you imagine i would have signed the certificate if it were not expected pitt insisted he had been ill for some time a week or so but in a man of sixty that is not unusual his mother has a weak heart but she is still alive pitt pointed out and somewhat over eighty i should judge that has nothing to do with it mcduff snapped his fist tightening on the desk top lord augustuss death was quite natural and in a man of his years and health not unusual you did a postmortem pitt knew perfectly well he had not mcduff was too angry to think of that the very idea outraged him i did not his face mottled heavily with purple you have practiced too long in the back streets inspector i would have you remember that my clients have no resemblance whatsoever to yours there is no murder here and no crime except that of grave robbing and doubtless it is one from your world not one from mine who is to blame for that good day to you sir then i shall have to get a postmortem now pitt said softly i am obliged to tell you i shall apply to the magistrate this afternoon and i shall oppose you sir mcduff banged his fist down and you may allow yourself to be quite certain his family will also they are not without influence now please take yourself out of my house pitt went to his superiors with his request for a postmortem on lord augustus and they received him with anxiety saying they would have to consider such a thing and could not put it to a magistrate without due weighing of all its aspects one could not do such things lightly or irresponsibly and they must be sure they were justified before committing themselves pitt was angry and disappointed but he knew that he should have been prepared for it one did not disembowel the corpses of the aristocracy and question their deaths without the most dire compulsion and even then one obtained a justification that could not be denied before venturing forth the following day mcduff had done his best the answer was returned to pitt in his office that there were no grounds for the application and it would not be made he went back to his own small room not sure whether he was angry or relieved if there were no autopsy then it was unlikely there would ever be any murder proved the certificate had been signed for a natural death from heart failure and he had already seen enough of dr mcduff to believe it would take more than anything pitt was capable of to make him reverse a professional opinion and certainly not publicly and if there were no murder pitt would still be obliged to make the motions of further investigations as to who had disinterred the body and left it so bizarrely displayed but he did not for a moment hold any hope of discovering the answer in time it would be overtaken by more urgent crimes and dominic and the fitzroyhammonds would be left alone to get on with their lives except of course that whoever had dug up augustus might not give up so easily if someone believed or even knew that there had been murder heor shemight have more ideas on how to bring it to attention god knew what could be next and pitt hated an open case he liked alicia as far as his imagination stretched to a totally alien way of life he even sympathized with her he did not want to learn that she had either killed her husband or had been party to it and for charlottes sake he did not want it to have been dominic for the time being there was nothing he could do he turned his mind to a case of forgery he had been closing in on before lord augustus fell off the cab at his feet it was halfpast five and outside as dark as an unlit cellar between the fogwrapped gas lamps when a junior constable opened his door to say that a mr corde had come to see him pitt was startled his first thought was that there had been some new outrage that his extraordinary opponent was impatient and ready to prompt him again it was a sick unhappy feeling dominic came in with his collar turned up to his ears and his hat on far lower than his usual rakish angle his nose was red and his shoulders hunched my god its a wretched night he sat uncomfortably on the hardbacked chair looking at pitt with anxiety i pity any poor devil without a fire and a bed instead of asking why dominic had come pitt made the instinctive reply that was on his tongue therell be thousands of them he met dominics eyes and without supper either within a stones throw of here dominic winced he had never had much imagination when charlotte had known him but maybe the few years between had changed him or perhaps it was only distaste at pitts literal reply to what had been meant only as a passing remark is it true that you want to do a postmortem on lord augustus he asked taking his gloves off and pulling a white linen handkerchief out of his pocket pitt could not let a chance for truth slip away unused yes dominic blew his nose and when he looked up his face was tight why he died of heart failure its in the family mcduff will tell you it was all perfectly normal even expected he ate too much and seldom took any recreation men like that in their sixties are dying all the time dominic screwed up the handkerchief and shoved it in his pocket cant you see what it will do to the family especially alicia that old woman is pretty good hell to live with now imagine what she will be like if there is a postmortem she will blame it all on alicia and say that such a thing would never have happened to augustus if he had not married her if alicia were not more than thirty years younger than he no one would think anything of it its nothing to do with age pitt said wearily he wished he could leave the affair put it out of his mind as well as his duty it is because the body was dug up twice and left where we could not help but find it quite apart from the fact that that is a crime we have to prevent it happening again surely you can see that then bury him and put a constable on watch dominic said with exasperation no one is going to dig him up with a policeman standing there looking at them it cant be an easy job or a quick one moving all that earth and raising a coffin they must do it at night and take a fair bit of equipment spades ropes and things and there must be more than one of them it stands to reason pitt did not look at him one strong man could do it with a little effort he argued and he wouldnt need ropes the coffin was left only the actual corpse was taken we could post a constable for a night or two even a week but sometime wed have to take him awayand then he could go and do it again if that was what he wanted oh god dominic shut his eyes and put his hands over them or else hell do something else pitt added if he is determined to make somebody act dominic lifted his head something else such as what for gods sake i dont know pitt admitted if i knew then perhaps i could prevent it dominic stood up the blood high in his face now well ill prevent a postmortem there are plenty of people in the park who will put their weight against it lord st jermyn for one and if necessary we can hire somebody to keep a guard over the grave to see that the body rests in peace and decency nobody but a madman disturbs the dead nobody but madmen do many things pitt agreed im sorry about it but i dont know how to stop it dominic shook his head moving slowly away its not your fault and not your responsibility well have to do somethingfor alicias sake remember me to charlotteand emily if you ever see her goodnight the door closed behind him and pitt stared at it feeling guilty he had not told him there was no postmortem because he had wanted to see what dominic would say and now he knew he felt worse than before a postmortem might have cleared up forever any suspicion of murder perhaps he should have said that but why had dominic not seen that himself or was he afraid it would show the very opposite that there had been murder was dominic guilty himselfor afraid for alicia or only afraid of the scandal and all the dark corroding suspicions the old sores opened up that investigation always brings he could not have forgotten cater street but if dominic wanted the matter silenced there was at least one other who did not in the morning pitt received a rather stiff letter from the old lady reminding him that it was his duty to discover who had disturbed lord augustus in his graveand why if there had been murder done he was paid by the community to learn of it and avenge it he called her an exceedingly uncomplimentary name and put the sheet of paper down it was ordinary white notepaperperhaps she kept the deckleedged for her social acquaintances the thought flickered through his mind that maybe he should take it to his superiors and let them fight among themselves as to which was the more imperative for their careers and dutythe establishments prohibition or the old ladys social weight he was still considering the matter with the letter in his top drawer when alicia came wrapped in furs to her throat she caused a few surprised comments in the outer office and the constable who preceded her to tell pitt had eyes as round and bulbous as marbles good morning maam pitt offered her the chair and waved the constable away im afraid i have nothing new to tell you or i should have called to say so no she looked everywhere but at pitt he wondered whether she was simply avoiding him or if she had any interest at all in the brownish walls and the austere prints on them the boxes bulging with files he waited leaving her to find her own courage at last she looked at him mr pitt i have come to ask you not to continue with the matter of my husbands grave being disinterred that was a ridiculous euphemism and she realized it stammering a little awkwardly ii meanthe digging up of his body i have come to the belief that it was someone deranged vandals who knew no better you will never catch them and no good can be served by pursuing it a sudden idea occurred to him no i may not catch him he agreed slowly but if i do not pursue it then there may be great distress not least to you yourself he met her eyes squarely and she was unable to look away without obviously avoiding him i dont understand you she shook her head a little we shall bury him and if necessary hire a servant to keep guard for as long as need be i see no way in which that can cause distress it may well be that it was merely a lunatic he leaned a little forward but im afraid not everyone will believe so her face pinched he did not need to use the word murder they will have to think as they choose she lifted her head and gripped her fur tighter they will pitt agreed and some of them will choose to think you have refused to allow a postmortem precisely because there is something to hide her face paled and she knotted her fingers unconsciously in the thick pelts unkindness is surprisingly perceptive he continued there will be those who have remarked mr cordes admiration for you and no doubt those also who have envied it he waited a moment or two allowing her to digest the thought with all its implications he was preparing to add that there would be suspicion but it was not necessary you mean they will wonder if he was murdered she said very softly her voice dry and they will say it was dominic or me myself it is possible now that he had come to it again it was hard to say he wished he could disbelieve it himself but remembering dominic and sitting here looking at her face eyes hot and miserable hands twisting at her collar he knew that she was not sure beyond question even in her own heart they are wrong she said fiercely i have done nothing to harm augustus ever and i am sure dominicmr cordehas not either it was the protest of fear to convince herself and he recognized it he had heard just that tone so often before when the first doubt thrusts itself into the mind then would it not be better to allow a postmortem he said softly and prove that the death was natural then no one would consider the matter any further except as an ordinary tragedy he watched as the fears chased each other across her face first a catching at the hope he held out then doubt then the sick pain that it might prove the exact opposite and make murder unarguable a fact do you think mr corde might have killed your husband he said brutally she glared at him with real anger no of course i dont then let us prove that it was a natural death with a postmortem which will put it beyond doubt she hesitated still weighing the public scandal against the private fears she made a last attempt his mother would not permit it on the contrary he could afford to be a little gentler now she has written to request it perhaps she wishes these voices silenced as much as anyone else alicia pulled a face of derision she knew as well as pitt who had read the letter what the old lady wanted and she also knew what the old lady would say and go on saying until the day she died if there were no postmortem it was the deciding factor as pitt had intended it should be very well she agreed you may add my name to the request and take it to whoever it is who decides such things thank you maam he said soberly the victory had no pleasure in it he had seldom fought so hard for something that tasted so bitter the postmortem was a gruesome performance they were never pleasant but this one performed on a body that had now been dead for nearly a month was grimmer than most pitt attended because in the circumstances it was expected that someone from the police be there and he wanted to know for himself each answer the minute it was obtained it was a day when the cold seemed to darken everything and the autopsy room was as bleak and impersonal as a mass grave god knew how many dead had passed across its scrubbed table the pathologist wore a mask and pitt was glad of one too the smell caught at the stomach they worked for hours calmly and in silence but for brief instructions as organs were removed and handed over samples taken to search for poisons the heart was looked at with particular care at the end pitt walked out numb with cold his stomach tight from nausea he huddled his jacket round him and pulled his muffler up to his ears well he asked nothing the pathologist replied dourly he died of heart failure pitt stood silently half of him had wanted that answer and yet the other half could not believe it could see no sense in it dont know what brought it on the pathologist went on hearts not in a bad condition for a man of his age bit fatty arteries thickening a little but not enough to kill him pitt was obliged to ask could it have been poison could have the pathologist answered quite a lot of digitalis there but his doctor says the old lady had it for her heart he could have taken it himself doesnt look like enough to have done him any harmbut i cant say for certain people dont all react the same way and hes been dead awhile now so he could have died of digitalis poisoning possibly the pathologist agreed but not likely sorry i cant be more help but there just isnt anything definite pitt had to be content the man was professional and had done his job the postmortem had proved nothing except confirm to the world that the police were suspicious pitt dreaded having to tell the news to his superiors he treated himself to a hansom from the hospital back to the police station and got out in the rain at the other end he ran up the steps two at a time and dived into the shelter of the entrance he shook himself scattering water all over the floor then went in before he reached the far side of the room and went up the stairs to break the news he was confronted by the red face of a young sergeant mr pitt sir pitt stopped irritated he wanted to get this over as soon as possible what is it he demanded the sergeant took a deep breath theres another grave siri mean another open onesir pitt stood stockstill another grave he said fatuously yes sirrobbed like the last one coffinbut no corpse and whose is it a mr w w porteous sir william wilberforce porteous to be exact pitt did not tell charlotte about the second grave nor indeed about the result of the postmortem she heard about the latter two days later in the early afternoon she had just finished her housework and put jemima to bed for her rest when the doorbell rang the woman who came in three mornings a week to do the heavy work had gone before midday so charlotte answered the door herself she was startled to see dominic on the step at first she could not even find words but stood stupidly without inviting him in he looked so little different it was as if memory had come to life his face was just as she had remembered it the same dark eyes the slightly flared nostrils the same mouth he stood just as elegantly the only difference was that it did not tighten her throat anymore she could see the rest of the street with its white stone doorsteps and the net twitching along the windows may i come in he asked uncomfortably this time it was he who seemed to have lost his composure she recollected herself with a jolt embarrassed for her clumsiness of course she stepped back she must look ridiculous they were old friends who had lived in the same house for years when he had been her brotherinlaw in fact since he had apparently not remarried even though sarah had been dead for nearly five years he was still a member of the family how are you she asked he smiled quickly trying to look comfortable to bridge the immense gap very well he replied and i know you are i can see and thomas told me when i met him the other day he says you have a daughter yes jemima shes upstairs asleep she remembered that the only fire was in the kitchen it was too expensive to heat the parlor as well and anyway she spent too little time in there for it to matter she led him down the passage conscious of the difference between this with its wellworn furniture and scrubbed board floors and the house in cater street with five servants at least the kitchen was warm and clean thank goodness she had blackened the stove only yesterday and the table was almost white she would not apologize not so much for herself as for pitt she took his coat and hung it behind the door then offered him pitts chair he sat down she knew he had come for some reason and he would tell her what it was when he had found the words it was early for tea but he was probably cold and she could think of nothing else to offer thank you he accepted quickly she did not notice his eyes going round the room seeing how bare it was how every article was old and loved polished by owner after owner and mended where use had worn it down he knew her too well to play with gentilities he could remember her sneaking the newspaper from the butlers pantry when her father would not allow her to read it he had always treated her as a friend a strong friend rather than as a woman it was one of the things that used to hurt did thomas tell you about the grave robbing he asked suddenly and baldly she was filling the kettle at the sink yes she kept her voice level did he tell you much he went on that it was a man called lord augustus fitzroyhammond and that they dug him up twice and left him where he was bound to be found quicklythe second time in his own pew in church where it would be his family who saw him yes he told me she turned off the tap and set the kettle on the stove she could not think what to offer him to eat at this time of day he was bound to have lunched and it was far too early for afternoon tea she had nothing elegant in the end she settled for biscuits she had made sharp with a little ginger in them he was looking at her his eyes following her round the room anxious they did a postmortem thomas insisted on it even though i begged him not to why she met his eyes and tried to keep all guile out of her face she knew he had come for some kind of help but she could not give it if she did not understand the truth or at least as much of it as he knew himself why he repeated her question as if he found it strange yes she sat down opposite him at the scrubbed table why do you mind if they do a postmortem he realized he had not told her about his connection with the family and assumed that that was why she was confused she could see the thoughts crossing his mind and was surprised how easily she read them in cater street he had seemed mysterious private and out of reach she allowed the mistake oh he acknowledged his omission i forgot to explaini know lady alicia fitzroyhammond the widow i met her at a ball some little time ago we became he hesitated and she knew he was debating whether to tell her the truth or not not from any sensitivity to old feelings because he had never been aware of them but from a habitual delicacy in discussing such things one did not speak freely of a relationship with a recent widow still less of another mans wife personal emotion of any sort was hinted at rather than named she smiled very slightly allowing him to flounder he met her eyes and memory was too strong for him friends he finished in fact i hope to marry herwhen a decent time has passed she was glad she had been prepared for it somehow it would have been a shock if it had come without any warning was her resentment for sarahs memory or for her own a final shedding of girlhood dreams she forced her mind back to the disinterment then why do you mind there being a postmortem she asked frankly are you afraid it will uncover something wrong his face colored but he remained looking at her fixedly no of course not it is the suspicion if the police demand a postmortem that means they must have a strong belief there is something to discover in any event they were wrong she was surprised pitt had not told her it had been done you mean it is over she asked his eyebrows went up yes you didnt know no what did they find he looked angry and unhappy they made it worse than before it made their suspicions obvious without proving anything alicia consented to it because thomas told her it would put an end to all the speculation but the answer was equivocal it could have been natural heart failure or it could have been an overdose of digitalis and an overdose could have been accidentalhis mother keeps it for her heartor it could have been murder of course she knew he would say this but now that he had she did not know how to answer she asked the obvious question is there any reason to suppose it was murder the damned corpse was dug up twice he said furiously his helplessness breaking through in anger that isnt exactly common you know especially in that sort of society good god charlotte have you forgotten what suspicion of murder did to us in cater street it stripped off the facade so we saw all the weak and ugly things we had learned to hide from ourselves and each other she said quietly what are you afraid you will see here he stared at her something close to dislike in his face she would have expected it to hurt her and yet it did not not closely inside herself where real pain lived rather it was the distant ache one feels for someone unknown whose misfortune one has seen before and known to expect im sorry she meant it not as an apology but as an expression of regret even sympathy i really am sorry but i dont know of anything i can say or do to help his anger vanished he was caught he knew all the disillusion the malice and the fear that almost inevitably would follow and he was afraid he was still looking for an escape cant they leave it now he said quietly his voice tight his hands white on the wooden tabletop alicia didnt kill him i didnt and the old lady wouldnt have unless she gave him a dose accidentally and it was too much for him he looked up at charlotte but no one can prove it all they will do is raise a lot of doubts make everyone look with suspicion at each other cant thomas just leave it now then therell be some hope that whoever did this wretched thing will give up be convinced at last that theres nothing to it she did not know what to say she would like to have believed him and accepted that it was simply either a natural death or an accident but why the disintermenttwice and why was he afraid was it no more than the shadow of cater street indelible in the memory or was there growing in him a fear that alicia could have become so in love with him so frustrated by her husband that she had taken a simple easily grasped opportunity and given him a fatal dose of his mothers medicine she looked at dominics handsome face and felt as she sometimes did towards jemima he may do she wanted to comfort him she had known him a long time and he had been part of her life part of the deepest of her emotions in those callow vulnerable years before she met pitt yet it would be both useless and stupid to lie but grave robbing is a crime she said clearly and if there is a chance he can find who did it he will have to continue he wont find out he spoke with such conviction she knew it was for himself he insisted not for her probably not she agreed unless of course they do it again or they do something else it was a thought he had been trying to banish now she had brought it where it could not be denied its insane he said hotly it was the easiest way to explain it the only acceptable way insanity did not have to have reason by its very nature any incongruity could be explained and wiped away perhaps he had finished his tea and she collected his cup to remove it cant you ask thomas he leaned forward a little urgently his face puckered point out the harm it will do to innocent people please charlotte there will be such injustice we wont even have the chance to deny or disprove what has only been whispered never said outright when people whisper lies become bigger and bigger as they are passed around the injustice convinced her for a moment she placed herself in alicias position in love with dominic she could still remember how sharp that was full of excitement and pain wild hope and hot disillusion and to be tied to a husband without imagination or laughter then if he died and at last you were free suspicion reached out its ugly fingers and soils everything no one says to you what they think it is all smiles and sympathy to your face polite smirks in the withdrawing room the moment you are gone the acid overflows creeping wider and wider eating away the fabric of everything good the gossips court you old friends no longer call she had seen enough of envy and opportunism before ill ask him she agreed i cant say what he will do but ill ask his face lit up making her feel guilty for having promised when she knew she could influence pitt very little where his job was concerned thank you dominic stood up as graceful as always now that his fear had gone thank you very much he smiled and the last few years slipped awaythey could have been conspirators again in something trivial like the filching of papas newspaper when pitt came home she said nothing at first allowing him to warm himself to speak with jemima and see her to bed and then to eat his meal and relax before the fire the kitchen was comfortable from the daylong heat of the stove the scrubbed wood was pale almost white and the pans gleamed on the shelves flowered china on the dresser reflected the gaslight dominic came here today she said casually she was sewing mending a dress of jemimas where she had trodden on the hem and toppled over she did not notice pitt stiffen here he asked yes this afternoon what for his voice was cool guarded she was a little surprised she stopped sewing needle in the air and looked up at him he said youd done a postmortem on lord whatever his name isthe man who fell off the cab after the theatre so we did and you didnt discover anything conclusive he died of heart failure thats right did he come here to tell you that his voice was a beautiful instrument precise and evocative it was rich with sarcasm now no of course not she said sharply i dont care what the wretched man died of he was frightened that the suggestion of murder might cause gossip whispering that would hurt a lot of people it is very difficult to deny something that no one has said outright such as that alicia fitzroyhammond murdered her husband he asked or that dominic did himself she looked at him a little coolly i dont think he was afraid for himself if that is what you are trying to say as soon as the words were out she thought better of them she loved pitt and she sensed in him a vulnerability even though she did not know what it was but justice was strong too and the old loyalty to dominic died hard perhaps because she knew his weaknesses pitt was the stronger she had no need to defend him he could be hurt but he would not hurt himself crumble under pressure he ought not be pitt said drily if lord augustus was murdered dominic is an obvious suspect alicia inherits a good deal not to mention an excellent social position shes in love with dominicand shes an extremely handsome woman you dont like dominic do you she was listening not to his words but to what she read in them he stood up and walked away pretending to fiddle with the curtains like and dislike have nothing to do with it he answered i am speaking of his position he is a natural suspect if lord augustus was murdered it would be naive to imagine otherwise we cannot always have the world as we would like it and sometimes even the most charming people people we have known and cared for for years are capable of violence deceit and stupidity he let the curtains go and turned back to her because he had to know what she was feeling he would not ask her what dominic had meant under his words how he had spoken what he had left unsaid her face was calm but there was anger under the surface and he was not sure exactly why he had to press until he did even if it hurt him in the end because not knowing was worse dont talk to me as if i were a child thomas she said quietly i know that perfectly well i dont think dominic killed him because i dont think he would want to enough but i think he is afraid that she did that is why he came here his eyes narrowed a little what did he expect you to do point out to you the injustice that might be done if you continue with an investigation especially since you are not even sure if there has been any crime you think i shall be unjust he was looking for a quarrel now better to hear it than leave it in the air waiting she refused to reply biting her tongue instead of telling him not to be idiotic she would like to have said it but she did not dare charlotte he demanded do you think that because it is dominic i shall be unjust she looked up from jemimas dress the needle still in her fingers it does not need anyone to be unjust for injustice to happen she said a little tartly really he was being stupid on purpose we all know what suspicion can do and we have said as much and in case you think otherwise i told dominic that you would do whatever was necessary and i should have no influence upon you oh he walked back across the room and sat down in his chair opposite her but you still dont like dominic she added he did not answer instead he pulled out the box where he kept the pieces he was making into a train for jemima and began working on them skillfully with a knife he had got enough of the answer he wanted for tonight he would prefer to leave it alone she was still cross but he knew it was not to do with dominic and that was all that mattered he carved at the wood with satisfaction beginning to smile as it took shape the following day charlotte determined to do something about the matter herself she had not a really good winter dress but she had one that although it was very much last years fashion flattered her its cut fit her extremely well especially now that her figure was quite back to its weight before jemimas birth in fact if anything a little improved the gown was the color of warm burgundy complementary both to her hair and her complexion she remembered what aunt vespasia had said about a suitable hour to call and she spent the next days housekeeping on a hansom cab to take her to gadstone park she could not possibly be seen arriving on an omnibus even if such a thing were to run anywhere near the parlormaid was surprised to see her but well trained enough to show it only slightly charlotte had no card to present as most callers did in society but she kept her chin in the air and begged the maid to be good enough to inform her mistress that mrs pitt was here at her invitation she was more relieved than she had realized when the girl accepted this somewhat odd introduction and led her to an empty withdrawing room to wait while lady cumminggould was apprised of the event it was probably the word invitation that had decided it after all it was just possible lady cumminggould had invited her the old lady being a trifle eccentric charlotte was too tense to sit down she stood with her hat and gloves still on and tried to affect an air of indifference in case the maid should return before she heard her anyway it was good practice when the door opened it was vespasia herself dressed in dove gray and looking like a figure from a silversmiths dream she was more magnificent in her seventies than most women ever are charlotte how delightful to see you for goodness sake girl take off your hat and cloak my house cannot possibly be as cold as that here eliza her voice rang out in imperious disgust and the maid appeared instantly take mrs pitts cloak and bring us something hot to drink what would you like mlady the girl took the things obediently i dont know vespasia snapped use your imagination she sat down the moment the door was closed behind the maid and treated charlotte to a detailed inspection finally she snorted and leaned back you look in excellent health time you had another child she disregarded charlottes blush i suppose youve come about this disgusting business of the corpse old augustus fitzroyhammond he was always a nuisance never knew when it was time to go even when he was alive charlotte wanted to laugh perhaps it was a relief from nervousness especially after last evenings wretched silly conversation with pitt yes she agreed warmly dominic came to see me yesterday you know he is very afraid the continued investigation may cause a lot of unkind speculation no doubt vespasia said drily and most of it to the effect that either he or alicia killed himor both together she had said it so immediately charlottes mind flew to the obvious does that mean they have started already they are bound to have vespasia replied there is little enough else to talk about at this time of the year at least half of society is in the country and those of us who are left are bored to stupidity what more exciting than the rumor of a love affaire or a murder thats vicious charlotte was angry at the callousness of it the enjoyment of other peoples tragedies almost as if the gossipers were willing it to be true of course vespasia looked at her with amusement and regret under her hooded eyelids nothing much changes it is still bread and circuses why do you think they baited bears or bulls id hoped we had learned better charlotte replied we are civilized now we dont throw christians to the lions anymore vespasia raised her eyebrows and her face was perfectly straight you are out of date my dear far out christians are passe now it is jews who are the fashion they are the stuff for the circuses memories of delicate social cruelty came back to charlotte yes i know and i suppose if there isnt a jew or a social climber to hand then dominic will do as well the maid came in with a tray with hot chocolate in a silver pot and very small cakes she set it in front of vespasia and waited for acceptance thank you vespasia regarded it down her nose very good ill call if i wish for you again for the time being i am not at home yes mlady and the girl departed her face still wide open with surprise why in goodness name should her ladyship treat this mrs pitt whom no one had ever heard of with such extraordinary regard she could hardly wait to regale the other servants with the news and discover if anyone knew the answer charlotte sipped the chocolate she had a weakness for it but it was something she could not often afford i suppose someone must think he was murdered she said presently or they would not keeping digging him up it seems the most likely explanation vespasia agreed with a frown although i cannot for the life of me imagine who would do such a thing unless of course it is the old woman what old woman for the moment charlotte could not think whom she meant his mother the old dowager lady fitzroyhammond fearful old creature lives in her bedroom most of the time except sundays when she goes to church and watches everyone she has ears like a ferret although she affects to be deaf so people will not be discreet in front of her she never comes anywhere near me in fact she took to her bed for a week when she heard i had come to live in the park because i am nearly as old as she is and i can remember her perfectly well fifty years ago she is forever recalling her youth and what a splendid time she had the balls and the carriage rides the handsome men and the love affaires only her memory has in it a great deal more than mine has and a good deal more highly spiced i recall her as a mousecolored girl far too short in the leg for elegance who married above herself rather later than most and winters were just as cold then orchestras just as out of tune and the handsome men just as vain and every bit as silly as they are now charlotte smiled into her chocolate cup im sure she must hate you soundly even if you never say anything at all about it no doubt part of her remembers the truth poor alicia i suppose she is in a constant comparison a moth to the memories of a butterfly very well put vespasias eyes glittered in appreciation if it were the old woman who had been killed i would hardly have blamed her did alicia love lord augustusi mean in the beginning charlotte asked vespasia gave her a long stare dont be ingenuous charlotte you are not so long out of society as that i dare say she was fond enough of him he had no intolerable habits so far as i am aware he was a bore but no more so than many men he was not generous but neither was he mean he certainly kept her well enough he seldom drank to excess nor was he indecently sober she sipped at her chocolate and looked charlotte straight in the eye but he was no match for young dominic corde as i dare say you know for yourself charlotte felt the color sweep up her face vespasia could not possibly know of her infatuation with dominic unless pitt had told her or emily but they would not vespasia must know he had been her brotherinlaw thomas would say so she knew he liked vespasia and would tell her that much of the truth charlotte chose her words very slowly to lie would be pointless and lose vespasias regard she made herself look up and smile no i should imagine not she answered lightly especially if he was her fathers choice rather than her own there is nothing to put one off anything like not having chosen it yourself even if you might have liked it well enough otherwise vespasias smile lit up her face going all the way to her eyes then you did well my dear im sure thomas pitt was not your fathers choice charlotte found herself grinning a tide of memories coming back to her although to be fair papa had not fought her nearly as hard as might have been expected perhaps he was glad enough she had at last made a choice at all but she had not come here merely to enjoy herself she must get back to the purpose do you think the old lady could have hired someone to dig up lord augustus just to spite alicia she asked a little too bluntly jealousy can be very obsessive especially in someone who has nothing else to occupy herself with but the past perhaps she has even convinced herself it is true it may be true vespasia weighed it in her mind although i doubt it alicia does not seem to have the desperation in her actually to have murdered the old fool even for dominic corde but then one seldom knows what fires may burn underneath a comparatively passive exterior and perhaps dominic is greedier than we think or more urgently pressed by creditors he dresses extremely well i should think his tailors bill is no small matter the thought was ugly and charlotte refused to entertain it she knew she might well have to eventuallybut not yet not until they had tried every other answer what possibilities are there apart from that she said cheerfully none that i know of vespasia admitted i cannot imagine anyone else of his social acquaintance either hating him enough to kill him or loving him enough to wish him avenged he was not the sort of man to inspire passion of any sort charlotte could not give up tell me about the other people in the park there are several who would be of no interest to you they are away for the winter of those who are here i can see no reason why any should be involved but you may as well consider them sir desmond and lady cantlay you have already met they are pleasant enough quite harmless i should have judged if desmond has anything more to him he should be on the stage he is the finest actor i have seen gwendoline may be a little bored like many women of her station with everything provided for her and nothing to complain of but if she took a lover it would most assuredly not have been augustus even had he unbent himself so far as to be willing he was a great deal more boring than desmond could it have anything to do with money charlotte was clutching at extremes vespasias eyebrows went up not likely my dear everyone in the park has more than adequate means and i dont believe anyone lives significantly beyond them but if one is temporarily embarrassed one goes to the jews not to augustus fitzroyhammond and there are no fortunes to be inherited except by the widow oh it was disappointing as always it led back to dominic and alicia the st jermyns were well acquainted vespasia continued but i cannot conceive of any reason why they should wish him harm in fact edward st jermyn is far too involved in his own affairs to have time or effort for anyone elses romantic affaires charlottes hopes rose vespasia pulled a small dry face certainly not he is a member of the house of lords and has great ambitions for office at the moment he is drafting a private members bill to reform conditions in workhouses particularly with regard to children believe me charlotte it is very much needed if you have any idea of the suffering of children in such places that may well affect them all their lives he will achieve a great thing if he succeeds and a good deal of regard throughout the country then he is a reformer charlotte said eagerly vespasia looked at her down her long nose she sighed a little wearily no my dear i fear he is no more than a politician you are being unkind that is quite cynical charlotte accused it is quite realistic i have known edward st jermyn for some time and his father before him nevertheless it is an excellent bill and i am giving it every support i can indeed we were discussing it when thomas came here last week i see he did not mention it no he seemed to feel strongly about it in fact i felt it was hard for him to be civil he looked at my lace and hesters silk as if it had been a crime in itself he must see a great deal more of poverty than any of us imagine but if we did not buy the clothes how would the seamstresses get even the few pence they do her face tightened and for the first time all the wit was gone out of her voice although somerset carlisle says that even sewing eighteen hours a day till their fingers bleed they still do not earn enough to live many of them are driven to the streets where they can make as much in a night as they would in a fortnight on the sweatshop floor i know charlotte said quietly thomas seldom speaks of it but when he does i cannot rid myself of the visions it brings for nights afterwards twenty or thirty men and women huddled together in a room probably below the street with no air and no sanitation working eating and sleeping there just to make enough to cling to life it is obscene god alone knows what a workhouse must be like if they still prefer the sweatshop i feel so guilty because i do nothingand yet i go on doing nothing vespasias face warmed to her honesty i know my dear yet there is very little we can do it is not an isolated instance or even a hundred instances it is a whole order of things you cannot relieve it by charity even had you the means it needs law and to initiate laws you must be in parliament that is why we need men like edward st jermyn for some time they sat silently then at last charlotte brought herself back to the thing that she could accomplish or at least could try that doesnt answer why lord augustus was dug up does it vespasia took the last cake no not in the least nor do i think the other people in the park will enlighten the situation somerset carlisle never showed anything for augustus beyond the courtesy required of good manners he like st jermyn is far too occupied with the bill major rodney and his two sisters are very retiring they are maiden ladies and will assuredly remain so they busy themselves with domestic chores largely of a refined nature such as fine sewing and the making of endless preserves and i think rather a lot of homemade wine from quite dreadful ingredients like parsnips and nettles perfectly appalling not that i have tasted it above once major rodney has left the army now of course and collects butterflies or something small that crawls around on dozens of legs he has been writing his memoirs of the crimea for the last twenty years i had no idea so much had happened out there charlotte hid a smile and there is a portrait artist vespasia continued godolphin jones but he has been absent for some little while in france i believe so he could not have dug up augustus and i can think of no possible reason why he should wish to the only other person she concluded is an american called virgil smith quite outrageous of course society will abhor him if he is brazen enough to remain here next season but then on the other hand he is laden with money from something quite uncouth like cattle out in wherever it is he comes from so they will not be able to refrain from courting him at the same time it should be greatly entertaining except that i hope the poor creature does not get too hurt he really is very goodnatured and seems to be quite without airs which is such a change of course his manners and his appearance are both disasters but money covers a multitude of sins and kindness even more charlotte pointed out not in society vespasia stared at her society is all to do with what seems and nothing to do with what is that is one of the reasons you will find it uncommonly difficult to discover whether augustus was killed by whom or whyand still less if anybody cares while charlotte was sitting in vespasias carriage being driven home feeling selfconscious but utterly pampered turning over in her mind the fruits of the journey or rather the lack of them in the churchyard of st margarets two gravediggers were standing in the rain for a moments respite from the long and heavy duty of preparing the earth to receive augustus fitzroyhammond yet again i dunno arry one of them said wiping the drop off the end of his nose im beginning to think as i could make me livin purely out o this just buryin is lordship no sooner does we ave im down there as some great fool goes an digs im up again i know what you mean harry sniffed i dreams about this i does spend me life goin in an out o this bleedin grave you should ear what my gertie says about it she says its only them wots murdered as wont rest an i tell you arfur im beginnin to think as shes right i dont suppose this is the last time well be in an out of ere arthur spat and took up his spade again the next blow hit the coffin lid well ill tell you this arry its the last time i will i dont want no truck wiv murder or them wots been murdered i dont mind buryin nice decent corpses what ave died natural ill bury as many of them as you like but theres two things as really gets me one is babiesi ate buryin kidsand the other is them wots been murdered an i already buried this one twice ifn e dont stay there this time they neednt ask me to do im againcos i shant enoughs enough let the rozzers find out oo done im in then maybe elll stay there thats wot i say me too harry agreed vehemently im a patient man god knows i am in this line you gets to see a lot o death you gets to know wots important and wot aint we all comes to this in the end and some folks as forgets that might do better if they remembered but my patience is wore out and i wont stand by for no murder i agree wiv yer let the rozzers bury im theirselves next time do em good it would they had cleaned the earth off the lid of the coffin and climbed out of the grave again for the ropes i suppose theyll want this thing all cleaned up fit to look at arthur said with heavy disgust theyll ave another service for im like as not they must be fair sick o payin their last respecs only it aint lastis it harry asked drily its second to last or third or fourth who knows when ell stay there ere take the other end o this rope will you together they eased the ropes under the coffin heaving on its weight and worked in silence except for grunts and the occasional expletive till it was laid on the wet earth beside the gaping hole cor that bleedin thing weighs a ton harry said furiously feels like it ad a load o bricks in it you dont suppose they put suffink else in there do you like wot arthur sniffed i dunno you want to look arthur hesitated for a moment then curiosity overcame him and he lifted one of the corners of the lid it was not screwed and came up quite easily god allbloodymighty arthurs face under the dirt went sheetwhite wots the matter harry moved toward him instinctively stubbing his toe on the coffin corner damn the flamin thing wot is it arfur es in ere arthur said huskily his hand went up to his nose rotten as ell but es ere all right e cant be harry said in disbelief he came round to where arthur was standing and looked in youre bloody right e is ere now wot in ells name do you make o that pitt was considerably shaken when he heard the news it was preposterous almost incredible he did up his muffler pulled his hat down over his ears and strode out into the icy streets he wanted to walk to give himself time to compose his mind before he got there there were two corpsesbecause the corpse from the church pew was still in the mortuary therefore one of them was not lord augustus fitzroyhammond his mind went back over the identification the man from the cab outside the theatre had been identified only by alicia now that he thought about it she had been expecting it to be her husband pitt himself had as much as told her it was she had only glanced at him and then looked away he could hardly blame her for that perhaps her eyes had seen only what had been told them and she had not actually examined him at all on the other hand the second corpse the one in the church pew had been seen not only by alicia but by the old lady the vicar and lastly by dr mcduff who one would presume was reasonably used to the sight of death even if not three weeks old he crossed the street splashed with dung and refuse from a vegetable cart the child who normally swept the crossing had bronchitis and was presumably holed up somewhere in one of the innumerable warrens behind the facade of shops therefore the most reasonable explanation was that the second corpse was lord augustus and the first was someone else since the grave of mr william wilberforce porteous had also been robbed presumably it was his corpse they had buried in st margarets churchyard he had better make arrangements for the widow to see itand properly this time it was halfpast six and the wind had dropped leaving the fog to close in on everything deadening sound choking the breath with freezing cloying pervasiveness when pitt drove in a hansom cab with a very stout and painfully corseted mrs porteous flowing with black toward the morgue where the first corpse was now waiting they were obliged to travel very slowly because the cabby could not see more than four or five yards in front of him and that only dimly gas lamps appeared like baleful eyes swimming out of the night and vanished behind them into the void they lurched from one to the next as alone as if it had been an ocean with no other ship upon it pitt tried to think of something to say to the woman beside him but rack his brains as he might there seemed nothing at all that was not either trivial or offensive he ended by hoping his silence was at least sympathetic when the cab finally stopped he got out with inelegant haste and offered her his hand she weighed heavily upon it a matter of balance rather than degree of distress inside they were greeted by the same cheerfully scrubbed young man with his glasses forever sliding down his nose several times he opened his mouth to remark on the extraordinariness of the circumstance never having had the same corpse twice in this manner then cut himself off halfway realizing that his professional enthusiasm was in poor taste and might be misunderstood by the widowor pitt for that matter he pulled back the sheet and composed his face soberly mrs porteous looked straight at the corpse then her eyebrows rose and she turned to pitt her voice level that is not my husband she said calmly its nothing like him mr porteous had black hair and a beard this man is nearly bald ive never seen him before in my life since the unnamed corpse was in the morgue there was no reason why augustus should not be reinterred of course it would have been ludicrous to have yet another ceremony but it was felt indecent not at least to observe the occasion in some manner it was a show of sympathy for the family and perhaps of respect not so much for augustus as for death itself alicia naturally had no choice but to go the old lady decided first that she was too unwell because of the whole miserable affair then later that it was her duty to pay a final farewelland please god it was final she was attended as always by nisbett in dourest black alicia was in the morning room waiting for the carriage when verity came in from the hall she was pale and the black hat made her look even younger there was an innocence about her that had often caused alicia to wonder what her mother had been like because verity possessed a quality that had nothing to do with augustus and she was as unlike the old lady as a doe is unlike a weasel it was an odd thought but in the darkness of the night alicia had even talked to the dead woman as if she had been a friend someone who could understand loneliness and dreams that were fragile but so very necessary in alicias mind that first wife who had died at thirtyfour had been very like herself because of her the ridiculous conversation in the dark she could almost feel as if verity were her own daughter although there was only a handful of years between them are you sure you wish to come she asked now no one would misunderstand if you preferred not to verity shook her head a little id love not to come but i cant leave you to do it alone your grandmother is coming alicia replied i shant be alone verity gave a dry little smile it was the first time alicia had seen it she had grown up a lot since her fathers death or perhaps she had only now felt the freedom to show it then i shall definitely come she said that is worse than alone at another time alicia might have made some protest as a matter of form but today the hypocrisy seemed emptier than ever it was a time for substance and form was irrelevant thank you she said simply it will be much less unpleasant for me if you are there verity gave a sudden flashing smile almost conspiratorial then before alicia could make an answer they both heard the old womans stick banging in the hall as she came toward them nisbett opened the door wide right back on its hinges and the old woman stood in the entrance glaring she examined both of them closely every article of their clothing from black hats and veils to black polished boots then nodded well are you coming then she demanded or do you mean to stand there all morning like two crows on a fence we were waiting for you grandmama verity replied instantly we would not leave you to come alone the old lady snorted huh she looked venomously at alicia i thought perhaps you were waiting for that mr corde you are so fond of not here this time i see perhaps he is afraid for his skin after all you seem to bury husbands more often than most she grabbed at nisbetts arm and went out whacking the door lintel with her stick as if it might have moved out of her way were it more aware of its duty it would hardly be appropriate for mr corde to have come alicia could not help defending him explaining even though the old lady was out of hearing and verity had said nothing but lowered her eyes it is a very private affair she added i expect no one but the family and perhaps a few of those who knew augustus well no of course not verity murmured it would be silly to expect him nevertheless there was a ring of disappointment in her voice and as alicia followed her outside and into the blackdraped carriage she could not help wondering why dominic had not at least sent a message good taste would keep him from coming himself that was simple to explain since he loved alicia it would be a little brazen to turn up yet again to an interment but it would have been so easy to have sent a small message just a sympathy a coldness jarred through alicia which had nothing to do with the wind and the drafty carriage perhaps she had read too much into his flatteries the soft looks the seeking after her company she would have sworn a few days ago that he loved her and she loved him with all the excitement the laughter ready to burst open at the silliest things the sharing of very private thoughts and sudden understandings but maybe it was only she who felt like that and had put her own joy into his heart quite falsely after all he had not actually said as muchshe had assumed out of delicacy for her position first as a married woman then as a very recent widow maybe he had not said so quite simply because it was not true many people loved to flirt it was a kind of game an exercise of skills a vanity but surely dominic was not like that his face swam before her memory the dark eyes the fine brows the curve of his mouth the quick smile the tears welled up and slid down her cheeks at any other time she would have been mortified but she was sitting in a dark carriage on a wet bitter day on the way to bury her husband no one would remark her weeping and anyway under her veil it would take a careful eye even to notice it the carriage lurched to a stop and the footman opened the door letting in a blast of icy air the old lady got out first holding her stick across their legs so they could not precede her the footman helped alicia it was raining even harder and the water ran round the brim of her hat and fell off the front blowing into her face the vicar spoke to the old lady then held out his hand to alicia he was never a cheerful man but he looked unusually wretched today far inside herself she half smiled but it would not reach her lips she could hardly blame the man even though she did not like him after all it was an occasion for which he probably had no precedent and he was at a loss to know what to say he had stock phrases of piety for all the foreseeable eventsbaptisms deaths marriages even scandalsbut who could expect to bury the same man three times in as many weeks she could have laughed albeit a little hysterically but she saw in the distance the slim elegant figure of a man and for a moment her heart lurched dominic then she realized it was not the shoulders were squarer leaner and there was something different about the way he stood it was somerset carlisle he turned as she picked her way through the puddles on the path and offered her his arm good morning lady fitzroyhammond he said gently im so sorry this should be necessary let us hope they get it over with as quickly as possible perhaps the rain will cut the vicars desire to expound he smiled very slightly hes going to be as wet as a fish if he stands out here for long it was a pleasing thought to remain here by the grave while the vicar droned on imperviously would be the final wretchedness the old woman looked like a sodden black bird feathers ruffled her whole stance bristling with anger verity stood with her head down and her eyes lowered so no one could read her face whether it was out of grief for her father or because in mind she was not attending at all alicia could only guess but she imagined the latter lady cumminggould of all people had also elected to attend her dignity was as superb as always indeed but for her deep lavender mourning she might have been at a garden party rather than standing by a yawning grave in a winter churchyard in the rain major rodney was there shifting unhappily from foot to foot blowing water off his moustache obviously acutely embarrassed by the whole business only knowledge of duty could have brought him he kept darting furious glances at his sisters who had presumably nagged him into coming they huddled together roundeyed like little animals woken from hibernation and longing to return home the only other person was virgil smith enormous in a heavy coat and bareheaded she could not help noticing how thick his hair was and how it had been cut level at the bottom of his ears really someone should find him a decent barber the vicar began to speak then became increasingly unhappy with what he was saying stopped and began again quite differently there was no other sound but the rain swirling in blusters and the far rattle of branches in the wind no one else spoke finally he became desperate and finished at a positive shout commit the body of our brotheraugustus albert william fitzroyhammondto the groundhe took a deep breath and his voice rose to a shriekuntil he come forth at the resurrection of the just when the earth yields up her dead and may the lord have mercy on his soul amen came the response with infinite relief they all turned and made with indecent haste for the shelter of the lychgate when they were crammed together underneath it the old lady suddenly made a startling announcement there will be a funeral breakfast for anyone who cares to come she issued it rather as a challenge a defiance to them to dare not to there was a moments silence then a murmur of thanks hastily they stepped out into the rain again and splashed through the water now running down the paths and climbed into their respective carriages sitting wrapped in wet clothes trouser legs and skirt hems sodden while the horses clopped back through the park on any other occasion they would have trotted but it would be unthinkable for one to hurry leaving a funeral back at home again alicia found the servants prepared to receive although she had given no such instructions once in the hall she caught nisbetts eye and saw in it a gleam of satisfaction it explained a great deal one day she would deal with nisbett that was a promise in the meantime she must force herself to behave as was expected of her the old lady might have invited them but she was the hostess because this had been augustuss house so now it was hers she welcomed them in and thanked them for coming ordered the footmen to bank up the fires and dry out as much clothing as possible and then led the way into the dining room where the cook had prepared an array of suitable dishes it was hardly the day for cold food even as rich as game pies and salmon but at least someone had thought to provide hot mulled wine she doubted it was the old lady probably milne the butler she must remember to thank him conversation was stilted no one knew what to say all the sympathies had already been expressed to say they were sorry yet again would be so jarring as to be offensive major rodney made some mumbled remark about the weather but since it was midwinter it was hardly a subject for surprise he began on some reminiscences about how many men had frozen to death on the heights sevastopol then trailed off into clearing his throat as everybody looked at him miss priscilla rodney commented on the excellence of the chutney that was served with one of the pies but blushed when verity thanked her because they both knew that priscilla made infinitely better herself it was not the cooks strength she was far more skilled with soups and sauces she always put too much pepper in pickles and they bit like a cornered rat lady cumminggould seemed satisfied merely to observe it was virgil smith who rescued them with the only viable conversation he was staring at a portrait of alicia over the fireplace a large rather formal study set against a brown background which did not flatter her it was one of a long succession of family portraits going back over two hundred years the old ladys hung in the hallway looking very young like a memory from a history book in an empire dress from the days just after napoleons fall i surely like that picture maam he said staring up at it its a good likeness but i guess it dont flatter you with that color behind it i sort of see you inside with all green and the like behind you trees and grass and maybe flowers you cannot expect alicia to trail out to some countryside to sit for a portrait the old lady snapped you may spend your days in the wilderness where you come from mr smith but we do not do so here i didnt exactly have the wilderness in mind maam he smiled at her completely ignoring her tone i was thinking more of a garden an english country garden with willow trees with all of those long lacy leaves blowing in the wind you cannot paint something blowing she said tartly i reckon a real good artist could he was not to be cowed or he could paint it so as you could feel as though it was have you ever tried to paint she glared at him it would have been more effective had she not been forced to stare upwards but she was nearly a foot shorter than he and even her voluminous bulk could not make up for the difference no maam he shook his head do you paint yourself of course her eyebrows shot up all ladies of good breeding paint a sudden thought flashed into his face did you paint that picture maam she froze to glacial rigidity certainly not we do not paint commercially mr smith she invested the idea with the same disgust she might have had he suggested she took in laundry all the same you knowsomerset carlisle eyed the picture criticallyi think virgil is right it would have been a great deal better against green that brown is quite muddy and deadens the complexion all the tones are spoiled the old lady looked from him to alicia then back at the picture her opinion of alicias complexion was plain no doubt he did the best he could she snapped miss mary ann joined in the conversation her voice lifting helpfully why dont you have it done again my dear i am sure in the summer it would be quite delightful to sit in the garden and have ones portrait painted you could ask mr jones i am told he is quite excellent he is expensive the old lady said witheringly that is not the same thing anyway if we get any more pictures done it ought to be of verity she turned to look at verity you probably are as goodlooking now as you will ever be some women improve a little as they get older but most dont she flashed a glance back at alicia then away again well see this man joneswhat is his name godolphin jones miss mary ann offered ridiculous the old lady muttered godolphin whatever was his father thinking of but i am not paying an exorbitant price i warn you you dont need to pay at all alicia finally responded i shall pay for it if verity would like a portrait and if she would prefer someone other than godolphin jones then we will get someone else the old lady was momentarily silenced godolphin jones seems to be away at the moment anyway vespasia observed i am informed he is in france it seems to be the obligatory thing for artists to do one can hardly call oneself an artist in society if one has not been to france gone away major rodney sputtered in his drink and sneezed for how long when is he due back vespasia looked a trifle surprised i have no idea you might try sending to his house if it is important to you although from what my own servants say they have no idea either being unreliable seems also to be part of the professional character oh no major rodney said hastily grabbing a game pastry and dropping it no not at all i was merely trying to be helpful he picked up the pasty again and it fell apart on the tablecloth virgil smith handed him a napkin and a plate then helped him scoop it up with a knife the old lady made a noise of disgust and turned to look the other way i suppose he is a competent artist she said loudly he fetches a very high price miss priscilla replied very high indeed i saw the portrait of gwendoline cantlay and she told me what she had paid for it i must say i thought it a great deal even for a good likeness and that is about all it is carlisles mouth turned down a good likeness it catches something of her character it would be hard for a likeness not to but it is not art one would not wish for it unless one was fond of gwendoline herself is that not the purpose of a portrait miss mary ann inquired innocently a portrait perhaps carlisle agreed but not of a painting a good painting should be a pleasure to anyone whether they know the subject or not overrated the old lady nodded and overpaid i shall not pay him that much if gwendoline cantlay did then she is a fool hester st jermyn paid something similar miss priscilla said with her mouth full and i do know dear hubert paid a good deal for the picture mr jones painted of us didnt you dear major rodney colored painfully and treated her to a look of something close to loathing ive seen the one of lady cantlay virgil smith screwed up his face i wouldnt buy it if it were on sale it seems kind ofheavyto me not like a lady should look what do you know about such things the old lady snapped derisively do you have ladies wherever it is you come from no maam i dont reckon you would call them ladies he said slowly but ive seen a few over here i think miss verity is surely a lady and deserves a portrait that says so verity blushed with pleasure and treated him to one of her rare smiles alicia found herself suddenly liking him very much in spite of his manners and his plain face thank you verity said quietly i think i shall like to have a portrait done in the summer if alicia does not mind of course not alicia agreed i shall make inquiries to find someone she was aware of virgil smith looking at her she was a handsome woman and she was used to admiration but there was something more personal in his gaze and she found it uncomfortable she wanted to break the silence and she rushed to find something to say she turned to vespasia lady cumminggould can you recommend anyone who might paint verity pleasingly you must have been painted many times yourself vespasia looked a trifle pleased not lately my dear but i will ask among my acquaintances if you wish i am sure you can do better than godolphin jones i believe he is very highly regarded by some or so the price he fetches would indicate but i agree with mr smith he is somewhat heavyhanded a little fleshy the old lady glared at her opened her mouth met vespasias unflinching stare and closed it again her eyes swept over virgil smith as if he had been an unpleasant stain on the carpet precisely carlisle said with satisfaction there is an abundance of portrait painters about just because godolphin lives in the park that is not a reason to patronize him if you prefer someone else gwendoline cantlay had two pictures done miss priscilla offered i cannot imagine why perhaps she likes them miss mary ann suggested some people must or they would not pay so very much money art is very much a matter of taste isnt it alicia looked from one to the other the old lady snorted naturally good tasteand bad taste only the vulgar who know no better judge anything as a matter of money once more her eyes darted to virgil smith and away again time is the thingwhatever has lasted that is worth something old paintings old houses old blood alicia felt embarrassed for him as if she were both receiving the hurt herself and at the same time responsible for it because the old lady was part of her family pure survival alone is hardly a mark of virtue she surprised herself by speaking so vehemently and with something that could only be regarded as insolence by the old lady but she wanted to contradict her so badly it was like a bursting in her head after all disease survives everyone was staring at her the old lady with a look as if her footstool had risen up and smitten her somerset carlisle was the first to react bravo he said cheerfully an excellent argument if somewhat eccentric im not sure godolphin would appreciate it but it just about sums up the relationship between art survival and price i dont understand miss priscilla squinted painfully i dont see the relationship at all that is precisely what i mean he agreed there is none the old lady banged her stick on the ground she had been aiming at carlisles foot and missed of course there is she snapped money is the root of all evil bible says so do you argue with that you misquote carlisle was not daunted and he did not move his feet what it says is that the love of money is the root of all evil things are not evil it is the passions they stir in people that may be a piece of sophistry she said with disgust and this is not the place for it go to your club if you have a taste for that kind of conversation this is a funeral breakfast i would oblige you to remember that he bowed very slightly indeed maam you have my sympathies he turned to alicia and verity and you also of course suddenly everyone remembered this was the third time they had attended such an affair and major rodney excused himself rather loudly in the awkwardness that followed he took his sisters by the arms and almost propelled them out into the hallway where the footman had to be sent for to bring their coats vespasia and carlisle followed virgil smith hesitated a moment by alicia if there is anything i can do maam he looked uncomfortable as if he wanted to say something and could not find the words she was aware of the kindness in him and it made her also feel a little clumsy she thanked him more hastily than she meant to and with a faint color in his face he followed the others out i see your mr corde didnt come the old lady said spitefully other fish to fry maybe alicia ignored her she did not know why dominic had sent no word no flowers or letter of sympathy it was something she did not want to think about on the morning of the interment dominic had been in two minds as to what to do he had got up and dressed intending to go as a support to alicia in a time which was bound to be extremely trying for her verity was too young and too vulnerable herself to afford much comfort and he knew the old lady would if anything make matters worse no one would find his attendance odd it was a mark of respect after all he had been invited to the original funeral then as he stared at himself in the mirror making the final adjustment to his appearance he remembered his visit to charlotte he had never been inside a house of working people before not something on a level with a tradesmans house like pitts all things considered it was odd how comfortable he had felt and how little charlotte had changed of course it would have been different if he had stayed there long but for that hour or so the surroundings had been unimportant but what charlotte had said was a totally different matter she had asked him if he thought alicia capable of murdering her husband in all but as many words charlotte had always been frank to the point of tactlessness he smiled even now to recall some of the more socially disastrous incidents the image smiled back at him from the mirror of course he denied italicia would never even think of such a thing old augustus had been a bore he talked endlessly and fancied himself an expert on the building of railways and since his family had made money in their construction perhaps he was but it was hardly a subject to pontificate on interminably over the dinner table dominic had never met a woman yet who cared in the slightest about railway construction and very few men but that does not move to murder actually to kill someone you have to care desperately over something whether it is hate fear greed or because they stand in the way between you and something you hunger forhe stopped his hand frozen on his collar he imagined being married to some sixtyyearold woman twice his age boring pompous with all her dreams in the past looking forward to nothing more than a sinking into slow verbose old agea relationship without love perhaps one day or one night the need to escape would become unbearable and if there were a bottle of medicine on the table what would be simpler than to dose a little too much how easy just to step it up a fraction each time until you got the amount that was not massive but just precisely enough to kill but alicia could never have done that he pictured her in his mind her fair skin the curve of her bosom the way her eyes lit up when she laughedor when she looked at him once or twice he had touched her more intimately than mere courtesy required and he felt the quick response there was a hunger underneath her modesty there was something about her perhaps a mannerism a way of holding her head that reminded him of charlotte he was not sure how it was indefinable and charlotte cared enough to kill that he was as sure of as his own reflection in the glass morality would stop herbut never indifference was it possible alicia really had killed augustusand the old lady knew it if that were so then he was bound up in it the catalyst for the motive slowly he undid the tie and took off the black coat if that were so and it could beit was not completely impossiblethen it would be better for everybody especially alicia if he did not go today the old lady would be waiting for it waiting to make some stinging remark even to accuse outright he would send flowerstomorrow something white and appropriate and then perhaps the day after he would call no one would find that odd he changed from the black trousers into a more usual morning gray he did send the flowers the next morning and was appalled at the price still as the icy wind outside reminded him it was the first day of february and there was hardly a thing in bloom the sun was shining fitfully and the puddles in the street were drying slowly a barrow boy whistled behind a load of cabbages today funerals and thoughts of death seemed far away freedom was a precious thing but every mans gift not something that needed fighting for he walked briskly round to his club and was settled behind his newspaper when a voice interrupted his half thought half sleep good morning dominic corde isnt it dominic had no desire for conversation gentlemen did not talk to one in the morning they knew better most especially if one had a newspaper he looked up slowly it was somerset carlisle he had met him only two or three times but he was not a man one forgot yes good morning mr carlisle he replied coolly he was lifting his paper again when carlisle sat down beside him and offered him his snuffbox dominic declined snuff always made him cough to sneeze was acceptable lots of people sneezed when taking snuff but to sit coughing with ones eyes running was merely clumsy no thank you carlisle put the snuff away again without taking any himself much pleasanter day isnt it he remarked much dominic agreed still holding onto the paper anything in the news carlisle inquired whats happening in parliament no idea dominic had never thought of reading about parliament government was necessary any sane man knew that but it was also intensely boring no idea at all carlisle looked as nonplussed as courtesy would allow thought you were a friend of lord fleetwood dominic was flattered friend was perhaps overstating it a little but he had met him lately and they had struck up an acquaintance they both liked riding and driving a team dominic had perhaps less courage than fleetwood but far more natural skill yes he identified guardedly because he was not sure why carlisle asked carlisle smiled sitting back in the chair easily and stretching his legs thought hed have talked politics with you he said casually could be quite a weight in the house if he wished got a following of young bloods dominic was surprised they had never discussed anything more serious than good horses and of course the occasional woman but come to think of it he had mentioned a number of friends who had hereditary titles whether they ever attended was quite another thing half the peers in england went nowhere nearer the house of lords than the closest club or party but fleetwood did have a large circle and it was not an exaggeration to say that dominic was now on the fringes of it carlisle was waiting no dominic replied horses mostly dont think he cares much about politics carlisles face flickered only very slightly dare say he doesnt realize the potential he raised his hand and signaled to one of the club servants and when the man arrived looked back at dominic do join me for luncheon they have a new chef who is quite excellent and i havent tried his specialty yet dominic had intended having a quiet meal a little later but the man was pleasant enough and he was a friend of alicias also of course an invitation should never be turned down without sound reason thank you he accepted good carlisle turned to the servant with a smile come for us when the chef is ready blunstone and get me some of that claret again same as last time the bordeaux was awful blunstone bowed and departed with murmurs of agreement carlisle allowed dominic to continue with his newspaper until luncheon was served then they repaired to the dining room and were halfway through a richly stuffed and roasted goose garnished with vegetables fruit and delicate sauce when carlisle spoke again what do you think of him he inquired eyebrows raised dominic had lost the thread fleetwood he asked carlisle smiled no the chef oh excellent dominic had his mouth full and found it hard to reply gracefully most excellent i must dine here more often yes its a very comfortable place carlisle agreed looking round at the wide room with its dark velvet curtains adam fireplaces on two sides with fires burning warmly in each there were gainesborough portraits on the blue walls it was something of an understatement it had taken dominic three years to get himself elected as a member and he disliked having his achievement taken so lightly rather more than comfortable i would have said his voice had a slight edge its all relative carlisle took another forkful of goose i dare say at windsor they dine better he swallowed and took a sip of wine then on the other hand there are thousands in the tenements and rookeries within a mile of here who find boiled rats a luxury dominic choked on his goose and gagged the room swum before him and for a moment he thought he was going to disgrace himself by being sick at the table it took him several seconds to compose himself wipe his mouth with his napkin and look up to meet carlisles curious eyes he could not think what to say to him the man was preposterous sorry carlisle said lightly shouldnt spoil a good meal by talking politics he smiled dominic was completely unguarded ppolitics he stammered most distasteful carlisle agreed much pleasanter to talk about horseracing or fashion i see your friend fleetwood has adopted that new cut of jacket rather flattering dont you think i shall have to see if i can get my tailor to do something of the sort what in hell are you talking about dominic demanded you said rats i heard you perhaps i should have said workhouses carlisle chose the words carefully or pauperchildren laws so difficult to know what to do whole family in the workhouse children in with the idle or vagrant no education work from waking to sleepingbut better than starvation which is the alternative or freezing to death have you seen the sort of people that get into the workhouses imagine how they affect a child of four or five years old seen the disease the ventilation the food dominic remembered his own childhood a nurse recalled only hazily mixed in his mind with his mother a governess then schoolwith long summer holidays rice pudding which he loathed and afternoon teas with jam especially raspberry jam he remembered songs round the piano making snowballs playing cricket in the sun stealing plums breaking windows and receiving canings for insolence thats ridiculous he said sharply workhouses are supposed to be temporary relief for those who cannot find legitimate work for themselves it is a charitable charge on the parish oh very charitable carlisles eyes were very bright watching dominics face children of three or four years old in with the flotsam of society learning hopelessness from the cradle onwards those that dont die of disease from rotten food poor ventilation cross infection well it should be stopped dominic said flatly clean the places up of course carlisle agreed but then what if they dont go to schools of some sort they never learn even to read or write how can they ever get out of the circle of vagrant to workhouse and back again what can they do sweep crossings summer and winter walk the streets as long as their looks last and then turn to the sweatshops do you know how much a seamstress earns for sewing a shirt seams cuffs collars buttonholes and four rows of stitching down the front all complete dominic thought of the prices of his own shirts two shillings he hazarded a guess a little on the mean side but then carlisle had suggested as much how extravagant carlisle said bitterly she would have to sew ten for that but how do they live the goose was going cold on dominics plate carlisle turned his hands up most of them are prostitutes at night to feed their children and then when the children are old enough they work as wellor else it is all back to the workhouse and theres your cycle again but what about their husbands some of them have husbands surely dominic was still looking for rationality something sane to explain it oh yes some of them do said carlisle but its cheaper to employ a woman than a man you dont have to pay her much so the men dont get the work thats dominic searched for a word and failed to find one he sat staring at carlisle over the congealing goose politics carlisle murmured picking up his fork again and education how can you eat that dominic demanded it was repulsive to him now an indecency if what carlisle said was true carlisle put it into his mouth and spoke round it because if i were not to eat every time i think of sweated labor uneducated children the indigent sick filthy or destitute i should never eat at alland what purpose would that serve parliament i ran for it once and failed my ideas were remarkably unpopular with those who have the vote sweated labor doesnt vote you knowfemale mostly too young and too poor now i have to try the back door house of lords people like st jermyn with his bill and your friend fleetwood they dont give a damn about the poor probably never really seen any but an eye to a causegreat thing a cause dominic pushed his plate away if this were true not a piece of melodramatic luncheon conversation designed to shock then something ought to be done by people like fleetwood carlisle was perfectly right he drank the end of the wine and was glad of its clean bite he needed to wash his mouth out after the taste that had been on his tongue he wished to god he had never seen somerset carlisle the man was uncouth to invite him to a meal and then discuss such things they were thoughts that were impossible to get rid of pitts superiors had meantime directed his attention to a case of embezzlement in a local firm and he was returning to the police station after a day of questioning clerks and reading endless files he did not understand when he was met at the door by a wideeyed constable pitt was cold and tired and his feet were wet all he wanted was to go home and eat something hot then sit by the fire with charlotte and talk about anything as long as it was removed from crime what is it he said wearily the man was practically wringing his hands with anxiety and pentup apprehension its happened again he said hoarsely pitt knew but he put off the moment what has corpses sir theres been another corpse i mean one dug up like not a new one pitt shut his eyes where in the park sir st bartholomews green sir not really a park just a stretch o longish grass with a few trees and a couple o seats found on one o the seats e was sitting up there like jackie bold as you likebut dead o course stone dead and as been for a while id say what does he look like pitt asked the constable screwed up his face orrible sir downright orrible naturally pitt snapped his patience was worn thin to transparency but was he young or old tall or short come on man youre a policeman not a penny novelist what kind of a description is orrible the constable blushed crimson e was tall and corpulent sir with black air and black whiskers sir and e was dressed in an andmedown sort o coat didnt fit im none too good not like a gentlemans would sir thank you pitt said ungraciously where is he in the morgue sir pitt turned on his heel and went out again he walked the few blocks to the morgue head bent against the rain mind turning over furiously every conceivable answer to the disgusting and apparently pointless happenings who on earth was going around digging up random corpsesand above all why when he reached the morgue the assistant was as buoyant as ever in spite of a streaming cold he led pitt over to the table and whipped off the cloth with the air of a musclehall magician producing a clutch of rabbits as the constable had said the corpse was a robust middleaged man with black hair and whiskers pitt grunted mr william wilberforce porteous i presume he said irritably there was nothing for pitt to do but go home and after thanking the attendant he turned and went back out into the rain it took him half an hours steady walking before he at last rounded the corner into his own street and five minutes later was sitting in front of the stove in the kitchen the fender open to let out the heat his trousers rolled up and his feet in a basin of hot water charlotte was standing next to him with a towel youre soaking she said exasperatedly you must get a new pair of boots where on earth have you been the morgue he moved his toes slowly in the water letting the ecstasy ripple through him it was hot and tingling and it eased out the numbness with a caress almost like pain they found another corpse she stared at him the towel hanging from her hands you mean one that had been dug up again she said incredulously yes dead three or four weeks i should say oh thomas her eyes were dark and horrified what sort of person digs up the dead and leaves them sitting on cabs and in churches why there isnt any sanity in it her face suddenly went white as a new thought occurred to her oh you dont think it could be different people do you i mean if lord augustus was murdered or someone thinks he was and they dug him up to bring your attention to itthen whoever killed him or fears to be suspected of it digs up these other people they dont even know to obscure the real murder he looked at her slowly the hot water forgotten you know what you are saying he asked watching her face that means dominic or alicia or both of them for several moments she said nothing she handed him the towel and he dried his feet then she took the basin and poured the water away down the sink i dont think i believe that she said with her back still toward him there was no distress in her voice that he could hear just doubt and a little surprise you mean dominic wouldnt commit murder he asked he tried to make it impersonal but the edge was still there sharp with old fears i dont think so she wiped round the basin and put it away but even if he did kill someone im pretty sure he wouldnt think to dig up other corpses and leave them around to hide it not unless he has changed more than i think people do maybe alicia changed him he suggested but he did not believe that himself he waited for her to say it could have been alicia with someone else she had money enough to pay but charlotte said nothing they found him in the park he held out his hand for his dry socks and she passed them off the airing rack then winched it back up to the ceiling sitting on a bench he added i think from the description it is the body from the grave that was robbed last week mr w w porteous does he have anything to do with dominic and alicia or anyone in gadstone park she asked going back to the stove would you like some soup before your dinner she lifted the lid and the delicate odor of the steam caught his nostrils yes please he said immediately what is for dinner meat and kidney pudding she took a dish and a ladle and gave him a generous portion of soup full of leeks and barley mind its very hot he smiled up at her and took it balancing it on his knee she was right it was very hot he put a tea towel under it to protect himself nothing at all as far as i know he replied where did he live she sat down again opposite him and waited for him to finish the soup before getting out the pie and vegetables it had taken her awhile to learn how to cook economically and well and she liked to watch the results of her efforts just off resurrection row he replied holding up the spoon she frowned puzzled i thought that was rather aa shabby area it is worn down and a little seedy there are at least two brothels that i know of all discreetly covered up but thats definitely what they are and theres a pawnshop where we have found rather more than the usual number of stolen goods well that cant have anything to do with dominic and certainly not alicia charlotte said with conviction dominic might have been to such a place even gentlemen get up to the oddest things especially gentlemen pitt put in she let the jibe pass but alicia would never even have heard of it wouldnt she he was genuinely not sure she looked at him patiently and for a moment they were both aware of the social gulf between their backgrounds no she shook her head minutely women whose parents have social pretensions real or imaginary are far more protectedeven imprisonedthan you know papa never allowed me to read a newspaper i used to sneak them from the butlers pantry but emily and sarah didnt papa considered anything controversial or in the least scandalous or distressing to be unsuitable for young ladies to knowand one should never mention them in discussion i know that he started you think he was unusual she shook her head again harder but he wasnt he was no stricter or more protective than anyone else women can know about illness childbirth death boredom or loneliness but not anything that could be argued aboutreal poverty endemic disease or crimeand most of allnot about sex nothing disturbing must be considered especially if one might feel moved to question it or try to change it he looked at her with surprise he was seeing a side of her thoughts he had never recognized before i didnt know you were so bitter about it he said slowly reaching out to put the soup dish on the table arent you she challenged do you know how many times you come home and tell me about tragedy youve seen that need never happened youve taught me at least to know there are rookeries behind the smart streets where people die of starvation and cold where there is filth everywhere and rats and disease where children learn to steal to survive as soon as they can walk ive never been there but i know they exist and i can smell them on your clothes when you come back in the evening there is no other smell like it he thought of alicia in her silks and innocence charlotte had been like that when he met her im sorry he said quietly she opened the door with a cloth and took out the pudding dont be she said sharply im a woman not a child and i can stand knowing just as well as you can what are you going to do about this mr porteous she took a knife and cut into the pudding the thick suet crust was brown and the gravy bubbled through it when she took out a slice rookeries or no rookeries he was hungry at the smell of it make sure he is porteous he replied then i suppose see what he died of and who knows anything about him she dished up the carrots and cabbage if that corpse is mr porteous then who is the first corpse the one from the cab ive no idea he sighed and took his plate from her he could be anybody in the morning pitt turned his attention to the unidentified corpse there would be no solution to the whole business that did not include him at least his name and the manner of his death perhaps he was the one who had been murdered and lord augustus was the blind the diversion or conceivably they had been involved in something together but what venture could possibly include lord augustus fitzroyhammond and mr william wilberforce porteous from resurrection rowand lead to murder what about the man in the cab and who was the other party to it the one who dug them all up the first step was to discover the precise manner of death of the corpse from the cab if it had been murder or could have been then that shed a totally new light on the disinterment of lord augustus if on the other hand it had been natural then since he had been burned was it a lawful burial in a graveyard where was the empty grave and why had it not been reported presumably it had been filled in again and left to appear like any other new grave but normal deaths are certified by a doctor once the nature of death was known then the investigation could begin of all recorded deaths from that cause over the period in time they would narrow it down the correct one would be found they would have a name a character a history as soon as he reached the police station he called his sergeant to take over the matter of the embezzlement and went upstairs to request permission for a postmortem on the unidentified corpse no one demurred since it was not lord augustus after all and no one else had come forward to claim him in the circumstances murder must be considered permission was granted immediately next was the rather unpleasant job of making sure that the new corpse in the morgue was indeed w w porteous although he had little doubt about it he put on his hat and coat again and went outside into the intermittent drizzle and took an omnibus to resurrection row he walked a hundred yards turned to the right and looked for number ten where mrs porteous lived it was one of the larger houses a little faded on the outside but with prim white curtains at the windows and a whitened step he pulled the bell and stood back yes a stout girl in black stuff dress and starched apron opened the door and stared at him inquiringly is mrs porteous in pitt asked i have information regarding her late husband he knew that if he said he was from the police the servants would have it all over the street within the day and it would grow in scandal with each retelling the girls mouth fell open oh oh yes sir youd better come in if you wait in the parlor ill tell mrs porteous youre here sir what name shall i say mr pitt yes sir and she disappeared to inform her mistress pitt sat down the room was crammed with furniture photographs ornaments an embroidered sampler saying fear god and do your duty three stuffed birds a stuffed weasel under glass an arrangement of dried flowers and two large shining green potted plants he felt intensely claustrophobic it gave him the rather hysterical feeling that it was all alive and when he was not looking creeping closer and closer to him hungry and defensive against an alien in their territory eventually he preferred to stand the door opened and mrs porteous came in as robustly corseted as before her hair perfect her cheeks rouged her bosom was decorated with rows and rows of jet beads good morning mr pitt she said anxiously my maid says you have some news about mr porteous yes maam i think we have found him he is in the morgue and if you would be good enough to come and identify him we can be sure and then in due course we can have him reinterred i cant have a second funeral she said in alarm it wouldnt be proper no naturally he agreed just an interment but first let us be sure it is indeed your husband she called for the maid to fetch her coat and hat and followed pitt outside into the street it was still raining lightly and in resurrection row they hailed a hansom and rode in silence to the morgue pitt was beginning to feel an antiseptic familiarity with the place the attendant still had a cold and his nose was now bright pink but he greeted them with a smile as wide as decorum before a widow allowed mrs porteous looked at the corpse and did not require either the chair or the glass of water yes she said calmly that is mr porteous thank you maam i have some questions i must ask you but perhaps you would prefer to discuss them in a more comfortable place would you like to go home the cab is still waiting if you please she accepted then without looking at the attendant she turned and waited for pitt to open the door for her outside into the rain preceded him down the path and back into the cab again seated in the parlor of her own house she ordered hot tea from the maid and faced pitt hands folded in her lap jet beads glistening in the lamplight on a day as dark as this it was impossible to see clearly inside without the lamps lit well mr pitt what is it you wish to ask me that is mr porteous what else is there to know how did he die maam in his bed naturally from what cause maam he tried to make it clear without being offensive or distressing her more than was necessary her remarkable bearing might well hide deep emotion underneath a complaint of digestion no doubt it had a name but i do not know it he had been ill for some time i see im sorry who was his doctor her arched eyebrows rose dr hall but i cannot see why you wish to know surely you do not suspect dr hall of violating the grave no of course not he did not know how to explain that he was questioning the cause of death obviously the whole train of thought had not occurred to her it is just that in order to find who did we need all the information possible do you expect to find out she was still perfectly composed no he admitted frankly meeting her eyes with something like a smile there was no answer in her face and he looked away feeling a little foolish but it is not the only case he went on in a more businesslike tone and anything they have in common might help not the only case she was startled now you mean you think mr porteouss grave robbing is connected to those others everyone is talking about you ought to be ashamed allowing such things to happen here in london to respectable people why arent you doing your job i should like to know i dont know whether there is a connection maam he said patiently that is what i am trying to establish its a lunatic she said firmly and if the police cant catch a lunatic i dont know what the world is coming to mr porteous was a very respectable man never mixed with fast society every penny he had was earned and he never put a wager in his life perhaps there is no connection apart from the time he died pitt said wearily lord augustus was a respectable man too thats as may be she said darkly they didnt find mr porteous in that gadstone park did they no maam he was sitting on a bench in st bartholomews green her face paled nonsense she said sharply mr porteous would never be in such a place i cannot believe it you know what kind of people frequent it you must be mistaken he did not bother to argue if it mattered to her to cling onto the distinction even after death then allow her to it was a curious divergence he remembered the rather worn clothes with the corpse he had been buried very much in his second best perhaps at the last moment she had felt the best black all such men kept for sundays to be too good to consign to the oblivion of the tomb at least at that time she would expect it to be oblivion he stood up thank you maam if i need to ask anything else i shall call on you i shall make arrangements to have mr porteous put away again she rang the bell for the maid to show him out not yet maam he wanted to apologize because he knew the outrage before it came im afraid we shall have to do some more investigation before we can allow that her face mottled with horror and she half rose in her chair first you allow his grave to be desecrated and his body to be left in a park where publicwomenoffer themselves and now you want to investigate him it is monstrous decent people are no longer safe in this city you are a disgrace to your she had wanted to say uniform then she looked at pitts jumble of colorshat still dripping in his hands muffler end trailing down his frontand gave up you are a disgrace she finished lamely im sorry he was apologizing not for himself but for the whole city for the entire order that had left her with nothing but need and the trimmings of being respectable he spoke to the doctor and discovered that porteous had died of cirrhosis of the liver and had most assuredly visited the benches of st bartholomews green before some grotesque chance had placed his corpse under its shade to be solicited by a prostitute to whom even the dead were no horror or surprise he left wondering what had been the stuff of lives that ended like this what failures what bolsteredup loneliness what constant small retreats dominic put somerset carlisle and the disgraceful luncheon from his mind he was looking forward to seeing alicia again the reinterment was over and from now on provided decent mourning was observed at least outwardly they could begin to think of the future he would not wish to offend her sensibilities by speaking too quickly or cause her any embarrassment but he could certainly call to pay his respects and spend a little time in her company and in a few weeks she could afford to be seen out not at theatres or parties but at church with the family or during a carriage ride to take the air he did not mind if verity came also for appearances in fact he liked her very well for her own sake she was easy to talk to once she felt comfortable with him and although she was modest she had her own opinions and quite a dry sense of humor with which to express them altogether he was feeling in a very pleasant mood when he arrived at gadstone park on thursday morning and presented his card to the maid alicia received him with delight almost relief and they spent a totally happy hour talking trivialities and meaning everything else just to be in each others company was sufficient what was said was immaterial augustus was forgotten empty graves and wandering corpses did not even stray into their minds he left a little before luncheon walking briskly back across the park coat collar turned up against the north wind finding it exciting and sharpening rather than bitter he saw a figure coming the other way there was something familiar about the step the rather lean shoulders that made him hesitate even consider for a moment taking a sidecut across the grass even though it was rough and wet but he was not even sure who the person was it was far too tidy for pitt too elegant and not quite tall enough pitts coat always flapped and his hat sat at a different angle on his head it was not until he was close enough to see the face too close courteously to go another way that he recognized somerset carlisle good morning he said without slackening his stride he had no wish whatever to speak with the man carlisle stood in his path good morning he said then turned and fell in step beside him short of being appallingly rude there was nothing dominic could do but make some attempt at conversation pleasant weather he remarked at least this wind should keep the fog away good day for a walk carlisle agreed gets one an appetite for luncheon quite dominic replied really the man was a confounded nuisance he seemed to have no idea when he was intruding and dominic had no desire to be reminded of their previous meal together nice leisurely meal by a good fire carlisle went on i should thoroughly enjoy a soup something savory and delicate there was no way to avoid it dominic owed the man a meal and obligations must be honored if one wished to remain in society such a gaffe would quickly be remarked and word spread like fire an excellent idea he said with as much heart as he could muster and perhaps a saddle of mutton to follow my club is not far and i should be delighted if you would consent to dine with me carlisle smiled broadly and dominic had an uncomfortable feeling he saw something funny in the affair thank you he said easily i should enjoy that the meal fulfilled none of dominics fears in fact it was extremely pleasant carlisle did not mention politics at all and proved an agreeable companion talking neither too little nor too much when he did speak he was cheerful and occasionally witty dominic thoroughly enjoyed it and determined to repeat it as soon as opportunity arose he was thinking along these lines when he found himself outside again where the wind was sharper and beginning to carry a fine rain carlisle hailed a cab immediately and to dominics astonishment fifteen minutes later he was deposited in a filthy back street where precarious houses huddled together like a lot of drunken men supporting each other before the final collapse where in gods name are we he demanded alarmed and confused the street was swarming with children noses running clothes dirty women sat in areaways hands blue with cold presiding over rows of wornlooking shoes and light glimmered from belowstreet rooms the whole air was pervaded with a stale sour smell he could not identify but it clung to the back of the nose and he seemed to swallow it with every breath where are we he said again with mounting fury seven dials carlisle replied dudley street to be precise those people are secondhand shoe sellers down therehe pointed to the rooms below pavement level they take old shoes or stolen ones remake them out of the bits that are worth saving and then sell the botchedup results in other places they do the same with clothes unpick them and use whatever fabric is still good for a little while longer someone elses remade wool is better than new cotton which is all they could buy no warmth in cotton dominic shivered it was perishing out in this ghastly street and he was white with rage at carlisle for having brought him here either carlisle was oblivious to it or he simply did not care call back that cab dominic snarled you had no right to bring me here this place is he was lost for words he stared around him appalled at it the weight of the buildings seemed to overpower him the squalor was everywhere and the smell of dirt old clothes grime of soot and oil lamps unwashed bodies yesterdays cooking on top of the roast it was almost too much for his stomach a preview of hell carlisle said quietly dont speak so loudly these people live here this is their home i dare say they dont like it any more than you do but its what they have show your disgust and you may not get out of here as immaculately as you came inin any sense and this is only a foretaste you should see bluegate fields down by the docks or limehouse whitechapel st giles walk with me weve got about three hundred yards to go along that way he pointed down a side street over the square at the end of that is the local workhouse thats what i want you to see this is only incidental then perhaps the devils acre below westminster dominic opened his mouth to say he wanted to leave then saw the childrens faces gaping up at him young bodies young skins and eyes as old as the roues he had seen with the prostitutes in the night houses of the haymarket it was the weary avariciousness in them that frightened him more than anything else that and the smell he saw one urchin chased by another in play pass close to carlisle and in a movement as smooth as a weasel extract his silk handkerchief from his pocket and move on carlisle i know carlisle said quietly dont make a fuss just follow me and he moved almost casually over the street onto the pavement on the other side then down the alleyway at the far side of the square beyond he stopped at the large blind wooden door and knocked it was opened by a stout man in a green frock coat the sour expression on his face changed to one of alarm but before he could speak carlisle stepped inside forcing him back morning mr eades comes to see how you are today well thank you yes very well sir eades said defensively you are too kind sir you pay too much attention im sure your time is valuable sir very carlisle agreed so dont let us waste it any of your children gone to the schools since the last time i was here oh yes as many as we had at the time of intake sir you may be sure and how many is that ah well now i dont have the precise figures to my mind you must recall people come and go here as the necessity finds them if they are not here on the day of intake which you must know is only once a fortnight then naturally they dont go i know that as well as you do carlisle said tartly i also know they check out the day before the intake and back in again the day after now sir that aint my fault i know it isnt carlisles voice was raw with anger at his own impotence he strode past eades and down the airless dank corridor to the great hall and dominic was obliged to follow him or be left alone in the stone passage his flesh standing out with cold the room was large and low gaslit one stove burned in the corner about fifty or sixty men women and children sat unpicking old clothes sorting the rags and cutting and piecing them together again the air was so fetid it caught in dominics throat and he had to concentrate to prevent himself from vomiting carlisle seemed to be used to it he stepped over the rags and approached one of the women hello bessie he said cheerfully how are you today the woman smiled showing blackened teeth and mumbled something in reply she had a large shambling figure and dominic would have judged her to be about fifty he did not understand a word of her speech carlisle led him on a few yards to where half a dozen children sat unpicking old trousers some of them no more than three or four years old three of these are bessies he looked at them they used to work at home before putting the new railway through caused the slum clearance and the house their room was in was demolished her husband and older children made match boxes at tuppence ha penny for a hundred and fortyfour and out of that they found their own twine and paste bessie herself worked in the bryant and mays match factory thats why she speaks so oddlyphossy jawa necrosis of the jaw caused by the phosphorus in the matches shes three years older than alicia fitzroyhammondyou wouldnt think it would you it was too much dominic was bewildered and appalled i want to get out of here he said quietly so do we all carlisle embraced the room in a gesture do you know third of london lives no better than this either in the rookeries or the workhouses what can anybody do dominic said helplessly itsits sovast carlisle spoke to one or two more people then he led dominic back out into the square again bidding mr eades a tart farewell on the doorstep after the thick air inside even the gray drizzle seemed cleaner change some of the laws carlisle replied the meanest ledger clerk who can write or add is a prince compared with these get pauper children educated and apprenticed theres little you can do for their parents except charity but we can try for the children possibly dominic had to walk sharply to keep up with him but what is the point in showing me i cant change laws carlisle stopped he passed a few pence to a child begging and saw him immediately hand them over to an old man fancy sending your grandchild out to beg for you dominic muttered hes more likely no relation carlisle kept on walking he probably bought the child children make better beggars especially if they are blind or deformed some women even cripple them on purpose gives them a better chance of survival to answer your question you can talk to people like lord fleetwood and his friends persuade them to go to the house and vote dominic was horrified i cant tell them about this sort of thing theyd he realized what he was saying yes carlisle agreed they would be disgusted and offended most distasteful not the sort of subject a gentleman embarrasses others with i think i rather spoiled your luncheon the other day you dont get the same pleasure out of roast goose when you think about something like this do you and yet how far do you think it is from gadstone park church pews to seven dials they turned the corner into another street and saw a cab at the far end carlisle increased his pace and dominic had almost to trot to keep up with him but if i can court a coldblooded sod like st jermyn carlisle continued to get a bill introduced i think you can manage a little discomfort with fleetwood cant you dominic spent a wretched evening and woke the next morning feeling no better he told his valet to have all his clothes cleaned and if the smell would not come out then to give them away to whosoever would take them but nothing so simple would get rid of the pictures from his mind part of him hated carlisle for obliging him to see things he would much rather not ever have known of of course he had always appreciated in his head that there was poverty but he had never actually seen it before one did not really see the faces of beggars in the streets they were simply faces therelike lamp posts or railings one was always about some business of ones own and too occupied to think of them but worse than the sight was the taste of it in his mouth the smell that stayed at the back of the throat and tainted everything he ate perhaps it was guilt he had arranged to take alicia on an errand she had some little distance away and he had taken a carriage for the occasion he called for her at a quarterpast ten and she was ready waiting for him although of course she did not allow it to be obvious in fact might even have imagined he did not see it possibly she forgot he had been married and was acquainted with at least some of womens habits she was dressed in black and looked particularly fine her hair bright and her skin flawless with the delicacy of alabaster everything about her was impeccably clean it was impossible to equate her in any way with the woman in the workhouse she had been talking to him and he was not listening dominic she said again are you unwell he needed to share the turmoil inside him indeed he could not keep his mind upon anything else i met your friend carlisle yesterday he said harshly she looked surprised surely at his tone rather than the information somerset how was he we had luncheon together then he tricked me into going with him into the most awful place i have ever seen in my life i have never imagined anything so wretched im sorry her voice was full of concern were you hurt are you sure you are well now i can easily put off this call it is not urgent no i wasnt hurt his voice was uglier than he meant it to be but it would not stay in his control confusion and anger were boiling up inside him he wanted someone to explain it away to give back the ignorance that had been so much easier she obviously did not understand she had never seen a workhouse in her life she had never been permitted to read newspapers and she did not handle money the housekeeper kept the accounts and her husband had paid the bills the nearest she had ever come to poverty was a restriction in her dress allowance when her father had suffered a reverse in his investments he wanted to explain what he had seen and above all how he felt about it but the only words for it were unseemly and anyway they described things that were completely beyond anything she could imagine he gave it up and sank into silence after they returned from the visit he dropped her off at gadstone park and then feeling miserable and dissatisfied he sent the carriage away and sat in front of his own fire for an hour finally he got up again and called a hansom charlotte had put the matter of the corpses from her mind indeed she had far too much of her own to do to interest herself in most of pitts cases and the identity of a corpse that had so far as anyone knew died quite naturally was not of concern to her jemima had sat in a puddle and required a complete change of clothing she was now busy with a larger laundry then usual and ironing was not quite one of her favorite chores she was startled when the doorbell rang because she was not expecting anyone people seldom called in the middle of the day they all had their own duties and meals to prepare she was even more surprised when she saw dominic standing on the step may i come in he asked before she had time to speak she opened the door wider yes of course whats wrong you look she wanted to say miserable but decided unwell would be more tactful he passed her into the hall and she closed the door and led the way to the kitchen again jemima was building bricks in her playpen in the corner dominic sat down on the wooden chair in front of the table the room was warm and the washed wood smelled good there were sheets hanging from the airing rail on the ceiling and he looked with curiosity at the rope and pulleys for hauling it up and down the flatiron was warming on the stove ive interrupted you he said without moving no you havent she smiled and picked up the iron to continue whats the matter he was irritated with himself for being so transparent she was treating him like a child but at the moment he wanted the reassurance enough to shelve the resentment a man called carlisle took me to see a workhouse yesterday somewhere in seven dials there were fifty or sixty people in one room all unpicking clothes to remake them even children it was foul she remembered the anger she had felt when pitt had first told her about the slums and tenements when she lived in cater street and thought herself terribly knowledgeable because she looked at the newspapers she had been shocked angry that she had not known before and angry most of all with pitt because he had know all the time and had chosen to disturb her world with ugliness and other peoples pain there was nothing comforting to say she went on ironing the shirt it is she agreed but why did he take youthis mr carlisle the reason was at once the best and the worst side to it because he wants me to speak to a friend of mine in the house of lords and see if i can influence him to be there when st jermyns bill is put up she remembered what aunt vespasia had said and it was immediately understandable and are you going to for heavens sake charlotte he said exasperatedly how on earth do you go up to a fellow you only know because of racing horses and things and say to him by the way id like you to take your seat in the house when they put up st jermyns bill because the workhouses really are awful and the children need educating you know there ought to be a law to support and educate pauper children in london so be a good chap and get all your friends to vote for it its impossible i cant do it thats a pity she did not look up from her ironing she was sorry for him she knew how nearly impossible it was to engage people in thoughts they do not like especially those that make them uncomfortable and threaten their pleasures by questioning the order of things but she was not going to tell him he had no obligation or that it was up to someone else not that he was likely to have accepted it if she had he had seen and smelled the streets of seven dials and no words would wipe out that memory a pity he said furiously a pity is that all you can say has thomas ever told you what those places are like its indescribableyou can taste the filth and despair i know she said calmly and there are worse places than workhouses places inside the rookeries that even thomas wont describe hes told you something not all he screwed his face up and stared down at the white wood of the table its awful would you like some luncheon she folded the shirt and put it away then folded the ironing board also im going to have some its just bread and soup but you are welcome if you wish suddenly the gulf opened and he realized he had been speaking to her as if they were both still in cater street with the same material possessions he had forgotten his world was as different now from hers as hers was from seven dials he was momentarily embarrassed for his clumsiness he watched her as she took two clean plates out of the cupboard and set them on the table then the bread out of the bin a board and a knife there was no butter yes please he answered yes i would she took the lid off the stockpot on the stove and ladled out enough to fill the two plates what about jemima he asked she sat down shes had hers what are you going to do about mr carlisle he ignored the question he knew what the answer would be but he did not want to admit it yet i tried to tell alicia about it he took a mouthful of the soup it was surprisingly good and the bread was fresh and crusty he had not known charlotte could make bread stillshe must have had to learn that was unfair she looked at him steadily you cant tell people in words and expect them to understand or feel the way you do noshe didnt she brushed it aside as so much conversation she seemed like a stranger and i thought i knew her so well thats not fair either she said its you who have changed what do you suppose mr carlisle thought of you what were you very impressed by what he said didnt he have to take you to seven dials to see it for yourself yes but thats he stopped remembering his reluctance disinterest but he was nothing to carlisle whereas he and alicia loved each other thats different charlotte raised eyebrows its not caring for someone doesnt alter it knowing might straightaway she was sorry for saying it enchantment was such an ephemeral thing and familiarity had so little to do with it dont blame her she said quietly why should she know about it or understand no reason he admitted and yet he felt a void between himself and alicia and realized how much of his feeling for her depended on the color of her hair the curve of her cheek a smile and the fact that she responded to him but what was inside her in the part he could not reach could there be even the simple removal of an object that stood between her and what she wanted a little movement of the hand with a bottle of pillsand murder at the top of resurrection row was a cemetery hence its name a tiny chapel stood in the center in a wealthier area it would have been a crypt or family tomb but here it was only the pretension to one marble angels perched on a few of the better tombstones here and there there was a distant cross but most of them rose bare and a little crooked with age subsidence in the earth from frequent digging caused them to lean askew and half a dozen skeletal trees had not been removed it was an unlovely place at any time and on a damp february evening it boasted only one virtue privacy for a seventeenyearold maid of all work like dollie jenkins who was in the process of courting a butchers boy with excellent prospects it was the only place in which she could give him just sufficient encouragement without losing her employment arm in arm they walked in through the gates whispering together giggling under their breath it was hardly decent to laugh out loud in the presence of the dead after a little while they sat down close together on one of the tombstones she allowed it to be known that she would not resent a little show of affection and he responded enthusiastically after some fifteen minutes she felt the situation was getting out of hand and he might well end up taking liberties and afterwards think the worse of her for it she pushed him away and saw to her consternation a figure sitting perched on one of the other gravestones knees crossed high stovepipe hat askew ere samuel she hissed theres an old geezer sittin over there spyin on us samuel got to his feet in awkward haste dirty old goat he said loudly go on get away wiv yer peepin tom afore i thump yer the figure did not move indeed he ignored samuel completely not even raising his head samuel strode over to him ill teach yer he shouted ill box your ears for yer right proper go on get out of ere yer dirty old toad he seized the man by the shoulder and made as if to swing his fist at him to his horror the man swayed and toppled over sideways his hat rolling onto the ground his face was blue in the faint moonlight and his chest was a most peculiar flat shape oh god almighty samuel dropped him and leapt away falling over his own feet he scrambled up again and backed toward dollie clutching onto her what is it she demanded what ave you done i aint done nuffin es dead dolles as dead as anybody in ere somebodys gorn an dug im up the news was conveyed to pitt the following morning youll never believe it the constable said his voice squeaking up to top c tell me anyway pitt was resigned theyve found another one courting couple found him last night why shouldnt i believe it pitt said wearily id believe anything because it was horrie snipe the constable burst out as i live and breathe it wassitting up on a gravestone in resurrection cemetery in his old stovepipe hat he was run over three weeks ago by a muck cart and buried a fortnightand there e was sitting on a tombstone all by isself in the moonlight youre right pitt said i dont believe it i dont want to believe it its im sir id know horrie snipe anywhere he was the busiest procurer the row ever had so it seems pitt said drily but for this morning i still refuse to believe it on monday charlotte received a handwritten note from aunt vespasia inviting her to call that morning and be prepared to stay for some little while in fact over luncheon and into the afternoon no reason was given but charlotte knew aunt vespasia far too well to imagine it was idle a request at such short notice and stating such a specific time and duration was not casual charlotte could not possibly ignore it apart from good manners curiosity made it absolutely imperative she go accordingly she took jemima over the street to mrs smith who was always more than willing to tend her with great affection in return for a little gossip as to the dress manners and especially foibles of the society that charlotte kept her own resulting importance in the street as charlottes confidante was immeasurable she was also quite genuinely a kind woman and enjoyed helping especially a young woman like charlotte who was obviously ill prepared by her own upbringing to cope with the realities of life such as mrs smith knew them having been rather rash with the housekeeping in buying bacon three days in a row instead of making do with oatmeal or fish as usual charlotte was obliged to catch the omnibus to its nearest point to gadstone park instead of hiring a hansom and then walk in rising sleet the rest of the way she arrived on the doorstep with wet feet and she feared a very red nose not in the least the elegant image she would wish to have presented so much for bacon for breakfast the maid who answered was too sensitive to her mistresss own eccentricities to allow her thoughts to be mirrored in her face she was becoming inured to any kind of surprise she moved charlotte into the morning room and left her standing as near to the fire as she dared without risking actually setting herself alight the heat was marvelous it brought life back into her numb ankles and she could see the steam rising from her boots aunt vespasia appeared after only a few moments she glanced at charlotte then took out her lorgnette good gracious girl you look as if you came by sea whatever have you done it is extremely cold outside charlotte attempted to explain herself she moved a little forward from the fire it was beginning to sting with its heat and the street is full of puddles you appear to have stepped in every one of them vespasia looked down at her steaming feet she was tactful enough not to ask why she had walked in the first place i shall have to find something dry for you if you are to be in the least comfortable she reached out for the bell and rang it sharply charlotte half thought of demurring but she was wretched with cold and if she was to be there for some time it would be quite worth it to borrow something warm and dry thank you she accepted vespasia gave her a look of sharp perception she had seen the edge of argument and quite possibly understood when the maid came she treated the whole matter quite lightly mrs pitt has unfortunately been splashed and quite soaked on her journey here she did not even bother to look at the girl go and have rose put out dry boots and stockings for her and that bluegreen afternoon gown with the embroidery on the sleeve rose will know which one i mean oh dear the girl looked at charlotte with sympathy some of those hansom drivers dont look in the least where theyre going maam im ever so sorry cook only took a step down the road the other day and two of them lunatics passed seein as they could race each other and she was fair covered in mud said something awful she did when she got ome again ill find something dry for you straightaway she whisked out of the door bound on an errand of mercy and hoping eternal punishment for cab drivers in general and careless ones in particular charlotte smiled broadly thank you that was remarkably tactful of you not at all vespasia dismissed it i am holding a small soiree this afternoon very small indeed she fluttered her hand slightly to indicate how very minor it was and i would like you to be here im afraid this wretched business of augustus is not going well charlotte was not immediately sure what she meant her mind flew to dominic surely there could be no one who genuinely suspected him vespasia saw her look and read it with an ease that made charlotte blush thinking if she were so transparent now how truly painful she must have been in the past oh im sorry she said hastily i had hoped people would put it from mind now that he is reinterred it does seem as if he was only the unfortunate victim of some insane creature who is tearing up graves all over the place there have been two more you knowapart from lord augustus and the man in the cab she had the satisfaction of seeing vespasias eyes widen in surprise she had told her something she not only did not know but had not foreseen two more i heard nothing of it when and who no one you would know charlotte replied one was an ordinary man who lived near resurrection row vespasia shook her head never heard of it it sounds most insalubrious where is it about two miles away yes it isnt very pleasant but nothing like a slum just a back street and of course there is a cemeterythere would be with such a name that is where the other corpse was foundin the graveyard appropriate vespasia said drily yes but not sitting up on a tombstone and with his hat on no vespasia agreed pulling a painful face and who was he a man called horatio snipe thomas would not tell me what he did so i presume it must be something disreputablei mean worse than merely a thief or a forger i suppose he kept a house of women or something like that vespasia looked down her nose really charlotte she snorted but i dare say you are right however i dont think it will help suspicion is a strange thing even when it is proved to be entirely unjustified the flavor of it stays on rather like something disagreeable one has disposed ofthe aroma remains people will forget even what it was they suspected alicia or mr corde of having donebut they will remember that they did suspect them that is quite unjust charlotte said angrily and it is unreasonable of course vespasia agreed but people are both unjust and unreasonable without the slightest awareness or intention of being either i hope you will stay to the soiree that is principally why i invited you today you have something of a perception of people i have not forgotten you understood what had really happened in paragon walk before any of the rest of us perhaps you can see something in this that we do not but in paragon walk there had been a murder charlotte protested here there has been no crimeunless you think lord augustus was murdered it was a horrible thought and she had not accepted it nor did she now she meant it as a criticism a shock rather than a question vespasia was not shaken most probably he died quite naturally she replied as if she had been discussing something that happened every day but one must face the possibility that he did not we know a great deal less about people than we like to imagine maybe alicia is as simple as she seems a pleasant girl of good family and more than usual good looks whose father married her advantageously and she was if not pleased by it at least not imaginative or rebellious enough to object even in her own mind but my dear it is also possible that as her marriage became more and more tedious and she began to realize it would never be otherwise and could well last another twenty years the thought became unbearable and then when dominic corde came along and at precisely the same time an opportunity presented itself quite easily to be rid of her husband in an instant she took it it would be very easily done you know merely a small movement of the hand a drop two drops too much nothing more no evidence no lies as to where she had been or with whom she could almost forget it wipe it from memory convince herself it had not happened do you believe that charlotte was afraid even in front of the fire she became conscious of coldness again of her feet being wet outside the sleet clattered against the glass of the windows no vespasia said quietly but i do not deny its possibility charlotte stood still go and change out of those wet boots vespasia ordered we will take luncheon in here and you may tell me about your child what is it you have called her jemima charlotte answered obediently standing up i thought your mothers name was caroline vespasia raised her eyebrows in surprise it is charlotte agreed she turned at the door and gave her a dazzling smile and grandmamas name is amelia i dont care for that either the soiree was informal and there was a great deal more conversation than listening to the music which charlotte rather regretted since it was good and she was fond of the piano she had never played it well herself but both sarah and emily had and this young mans gentle touch brought back memories of childhood and mama singing dominic was surprised to see her but either he did not notice the excellence of vespasias gown on her or he was too sensitive to comment on it knowing that in her circumstances it would have to be borrowed charlotte had not seen alicia before and her curiosity had been mounting from the time the first guest who was virgil smith arrived as vespasia had said he was remarkably plain his nose was anything but aristocratic it appeared less like marble than warm wax put on with a careless hand his haircut might have been executed with a pair of shears round the edge of a basin but his tailor was exemplary he smiled at charlotte with a warmth that lit up his eyes and spoke to her in an accent she would have loved to mimic as emily could have to retail it to pitt but she had no skill in the art sir desmond and lady cantlay did not remember her or if they did chose not to acknowledge it she could hardly blame them when a corpse lands in the street in front of one one does not recall the faces of the passersby even those who offer assistance they greeted her with the wellbred mild interest of acquaintances who have nothing in common so far as they know except the place in which they meet charlotte watched them go and wondered nothing about them except if they suspected dominic or alicia of having entertained murder major rodney and his sisters held no involvement for her either and she murmured polite nonsenses to them that reminded her of standing beside her mother and emily at endless parties when she was single trying to sound as if she were totally absorbed by mrs soandsos most recent illness or the prospects of miss somebodys engagement she had already built in her mind very clearly how she expected alicia to look fair skin and hair that curled quite naturallyunlike her ownmedium height and with soft shoulders a little inclined to plumpness afterward she realized she was creating a vague picture of sarah again when alicia came she was utterly different it was not so much a matter of description she did have fair skin and her hair waved so softly and asymmetrically it must surely be natural but she was as tall as charlotte and her body was quite slim her shoulders almost delicate far more than that there was a completely different look in her eyes she was nothing like sarah at all how do you do charlotte said after only a seconds hesitation she did not know whether she had expected to like her or not but she was startled by the reality in her own mind because dominic was in love with her she had created a shadow of sarah she was unprepared for a different and independent person and she had forgotten that to alicia she would be a stranger and unless dominic had told her of sarah and their relationship one of no importance how do you do mrs pitt alicia replied and charlotte knew instantly that dominic had not told her there was no curiosity in her face alicia took a step away saw dominic and stood perfectly still for a moment then she turned to gwendoline cantlay and complimented her on her gown charlotte was still considering her own instinctive understanding of the moment when she realized she was being spoken to i understand you are an ally of lady cumminggould she looked round at the speaker he was lean with winged eyebrows and teeth that were a little crooked when he smiled charlotte scrambled to think what he could mean ally it must have something to do with the bill aunt vespasia was concerned with to get children out of workhouses and into some sort of school he would be the man who had driven dominic to the street in seven dials and shown him the workhouse that had upset him so profoundly she looked at him with more interest she could understand thomass care for such things his daily life brought him the results of its tragedies every sort of victim but why did this man care only in spirit she said with a smile now she knew who he was she felt assured perhaps in all the room he was the one who discomfited her least a supporter nothing so useful as an ally i think you underrate yourself mrs pitt he replied it stung her to be patronized the cause was too real for trivia and meaningless flattery she found herself resenting it as if he did not consider her worthy of the truth you do me no favor by pretending she said rather sharply i am not an ally i have not the means his smile widened i stand rebuked mrs pitt and i apologize perhaps i was precipitate making the wish the fact it would be churlish of her not to accept his apology if you can make it a fact i shall be delighted she said more gently it is a cause worthy of anyones effort before he could reply they were introduced to more people lord and lady st jermyn came in and charlotte found herself presented her first impressions of people were frequently wrong most often the people she afterwards came to like she felt nothing toward at first but she could not imagine ever being anything but uncomfortable in the presence of lord st jermyn there was something about his mouth that repelled her he was in no way ugly rather the opposite but there was a way his lips met that stirred half a memory half imagination in her that was unpleasant she heard her voice replying some inanity and felt carlisles eyes on her he had every right to reproach her with the very dishonesty for which she had just criticized him a little later alicia joined them with dominic at her elbow charlotte watched them and thought how well they looked together a perfect complement odd how that thought would have hurt and bewildered her a few years ago and now it gave her no feeling at all except anxiety in case the picture broke and there was nothing behind its perfection strong enough to stand an injury to the balance an assault the conversation turned back to the bill st jermyn was talking to dominic i hear from somerset that you are a friend of young fleetwood with him on our side we would have an excellent chance he has considerable influence you know i dont know him very well dominic was nervous beginning to disclaim charlotte had seen him twist a glass stem like that in cater street she realized now how many times she had never been conscious of it before well enough st jermyn said with a smile you are a good horseman and an even better judge of an animal thats all it takes i believe you have a fine stable yourself sir dominic was still trying not to be pushed racing st jermyn waved his hand fleetwood prefers a good carriage pair likes to drive himself and thats where you excel heard you even beat him once he smiled curling his long mouth down at the corners dont make a habit of it he wont like it more than the occasional time i was driving to win not to please lord fleetwood dominic said a little tartly his eyes flickered over to charlotte almost as if he were aware of her thoughts and of what she herself would have said that is a luxury we cannot afford st jermyn was not pleased but he ironed it out of his face the moment after charlotte had seen it and a second later there was no trace at all she judged that dominic had not even noticed if we want fleetwoods help it would not be clever to beat him too often st jermyn finished dominic drew breath to retort but charlotte spoke before he did he was not quick to anger in fact most agreeable he seldom took a hard position on any issue but on the rare occasions that he did she could not recall his ever having changed it it would be easy for him to commit himself now and then be unable to move when he regretted it i dont believe mr corde will do that she said forcing herself to smile across at st jermyn but surely lord fleetwood will take more notice of a man who has beaten him at least once to come second to him hardly marks one from the crowd or earns his interest dominic flashed her one of his beautiful smiles and for an instant she remembered how she used to feel about him then the present returned and she was staring at st jermyn quite dominic agreed i would like him to see the workhouse in seven dials as i did it would not be a sight he would forget in a hurry alicia was looking puzzled a slight frown on her face what is so dreadful about the workhouse she asked you said there was poverty but no legislation is going to get rid of that workhouses at least provide people with food and shelter there have always been rich and poor and even if you were to alter it with some miracle in a few years or less it would all be the same againwouldnt it if you give a poor man money it does not make him a rich man for long you are more perceptive than perhaps you intend carlisle said with a lifting of his brows but if you feed the children and keep them clean from disease and despair so they survive into adulthood without stealing to live and give them some sort of education then the next generation is not quite so poor alicia looked at him absorbing the idea realizing that he was very serious god if youd seen it dominic said sharply you wouldnt be standing here discussing academic niceties you would want to get out there and do something he looked across at charlotte wouldnt they a look of pain shot cross alicias face and she moved almost imperceptibly away from him charlotte saw it and knew exactly what she felt the sudden sense of alienation of being shut out of something important to him charlotte looked at him hard making her voice clear and light i should imagine they would it has certainly affected you that way you are totally changed but i hardly think it is a suitable place to take lady fitzroyhammond from what i have heard my husband would not permit me to go there but dominic would not be told nor read her hint he doesnt need to take you he said heatedly you already know about such places and the people in them and you care i can remember you telling me about it years ago but i didnt really understand what you meant then i dont think you were listening to me she said quite honestly it has taken you a long time to believe you must permit others a little time as well there isnt time indeed there isnt mrs pitt st jermyn said raising his glass my bill comes up in a few days if we are to get it through we will have to have our support then there isnt any time to waste corde id be most obliged if youd tackle fleetwood tomorrow or the day after at the latest of course dominic said firmly tomorrow good st jermyn patted him on the shoulder then drained his glass come on carlisle wed better go and talk to our hostess she knows simply everyone and we need that a flicker of distaste crossed carlisles face for an instant and was gone almost before charlotte was sure of it and he moved to keep up with st jermyn they walked together past the misses rodney and major rodney holding a glass in his hand and looking anxiously over their heads as if searching for someone or possibly fearing someone there was an uncomfortable silence then virgil smith appeared he looked a little doubtfully at charlotte then his face softened and he spoke to alicia it was only some common remark quite trivial but there was a gentleness in his voice that jarred charlotte away from thoughts of poverty or parliamentary bills and even suspicions of murder it was sad and perhaps unnoticed by anyone else but she was quite sharply aware that virgil smith was in love with alicia probably she had eyes only for dominic and was not in the least conscious of it and perhaps he would know its futility and never tell her in those few seconds charlotte became one person with alicia in her mind and memory reliving her own infatuation with dominic finding again the miseries and wild hopes the silly selfdeceptions all the virtues she read into him and how little she really knew him she had done them both a disservice with her dreams saddling him with virtues he had never claimed to possess she would not have seen virgil smith either with his unsculpted face and his impossible manners and certainly never known or wanted to know that he loved her it would have embarrassed her but perhaps she would have been the loser for it she excused herself and went to talk to vespasia and gwendoline cantlay and saw more than once a look of unease pass over gwendolines face as she recognized charlotte vaguely struggling to place her and failing she was not sure if she knew her socially and whether she ought to acknowledge it with a faint malice charlotte allowed her to search the satisfaction of telling her would not be as great and might possibly embarrass aunt vespasia she might not care in the least if they all knew she kept company with policemens wivesbut on the other hand she might prefer to select whom she told and how it was late with one or two guests departed and the gray afternoon already beginning to close in when charlotte found herself comparatively alone near the entrance to the conservatory and saw alicia coming toward her she had been expecting this moment in fact if alicia had not chosen it she would have contrived it herself alicia had obviously been rehearsing in her mind just how she could begin charlotte knew it because it was what she would have done it has been a most pleasant afternoon hasnt it alicia said quite casually as she drew level with charlotte so considerate of lady cumminggould to arrange it in such a way that it is not inappropriate for me to come mourning seems to go on for so long it only makes the bereavement worse it allows no one diversion in order to relieve ones mind from thoughts of death or from loneliness quite charlotte agreed i think people do not realize the added burden it is on top of the loss one has already sustained i did not know before today that lady cumminggold was an aunt of yours alicia continued i think that is rather more than the truth charlotte smiled she is the greataunt of my brotherinlaw lord ashworth then she said what she intended to tell alicia ever since the conversation with lord st jermyn my sister emily married lord ashworth a little while ago my older sister sarah was married to dominic before she died but then im sure you knew that she was in fact quite sure that she did not but she wanted to allow alicia room to pretend that she had alicia disguised her confusion with a masterly effort charlotte affected not to have noticed yes of course alicia pretended although he has been so taken up with this business of mr carlisles lately that i have not talked with him much i should be obliged if you could tell me a little more about it you seem to be in their confidence and i confess myself most dreadfully ignorant charlotte surprised herself by lying actually i think it is rather more aunt vespasias confidence i am in she kept her voice quite light she is very concerned with it you know mr carlisle seems to speak to her on the subject perhaps to gain her assistance in persuading others with seats in the house to go and support them she glanced at alicia and saw the memory of st jermyns remark flicker across her face she does know a great many people i have never seen a workhouse myself naturally but from what they have said it is a most appalling distress which should be alleviated and if this bill will provide maintenance and education for pauper children in the metropolis and remove them from the effects of living in the constant company of the vagrant of all sorts i for one would hope and pray it will be passed alicias face softened with relief oh so do i she agreed intensely i must think if i know anyone who could help there must be some of augustuss family or friends oh could you charlotte was not playacting this time she cared about both dominic and alicia because they were individual people she could understand but perhaps if she were honest the bill was far more important than a simple murder whatever tragedy brought it about or followed in its wake alicia smiled of course i shall begin as soon as i get home she held out her hand impulsively thank you mrs pitt you have been so kind i feel as if i know you already i hope you dont consider that an impertinence i consider it the greatest compliment charlotte said sincerely i hope you will feel so in the future alicia kept her word upon arriving home the first thing she did after giving her cloak to the maid and changing into dry boots was to go to her writing room and take out her address book she had very carefully composed and written four letters before going upstairs to change for the evening meal verity was not home having gone to visit a cousin for a few days and there was no one at the table except the old lady and herself she missed verity because she both enjoyed her company and would have liked to share with her the new project she had found and her thoughts on mrs pitt whom alicia had changed from disliking intensely because of dominics obvious regard for and closeness to her to liking her now as much she was quite different from alicias imagining did you enjoy your tea party the old lady asked spearing a large portion of fish with her fork and putting it whole into her mouth no one commented it odd that you should be out so soon after your husbands burial i suppose they were too polite it is over five weeks since he died mamainlaw alicia replied removing the bone from her fish delicately and it was a soiree not a tea party music as well very unsuitable all love songs i suppose so you could gape at dominic corde and make a fool of yourself he wont marry you you know he hasnt the stomach for it he thinks you poisoned augustus the full meaning of what she had said broke on alicia only slowly at first she was angry with the suggestion that she had disgraced herself at the soiree only after she had opened her mouth to deny it did she realize what the old lady had said about dominic it was ugly and utterly wrong of course he would never think anything so evil of her wont be able to prove it of course the old lady went on eyes bright wont say anythingjust be a little cooler every time you see him notice he didnt call round the last few days no more carriage rides it hasnt been the weather alicia said hotly never stopped him before the old lady took another mouthful of fish and spoke round it seen him come here at christmas when there was snow in the streets dont make a fool of yourself girl alicia was too angry to be polite any more last week you were saying he killed augustus himself she snapped if he did it how could he be thinking i did or do you imagine we both did it quite independently if that is the case then you should be delighted to see us marrywe deserve each other the old lady glared at her pretending to have her mouth too full to speak while she thought of a suitable reply perhaps he thinks you did it alicia went on gathering impetus with the idea after all the digitalis is yours not mine maybe he is afraid to come and live here in the same house with you and why should i poison my own son pray the old lady swallowed her mouthful and immediately put in more i dont want to marry some handsome young philanderer its as well alicia snapped since you dont have the least opportunity she was appalled at herself but years of good behavior had finally snapped and it was a marvelous feeling exhilarating like riding too fast on a good horse neither do you my girl the old ladys face was scarlet and youre a fool if you imagine you have youve poisoned your husband for nothing if you think me a poisoneralicia looked straight into her old eyesi am surprised you dine so voraciously at the same table with me and yet pursue my enmity so hard are you not afraid for yourself the old lady choked and her face went livid white her hand flew to her throat alicia laughed with real and bitter humor if i were going to poison anyone it would have been you in the beginning not augustus but i am not which you know as well as i do or you would have thought of it long ago you would have had nisbett tasting everything before you put it in your mouth not that i wouldnt cheerfully have poisoned nisbett too the old lady coughed and went into a spasm alicia ignored her if you have had sufficient of that fish she said coldly ill have byrne bring in the meat pitt knew nothing about the soiree he was determined to find the identity of the corpse from the cab and as soon as he received the result of the postmortem he snatched it from the delivery boy and tore it open he had worn himself out speculating what it might be something exotic and individual damning to someone to account for the extraordinary circumstances if it were not connected to some crime or scandal why should anyone perform the grisly and dangerous job of disinterring him and leaving him on the box of a hansom cab naturally they had traced the cab only to find it had been removed while its owner had been refreshing himself a little too liberally at a local tavern not an entirely uncommon occurrence and on a january night one for which pitt had considerable sympathy only policemen cabbies and lunatics frequented the streets all night long in such weather he read the piece of paper from the envelope it was as ordinary as possiblea stroke it was a common and utterly natural way to die there were no marks of violence on the body in fact nothing to comment on at all he had been a man of late middle years in generally good health well nourished and well cared for clean a little inclined to overweight in fact as the morgue attendant had said precisely what one might expect a dead lord to look like pitt thanked the boy and dismissed him then put the paper into the drawer of his desk jammed his hat on his head tied his muffler up to his ears and taking his coat off the stand went out the door there was no open grave that was perhaps the most sinister part about it he had three graves and four bodies lord augustus william wilberforce porteous horrie snipeand this unknown man from the cab where was his grave and why had the grave robber chosen to fill it in again so carefully that it remained hidden the other graves had all been within a fairly small perimeter he would begin looking in the same area obviously he could not search all the recent graves for an empty onehe would have to question all the doctors who might have certified a death from stroke within the last four to six weeks he might be able to narrow it down until he had a mere one or two who could then be taken to see the very unpleasant remains still lying at the morgue it took him until the afternoon of the following day before tired cold and very ragged of temper he climbed the stone stairs to the office of one dr childs he doesnt see patients this time o the day his housekeeper said sharply youll have to wait es just avin is tea im not a patient pitt made an effort to control his voice i am from the police and i will not wait he met the womans eyes and stared until she looked away im sure i dont know what you want ere she said with a lift of her shoulder but i suppose you ad better come in mind you wipe your feet pitt followed her in and disturbed a somewhat startled doctor sitting with his boots off in front of the fire crumpet in his hand and butter on his chin pitt explained his errand oh the doctor said immediately bring another cup mrs lundy have a crumpet inspectoryes that would be albert wilson i imagine warm yourself man you look perished mr dunns butler poor fellow still dont know why i say that very quick way to go dare say he never knew anything about it your boots are wet man take em off and dry your socks out cant bear this weather why do you want to know about wilson perfectly normal death no relation and nothing to leave anyway just a butler good one so i hear but perfectly ordinary fellow thats right make yourself comfortable have another crumpet watch the butter runs all over the place whats the matter with wilson he raised his eyebrows and looked at pitt curiously pitt warmed to him as much as to the fire there was a disinterred corpse found on the box of a hansom cab outside the theatre about three weeks ago good god you mean that was poor old wilson the doctors eyebrows shot up almost to his hairline now why on earth should anybody do that your case is it thank you mrs lundy now pour the inspector a cup of tea pitt took the tea gracefully and waited till the housekeeper was reluctantly out of the room terrible curious woman the doctor shook his head at her departing back but it has its usesknows more about my patients than they ever tell me cant cure a man if you know only half of whats wrong with him he watched the steam rise from pitts socks shouldnt walk around with wet feet not good for you yes it is my case pitt could not help smiling and the odd thing is theres no open grave left albert wilson was buried i presume oh certainly of course he was i cant tell you where but im sure mr dunn could then i shall ask him pitt replied without moving he bit into another crumpet im greatly obliged to you the doctor reached for the teapot think nothing of it my dear fellow professional duty have some more tea pitt went to the dunns and learned the name of the church but there was no use going to look for graves in the dark it was the following morning when he found the grave of albert wilson butler deceased and obtained permission to open it by eleven oclock he was standing beside the gravediggers watching as they took out the last of the black earth from the coffin lid he passed the ropes down waited as they poked them under the box and tied them then stood back as they climbed out and began to haul it was an expert job a matter of balance and leverage they seemed to find it heavy finally laying it on the wet earth beside the cavity with a sigh of relief that were rotten eavy guv one of them said soberly it didnt ardly feel like it were empty to me not me the other shook his head and stared at pitt accusingly pitt did not reply but bent and looked at the fastenings on the lid after a moment he fished in his pocket and pulled out a screwdriver silently he started to work moving round the coffin till he had all the screws in his hands he put them in the other pocket then inserted the blade between the lid and the box and lifted it up they were right it was not empty the man lying in it was slight with thick red hair he wore a loosefitting white shirt and there was paint on his fingers thin watercolor paint such as an artist uses but it was the face that held pitt his eyes were closed but the skin was bloated and puffy the lips blue under the surface of the skin were dozens of tiny pinprick red marks where the capillaries had burst but the most obvious of all were the dark bruises on the throat here at last was the one who had been murdered so much had already centered on gadstone park it did not take pitt long to discover the identity of the man buried in albert wilsons grave there had been only one artist mentionedgodolphin jones it was but a short step to see if this was his body pitt put down the lid again and stood up he called over the constable waiting at the end of the path and told him to have the body taken immediately to the morgue he himself would repair to gadstone park and fetch a butler or footman to look at it he thanked the gravediggers and left them angry and confused staring at the earthstained coffin while he tied his muffler still tighter pulled his hat forward to keep the drizzle off his face and went out into the street it was a short grim business it was a distinctive face even under the puffing and the marks and the butler needed only one look yes sir he said quietly that is mr jones then he hesitated sirhehe swallowed hard he does not look as if he met with a natural death sir no pitt said gently he was strangled the man was very pale indeed the morgue attendant reached for the glass of water does that mean he was murdered sir and there will be an investigation yes pitt answered im afraid it does oh dear the man sat down on the chair provided how very unpleasant pitt waited for a few minutes while the man collected his composure again then they both went back to the hansom that was waiting and returned to gadstone park there was a great deal to be done no other event so far had included godolphin jones in any way he had had no apparent relationship with augustus fitzroyhammond or with alicia or dominic in fact he did not figure in anything that had been mentioned not even the bill that aunt vespasia was so concerned with no one had claimed any acquaintance with him beyond professional or the merest sort that one has with any person who lives in the immediate neighborhood charlotte had said aunt vespasia thought his paintings a little muddy and highly priced but that was no cause for personal dislike far less murder if one did not like paintings one simply did not purchase them and yet he had been popular and if his house was anything to judge by of very considerable means the house was the place to begin possibly it was where he had been murdered and if that could be established it was a point from which to pursue time and witnesses at the very least he would discover the last occasion godolphin jones was there if he was seen leaving who had called upon him and when servants frequent knew a great deal more about their masters than their masters would have chosen to believe discreet and welljudged questioning might elicit all sorts of information and of course a thorough search must be made of his belongings pitt in company with a constable began the long task the bedroom yielded nothing it was orderly a little consciously dramatic for pitts taste but clean and unremarkable in every other way it held all the usual effects washstand mirror chests of drawers for underwear and socks suits and shirts were kept in a separate dressing room there were several guest bedrooms unoccupied and out of use nor did any of the downstairs rooms offer anything unusual until they came to the studio pitt opened the door and stared inside there was nothing posed or indulgent about this room the floor was uncarpeted the windows enormous and taking up the most part of two walls there was a clutter of odd pieces of statuary in one corner and what looked like a white garden chair a louis quinze chair was half draped with a length of pink velvet and an urn lay on its side on the floor on the wall beside the door were shelves stacked with brushes pigments chemicals linseed oil spirits and several bundles of rags on the floor underneath were a number of canvases and in the center of the room an easel with two palettes beside it and a halfworked canvas propped on the pegs there was nothing else immediately visible except a shabby rolltop desk and a hardbacked kitchen chair beside it artist the constable said obviously reckon to find anything here i hope so pitt walked in otherwise theres nothing left but questioning the servants you start over there he pointed and began to go through the canvases himself yes sir the constable replied dutifully climbing over the urn to begin and knocking the chair off its balance it fell over and rolled onto its side with a clatter carrying a vase of dried flowers with it pitt refrained from comment he already knew the constables opinion of art and artists the canvases were mostly primed but unused there were only two with paint on one with background and outline of a womans head the other almost completed he sat them up and stepped back to consider them they were as vespasia had said a little muddy in color as if he had used too many pigments in the mixing but the balance was good and the composition pleasing he did not recognize the almost completed one nor the one on the easel but probably the butler would know who they were and no doubt jones himself kept a record for financial purposes if nothing else the constable knocked over a piece of pillar and swore under his breath pitt ignored him and turned to the desk it was locked and he was obliged to fiddle for several minutes with a wire before getting it open there were few papers inside mostly bills for artists supplies the household accounts must be kept somewhere else probably by the cook or the butler theres nothing ere sir the constable said hopelessly couldnt rightly tell if theres been a struggle in among this lot or not seein as its such a mess anyway i suppose its bein a hartist like he did not approve of art it was not an occupation for a man men should do a job of work and women should keep house a neat and tidy house if they were any good at it they all live like this he eyed the room with disdain ive no idea pitt replied see if you can find any blood there was a hell of a bruise on his head whatever he hit it on is bound to have traces and he resumed his search of the desk picking up a bundle of letters he read through them quickly they were of no interest that he could see all to do with commissions for portraits detailing poses desired colors of gowns dates for sittings that might be convenient next he came to a small notebook with a series of figures which could have been anything and after each figure a tiny drawing either an insect or a small reptile there was a lizard a fly two kinds of beetle a toad a caterpillar and several small hairy things with legs all of them were repeated at least half a dozen times except the toad which appeared only twice and toward the end perhaps if jones had lived the toad would have continued found something the constable climbed over the urn and the chair and came across his voice lifting hopefully i dont know pitt answered it doesnt look like much but maybe if i understood it the constable tried to lean over his shoulder found it too high and peered over his elbow instead well i dunno he said after a minute was e interested in them kind o things some gentlemen iswho dont ave anythin better to do wiv their time though why anybody wants to know about spiders and flies is a mystery to me no pitt shook his head frowning theyre not naturalist drawings they are all repeated at fairly regular intervals and exactly the same they are more like hieroglyphics a sort of code what for the constable screwed up his face it aint a letter or anything if i knew what for i should know the next step pitt said tartly these figures are set out in groups like either dates or money or both the constable lost interest maybe that was is way of doin is accounts to keep out nosy ousekeepers or the like he suggested theres nothing much over there just a lot o things like you see in paintings bits o plaster made up to look like stone colored bits o cloth things like that aint no blood and theyre all in such a mess you cant tell whether they been knocked like that or e just threw em there anyway seems like hartists is just naturally untidy looks as if e took photographs as well as theres one o them cameras over there a camera pitt straightened up i havent seen any photographs have you no sir now as you mention it i avent do you think e sold them he would hardly sell all of them pitt answered puzzled and there werent any in the rest of the house now i wonder where they are maybe e never used it the constable suggested its in among all them things e put in is pictures maybe thats what its for part of a picture doesnt seem the sort of thing youd put in a picture pitt climbed carefully over the chair and the urn and the pillars till he came to the black camera on its tripod and its far from new he observed so he hadnt just bought it unless he got it secondhand but we can find out from his past clients if anyone had a portrait painted with a camera in it or if anyone commissioned such a thing for the future it aint a pretty thing the constable caught his feet in a piece of the velvet cloth and swore vociferously then he noticed pitts face beg pardon sir he coughed in a mixture of embarrassment and irritation but maybe e took photographs o people e was goin to paint so e could know what they looked like when they wasnt ere like and then destroyed them or gave them away afterwards pitt considered it possible but i would have thought hed want to see them in color after all an artist works in color still it could be he started to examine the camera pressing the pieces experimentally he had never worked one himself although he had seen them used by police photographers a few times and had begun to appreciate their possibilities he knew the imprint of the picture was made on a plate which then had to be developed it took him a little fiddling before he got the plate out of this one carefully keeping it wound in the black cloth away from the light because he was not used to it and did not know how fragile it might be whats that the constable asked dubiously the plate pitt replied anything on it i dont know have to have it developed probably not or he wouldnt have left it in there but we might be lucky probably only some woman e was painting the constable dismissed it he may have been murdered because of some woman he was painting pitt pointed out the constables face lit up hopefully avin an affaire well now thats a thought bit free with the posin you reckon pitt gave him a dry humorous look go and get the servants one by one he ordered starting with the butler yes sir the constable obeyed but he was obviously turning over in his mind the limitless possibilities that had just dawned on him he did not like effeminate men who made a great deal too much money by puddling around in smocks and painting pictures of people who ought to know better but it was a good deal more interesting than the usual runofthemill tragedies he saw he did not want to be bothered with servants he retired reluctantly the butler came in a few moments later and pitt invited him to sit down in the garden chair while he himself sat in the one that had been beside the desk who was your master painting when he left he asked straightaway no one sir he had just finished a portrait of sir albert galsworth that was a disappointment not only someone pitt had never heard of but also a man what about the picture on the floor he asked thats a woman the butler walked over and looked at it i dont know sir she appears to be a lady of quality by her clothes but as you see the face has not yet been filled in so i cannot say who it may be has no one been coming here for sittings no sir not that i am aware of perhaps she was due and had put it off until a more convenient time what about this one pitt showed him the other more nearly completed canvas oh yes sir that is mrs woodford she did not care for the picture she said it made her look lumpish mr jones never finished it was there ill feeling not on mr joness part sir he is used tocertain personsvanity an artist has to be he wasnt prepared to alter it to suit the lady apparently not sir i believe he had already made considerable adjustments to suit the ladys view of herself if he went too far he would compromise his reputation pitt did not argue it was academic now have you seen this before he pulled out the notebook and let it fall open the butler glanced at it and his face went blank no sir is it of importance i dont know was mr jones a photographer the butlers eyebrows shot up a photographer oh no sir he was an artist sometimes watercolors and sometimes oil but certainly not photographs then whose camera is that the butler looked startled he had not noticed the contraption i really have no idea sir i have never seen it before could someone else have borrowed his studio oh no sir mr jones was most particular beside if they had i should have known there have been no strangers here in fact no caller has been inside this house since mr jonesleft i see pitt was confused the thing was becoming ridiculous he wanted a mystery something to investigate but this was nonsensical the camera had to have come from somewhere and belong to someone thank you he said standing up again will you make me a list of all the people you can remember who came here to have their pictures painted starting with the latest and going back as far as you can remember with the best recollection you have as to dates yes sir has mr jones no accounts you can check if he has they are not here the butler forbore from comment and retired to send in the next servant pitt interviewed them all one by one and learned nothing that seemed important it was early afternoon when he had finished and still time to visit at least one of the other houses in the park he chose the latest on the butlers list of portraitslady gwendoline cantlay obviously she had not heard the news she received him with surprise and a hint of irritation really inspector i see no purpose to be served by pursuing this unfortunate subject augustus is buried and there has been no further vandalism i suggest you now leave his family to recover as well as they may and do not refer to the matter again havent they been through enough i have no intention of raising the matter again maam he said patiently unless it should become necessary im afraid i am here over something quite different you were acquainted with the artist mr godolphin jones i believe did he imagine it or was there a tightening of her fingers in her lap a faint flush across her cheeks he painted my picture she agreed watching him he has painted many pictures and came highly recommended to me he is a wellknown artist you know and very much praised you think highly of him maam i she drew in her breathi dont really know sufficient to say i am obliged to rest upon other peoples opinions she looked at him with a touch of defiance again her hands were tight in her lap crunching the fabric of her dress why do you ask at last she had come to it he had a sudden sense of anxiety as if the knowledge might affect her more than he was prepared for im very sorry to have to tell you maam he began unusually awkwardly for him he had done this often before and the words were practiced but mr jones is dead he had been murdered she sat perfectly still as if she did not understand he is in france no maam im sorry but he is here in london his body has been identified by his butler there is no mistake he looked at her then round the room to see where the bell was to call a maid in case she should require assistance did you say murdered she asked slowly yes maam im sorry why who would murder him do you know are there any clues she was agitated now he would have sworn it came to her as a complete shock but she had changed she was frightened and it was not hysterical or nameless she knew what she was frightened of pitt would have given quite a lot if he could have known also yes there are several clues he said watching her her face her neck her hands grasping the arms of the chair her eyes widened may i ask what they are perhaps if i knew i could help i knew mr jones a little naturally having sat for the portrait of course he agreed there are unfinished canvases that the butler does not recognize as ladies who ever called at the house for sittings or any other purpose and there is a camera he was quite sure her surprise was genuine a camera but he was an artist not a photographer exactly and yet one presumes it was his it is very improbable someone elses camera would be there in his studio the butler is quite positive he has not permitted anyone else to use it i dont understand she said simply no maam neither do we as yet i take it mr jones never took photographs of you say to work from when you were not available no never perhaps i could see the portrait if you still have it of course if you wish she stood up and led him to the withdrawing room where a large portrait of her sat over the mantelpiece excuse me he went forward and began to study it carefully he did not like it much the pose was quite good if rather stylized he recognized several of the props from the studio especially a piece of pillar and a small table the proportions were correct but the colors lacked something a certain clarity they seemed to have been mixed with a permanent undertone of ocher or sepia giving even the sky a heavy look the face was definitely gwendolines the expression was pleasant enough and yet there was no charm in it he began to study the background and was just about to leave it when he noticed in the bottom lefthand corner a small clump of leaves quite clearly drawn with a beetle on one of them distinct and stylized precisely like one of those he had seen in the notebook at least four or five times may i ask you what it cost maam he said quickly i cannot see what that has to do with mr joness murder she said with marked coolness and i have already said he is an artist of excellent repute pitt was aware he had mentioned a subject socially crass yes maam he acknowledged you did say so and i have already heard that from others nevertheless i have good reason for asking even if only for comparisons sake i do not wish half london to be familiar with my financial arrangements i shall not discuss it maam it is purely for police use and then only should it be relevant i would prefer to find it out from you rather than press your husband or her face hardened you are overstepping your office inspector but i do not wish you to disturb my husband with the affair i paid three hundred and fifty pounds for the picture but i dont see what possible use that can be to you it is quite a usual price for an artist of his quality i believe major rodney paid something the same for his portrait and that of his sisters major rodney has two pictures pitt was surprised he would not have imagined major rodney as a man who cared for or could afford such an indulgence in art why not she asked eyebrows raised one of himself and one of miss priscilla and miss mary ann together i see thank you maam you have been very helpful i dont see how he was not quite sure of himself but at least there were other places to search and in the morning he would call on major and the misses rodney he excused himself and set out in the returning fog to go back to the police station and then home if lady cantlay had been startled to hear of godolphin joness murder major rodney was shattered he sat in the chair like a man who has nearly been drowned he gasped for breath and his face was mottled with red oh my god how absolute appalling strangled you say where did they find him in another mans grave pitt replied unsure again whether to reach for the bell and call a servant it was a reaction he had been totally unprepared for the man was a soldier he must have seen death violent and bloody death a thousand times he had fought in the crimea and from what pitt had heard of the tragic and desperate war a man who had survived that ought to be able to look on hell itself and keep his stomach rodney was beginning to compose himself how dreadful how on earth did you know to look we didnt pitt said honestly we found him quite by chance thats preposterous you cant go around digging up graves to see what you will find in themby chance no of course not sir pitt was awkward again he had never known himself so clumsy we expected the grave to have been robbed to be empty major rodney stared at him we had the corpse whose grave it was pitt tried to make him understand he was the man we first took to be lord augustuson the cab near the theatre oh major rodney sat upright as though he were on horseback in a parade i see why didnt you say so to begin with well im afraid there is nothing i can tell you thank you for informing me pitt remained seated you knew mr jones not socially no not our sort of person artist you know he painted your picture did he not oh yesknew him professionally cant tell you anything about him thats all there is to it and i wont have you distressing my sisters with talk about murders and death ill tell them myself as i see fit did you have a picture painted of them also i did what of it quite an ordinary thing to do lots of people have portraits may i see them please whatever for ordinary enough but i suppose so if itll make you go away and leave us alone poor man he shook his head pity dreadful way to die and he stood up small slight and ramrod stiff and led pitt into the withdrawing room pitt stared at the very formal portrait on the far wall above the sideboard instantly he disliked it it was grandiloquent full of scarlets and glinting metal a child in an old mans body playing at soldiers had it been intended as ironic it would have been clever but again the colors were unsubtle and a little cloudy he went up to and found his eye drawn without consciousness to the left corner there was a small caterpillar totally irrelevant to the composition but cleverly masked in the background a brownbodied creature in a brown mottled shadow and i believe there is also one of your sisters he stepped back and turned to face the major cant think what you want to see it for the major said with surprise quite ordinary painting still if you like yes please pitt went after him into the next room it was on the facing wall between two jardinieres a larger work than the first the pose was fussy the scenery cluttered with far too many props the colors a little better but with too much pink he looked in the left corner and found the same caterpillar exactly the same stylized hair and legs but greenbodied to hide against the grass what did you pay for them sir he asked sufficient sir the major said huffily i cannot see that it concerns your investigation pitt tried to visualize the figures after the caterpillars in the little book but there had been so many of them more caterpillars than anything else and he could not remember them all i do need to know major i would prefer to ask you personally than have to discover by some other means damn you sir it is not your business inquire as you like pitt would get nowhere by pressing the point and he knew it he would find the figures in the notebook in the column under in line with the beetle and total all those next to caterpillars he would then try major rodney with that sum and observe his reaction the major snorted satisfied with his victory now if that is all inspector pitt debated whether to insist on seeing the misses rodney now and decided there was little to learn from them he could more profitably go and question the other person who had bought a jones portrait lady st jermyn he accepted the majors dismissal and a quarter of an hour later was standing rather uncomfortably in front of lord st jermyn lady st jermyn is not at home he said coolly neither of us can help you any further with the affair it would be best left and i counsel you to do so from now on one cannot leave murder my lord pitt said tartly even did i wish to st jermyns eyebrows rose slightly not surprise so much as contempt what has made you suddenly believe that augustus was murdered i suspect a prurient desire to inquire into the lives of your betters pitt ached to be equally rude he could feel it like a beat in his head i assure you sir my interest in other peoples personal lives is purely professional he made his own voice as precise and as beautiful as st jermyns coolly caressing the words i have no liking either for tragedy or for squalor i prefer private griefs to remain private where public duty permits and as far as i know lord augustus died naturallybut godolphin jones was unmistakably strangled st jermyn stood absolute still his face paled and his eyes widened very slightly pitt saw his hands clasp each other hard there was a moments silence before he spoke murdered he said carefully yes sir he wanted to let st jermyn say all he would not lead him and make his answers easy by suggesting them the silence was inviting st jermyns eyes stayed on pitts face watching him almost as if he were trying to anticipate when did you discover his body he asked yesterday evening pitt answered simply again st jermyn waited but pitt did not help him where he said at last buried sir buried st jermyns voice rose thats preposterous what do you mean buried in someones garden no sir properly buried in a coffin in a grave in a churchyard i dont know what you mean st jermyn was growing angry who would bury a strangled man no doctor would sign a certificate if the man was strangled and no clergyman would bury him without one you are talking nonsense he was ready to dismiss it i am relating the facts sir pitt said levelly i have no explanation for them either except that it was not his own grave it was that of one albert wilson deceased of a stroke and buried there in the regular way well what happened to thiswilson st jermyn demanded that was the corpse that fell off the cab outside the theatre pitt replied still watching st jermyns face he could see nothing in it but dark and utter confusion again for several moments he said nothing pitt waited st jermyn stared at him eyes clouded and unreadable pitt tried to strip away the mask of authority and assurance and see the man beneathhe failed entirely i presume you have no idea st jermyn said at last who killed him godolphin jones no sir not yet or why for the first time pitt overstepped the truth thats different we do have a possible idea as to why st jermyns face was still very pale nostrils flared gently as he breathed in and out oh and what may that be it would be irresponsible of me to speak before i have proof pitt evaded it with a slight smile i might wrong someone and suspicion once voiced is seldom forgotten no matter how false it proves to be later st jermyn hesitated as if about to ask something further then thought better of it yesyes of course he agreed what are you going to do now question the people who knew him best both professionally and socially pitt replied taking the opening offered i believe you were one of his patrons st jermyn gave an answering smile no more than a slight relaxation of the face what a curious word inspector hardly a patron i commissioned one picture of my wife and were you satisfied with it it is acceptable my wife liked it well enough which was what mattered why do you ask no particular reason may i see it if you wish although i doubt you will learn anything from it it is very ordinary he turned and walked out of the door into the hallway leaving pitt to follow the picture was in an inconspicuous place on the stair wall and looking at the quality of it compared with the other family portraits pitt was not surprised his eye scanned the face briefly then went to the lefthand corner the insect was there this time a spider well st jermyn inquired with a touch of irony in his voice thank you sir pitt came down the stairs again to stand level with him do you mind telling me sir how much you paid for it probably more than its worth st jermyn said casually but my wife likes it personally i dont think it does her justice do you but then you wouldnt know you havent met her how much sir pitt repeated about four hundred and fifty pounds as far as i can remember do you want the precise figure it would take me some time to find it hardly a major transaction the vast financial difference between them was not lost on pitt thank you that will be near enough he dismissed it without comment st jermyn smiled fully for the first time does that further your investigations inspector it may do when compared with other information pitt walked on to the front door thank you for your time sir when he got home cold and tired pitt was welcomed by the fragrance of steaming soup and dry laundry hanging from the ceiling jemima was already asleep and the house was silent he took his wet boots off and sat down letting the calm wash over him almost as capable of being felt with body as was the heat for several minutes charlotte said no more than a welcome an acknowledgment of his presence when at last he was ready to talk he put down the soup bowl she had given him and looked across at her im making noises as if i knew what i was doing but honestly i cant see sense in any of it he said with a gesture of helplessness whom have you questioned she asked wiping her hands carefully and picking up an oven cloth before opening the door and reaching in for a pie she pulled it out and put it quickly on the table the crust was crisp and pale gold a little darker in one corner in fact perilously close to burnt he looked at it with the beginning of a smile she saw him ill eat that corner she said instantly he laughed why does it do that scorch one corner she gave him a withering look if i knew that i would prevent it she turned out the vegetables smartly and watched the steam rise with appreciation whom have you seen about this artist everyone in the park who has portraits by himwhy i just wondered she lifted the carving knife and held it in the air suspended over the pie while she thought we had an artist paint a picture of mama once and another for sarah they were both full of compliments told sarah she was beautiful made all sorts of outrageously flattering remarks said she had a quality of delicacy about her like a bourbon rose she floated round insufferably with her head in the air looking sideways at herself in all the mirrors for weeks she was goodlooking he replied although a bourbon rose is a little extravagant but what is the point you are making well godolphin jones made his money by painting pictures of people which in a way is the ultimate vanity isnt it having your face immortalized maybe he flattered them all like that and if he did i would imagine a fair few of them responded wouldnt you suddenly he perceived you mean an affaire or several affaires a jealous woman who imagined she was something unique in his life and discovered she was merely one of many and that the sweet images were just part of his professional equipment or a jealous husband its possible she lowered her knife at last and cut into the pie thick gravy bubbled through and pitt totally forgot about the scorched piece im hungry he said hopefully she smiled up at him with satisfaction good ask aunt vespasia if it was anyone in the park ill bet she knows and if she doesnt she will find out for you i will he promised now please get on with that and forget about godolphin jones but the first person he saw the following day was somerset carlisle by now of course everyone in the park knew of the discovery of the body and he no longer had any element of surprise i didnt know him very well carlisle said mildly not much in common as i dare say you know and i certainly had no desire to have my portrait done if you had pitt said slowly watching carlisles face would you have gone to godolphin jones carlisles expression dropped a little in surprise why on earth does it matter im a bit late now anyway would you carlisle hesitated considering no he said at length no i wouldnt pitt had expected that charlotte had said carlisle had spoken slightingly of jones as an artist he would have contradicted himself had he praised him now pitt pursued it overrated would you say carlisle looked levelly at him his eyes were dark gray and very clear as a painter yes inspector i would say so as an admirer and companion possibly not he was quite a wit very eventempered and had learned the not inconsiderable art of suffering fools graciously it is difficult to command more than you are worth for long isnt art something of a fashion pitt inquired carlisle smiled still meeting his eyes without a flicker certainly but fashions are frequently manufactured price feeds upon itself you know sell one thing expensively and you can sell the next even more so pitt took the point but it did not answer the question as to why anyone should strangle godolphin jones you mentioned other forms of worth he said carefully did you mean purely as a companion or perhaps moreas a lover in an affaireor even several carlisles face remained impassive amused it might be worth your while to investigate the possibility discreetly of course or you will rouse a lot of ill feeling that will rebound upon yourself naturally pitt agreed thank you sir discretion began with aunt vespasia i was expecting you yesterday she said with slight surprise in her voice where can you start is there anything you know about this wretched man so far as i have heard he had nothing to do with augustus and alicia was one of the few beauties or imagined beauties around the park that he did not paint for goodness sake man sit down you give me a crick in my neck looking at you pitt obeyed he still did not care to take the liberty of making himself comfortable before he was invited was he a good artist he asked he would value her opinion no she said baldly why charlotte said as much she looked at him a little sideways her eyes narrowed indeed and what do you draw from that you are trying to say somethingwhat is it why do you think he was able to charge so much and get it he asked frankly ah she leaned back a little and a very small smile curved her mouth portrait artists who paint society women have to be courtiers as well in fact possibly even courtiers first the best of them can afford to paint as they please but the others must paint to suit whoever holds the purse strings if they have the skill they flatter with the brush if not they must do it with the tongue some even do both and godolphin jones her eyes flickered with amusement you have seen his work yourselfand you must know it was with his tongue do you suppose it went further than flattery he was not sure if she would be affronted by his assuming such a possibility and asking it so bluntly but on the other hand there was no point in being evasive with her and he was too weary of the case and confused to be subtle she was silent for so long he began to be anxious she was offended then at last she spoke choosing her words you are asking me if i know of anyone having an affaire with godolphin jones i suppose if i do not tell you you will have to pursue it yourself i had rather tell you i imagine that will be the least painful yes gwendoline cantlay had an affaire it was nothing serious a relief from boredom of a pleasant but growingly uninterested husband certainly not a grand passion and she was extremely discreet about it do you know if sir desmond knew of it she considered for a moment before replying i should think he guessed but was tactful enough to look the other way she said at length i find it very hard indeed to believe he would have killed the wretched little man over it one does not react in such a way unless one is completely unhinged pitt had no understanding he simply had to accept that she knew he could not conceive of what his own behavior might have been had he discovered charlotte in such a squalid involvement it would shatter everything he cared about desecrate and overturn all that was precious within him and held him islanded against daily wretchedness he saw it was not beyond his imagination that he would strangle the man the more so if it were merely part of his professional repertoire and she were one of any number vespasia was looking at him perhaps reading something of what was going through his mind you must not judge desmond cantlay by yourself she said quietly but investigate the possibility if you must i suppose as late as this you cannot say when he was killed no approximately three to four weeks ago but that is hardly any use for establishing anyones whereabouts to prove him innocent or guilty i should imagine he was killed shortly after the last time his servants saw him which was three weeks ago last tuesday but even that is not proven we dont even know where he was killed yet you seem to know remarkably little she said grimly dont go seeking your information by spreading suspicions maybe desmond didnt know it and doubtless since it is a tool of his trade jones used it quite regularly pitt frowned probably but would he dare with lady st jermyn he pictured that dark head with its severe silver streak there was a remarkable dignity about her it would have been a brash artist indeed who had tried to soften her with overflattery vespasias eyes widened very slightly but her expression was beyond his reading no he said simply nor with the misses rodney i suspect the idea of an affaire with the misses rodney was ridiculous but few people are impervious to flattery and perhaps jones had been skilled enough when he wished ill have to find his other subjects he agreed i have a list from the butler he wanted to ask her more in fact he had a vague impression that she knew something that deliberately she was not telling him a shield for gwendoline cantlay or for someone else surely not alicia again or worse than that verity there was no point in asking it would only offend her he stood up thank you lady cumminggould i appreciate your help she looked at him dubiously dont be sarcastic with me thomas i have been of uncommonly little help and you know it i have no idea who killed godolphin jones but whoever it was i have some sympathy with him but i am really only marginally interested in the whole affair it is a pity he could not have remained decently buried in the butlers grave the parliamentary bill is a great deal more important than the death of one opinionated and indifferent little artist do you have any conception of what it could mean in the lives of thousands of children in this wretched city yes maam i have he said equally soberly i have been in the workhouses and the sweatshops i have arrested starving fiveyearolds already schooled in thieving and knowing of nothing else i apologize thomas she was unused to retreat but this time she meant it he knew it he smiled at her brilliantly honestly and for an instant they were equals then it vanished she rang the bell and the butler showed pitt to the door but there was something nagging at his mind and rather than take out the butlers list he hailed a cab and traveled for more than two miles before alighting paying the driver and climbing a dingy staircase up to a small room that had a great southfacing window and an even greater skylight a scruffy little man with enormous eyes looked up at him hello froggy pitt said cheerfully can you spare me a few minutes the man looked at him skeptically i aint got nothing as i oughtnt to you got no right to look im not looking froggy i want your advice and i aint ratting on no one your artistic advice pitt elaborated on the worth of a perfectly legitimate picture or to be more precise an artist who godolophin jones no good dont touch it but es bleedin hexpensive where dyou get that kind o money you bin takin bribes or suffink dyou know what e sells forfour or five undred nicker a time or near enough yes i do know that and i wont press you to tell me how you know why does he sell that highly if hes no good oh now there you as one o lifes mysteries i dunno maybe youre wrong and he is good now theres no need to be rude mr pitt i know my business couldnt sell one o them joneses not if i was to give you a chicken with each one people as buy from me wants suffink as they can keep for a while then when nobodys lookin for it anymore ship it out to some collector what aint too choosy as to ow they come by fings no collector wants a jones you ask why they pays so ighmaybe its vanity dont understand the quality never aveand youre wastin your time if you thinks you can theyre a different sort of animal from you and me no knowin what theyll do or why except i can tell you thisthat joneses never change ands nobody sells em cos nobody buys em now thats a rule that isif its worth buying somewhere sometime somebodys goin to sell it thank you froggy that all yes thank you thats all does it elp ive no idea but i think im glad to know it all the same on his return to the police station before the end of the day pitt was greeted by the sergeant who had previously met him with news of one corpse after another his heart sank as soon as he saw the wretched mans face flushed with excitement again what is it he snapped that plate sir the photographic plate from the dead artists house what about it you sent it to be developed sir he was practically fidgeting in his fever naturally sudden hope seized pitt what was on it tell me man dont stand there a picture sir of a naked woman naked as a babe but nothing like a babe if you get my meaning sir where is it pitt demanded furiously what have you done with it its in your office sir in a brown envelope sealed pitt strode past him and slammed the door with shaking fingers he picked up the envelope and tore it open the photograph was as the constable had said an elegant but highly erotic pose of a woman without a shred of clothing the face was perfectly clear he had never seen her before either in life or in paint she was a total stranger damn he said fiercely damnation pitt spent the next day trying to discover the identity of the woman in the photograph if she was a person of social standing at all the picture alone was motive for murder he gave the sergeant a copy and had him try all the police stations in the inner city to see if anyone recognized her and he took another copy himself this time with the body carefully blocked out to see if anyone in society knew her she did not have to be a lady even a maid seeking to make a little money on the side with such things would lose not only her present employment but any hope of future employment with all its security clothes regular meals companionship and certain status of belonging that too could be cause for murder of course he went back to vespasia she hesitated a long time before replying weighing her answer so carefully he was more than half prepared for a lie she reminds me of someone she said slowly her head a little to one side still considering it the hair is not right i seem to feel it was done differently if indeed i do know her and perhaps it was a little darker who is it he demanded impatience boiling inside him she might actually have the last clue to murder on the back of her tongue and she was havering like a nervous bride she shook her head i dont knowi just feel a certain familiarity he let out his breath in a sigh of exasperation theres no use trying to goad me thomas she replied i am an old woman rubbish he snapped if you are going to plead infirmity of mindill charge you with perjury she smiled at him bleakly i do not know who it is thomas perhaps it is someones daughter or even someones maid maybe i have normally seen that face under a lace cap hair makes a lot of difference you know but if i see her again i shall send a messenger to you within the hour you said you found this photograph in godolphin joness house in his camera why is it so important she glanced at the picture still in her hand is the rest of it indecent or is there some other person in it or perhaps both it is indecent he replied indeed she raised her eyebrows a little and handed it back to him motive for murder then i presumed so poor creature i must know who it is i appreciate your desire she said calmly you have not need to reinforce it if everyone were to go around murdering witnesses to indiscretion he was frustrated almost beyond the stretch of his temper he was now nearly sure she was concealing something from him if not knowledge at least strong suspicion she cut across him i do not approve of murder thomas she said staring up at him if i remember who it is i shall say so he had to be content with that he knew perfectly well she would say no more he took his leave with as much grace as he could muster and went out into the thickening fog he spent most of the rest of the day inquiring with the picture in his hand but no one else was prepared to admit having known the woman and by dusk he was cold his legs and feet ached there was a blister on his heel and he was hungry and thoroughly miserable then as the fourth hansom cab passed him without stopping and left him islanded under the gas lamp in a sea of icy vapor he had a sudden idea he had temporarily forgotten all about the other corpses presuming them incidental they had all died naturally only godolphin jones was murdered but perhaps there was some bizarre connection horatio snipe had been a procurer of women could his clientele have included godolphin joneseither for his own appetite or as subjects to photograph perhaps that was his particular fetishlewd photography he ran out into the street shouting at the next cab as it approached and reluctantly it pulled to a halt resurrection row he bellowed at the driver the man pulled a fearsome face but wheeled his horse round and started back muttering angrily under his breath about darkness and graveyards and what he hoped would happen to residents of such places if they hired cabs they could not pay for pitt almost fell out at the other end shoving coins at the alarmed driver and strode down along the barely lit pavement to find number fourteen where horrie snipes widow lived he had to knock and shout loudly enough to make a nuisance and send windows opening along the street with cries of abuse before she came to the door all right she said furiously all right she opened it and glared at him then as she recognized him her expression changed what do you want she said incredulously orries dead and buried twice you oughta know that it was you wot came wiv im the second time dont say someones dug im up again no maizie everythings fine can i come in if you ave to what do you want he squeezed in past her the room was small but there was a fire burning strongly and it was much cleaner than he would have expected there was even rather a good pair of candlesticks on the mantel shelf polished pewter and lace antimacassars over the backs of the chairs well she demanded impatiently i aint got nuffink in ere as isnt mineif thats what youre thinking it wasnt what i was thinking he pulled out the picture do you know her maizie she took it between her finger and thumb gingerly an what if i do theres ten shillings in it for you he said rashly if you give me her name and where i can find her bertha mulligan she said without hesitation lodges with mrs cuff down at number one thirtyseven straight down on the leftand side but you wont find er at ome this time o the evening i shouldnt wonder beginning work about now doing what she gave a snort of disgust at his stupidity for asking on the streets o course probably up in one of them cafes near the aymarket goodlookin girl bertha i see and does mrs cuff have other lodgers if you mean does she run an ouse then i says go and look for yourself i dont talk about me neighbors same as i dont expect no gossip about me nor poor orrie when e was alive i see thank you maizie wheres my ten bob he fished in his pocket and brought out string a knife sealing wax three pieces of paper a packet of toffees two keys and about a pounds worth of change he counted out ten shillings for her reluctantly it had been a promise made in the heat of discovery but her hand was out and there was no going back on it she snatched it checking it minutely thank you she closed her grip on it like a dying mans and put it into the reaches of her underskirts thats bertha all right why do you want to know her picture was found in a dead mans house he replied murdered yes who was it then godolphin jones the artist she might not have heard of him probably she could not read and the murder would be of little interest in this quarter she did not seem in the least surprised stupid girl she said imperturbably i told er not to go posin for im better to stick to what she knows but not er would try to better erself greedy she was i never like things on paper meself only leads to trouble he grabbed at her arm without thinking and she pulled away sharply you knew she posed for godolphin jones he demanded holding onto her of course i did she snapped do you take me for a fool i know what goes on in that shop of is shop what shop that shop of is a number fortyseven of course where e takes all the photographs and sells them disgusting i calls it i can understand a man who wants a girl and cant get one for isself like what orrie used to provide for but one what gets is fun out o lookin at pictures now thats what i call unealthy a flood of understanding washed over pitt and a whole world of possibilities opened thank you maizie he clasped her hand with a warmth that positively alarmed her you are a jewel among women a lily growing in a rubbish yard may heaven reward you and he turned and charged out of the door into the thick darkness of resurrection row crowing with delight alicia first heard of the death of godolphin jones from dominic he had spent a morning with somerset carlisle going over the names of those they could count on to support them when the bill came before the house in a few days time and the news had come whispered from servant to servant around the park carlisles kitchen maid had been keeping company with joness footman and had been among the first to hear dominic arrived at the fitzroyhammond house before luncheon looking breathless and a little white he was shown straight into the room where alicia was writing letters as soon as she saw him she knew something else was wrong the joy she had expected to feel evaporated and she was aware only of anxiety what is it he did not take her hands as usual they found the body of godolphin jones this morning he was murdered he made no attempt to tell her gently or evade the unpleasantness perhaps association with somerset carlisle and the workhouse in seven dials had made such qualities ridiculous even an offense against reality he was strangled to death about three or four weeks ago he went on and buried in someone elses gravethe man who fell off the cab and you first thought was augustus he turned out to be someones butler she was stunned bemused by the rapidity of fact after fact all new and jarringly ugly she had never even thought of godolphin jones as having anything to do with the corpses in fact since augustus was buried again she had tried to dismiss the whole matter from her thoughts dominic was far more important and over the last week her feelings about him had been becoming gradually less complete tinged with an unhappiness or perhaps an anxiety that she had tried alternately to resolve or to put from her mind now she simply stared at him naturally theyll be looking in the park he went on she was still confused not understanding him why why should anyone in the park kill him i dont know why anyone at all should kill him he said a trifle tersely but since you cannot strangle yourself even by accident obviously someone did but why here she persisted because he lived here and augustus lived here and augustuss corpse turned up here he sat down suddenly im sorry its wretched but i had to warn you because pitt is bound to come did you know himgodolphin jones he looked up at her no not really i met him once or twice he was socially acquainted he seemed pleasant enough he painted gwendoline and hester you know and i believe all three of the rodneys he didnt paint you he asked frowning a little no i didnt really care for his work and augustus never expressed any wish for a portrait she turned away a little and moved closer to the fire she was thinking of the murder but it seemed very impersonal no one she knew appeared to be involved no one was threatened by an investigation she remembered how terrified she had been when it had been augustusafraid other people would suspect her then even worse that they would suspect dominic to begin with the idea had been something outside herself outside both of them and she had felt they stood together facing an undeserved suspicion from those whose ignorance or malice would eventually be proved wrong then the old woman had sowed seeds in her mind of doubt that the circle was really so simple assuredly there was the circle that enclosed both of them in a common motive and held them apart from others but there was also another circle that enclosed her alone and it was a double barrier she was ashamed and frightened by itbut the thought had crept into her mind that dominic might have killed augustus the old woman had said he did and she had not brought the whole heart the absolute conviction to denying it that she would have wished indeed expected there was a streak in him a childlike reaching for his wants that had allowed her to believe it possible even if only for an instant how well did she know him she turned away from the fire to look at him now he was still as handsome with the elegant head and shoulders the way the hair grew on his neck strong neatly curved to the nape his face was the same the lines of his smile but how much more was there what did he think behind the face did she know those things and did she love them too when she looked at her own face in the glass she saw even features fine hair when she moved closer in the morning light she saw all the tiny flaws but she also knew how to disguise them the whole was pleasing even beautiful did dominic see any more than that did he see the flaws and still love her or would they disturb him even repel him because it was not what he had looked for believed in all he knew was the careful face she presented to him her best and perhaps she was at fault for that she had taken so much trouble to hide all the other facets the weaknesses and failings because she wanted him to love her had he wondered if she had killed augustus was that why he had been cooler lately and so absorbed in this bill of carlisles not sharing it with her she could have helped she had every bit as many connections as he in fact more if he had trusted her felt that unity she believed was love then he would have told her how he felt what fear or pity seven dials had stirred in him he would have tried to explain the confusion in terms not of social wrong but of his own emotions he was looking at her now waiting i dont suppose it has anything to do with us she said at last if mr pitt comes here i shall see him of course but i cannot tell him anything of value she smiled the nervousness all gone her stomach was as calm as sleep they both knew what had happened and it was a kind of release like silence after a crescendo of music too long and too loudnow she was back to reality again thank you for coming it was kind of you to tell me it is always easier to learn of bad news from a friend than a stranger he stood up very slowly for a moment she thought he was going to argue to try to pull back the threads but he smiled and for the first time they looked at each other without pretense or the delusionary quickening of the heart the flutter the urgent breath of course he said quietly perhaps it will be solved before it needs to trouble us now i must go and see fleetwood the bill comes up very soon now i know several people i might approach she said quickly do you his face was keen jones forgotten would you ask them anything you want to know call on carlisle hell be terribly grateful i have already written a few letters thats marvelous you know i think we really have a chance after he had gone she felt a loneliness but it was not a painful anxious thing as it used to be a longing to know when he would return worrying about all she had said and done whether she had been foolish or too cold or too forward wondering what he felt or thought of her this was more like the emptiness of a summer morning when the whole sky is clear with the day before you and you have no obligations and no idea what you intend to do the morning after he had spoken to maizie snipe pitt was back in resurrection row with a constable and a warrant to search the premises of number fortyseven it was what he had expected a photographic studio complete with all the props necessary for rather glossy pornography colored lights animal skins a few lengths of fabric of various vivid dyes headdresses of feathers strings of beads and an enormous bed the walls were covered with very skilled and very varied photographs all of them highly erotic cor the constable breathed out tremulously not sure what emotion he dare express his eyes were as round as boiled sweets and twice as glazed precisely pitt agreed a flourishing business i should say before you disturb anything look at everything very carefully and see if you can see any marks of blood or evidence of violence he may well have been killed here i should think there are a couple of hundred motives hanging on these walls or stuffed in the drawers oh the constable stood motionless appalled by the thought get on with it pitt urged weve a lot to do when youve searched everything start putting those photographs in order see how many different faces weve got oh mr pitt sir were never going to try and identify all them lot itll take years and whos going to admit to it anyway can you see any young girl saying yes thats me i ask you if its her face in the picture she cant very well argue can she pitt pointed to the far corner and jerked his head expressively get on with it my wifed have a fit if she knew i was doing this then dont tell her pitt said sharply but ill have one if you dont and im much more of a force to be reckoned with than she is the constable pulled a face and squinted at the photographs with one eye dont you believe it sir he said but he obeyed and within a few minutes had discovered marks of blood on the floor and on an overturned stool this is where e was killed i reckin he said decisively pleased with himself see it plain if you know where to look reckin e was likely it with this he touched the stool it was after the examination and the measuring that pitt left the constable to begin the immense task of sorting the photographs to identify the girls it was for pitt to consider the other half of the tradethe clients naturally jones was more discreet than to write down names of those who might be sensitive even violent about their association but pitt thought he knew at least where he might begin with the book of numbers and insects from joness desk in his house he had seen four of those elegant little hieroglyphics on pictures in gadstone park now he would go and question their owners perhaps they held an explanation to at least one mystery why anyone should pay so highly for the work of an artist that was at best of very moderate talent he began with gwendoline cantlay and this time he came to the point after only the briefest of preliminaries you paid a great deal of money for your portrait by mr jones lady cantlay she was cautious already sensing something beyond trivial enquiry i paid the usual price mr pitt as i think you will discover if you look a little further the usual price for mr jones maam he agreed but not usual for an artist of his rather indifferent quality her eyebrows rose in disbelief are you an art expert inspector she said heavily no but i have opportunity to counsel with experts maam and they seem to be agreed that godolphin jones was not worth anything like the prices he received here in the park she opened her mouth and began a question then stopped indeed perhaps art is only a matter of taste after all this was a scene he had played put so many times and always disliked secrets were almost always a matter of vulnerability an attempt to hide or reject a hurt of some sort but he had no alternative plastering over truth was not his job even though he would like it to have been are you sure maam that he was not selling something else with his paintingperhaps discretion i dont know what you mean it was the standard response and he could almost have said it for her she was going to resist as long as possible make him spell out his knowledge were you not at one time fonder of mr jones than you would wish known lady cantlayespecially say by your husband her face flushed scarlet and it was several painful seconds before she could decide what to say to him whether to continue to deny it or if anger would help in the end she recognized the certainty in his face and gave in i was extremely foolish carried away by the glamour of an artist i supposeand flatteredbut it is all past inspector some time ago and yes you are correct i did commission the picture before myrelationshipand then paid rather more for it when it was completed to insure his silence i would not have accepted it for such an amount otherwise she hesitated and he waited for her ii would be obliged if you would not discuss it with my husband he does not know of it are you quite sure oh yes of course i am he would be all the color drained from her skin oh godolphin was murdered you cannot think desmondi assure you i give you my most absolute wordthat he did not know he could not have it was all most discreetonly when i went to sit for my portrait she did not know what else to say to convince him and she cast around for some form of proof it was against all his convictions to feel sorry for her and yet he did they had nothing in common and her behavior had been selfindulgent and thoughtless but he found that he did believe her and had no wish to prolong her fear thank you lady cantlay if he did not know of the matter he would have had no cause to wish mr jones any harm so far as we know i appreciate your candor the subject need not be raised again he stood up good day she was too relieved to say anything but a faint automatic good day in return pitt called next on major rodney and here his reception was totally different wiping away every trace of the rather ebullient feeling with which he had left the cantlays selfsatisfaction disappeared like water down a large sink you are extremely insolent sir the major said furiously and i have not the least notion of what you are imagining this is gadstone park not one of your back streets i dont know what kind of behavior you are accustomed to but we know how to conduct ourselves here and if you persist in suggesting that my sisters have had some sort of liaison with this wretched artist i shall sue you for slander do you understand me sir pitt tried with difficulty to keep his patience the idea of godolphin jones in a romantic involvement with either of the two elderly jammaking ladies was ridiculous and in taking refuge behind it major rodney was obscuring the issue very effectively whether on purpose or not pitt doubted him capable of the strategy but the result was the same i have not suggested anything of the kind sir he said as calmly as he was able but the hard frayed edges of his temper showed indeed the possibility had not occurred to me both because i would not have considered your sisters to be ladies of a temperament or an age to indulge in such things nor did i know they had purchased the pictures themselves i had believed it to be you who had commissioned mr jones the major was temporarily thrown off balance his cause for outrage had vanished just as he was getting into his stride and all ready to demand that pitt leave the house pitt pressed home his advantage are the ladies of private property he asked they were both unmarried and could not be heiresses since they had a brother so it was almost impossible and he knew it the major was growing increasingly redder in the face our financial affairs are not your concern sir he snapped i dare say it would seem like wealth to you but it is merely adequate for us we do not care to be ostentatious but we have means certainly and that is all i am prepared to say but you did commission two large and expensive picture from mr jones costing nine hundred seventyfive pounds in total pitt had added up the columns next to the caterpillars and had the satisfaction of seeing the majors face pale and his neck tighten with shock ii demand to know where you gained such information who told you pitt opened his eyes wider as if the question were foolish mr jones kept records sir very precise records dates and amounts of payments i had only to add them up to find the total it was hardly necessary to trouble anyone else the majors body went slack and he sat like a welltrained child at table eyes forward hands still but no substance inside him for a long time he was silent and pitt hated the necessity for digging out of him whatever wretched secret it was that jones had blackmailed him with but there was no alternative there was no time of the crime to use to eliminate people no weapon but hands the strength of which would almost certainly rule out a woman certainly any society woman possibly a servant used to manual work wringing heavy wet laundry might have had the power at the moment he could think of no avenue except to learn all the truth he could the major was a small man inarticulate rigidly stiff within himself both bodily and emotionally but he had been a soldier he had seen death before and been taught how to kill had learned to become familiar with the idea and to accept it as part of himself to know that at times it could be his duty was his secret of sufficient importance to him that he would have strangled godolphin jones and then buried him in albert wilsons grave why did you pay so much for those two pictures major rodney pitt pressed again the major focused his eyes and looked at him with dislike because that was the mans price he said coldly i am no expert in art that was what everyone else paid him if it was excessive then i was misled so were we all the man was a charlatan if what you say is true but you will forgive me if i do not accept your opinion as final his voice was heavy with sarcasm and from the weight of his tone pitt guessed it an unfamiliar sentiment major rodney stood up and now sir i have said all i have to say to you i wish you good day there was no point in struggling and pitt knew it he would have to find out the secret some other way and return when he had more ammunition perhaps it was only some foolishness something jones had discovered from another patron possibly an indiscretion with a woman and rodneys sense of honor forbade him from saying so or maybe it was a genuine matter of shame to him an incident of cowardice in the crimea or some other barrackroom weakness a gambling debt welched on or a drunken escapade for now he would have to leave it in the early afternoon he called on st jermyn and found that he was out at the house of lords he was obliged to return in the evening cold and tired and well past the best of his temper his lordship was also irritated at not being able to relax and forget the business of the day over a glass of something from the pick of his cellars before considering dinner he was civil to pitt with something of an effort i have already told you everything i know about the man he said tartly moving over to the fire he was a fashionable artist i commissioned a picture from him to please my wife i expect i have met him socially on one or two occasions after all he lived here in the park but i meet hundreds of people i recall he was a trifle oddlooking rather too much hair he gave pitt a sour look his eye going to pitts own scruffy head but then one expects artists to be a little affected he continued it was not enough to be offensive just rather obvious im sorry the fellow is dead but i dare say he mixed with a few less salubrious people possibly he became overfamiliar with one of his models as well as society artists frequently paint women of far lower classes who happen to have the coloring or the features they want i imagine you know that as well as i do i should look for a jealous lover or husband if i were you we havent been able to trace any pictures of women other than society portraits pitt replied he doesnt seem to have been prolific at all in fact rather reserved but anything he did do he sold at greatly inflated prices so you implied before st jermyn said drily i dont have any comment on that i would have thought portraits needed only to please the sitter one seldom would wish to resell them they usually get relegated to a back hallway or stair if one loses ones taste for them otherwise they remain wherever they were hung in the first place you paid a considerable amount for the portrait of lady st jermyn pitt tried again st jermyns eyebrows rose you also remarked on that the last time you were here she seemed to like the picture which was all that concerned me if i did pay too much then i was duped im really not very concerned about it i dont see why you should be pitt had already racked his brain to think of some reason any at all why jones should have been able to put pressure on st jermyn to buy a picture he did not like or at a price he thought unfair but he had come up with nothing to press lady cantlay in return for discretion would be easy and recalling the stiff nervous figure of the major that was certainly believable although he did not yet know the reason a middleaged socially inarticulate man living with two maiden sistersthe probability was obviousanother indiscretion pride would force the major to pay for silence but st jermyn was a totally different man there was no fear in him he would cover his indiscretions if there were any and he cared about them which again was doubtful and there was no other crime that pitt knew of lord augustus had died normally or if he had not it was unprovable and of no interest he knew of to st jermyn either way all the othersarthur wilson porteous and horrie snipehad also died naturally and again as far as pitt knew had no connection with st jermyn if it was a jealous lover or husband pitt said slowly why was he found in another mans grave to hide him i presume st jermyn said impatiently i would have thought that was obvious a freshdug grave anywhere in london except in a graveyard would excite attention pretty quickly you cant go digging up parks and if you put it in your own garden it would be damning if it were found in someone elses freshly turned grave it would invite no remark at all but why put the corpse of albert wilson on a cab box i really dont know inspector it is your job to find that out not mine possibly there was no reason at all it sounds the bizarre kind of thing an artist might do more likely the grave was already robbed and he merely took an excellent opportunity when it was presented to him pitt had already thought of that for himself but he was still hoping for a new thread some error of control a slip of the tongue that would give him another line to follow did lord augustus fitzroyhammond know mr jones he asked as innocently as he could st jermyn looked at him coldly not so far as i am aware and if you are suggesting he might have had some sort of affaire with one of joness models i think it highly unlikely pitt had to admit to himself it would also be too much of a coincidence if augustus had first killed jones and taken advantage of the grave robbers activities to hide him and then immediately afterwards died himself and become a victim of the same robber he looked across at st jermyn and fancied he saw a perception of the unlikelihood in his face also and a barely concealed and rapidly growing impatience pitt tried to think of something else to ask anything that might draw more information but st jermyn was not a man who could be manipulated and pitt gave in at least for the time being thank you my lord he said stiffly i appreciate your time a matter of duty st jermyn acknowledged drily the footman will see you out there was nothing to do but accept it with as much grace as possible and he left the bright room and accompanied the liveried footman to the step and out into the thick obliterating fog dominic had seldom been so enveloped and excited by anything as he was by st jermyns bill now that he had ceased to fight it in his mind and given himself over to it he found more and more pleasure in carlisles company he was literate intelligent and above all an enthusiast he had the rare gift of being able to pursue even the most appalling facts about workhouse conditions without losing his optimism that something could be done to alleviate them or his ability to find humor however wry in the midst of what would otherwise have been despair dominic found it hard to emulate he had sought out lord fleetwood with trepidation and some selfconsciousness the friendship had increased more easily than he had expected his natural charm was something he always underrated but he never managed to guide the conversation successfully into the reality of workhouse tragedy every time it was acknowledged in words they rang hollow like one reciting with perfect pronunciation a language he does not understand after two attempts dominic became more conscious of the urgency and admitted frankly to carlisle that he needed his help accordingly the day after because of the influence fleetwood might have carlisle joined dominic and fleetwood in the park for a spanking drive at a speed that scattered the few pedestrians and sent other drivers and riders into paroxysms of rage or envy depending upon the strength and direction of their own ambitions dominic had driven and although it was with a recklessness he would not normally have dared today he was past caring for anything so trivial as social outrage or a few thrown paraders landed hard upon their dignity on the damp ground marvelous fleetwood said with delight catching his breath my god dominic you drive like jehu i swear i never though you had it in you if you come and drive my team in the spring ill consider it a favor from you of course dominic agreed instantly his mind on the workhouse and a trade favor for favor he would not even consider now how he could find the courage to drive in such a fashion in cold blood and with weeks to contemplate it beforehand and to fully appreciate all the possible disasters he thrust it away to some improbable future delighted to brilliant carlisle agreed his tongue in his cheek but fleetwood did not see it you have a natural art dominic he turned to fleetwood both their faces red with cold and the fierce wind of their passage but you have a very fine team indeed my lord ive seen few better animals though i think perhaps the springing of your carriage could be improved a little fleetwood grinned he was a pleasant young man not handsome but of a countenance that spoke of abundant good nature bounce you around a bit did it never mind good for the digestion wasnt thinking of the digestion carlisle replied with a smile or the bruises rather more of the balance of the thing a wellbalanced carriage is a lot easier on the horses takes the corners better and is less likely to overturn if you get some idiot run into you and of course if you do get an excitable animal less likely for the whole thing to get away with you damn but youre right fleetwood said cheerfully sorry i misjudged you sold you short a bit ill have to get it seen to must have it right i know a chap in the devils acre who can spring a carriage to balance like a bird in flight carlisle offered with a casual air as if it were of no interest to him merely a graceful gesture after an early mornings companionship the devils acre fleetwood said incredulously where the deuce is that around westminster carlisle threw it away dominic watched him with admiration if he could have been so light perhaps he could have interested fleetwood he had been too earnest too full of urgency and the horror of it no one but a ghoul wanted horror least of all with breakfast around westminster fleetwood repeated you mean that awful slum area is that what they call it appropriate i would have thought carlisles peaked eyebrows went up filthy place what took you there fleetwood handed the horse over to the groom and the three of them went together toward the public house where breakfast and a steaming drink awaited them oh this and that carlisle dismissed it with a wave of his arm as though it were gentlemans business that any other gentleman would understand and be too discreet to mention further its slums fleetwood said again when they were inside and well started on a rich and excellent meal how would anyone there know about balancing and springing a carriage there isnt room to drive one let alone race it carlisle finished his mouthful and swallowed used to be an ostler he said easily stole from his master or anyway was accused of it fell on hard times simple fleetwood loved and understood horses he felt a comradeship with those who tended them and were obliged to make a living he had spent many a companionable hour swapping opinions and tales with his own grooms poor beggar he said with feeling maybe hed be glad of a job a few shillings for seeing what he can do to improve that carriage of mine i should think so carlisle agreed always try him if you like moves around a bit have to catch him soon good idea if youd dome the kindness appreciate it where do i find him carlisle smiled broadly in the devils acre youd never find him alone this side of doomsday ill take you id be obliged sounds an insalubrious spot oh it is carlisle agreed it is indeed but skill is often to be found best where it grows the hardest there is something in mr darwins idea of survival of the fittest you know as long as you count cleverest strongest and most cunning as the fittest and dont tangle it up with any moral ideas fittest needs to mean fittest to survive not most virtuous most patient most charitable or of most benefit to the rest of mankind dominic kicked him abruptly under the table and saw his face tweak with pain he was terrified he would spoil the whole issue by moralizing and lose fleetwood even now youre saying that the race does go to the swift and the battle to the strong after all fleetwood took himself another helping of kedgeree no carlisle refrained from rubbing his ankle with difficulty but he did not look at dominic only that places like the devils acre breed peculiar skills because without them the poor do not survive the fortunate can be any kind of a fool and get by but the unfortunate have to have a use to someone or they assuredly perish fleetwood screwed up his face that seems a little cynical if i may say so still i would like to see this fellow of yours youve convinced me he knows what hes doing carlisle smiled his face suddenly alight with warmth fleetwood responded like a flower opening to the sun he smiled back and dominic found himself included in the blithe good fellowship he felt a little guilty because he knew what fleetwood had in front of him but he refused to think of it now it was a good cause a necessary one he smiled back with equal charm and an almost straight eye the devils acre was horrific in the pall of smoke and fog the great towers of the minster hung over them their gothic glory lost in wraiths of vapor all the bracing air of the park was stilled and dampened to a chill stagnancy that sat like dead water from the shadows of the towers in the sky past the pillared and porticoed homes of the rich and business houses down to the modest dwellings of traders and clerks below them was a separate world of its own a world of creaking ratridden tenements with teeming alleys of walls that were forever wet and crumbling of air that was soured by rimed mold idlers beggars and drunks littered the way carlisle strode through it as though it were nothing to remark oh god fleetwood clutched his nose and darted a desperate glance at dominic but carlisle was not waiting if they were not to lose him they must follow closely heaven forbid they should become lost in such a hellhole as this carlisle appeared to know where he was going he picked his way over sleeping drunks under a pile of newspapers kicked an empty bottle out of the way and climbed up a flight of rickety stairs they swayed under his weight and fleetwood looked alarmed as dominic hastened him onto them also do you think theyll hold he asked knocking his hat askew on the beam above god knows dominic replied stepping past him and going up a good deal of his mind sympathized with fleetwood recalling his own feelings in seven dials which had been less fearful than this but there was also a strong tide in him that enjoyed it tasting what carlisle knew the passion to alter this world to force the innocent the unknowing to look at it to see and taste all of it and to care the emotion inside him was fierce almost volcanic he went up the stairs two by two and dived after carlisle into a fetid mass of rooms where families of tens and dozens sat in the sickly light carving polishing sewing weaving or gluing together to make all manner of articles to be sold for a few pence children as small as three or four years old sat tied to their mothers by string so they did not wander from work every time one of them stopped his labor or fell asleep the mother would clout him over the head to wake him up and remind him that idle hands made for empty stomachs the smell was fearful a mixture of wet mold smoke and coal fumes sewage and unwashed bodies at the far end of the particular tenement they emerged into a dank courtyard that must once have been a mews and carlisle stopped and knocked on a cutaway door dominic looked at fleetwood his face was pale and his eyes looked deep and frightened dominic guessed he would long ago have run away had he had even the faintest idea which way to go or how to get back to the world he knew he must have seen things even his nightmares had not conjured up the door opened and a lean bent little man peered out he seemed to be lopshouldered as if one side of him were longer than the other it was a moment before he recognized carlisle oh its you is it what do you want this time a little of your skill timothy carlisle said with a smile for a consideration naturally what kind of skill timothy demanded looking suspiciously over carlisles shoulder at dominic and fleetwood not rozzers are they shame on you timothy carlisle said with heavy disgust when did you ever know me to keep company with the police what skill timothy repeated why the balancing of fine carriages of course carlisle said with a twist to his face his lordship here he indicated fleetwood has an excellent pair and a fine chance of winning a few gentlemens races private wagers and the like if he can get his carriage balanced to do justice to them timothys face lit up ah course i can do suffink about that balancin makes all the difference wheres this ere carriage then you tell me and ill fix it for yer to run smooth as a weasel i will for a consideration like of course fleetwood agreed quickly holcombe park house ill write the address for you no good guvi dont read tell mei remember anything reckon it dulls the memory readin dont do you no good in the long run reckon them as writes down everythin dont remember their own name if they keeps it up long enough carlisle never missed a chance he took this one as a swift bird takes an insect on the wing with barely a flicker but theres work for men who can read and write timothy he said leaning on the door regular work in offices that close in the evening and send you home jobs that pay enough money to live on timothy spat id die of hunger and old age afore i learn to read and write now he said in disgust dont know what you want to say a thing like that for carlisle patted the mans shoulder for the future timothy he said quietly and for those who dont know how to balance a racing gig theres undreds o thousands what cant read nor write timothy looked at him sourly i know that carlisle conceded and there are hundreds of thousands who are hungryin fact i believe its roughly one in four in londonbut is that any reason why you shouldnt have a good meal if you can get it timothys face screwed up and he looked at fleetwood fleetwood rose to the occasion a good meal all you can eat before you do the job he promised and a guinea afterwards ill make a wagera fiver if i win the first race with it after that youre on timothy said instantly ill be there for dinner tonight start work in the morning good you can sleep in the stable timothy lifted his scruffy hat in a sort of salute perhaps a sealing of the bargain and carlisle turned to leave again fleetwood repeated the address with instructions on how to reach it then ran after carlisle before he was lost to sight and he found himself marooned in the nightmare place they passed through the worst of the rookery again and toppled out into the fine rain of a narrow street almost underneath the shadow of the church dear god fleetwood wiped his face makes me think of dante and the gates of hellwhat was it written over the cave abandon hope all ye who enter here carlisle said quietly how in the name of humanity do they bear it fleetwood turned up his collar and drove his hands into his pockets its better than the workhouse carlisle replied at least they reckon it is personally it seems much the same to me fleetwood stopped better he said in broad disbelief what are you talking about man the workhouse provides food and shelter safety its a charitable place all the anger was purged out of carlisles face his voice was a gentle as milk have you ever been to one fleetwood was surprised no he said honestly have you oh yes carlisle started walking again ive been working quite hard on this bill of st jermyns i dare say youve heard of it yes fleetwood said slowly yes i have he did not look at dominic and dominic did not dare to look at him i suppose youd like my help when it comes up in the house fleetwood said casually carlisle flashed him a dazzling smile yesyes please i would alicia had written to everyone she could think of recalling a good few of augustuss relatives who had married well and whom she would never have contacted for any other reason she found most of them insufferably dull but the cause overrode all her previous inhibitions when she had exhausted her imagination on the subject and everything was sealed and in the post she decided to go for a walk in the park in spite of the miserable weather she had a feeling of good spirits inside her that simply cried for exercise for the stretching of the body and opening of the lungs had it not been so absolutely ridiculous she would have liked to run and skip like a child she was striding along in a fashion unbefitting a lady her head in the air enjoying the bleak beauty of the trees against the ragged clouds far above in the park it was almost still heavy drops glistened and dripped from twigs she had never considered february had any loveliness before but now she took pleasure in the stark simplicity of it the soft subdued colors she had stopped to watch a bird in branches above her when she was aware of overhearing a conversation immediately the other side of the tree did you really the voice was so soft that she did not at first recognize it there appeared to be no answer come and tell me all about it then the voice continued again there was silence except for a faint squeak my well how about that you are a clever girl then she knew it at least she was almost sure she did it sounded too soft too american to be anyone but virgil smith but whom on earth was he talking to my you are beautiful well come on now tell me all about it an appalling thought came to her he must be making advances to some servant or streetwalker how dreadful and she had accidentally come upon him how could she possibly get away without embarrassing them both quite unforgettably she froze still there was no reply from whomever he was speaking to you pretty thing he was still talking gently softly you beautiful girl she could not stay any longer overhearing a conversation that was obviously desperately private she took a step to creep in the lee of the tree trunk till she was back on the path and could affect not to have noticed him her foot cracked on a twig and it broke loudly he stood up and came around enormous in a greatcoat square like the tree itself alicia shut her eyes her face burning up with her distress for him she was sure it must be scarlet she would have given anything not to have been witness to his shameful conduct good morning lady alicia he said with the softness she had heard in it before good morning mr smith she replied swallowing hard she must force herself to carry it off with some aplomb he was an american and a social impossibility but she should know how to conduct herself whatever the occasion she opened her eyes he was standing in front of her holding a little calico cat that was stretching and curling under his arms he saw her glazed look and glanced down at the animal his fingers running gently over its fur she could hear the little creature singing even from where she was the color rose up to his face also when he realized she had overheard him talking to it oh he said a little awkwardly dont mind me maam i often talk to animals especially cats im kind of fond of this one in particular she breathed out a sigh of immense relief she found she was grinning foolishly a sudden bubbling happiness inside her she stretched out her fingers to touch the cat virgil smith was smiling too a shining tenderness in his face for the first time she recognized it and knew what it was only for a moment did it surprise her then it seemed like something familiar amazing and beautiful like the leaves bursting open in the milky sunshine of spring pitt considered what might be reasonable what he might expect to receive and then requested three additional constables to help him with the enormous task of sorting and identifying the photographs in godolphin joness shop he was granted one along with the one he already had he dispatched them both back to resurrection row with instructions to find a name for every face and then an occupation and a social background but not to allow any part of the picture to be seen other than the head and to ask no questions and to give no information as to where or in what circumstances the photographs had been found this last instruction had been repeated to him by his superiors with much anxiety and a great deal of hemming and hawing as to whether there might not be some other way of tackling the whole matter one superintendent even suggested tentatively that perhaps it would be advisable to overlook the tragedy as insoluble and turn their attention to something else there was for example a nasty case of burglary that was still outstanding and it would be a most useful thing if they could recover the property pitt pointed out that jones had been a society artist and that anyone who had lived in an area like gadstone park could not be murdered and then merely forgotten or other residents of such areas would feel distinctly uneasy as to their own future safety the point was conceded him unhappily then pitt himself went back to the park and major rodney this time he would not be put off by the majors anger or protestations he could no longer afford to be if the murderer of godolphin jones had taken advantage of the grave robbings to hide his own crime as st jermyn had suggested then the death of lord augustus was irrelevant there was no point in looking any further for sense or connection between albert wilson horrie snipe w w porteous and lord augustus because there was none as far as either motive or means was concerned the murder of godolphin jones stood alone the key to them surely lay in the pornography shop in resurrection row or in the little book with its hieroglyphic insects or both it was possible the murderer was one of any number of women whose faces were on those photographs or perhaps someone else he had blackmailed as he had done gwendoline cantlay but surely the number of affaires he had had must be severely limited by both time and opportunity by all accounts he was not an abnormally charming man he might have flattered liberally but society beauties were used to that on the whole pitt inclined to think his romantic opportunities slight the blackmail must lie in other areas as well which brought pitt back once again to resurrection row and the photographs he was at major rodneys door the butler answered and suffered him to enter with the look of weary acceptance of one who is resigned to something unpleasant but inevitable pitt had felt the same when toothache had finally driven him to the dentist the major received him with illconcealed impatience i have nothing else to add inspector pitt he said waspishly if you cannot do better than to go over and over old ground pestering people then it would be better if you were to pass the case over to someone more competent you are making a nuisance of yourself pitt would not be pressured to apologize it stuck in his throat murder is an untidy and annoying business sir he replied he towered over the major putting him at a disadvantage the major waved to a chair and ordered pitt to sit down he sat on a straightbacked chair himself ramrodstiff reversing the advantage so now he could look down on pitt sprawled in a deep sofa his coat falling open and his scarf undone in the warmth of the room the majors confidence was somewhat restored well what is it now he demanded i have told you that i had very little personal acquaintance with mr jones no more than civility required and i have shown you the portraits i really cannot think of anything else i am not a man to make other peoples business my concern i do not listen to gossip and i will not permit my sisters to repeat such as they cannot help overhearing since it is in the nature of women to talk mostly upon trivial matters pitt would like to have arguedhe could imagine what charlotte would have said to such a condemnation of womenbut the major would not have understood him and he had no place to discuss such subjects this was not a friendship and they were not equals it was not for him to question the majors convictions indeed he replied gossip can be a great evil and much of it is false although i have often gained valuable insight into the nature or personality of people by listening to it what one man says of another may be false but the fact that he says it at all tells me that the man is a gossipmonger and a liar to boot the major snapped i have nothing but contempt for you or for an occupation which obliges you to indulge in such vices he stared at pitt fiercely seeming to burn him with indignation precisely pitt agreed what a man says may tell nothing of the object of his speech but it tells a great deal about him what the major was startled it took him several moments to digest pitts meaning when you open your mouth you may or may not betray another but you assuredly betray yourself pitt repeated a new thought had come to him about major rodney and his feelings towards women huh the major snorted never went in for sophistry soldierall my life man for doing things not sitting around talking about it better for you if youd been in the army make a man of you he looked at pitts clothes the way he was sitting and pitt could almost see in his face the vision of the drill sergeant the barber and the parade ground and the miraculous change that could be wrought in a man he smiled blissful that it would never be of course there are many women with mischievous tongues pitt observed feeding the major the thoughts he wanted and idleness is a schoolmaster of evil the major was again surprised he had not expected such perception in a policeman especially this one quite he agreed that is why i do all i can to see that my sisters are kept occupied good homely tasks and of course such study as they are capable of in the care of homes and gardens and so forth what about current affairs or a little history pitt inquired leading him gently current affairs dont be foolish man women have neither the interest nor the capacity for such things and it is unsuitable in them i see you dont know women very well not very pitt lied i believe you were married sir the major blinked he had not anticipated the question i was my wife died a long time ago very unfortunate pitt commiserated were you married long a year tragic all over now got over it years ago not like getting used to a thing hardly knew her really i was a soldieraway fighting for my queen and country price of duty quite so pitt did not have to affect pity he was beginning to feel it like a welling bitter spring inside him as his idea grew stronger and women are not always the companions one hopes he added the majors face sank into lines of quiet reflection looking back on disillusions the reality was unpleasing but the recognition of it gave him a certain satisfaction in having overcome even a sense of superiority over those who had yet to face it they are different from men he agreed shallow creatures for the most nothing to talk about but fashion the way they look and other similar foolishness always laughing at nothing at all a man cannot take much of that unless hes as big a fool as they are the idea crystallized in pitts brain now was the time to put it to the test extraordinary thing about these bodies he said casually the majors head jerked up bodies what bodies keep turning up pitt watched him first the man on the cab box then lord augustus then porteous then horatio snipe he saw the majors eye flicker and his adams apple move did you know horrie snipe sir never heard of him the major swallowed are you sure sir do you question my word shall we say your memory sir pitt hated it but he had to continue and the more quickly it was done the shorter the pain he was a procurer of women and he worked in the resurrection row area the same place godolphin jones kept his pornography shop perhaps that revives your recollection a bit he caught the majors eye and held it in a hard candid gaze that allowed no retreat no mercy of pretended ignorance the color wavered then swept up the majors mottled skin he was ugly and pathetic hurting pitt in a way perhaps he did not hurt himself he could not see how fragile how unused he looked how much of him had never grown he could find no words he could not admit it and he dared no longer deny it was that what godolphin jones was blackmailing you with pitt asked quietly he knew about horrie snipes woman and he sold you photographs the major sniffed tears started running down his cheeks and he was furious with himself for showing weakness hating pitt for seeing it i didi did not kill him he said between gulps to control himself before god i did not kill him pitt did not doubt it for a moment the major would never have killed himhe needed him for his private dreams his pictures and fantasies where he could live out the mastery he could never achieve in life jones was doubly precious to him since horrie snipe had died just before him cutting the major off from his brief wild adventure into the realms of live women no pitt said quietly i dont suppose you did he stood up looking down on the rigid little man wanting to get out into the fog and drizzle and escape from the despair inside im sorry it has been necessary to discuss this it need not be mentioned again the major looked up his eyes watering your report you are not a suspect sir that is all i shall say the major sniffed he could not bring himself to thank pitt pitt let himself out and breathed in the bitter fog with a sense of release almost of warmth within him but it was not a solution suddenly the little notebook seemed much less promising without searching the drawing rooms of london he knew of no way of finding all the rest of the pictures that carried the hieroglyphic insects and there was no proof that the owners were all victims of blackmail or any other sort of pressure possibly they were simply customers for the photographs as well and godolphin jones had chosen this disguised and highly profitable way of collecting his fee to have his art paid for at such inflated prices was a double reward because it enhanced his professional reputation in a way his skill never could pitt was obliged to admire his ingenuity if nothing else about him but if they were customers for his pornographic pictures they would be the last people to wish him dead one did not cut off ones source of supply especially of something that one desperately wished to be kept secret and that was presumably in its own way addictive there was of course another possibility a rival in the market that was a thought that had not occurred to him before joness work was good at least he had a better eye than most practitioners in the field that pitt had come across although admittedly his experience was slight he had not worked in the vice areas by choice but it fell to the lot of every policeman now and again and all the photographs he had seen before had been pathetic and obvious in their banality portrayals of nakedness and very little more these of joness had at least some pretensions to art of a decadent sort there was a little subtlety in them a use of light and shade even a certain wit yes very possibly some other merchant in the same trade had found himself squeezed out of the market and had rebelled in the only way he knew how effectiveand permanent pitt spent the rest of that day and all the following one questioning his colleagues in all of the stations within three or four miles of either gadstone park or resurrection row to catch up on whatever was known about current dealers in pornographic pictures when he finally reached home after seven oclock and found charlotte waiting for him a little anxiously he was beyond giving her an explanation and inside himself blessed her for not asking one her silence was the most companionable thing he could think of he sat all evening in front of the fire without speaking she was wise enough to occupy herself with knitting making no sound but the clicking of her needles he did not wish to relive the squalor he had seen the twisting of minds and emotions until all affections became mere appetites and the titillation of those appetites for financial gain so many sad little people clutching paper women fornicating in and dominated by fantasies all flesh and prurient frightened mind and no heart at all and he had learned nothing of use except that no one knew of a rival with either the need or the imagination to have killed godolphin jones and buried him in albert wilsons grave in the morning he set out again with nothing left but to return to the shop in resurrection row and the photographs the two constables were there when he arrived both of them leaped up redfaced as he opened the door oh its you mr pitt one of them said hastily didnt know who it might be does anyone else have a key pitt asked with a twisted smile holding up the one he had had cut no sir not exceptin us o course but you never know e might ave ad he trailed off the idea of an accomplice was never likely and the look on pitts face told him it was useless yes sir he sat down again we just about got em all sorted his companion said proudly i reckon as theres about fiftythree different girls all told lot of em e used a fair number o times i suppose there arent that many women as can do this sort o thing and not for long pitt agreed his amusement vanishing a few years on the streets a few children and you cant strip off in front of the camera any more unkind thing the camera doesnt tell any comfortable lies do you know any of the girls the constables back went rigid and his ears burned red who me sir professionally pitt coughed your profession not theirs oh the other constable ran his fingers round his collar yes sir i ave seen one or two cautioned em like told em to move on or go ome and beave theirselves good pitt smiled discreetly put them on one side with names if you remember them then give me the best picture of each and ill start checking the best one sir the constables eyes opened wide his eyebrows almost to the roots of his hair the clearest face pitt snapped ohyes sir they both started sorting rapidly and in a few moments handed pitt about thirty photographs thats all were sure of so far sir we should ave em all by lunchtime good then you can start round the brothels and rooming houses as well ill begin in resurrection row going north you can go south be back here by six oclock and well see what we have yes sir what are we looking for sir really a jealous lover or husband or more likely a woman who had a great deal to lose if people found out she posed for this sort of picture like a society woman the constable was dubious picking up one of the photographs and squinting at it i doubt it pitt agreed possibly middleclass after something a little daring to do more likely respectable workingclass hard up or a servant with aspirations right sir well get this lot sorted and be on our way pitt left them to it and went out into the row to begin the first rooming house got rid of three on his list they were handsome professional prostitutes who had been glad of the extra money and rather amused by the whole thing he was about to leave when on a sudden chance he decided to show them the rest of the pictures oh now love a big blond one shook her head at him you wouldnt expect me to go around naming other people would you what i do meself is one thing but talkin about other girls is something else im going to find them anyway he pointed out she grinned then good luck to you love you ave fun lookin he did not want to say anything about murder he had not said anything about it to the landlady either it was a crime for hanging and everyone knew it the shadow of the gallows closed even the most garrulous moths if they did not know so much the better im only looking for one girl he said reasonably just have to eliminate all the rest she narrowed bright blue painted eyes at him why whats she done somebody made a complaint no he was perfectly honest and he hoped it showed not at all as far as i know all your customers are perfectly satisfied she gave him a wide smile you got a quid to spare then love no he smiled back goodnaturedly i want to know how many of the rest of these are regular working girls who dont have any objection to anyone knowing what they do she was quick a touch o the black is it thats right he was startled by her perception he must not underrate her again blackmail dont like blackmailers she screwed up her face give us them again then he passed one over hopefully then another she looked at it then reached for the next cor she let out her breath bit much of er aint there dont ardly need a bustle do she backside like the battersea gasworks who is she he tried to keep a straight face dunno gimme the next one ah thats gertie tiller shed a done that for a laugh nobodyll black er for it tell em where to go she would she handed it back and pitt put it in his left pocket with the others he had dismissed and thats elsie biddock looks better without er clothes on than she does with em thats ena jessel although thats never all er air must be a wig she looks damn silly in all them feathers could you put the black on her pitt inquired never proud of it like as not never seen er reckon shes an amateur you could try er amateurs is scared rotten some of em poor bleeders just tryin to get a bit on the side to make ends meet pay the rent an feed theirselves pitt put it back in his right pocket and er dont know er neither another for the right pocket shes a looney daft as a brush she is couldnt black er she asnt the sense to be scared of anything goes with all sorts and er two for a pair they are thank you two more disposed of she took the rest one by one youre goin to be busy arent you love sorry know a few o their faces but cant remember where and dont know their names or anythin about them that all thats a great help thank you very much youre welcome could you put in a good word for me with the local rozzers pitt smiled least said the better he replied i dare say if you dont bother them theyll be happy enough to pretend they dont see you either live and let live she agreed ta love find your own way out ill manage he gave her a little salute with his hand and went back out into the street the next three places enabled him to write off a dozen more this list was going down rapidly so far there was no one who would be likely to be greatly concerned by any part of the affair least of all their own involvement in it by the end of the day the three of them had identified and dismissed all but half a dozen of the faces the following day was harder as pitt had known it would be they had identified the professionals now they were looking for the women driven to the streets by poverty and fear those who would be ashamed it was among these he expected to find the tragedy that had stretched and swelled until the burden was unbearable and had ended in murder he had talked to the constables probably far too long investing too much of his own feelings of anger and pity in his words if they did not feel it themselves already then they were not capable of understanding what his words could only frame he had been aware of it at the time he was speaking and yet he had still gone on by halfpast ten he had found two women who had worked all day in a sweatshop sewing shirts with children pinned to their chairs and walked the streets at night to pay the rent the sweatshop master looked sideways at him but he snapped viciously back that all he wanted was to find the witness to an accident and if he were not prepared to help the police the best he could pitt would see to it personally that the shop was turned over at least twice a week to look for stolen goods the man asked tartly how if she was only a witness to an accident pitt came to have her photograph pitt could not think of an answer to that so he glared at the man and told him that it was a secret of police procedure and that unless he wanted a much closer relationship with the police than he already had he would mind his own business that produced the desired silence on the subject and a grudging admission that at least two of the women worked for him and pitt could speak to them if he must but to be quick about it because time wasted was money lost and the women needed all they earned policemen might get paid to stand around and talk but they did not the afternoon was much the same finding one frightened woman after another ashamed of what she was doing afraid of being exposed and yet unable to manage on what sweatshop masters paid and terrified of the workhouse at all costs they wanted to keep their children out of the institutionalized regimented despair of the workhouses they feared losing their children to fostering out perhaps never to see them again or even to know if they had survived to adulthood what was taking off ones clothes for an hour or two to titillate some anonymous man one would never see again in exchange for enough money to live for a month by the time he came back to the police station at nine oclock rain soaking his trousers and boots and running down the back of his neck he had found only two exceptions one was an ambitious and rebellious little maid who had dreams of becoming rich and starting her own hat shop the other was completely different a very practiced woman of nearer thirty handsome cynical and obviously doing very well at the better end of the professional market she admitted quite freely to posing for the pictures and defied pitt to make a crime of it if certain gentlemen liked pictures that was their affaire they could well afford it and if pitt were foolish enough to pursue the matter and make a nuisance of himself he would very likely find his fingers burned by some gentlemen of considerable means not to mention social standing she had rooms at a comfortable address she made no trouble paid her rent and if she had gentlemen callers what of it she would admit to no husband lover or protector still less to anything resembling a pimp or a procurer and the confidence with which she said it made it impossible for pitt seriously to doubt her he walked into his own office weary and disappointed the best hope seemed the ambitious little maid and she admitted to the existence of no man who might have cared except perhaps her employer certainly she would be anxious even desperate not to lose her position and the roof over her head the constables were waiting for him well pitt sat down heavily and took his boots off his socks were wet enough to wring out he must have trodden in a puddle or several not much one of them replied grimly only what youd expect poor devils cant see any of them murderin anyone least of all the only bloke what paid em a decent bit o money reckon e was like christmas to them the other one sat up a little straighter mostly the same but i turned up a couple o really experienced bits addresses what i wouldnt mind even visitin let alone livin in reckon any feller what goes to them for is fun must ave money to burn pitt stared at him one wet sock in his hand the dry ones in the drawer forgotten what addresses he demanded the constable recited them one was the same as that of the women pitt had found the other was different but in the same area three prostitutes in business for themselves and a coincidence or at least one very discreet bawdy house up to that point pitt had had every intention of going straight home in half his mind he was already there feet dry hot soup in his hand charlotte smiling at him the constables saw the change in his face and resigned themselves they were constables and he was an inspector there was nothing else they could do brothels did their trade largely at night charlotte had long ago disciplined herself to accept pitts late and erratic hours but when he was not home by eleven oclock she could no longer pretend to herself that she was not worried all sorts of people had accidents were struck down in the street policemen especially invited attack by interfering in the affairs of those who made a business of violence a murdered body could be dumped in the river dropped down a sewer or simply left in the rookeries where it might never be found who would know one pauper corpse from another she had almost convinced herself that something appalling had happened when at midnight she heard the door she flew down the hallway and flung herself at him he was thoroughly wet where have you been she demanded its the middle of the night are you hurt what happened to you he heard the rising fear in her voice and swallowed back his instinctive answer he put both arms around her and held her close ignoring the fact that he was wetting her dress with the rain still sliding off him watching a very highclass brothel he replied smiling into her hair and youd be surprised who i saw going in there she pushed him away but still gripped his shoulders why do you care she demanded what case are you on now still godolphin jones can we go into the kitchen im frozen oh she looked at herself in disgust and youre soaking she turned and led the way smartly back to the kitchen and threw another piece of coal on the stove one by one she took his wet outer clothes then his boots and his new socks lastly she made tea with the kettle that had been simmering all evening five times she had got up and put more water in it waiting his return what has godolphin jones got to do with brothels she asked when she sat down opposite him at last i dont know except that most of the women he photographed also work in brothels you think one of them killed him her face was full of doubt wouldnt it be pretty hard for a woman to strangle a man unless she drugged him or hit him first and why should she anyway didnt he pay them he was a blackmailer he had not told her about gwendoline cantlay or major rodney blackmailers often get killed im not surprised do you think one of them might have received an offer of marriage or something of that sort and wanted her pictures destroyed it was a motive that had not occurred to him prostitutes quite often did marry in their heyday before their looks were gone and they slowly drifted to lower and lower brothels earning less and less and disease began to catch up with them it was a decided possibility why were you watching a brothel she continued what could that tell you first of all i wasnt sure that it was a brothel but it was yes or more correctly a set of apartments used for that purpose rather more luxurious than a regular brothel less communal she screwed up her face but said nothing i thought i might find a procurer or a pimp he could have an excellent motive for getting rid of godolphin jones maybe jones was poaching on his women paying them higher rates and not giving the pimp his cut she looked at him very steadily the polished pans gleamed on the dresser behind her one of them was a little askew and she had missed the handle i think thats where well find the murderer he stretched and stood up easing his feet now that they were free of their boots itll have nothing to do with gadstone park at all or the grave robbers for that matter except that he made use of them come on up to bed tomorrowll come too soon as it is in the morning she dished the porridge solemnly then sat down opposite him instead of getting her own or bothering with jemima thomas he poured milk on the porridge and began to eat there was no time to waste they had been a little late up anyway what you said godolphin jones was a blackmailer so he was whom did he blackmail and over what they didnt kill him who the porridge was too hot and he was obliged to wait he wondered if she had done that on purpose gwendoline cantlay over an affaire and major rodney because he was a customer why could he blackmail a pimp or a procurer i mean what would they be afraid of i dont know i should think greed professional rivalry is far more likely he tried the porridge again a smaller spoonful you said the houses where these women worked were better than ordinary brothels so they were pretty good addresses what are you getting at charlotte she opened her eyes very wide and clear who owns them thomas he stopped with the spoon halfway to his mouth owns them he said very slowly the thought mushrooming in his mind as he stared at her sometimes the oddest people own property like that she went on i remember papa knew someone once who made his money from property leased out as a sweatshop we never had anything to do with him after we found out pitt poured milk on the rest of the porridge and ate it in five mouthfuls pulled on his boots still damp grabbed his coat hat and scarf and left the house as if it were a sinking ship charlotte did not need an explanation her mind was with him and she understood it took him three hours to discover who owned those properties and six more like them edward st jermyn lord st jermyn made his money from the rent of brothels and a percentage from each prostituteand godolphin jones knew was that the reason st jermyn had bought the picture from him and then refused to pay him againand again that was most certainly a motive for murder but could pitt prove it they did not even know what day the murder had been committed proving st jermyn had been in resurrection row would mean little jones had been strangledany fit man and many women could have done it there was no weapon to trace jones was a pornographer and a blackmailer there could be dozens of people with motives st jermyn would know all these things and pitt would never even get as far as a warrant what he needed was a closer link something to tie the two men together more irredeemably than major rodney or gwendoline cantlay or any of the women in the pictures the largest house had a landlady no doubt the madame who kept the money took the rents and the percentages and passed them to st jermyn or whoever was his agent pitt was outside in the street now walking briskly he knew where he was going and what he intended to do he hailed a cab and climbed in he gave the driver the address and slammed the door then he sat back in the seat and planned his attack the house was silent in the empty street a rising wind blew sleet out of a gray sky a maid came up the areaway steps and then disappeared again it could have been one of any number of welltodo residences just before the midday meal pitt dismissed the cab and went up to the front door he had no warrant and he did not think he could get one merely on the strength of his beliefs but he did believe with something growing toward certainty that st jermyn had killed godolphin jones and the reason had been joness knowledge of the source of his income it was certainly motive enough especially if st jermyn was seeking to earn a high office for himself in government as a great reformer with his workhouse bill pitt lifted his hand and knocked sharply on the door he did not like what he was about to do it was not his usual manner but without it there was no proof and he could not let st jermyn go in spite of the bill although the thought was in his mind to put off collating the final evidence if he should find it until after the bill had been through the house one murderer even of st jermyns order was not worth all the children in all the workhouses in london the door was opened by a smart girl in black with a white lace cap and apron good morning sir she said with total composure and it flashed through pitts mind that perhaps the place did business even at midday good morning he replied with a bitter smile may i speak to your mistress the landlady of these apartments none of them are to lease sir she warned still standing in the doorway i dont imagine so he agreed nevertheless i wish to speak to her if you please it is a matter of business with regard to the owner of the property i think you had better permit me to come in it is not something to be discussed on the front steps she was a girl of some experience she knew what the house was used for and perceived the possibilities of what pitt said she made way for him immediately yes sir if you come this way i will see if mrs philp is at home thank you pitt followed her into a remarkably comfortable room discreetly furnished with a strong fire burning in the grate he had only a few minutes to wait before mrs philp appeared she was buxom growing a little fat now but handsomely dressed even at this hour her face was rouged and mascaraed as if for a ball he did not need to be told she was a successful prostitute a little over the hill promoted now from worker to management her clothes were expensive her jewelry flashy but pitt judged it to be real she looked at him with hard shrewd eyes i dont know you she said coming in and shutting the door with a snick youre lucky he was still standing back to the fire i dont often work vice especially not this class a rozzer she said instantly you cant prove anything and youd be a fool to try the sort of gentleman that comes here wouldnt thank you for it i dont doubt it he agreed ive no intention of trying to shut you down im not paying you anything she gave him a look of contempt you go tell anyone you like see where itll get you im not interested in telling anyone either then what do you want you want something a little custom on the cheap no thank you a little information if you think im going to tell you who comes here youre a bigger fool than i took you for blackmail eh ill have you thrown out and beaten so bad your own mother wouldnt know you possibly but i dont give a damn who comes here then what do you want you havent come here out of curiosity godolphin jones who but there was a hesitation only the fraction of a second a flicker of an eyelid you heard me godolphin jones im sure youre very competent to handle anything to do with prostitution youve had enough practice to outwit most of usbut how about murder do you feel like fighting me over that thats what im good at proving murder the painted rouge stood out on her cheeks without it she would still have been handsome i dont know anything about no murder godolphin jones knew about this house and its business because he photographed a few of your girls so what if he did blackmail mrs philp he couldnt blackmail me what for whom would he tell you what can you do about it youre not going to shut me down too many rich and powerful people come here and you know it not blackmail you mrs philp you are what you are and dont pretend to be anything else but who owns this building mrs philp her face went white but she said nothing whom do you pay rent to mrs philp he went on how much do you take from the girls fifty percent more and how much do you give him at the end of the week or the month she swallowed and stared at him i dunno i dunno is name liar its st jermyn and you know it as well as i do you wouldnt pay a landlord you didnt know youre too fly by half to do that youll have an agreement all detailed out even if it isnt written she swallowed again so she demanded what if it is what about you cant do nothing blackmail mrs philp you goin to blackmail im st jermyn youre a fool a crazy man why because id wind up dead like godolphin jones her eyes widened and for a moment he thought she might faint there was a funny dry rattle in her throat a gasping did you kill jones mrs philp you look strong enough he was strangled you know he looked at her broad wellpadded shoulders and her fat arms mother of godso i did not i wonder i swear i never went near the little sod except to give him the money why would i kill him i keep a house its my business but i swear to god i never killed anyone what money mrs philp money from st jermyn to keep him quiet a look of cunning came into her face then vanished again in uncertainty no i didnt say that far as i know it was money for a whole lot o pictures jones was going to paint all of st jermyns children and himself alf a dozen or more jones wanted the money in advance and this was the best place to get the ready cash it was several weeks earnings st jermyn couldnt get all of that much out of is regular bank no pitt agreed ill bet he couldnt nor would he want to but you see we never found it on joness body or in his shop in resurrection row or in his house nor was it paid into his bank what do you mean he spent it i doubt it how much was it and youd better be right one lie and ill arrest you as an accessory to murder you know what that meansthe rope five thousand pounds she said instantly five thousand i swear and thats gods truth when exactly twelfth of january midday e was here then e went straight to resurrection row and was murdered by st jermyn who took back the five thousand pounds i think if i check with his bank which will be easy to do now with your information i shall find that five thousand pounds or something near it was deposited again which will prove beyond any reasonable mans doubt that his lordship murdered godolphin jones and why thank you mrs philp and unless you want to dance at the end of a rope with him youll be prepared to come into court and tell the same story on oath if i do what will you charge me with not murder mrs philp and if youre lucky not even keeping a bawdy house queens evidence and you might find us prepared to turn a blind eye you promise no i dont promise i cant but i can promise no charge of murder as far as i know theres nothing at all to prove you ever knew anything about it i dont so far intend to look i didnt as god is my judge ill leave that to god as you suggest good day mrs philp and he turned and went out allowing the maid to open the door for him into the street the light snow had stopped but there was a watery bluewhite sunshine the next thing he did was return to gadstone park not to st jermyns house but to aunt vespasias he needed only one final piece of evidence a statement from st jermyns bank if the money was there or alternatively a warrant to search his house although it was highly unlikely he would keep that amount of cash in a household safe it was more than most men earned in a decade more than a good servant would earn in a lifetime also there would be a withdrawal of capital from the bank before the payment or the sale of some property either would be easily traceable as mrs philp had said he could not have immediately laid his hands on that kind of cash he certainly would not have sought a loan but before pitt did anything so final he wanted to know from vespasia when the precise day the bill was coming up before parliament if there was any way at all he could put off his last irreparable task he wouldat least that long she received him without her usual acid humor good afternoon thomas she said with a touch of weariness i presume this is business you have not called for luncheon no maam i apologize for the inconvenient hour she brushed it aside with a slight gesture well what is it you wish to ask this time when does st jermyns bill go before parliament she had been staring at the fire now she turned to face him slowly her old eyes bright and tired why do you want to know i believe you already know the answer to that maam he said quietly i cannot let him get away with it you know she gave a little shrug i suppose not but can you not leave it at least until after the bill it will be over by tomorrow evening that is why i came here to ask you can you yes i can leave it that long thank you he did not bother to explain that he was doing it because he believed in it and cared just as much as she or carlisle and probably more than st jermyn himself he thought she knew that he did not stay she would not do anything not communicate with st jermyn she would just wait he went back to the police station obtained the warrants for the house and the bank and contrived to get them too late to execute them that day he was home by five oclock and sat by the fire eating muffins and playing with jemima in the morning he started late moved slowly and it was the end of the afternoon before he had assembled all his evidence to his entire satisfaction and made out an appropriate warrant for st jermyns arrest he took only one constable and proceeded to the house of lords at westminster to wait in one of the anterooms until the voting was finished and their lordships left for the night he saw vespasia first dressed in dove gray and silver head high but he knew from the tightness in her the rigid walk the unblinking eyes that they had failed he should have had more sense more knowledge of reality than to hope it was too early too soon yet the disappointment rose up inside him like sickness a tangible pain they would go on fighting of course and in time five years ten years they would win but he wanted it now for the children it would be too late to save in ten years time behind vespasia was somerset carlisle as if drawn by the misery pitt was feeling he turned and caught pitts eye even in this moment of defeat there was a bitter irony in him something like a smile did he like vespasia know what pitt had come for he moved through the crowd toward them only dimly aware of the constable coming from the other side st jermyn was behind them he showed the least mark of hurt he had fought a good battle and it would be remembered perhaps that was all that had ever really mattered to him vespasia was talking to someone leaning a little she looked older than pitt had ever seen her before perhaps she knew she would not live to see the bill passed ten years for her was too long pitt moved sideways to see whom she was talking to who held her arm and supported her he hoped it was not lady st jermyn they were within yards now he could see the constable moving to cut off any retreat he was almost in front of them vespasia turned and saw him it was charlotte beside her pitt stopped they were facing each other the constable and pitt in front of st jermyn carlisle and the two women for a wild moment pitt wondered if charlotte had known all along who had killed godolphin jones then he dismissed it there was no way she could have if she had guessed lately then he would never know it my lord he said quietly meeting st jermyns eyes he looked surprised then reading pitts face the certainty in it the relentless unturnable knowledge he showed a trace of fear at last there was only one thing incomplete in pitts mind looking at st jermynthe recognition of defeat in him while the arrogance remained the hatred even now a contempt for pitt as if it were chance that had beaten him ill luck and not anyone elses skillhe could not see in him any trace of the bizarre imagination the black gravewit that had draped horrie snipe over his own tombstone or had set old augustus in his family pew porteous on the park bench and the unfortunate albert wilson to drive a hansom he must have known the grave of wilson would eventually be found with godolphin jones in it he could not have hoped to escape forever and his ambitions were longterm this bill was only a step on the way to high office and all it meant he did not care about it for itself to have changed those graves required a man of passion a man who cared enough for the bill to exercise all his black humor to hold off the arrest just long enough his eyes move to carlisle of course st jermyn had killed godolphin jonesbut carlisle had known about it perhaps even feared it and followed him finding the body it was he after st jermyn had gone who had buried him in albert wilsons grave and moved the bodies one by one to keep pitt confounded just long enough that explained why st jermyn had been so confused when jones had turned up in wilsons grave and not resurrection row carlisle was staring back at him a small bleak smile in his eyes pitt returned the shadow of the smile and then looked back at st jermyn he cleared his throat he could never prove carlisles part and he did not wish to edward st jermyn he said formally in the name of the queen i arrest you for the willful murder of one godolphin jones artist of resurrection row
