charles todd a fearsome doubt august london theprisoner was standing in the dock face strained eyes on the foreman of the jury his fingers gripped the wooden railing whiteknuckled as he tried to hear the portly grayhaired man in the jurors box reading the verdict but the roaring in his ears as his heart pounded hard enough to suffocate him seemed to shut out the words he swallowed hard then leaned forward a little concentrating on the jurors lips guilty on all charges the foremans voice rose on the last four words as if he found them distasteful his glance furtively flicking toward the accused and away again a greengrocer he was not sympathetic to theft and murder the prisoners face swung toward the judge as he lifted the black silk square and settled it neatly on his heavy white wig prepared to pass sentence taken from this place hung by the neck the prisoner blanched and turned in anguish toward his wife seated in the gallery watching her gloved hands clenched tightly in her lap but she offered no comfort staring straight ahead her face was closed and empty he couldnt look away his sister on the far side of his wife was weeping into her handkerchief hunched into her grief but he hardly noticed it was his wifes coldness that riveted him he thought she believes it now inspector ian rutledge the young officer from the yard whose evidence had all but placed the rope around ben shaws throat turned away and quietly left the courtroom he did not enjoy sending any man to his death even this one whose crimes had shocked london at such a time he was always mindful of his father a solicitor who had held strong views on the subject of hanging i dont believe in it still the dead had no choice in their dying did they the murderer did its on his own head what becomes of him he knew from the start what justice would be meted out to him but he always expects to avoid it doesnt he theres an arrogance in that which disturbs me more than anything else ben shaw hadnt been arrogant murder hadnt set well on his conscience hanging might come as a relief an end to nightmares who could say certainly not rutledge himselfhe had never taken a life would that alter his view of murder would it in any way change his ability to understand a crime or his attitude toward the killer he thought not it was the victim who had always called out to him the voiceless dead so often forgotten in the tumultuous courtroom battle of guilt versus innocence it was said that justice prevented anarchy law established order cold comfort to the elderly women ben shaw had strangled in their beds still the silenced victims had not gone unheard in this courtroom november marling kent the bonfire had been piled high with the debris from a dozen gardens and enough twigs and dead boughs to outlast the guy the celebrants were gathered about the square talking and laughing as if the gruesome spectacle they were about to witness was far more exciting than frightening the match had yet to be tossed into the pyre but two men in flowing wigs and faded satin coats awaited the signal their sober faces were flushed with wine and duty the taller leaned toward his companion and said in a low voice all this hair itches like the very devil yes well at least your shirt fits this lace will end up strangling me wait and see im ready to kill whoever thought up this charade wont be long now it was the close of guy fawkes day and tonight the stuffed effigy of a traitor was about to be paraded around the village square and then thrown into the flames bonfires were a longstanding english tradition marking the gunpowder plot of when the real guy fawkes had been caught with his coconspirators attempting to blow up the houses of parliament and king james with them a macabre way of reminding schoolchildren as they went round their villages and towns collecting pennies to buy roman candles what becomes of traitors as a rule it was a family affair held in the back garden the fire as fat or sparse as the family could manage the guy dressed in castoff clothes stuffed with straw in too many households during four and a half years of war the celebration had dwindled to a token affair the dearth of ablebodied men and the hardships of families struggling to survive without them made the effort increasingly a burden the village of marling had decided to revive the custom with a public flourish ian rutledge had given his share of pennies to the local children this morning while hamish in his head disparaged the whole affair its no a scottish tradition to waste guid firewood its too hard to come by remembering the barren stonescarred mountains where hamish had grown up rutledge said when in rome if ye came for hogmanay now a good fire on the hearth was hospitality after a long ride in the cold rutledge knew the scottish holiday the last day of the year when the children demanded gift cakes and the whisky flowed freelyand not necessarily whisky upon which any tax had been paid he had commanded scottish troops in the war and they had brought their traditions as well as their traditional courage with them he had turned a blind eye on more than one occasion the policeman subverted by the compassion he felt for his homesick menmany little more than boystrying to forget how short their lives were destined to be by remembering home tonight november he wasnt on duty in london he was standing among the revelers in an attractive village high on the downs and beside him was the widow of a friend who had died in the great war she had invited him to come down for the occasion you must ian it will do both of us a world of good its time to put the war behind us and try to rebuild our lives he had no life to rebuild but she did and frances his sister had urged him to accept the invitation elizabeth has mourned for two years it wont bring richard back will it i think we should encourage her if shes ready to shut the door on all that and it will do you good as well to see more of old friends youve buried yourself in your work for months now the last accusing and then frances had added hastily no im not matchmaking she would do as much for either of us if we were in need and you know that as well as i do it was true elizabeth was one of the most generous people rutledge knew richard mayhew had been very fortunate in his choice of wife she was a slim woman in her late twenties with sparkling dark eyes and a wry sense of humor her presence was brightness and warmth and a belief that life could be good it wasalmostcontagious and just now he was in need of warmth and brightness to chase away other shadows clinging to his arm in the press of people elizabeth was saying richard loved all this you know he loved tradition and the rutledge lost the thread of her words as the guy flamboyant in dress and hanging from a long pole was brought into the square and carried triumphantly around the unlit fire a deafening shout of approval rose and as rutledge glimpsed the painted mockery of a face its wild eyes and flaring nostrils the grinning mouth the bits of someones wig straggling about the ears he had to laugh what was lost in talent had been made up in exuberance aye exuberance hamish agreed with a wee touch of auld clootie the devil only a scot with generations of covenanters in his family tree would make such a comparison rutledge responded silently the first james was your king as well as ours or have you forgotten hamish considering the matter replied we didna care oermuch for him the guy was closer now dancing a jig on the pole and elizabeth was laughing like a girl oh ian look hes wearing those masquerade clothes i found in the attics and donated to the committee wouldnt richard have been delighted on the far side of the crowd someone had lit the fire and the flames began to fly through the dry brush reaching for the harder wood applause greeted them in the garish light the guy took on a realistic life of its own the strawstuffed limbs jerking in time with the booted feet of its minders as it was paraded before an appreciative audience shouts of approval and the word traitor mingled with laughing cries of into the flames with him and god save king james and parliament the shrill giggling voices of children taunted the guy a counterpoint to parents warning their offspring not to venture too close to the fire mind now or stand clear do and in the light of the flames lit just as garishly as the guy was a face that rutledges gaze passed overand returned to and recognized but from where he went cold with a sense of shock he couldnt explain a knowledge that was there buried deep in the brain concealed by layers of denial and blank horror and yet rising to the surface with the full force of his being was a single realization he didnt want to know the answer there was danger in searching for the answer he stood motionless his body rigid his arm stiffening in elizabeths grip but she was entranced by the spectacle and unaware he was physically caught up in his surroundings the voices of people on every side of him the heavy smell of smoke as the wind blew it his way the warmth of elizabeths hands on him the coolness of the night air the rough feel of the wool coat across his shoulders the shadowed brick facades looming above himand at the same time emotionally he was firmly locked in a private hell that mirrored the flames rising into the black sky above as the seconds passed it seemed for a fraction of an instant that the eyes of his enemy sought and found his before moving on the odd light lent them a ferocity that stunned him as if acknowledging a connection between them a connection built onwhat and how did he know this was an enemy gentle god rutledge whispered under his breathand then the face vanished a willothewisp in the november night a figment of murky imagination lost in the smoke suddenly he doubted his own senses he had seen it dear god surely he had seen it orhad it been no more than a fleeting memory from the last days of the wara moments aberration a flash of something best buried in the dim reaches of his mind best unresurrected in this past week uneasy memories had surfaced and disappeared with disconcerting irregularity as if the approaching anniversary of the armistice had jarred them into life again rutledge was not the only soldier who was experiencing this phenomenonhed heard two constables who had survived the trenches warily questioning each other about lapses in concentration and several men in a pub dancing uneasily around who was sleeping well and who wasnt there had been the officer sitting on a bench by the embankment staring at the river water with such obsessive fascination that rutledge had stopped and spoken to him the man had traveled a long way back to the present and looked up at rutledge as though wanting to ask were you there and saying instead the waters bitter cold and gray today isnt it it was almost a confession that drowning had been on his mind as if uncertain all of them whether or not they were going mad and grateful to discover they were not alone in their fears as if that made it more tolerable not being alone just this need had sent him down to kent he found himself searching among the villagers gathered in a ring around the fires blazing gold and red light but the face he sought was no longer there not now not ever hamish alarmed and accusing in the back of his mind was exclaiming it canna be yeve gone ower the edge man badly shaken rutledge had lost sight of the perambulating guy making a lap on the far side of the bonfire now the grotesque effigy was coming round once more a final circuit while the lengths of harder wood smoked and began to burn hot enough to consume the fires prey over by the bronze statue of a mounted cavalier that stood at the point of the square where the main road curved away from the high street there was hilarity as a police sergeant gathered older boys around him and gave his orders the bronze cavaliers back was turned on the antics of his descendants his face haughty and withdrawn under the brim of his plumed hat the aristocratic arch of his nose and the smooth sweep of his cheekbones highlighted by the fires blaze as the first roman candles went streaming noisily skyward from the cluster of children rutledge flinched at the front flares had been used to test the wind the crack and the ratatattat of the smaller charges sent his heart rate soaring he felt exposed caught out in the open as the sounds of war surrounded him again his immediate inclination was to shout orders to his men to bend into the run that would carry him across no mans land elizabeth suddenly aware looked up at the tension in his face and cried ohi didnt thinkare you all right its only the children rutledge nodded unable to trust his voice just then the guy went sailing into the heart of the blaze like a living creature struggling to escape as the heat rushed toward him the onlookers were ecstatic roaring at the top of their lungs as the strawstuffed figure jerked and twisted as if in torment the candles streamed wildly above the tongues of flame and the noise was deafening rutledge was still scouring the faces illuminated by the flames a policeman was trained to observe to remember the shape of a nose the width of a mouth the way the eyes were set and the height of the forehead he couldnt have been wrong there had to be someone who bore a faint resemblance to the man hed seen something had triggered that memory something had reached somewhere deep in his past and dredged it up but there were only strangers here appearing and disappearing in the smoke like wraiths none of them familiar all of them solidly alive villagers with every right to be here enjoying the night in gods name it had surely been a ghost he knew about ghosts people were milling around him now slapping each other on the back celebrating calling out to friends pressing him toward the fire into the heart of the crowd mindnumbing to a man who was claustrophobic someone who knew elizabeth came past and thrust a glass of longhoarded champagne into their hands shouting something rutledge couldnt decipher in the din he drank the champagne quickly to steady himself what was happening to him why had a perfectly normal evening gone so badly wrong hamish said its november as if that explained everything and in a terrible way it did last november rutledge had been in the trenches of france he and his men abandoned by hope and bitter too tired to relish the successes of the americans or to believe the whispers of a peace the doctors had warned him there would be flashbacks that he would from time to time find himself reliving what was best forgotten sometimes as vividly as life dr fleming had cautioned him and far from unnatural easy for fleming to say sitting in his sparsely furnished surgery surrounded by stacks of folders of the living dead the men who had come home shattered in body or spirit locked in by the crowd his body confined on all sides by people oblivious to his sense of suffocation as the claustrophobia gripped him wanting to break through them to space and air fighting to draw a full breath rutledge struggled with panic even elizabeth chatting with a neighbor was pressing against him her body warm with excitement and the heat of the fire the nightmare surrounded him unending like torment meted out carefully to make the pain last he felt like the guy a helpless spectacle and then the guy was consumed the flames began to die back and the euphoria of the evening seemed to wane as well women began to collect reluctant children and men with rakes and brooms went to brush some of the ashes back toward the stillred coals at the center voices could actually be heard over the din and the crowd started to move in different directions freeing him at last elizabeth her face pink from laughter looked up at him and said gratefully thank you for coming ian i couldnt have faced it on my own although its time i learned isnt it she was holding his arm again her fingers like individual bands of steel gripping him and then as swiftly as he had seemed to suffocate his mind cleared and he was himself again he put his hand over hers and managed a smile as she moved away to speak to someone else rutledge scanned the far side of the smoking remains of the fire for a last time but the face was not there the man was not there surely he never had been elizabeth said turning to look behind her did you see someone you know do you want to try to catch him up no rutledge answered abruptly and then added at hamishs prompting i a trick of the light thats all i was wrong it was surely something about the night that had disturbed him and the noise and the acrid smell of the fireworks lingering in the smoky air there was no one there he canna be hamish reminded rutledge hes deid like me deid like me rutledge hesitated on the point of asking hamish what he knewwhat he might have seen thenor just now but before he could frame the words he stopped himself what if this had nothing to do with the war after a very fine dinner with elizabeth and three of her friends at the hotel just along the high street rutledge drove back to london introductions and the subsequent settling into chairs as everyone exclaimed over the success of the evening had given rutledge time to collect himself and present a polite pleasant facade in spite of his unsettled state of mind it was something he was becoming increasingly good at doing finding the right mask for his terrors caught up in their own excitement no one at the table noticed his long silences or made anything of his distraction he was the outsider among them and they included him from kindness expecting nothing in return he overheard one of the women as she leaned toward elizabeth and murmured hes absolutely charming where did you find him as if he were a new suitor his hostess had replied dryly he was richards best man ive known ian for ages hes been a great comfort for elizabeths sake he was glad to find himself accepted he couldnt have borne it if hed embarrassed her yet it could have happened all too easily frances had been wronghe was not ready to meet old friends and pick up the threads of an old life there were too many walls that shut him off from people who remembered a very different man called ian rutledge still elizabeth had not let him go without extracting a promise that hed be back on november you will ask for leave i hope she said anxiously a reminder and chief superintendent bowles will agree wont he i see no reason why not rutledge responded bending his head to kiss her cheek ill be here if i can what he didnt tell her was thatwith or without leavehe had no intention of being in london on november but on the long drive home watching the headlamps pick out the verges of the road and pierce the heavy shadows of trees and hedgerows rutledge had found himself seeing again and again the face hed carried with him since the bonfire it lingered against his will as if once having surfaced it refused to be stuffed down once more into the bleak depths from which it had risen and there was no respite for traffic was too light to distract him the cloudy moonless night seemed to be its ally and even hamish was silent by the time rutledge reached the outskirts of london the shoulders and chest attached to the face had fleshed themselves out bit by bit gathering substance like a reluctant ghost they belonged not in the proper english clothing rutledge thought hed glimpsed tonight but in a torn and bloody uniform and hamish said as if hed been waiting for rutledge to reach this point id no pursue it there were sae many in the pale morning light as he made his way to scotland yard the next day rutledge realized he had arrived at the same conclusion it was november rutledge was at the yard preparing to clear his desk for leave due to begin that afternoon he was looking forward to returning to marling in kent not just as an escape from london to avoid the public commemoration on the eleventh but as an opportunity to prove to himself that the memories awakened on guy fawkes day were no more than an isolated and unexpected response to the noisy press of people around the bonfire and his own restiveness over the approaching celebration of the armistice there had been no recurring episodes for that he was grateful he knew very well that it had become something of an obsession this celebration hamish harped on the date as did the newspapers giving him no peace for weeks hed watched the preparation of the temporary structure that london was building to honor the nations casualties of war in fact seeing every stage had been unavoidable as he came and went at the yard the permanent memorial would not be completed until the next year but much had been made of the eventual design and placement a cenotaph a monument to the dead buried elsewhere and so many so very many of them were a sea of white crosses in foreign ground some with names some with no more than the bleak word unknown but he had known them he and officers like him had sent them out to die young and inexperienced and eager dead before he could recall their names or remember their faces dead before hed had the chance to turn them into real soldiers with some small hope of survival dead and on his conscience like weighted stones and no time to mourn nor did he need a cenotaph standing close by whitehall and downing street as a focus for his grief and loss helike countless otherscarried them with him every day the men he had served with shared hardship and fear with bled and suffered with were as sharp in his memory and his nightmares as they had been before they died as was the recurring voice that lived in his mind a reminder in every waking moment of the scots hed led and the one scot hed been forced to execute during the horrendous bloodbath that had been the battle of the somme invading his thoughts hamish scolded yeve read the same lines three times man realizing hed done just that rutledge finished the paragraph and signed the report setting it aside to be handed to superintendent bowles his mind often grappled with the long nightmare of the trenches the blighted landscape of northern france the narrowed focus of trying somehow to protect the men under him and the black despair of failing sometimes these seemed more real than the paperwork in front of him he was reaching for the next folder when a young constable tapped at his door and stepped aside to usher in a floridfaced middleaged woman in a dowdy black coat and a black hat that did not become her a mrs shaw to see you sir she says youd know who she is the woman stared at rutledge her heavy features twisting into a mask of pain tears began to trickle down her face ravaging it rutledge nodded to the constable as the man hesitated before closing the door it swung shut with a click please sit down mrs shaw he said gently as he strove to find her name in his memory but there were no shaws in the files hed been reviewing and as far as he could recall no shaws who had served under him in france she watched him from behind her tears waiting for the first stir of recognition before the war then and it came back to him as she sank heavily into her chair she was the widow of a man hed sent to the gallows shaw ben shaw convicted of murdering elderly women and robbing them he had been trusted a manofallwork who came on call to do the small and necessary repairs that aging and ill householders couldnt manage and when they didnt die soon enough to suit him hed eased their going with a pillow and then ransacked their meager possessions for anything of value alone in the world and bedridden they had had no chance against him one of the newspapers had written a sensational account of the scene as imagined by one of their journalists he came boldly to the bed speaking kindly offering to plump the flat and lumpy pillows for them as he must have done a hundrednay a thousand timesand as they smiled gratefully he slipped the pillow over their faces before that smile could be replaced by horror and held it there firmly against their weakfutileattempts to prevent him and when the pale flaccid arms fell back to his victims sides he had lifted each graying head slipped the pillow gently back beneath it and closed the bulging eyes before walking back down the stairs and shutting the door behind him leaving the pathetic corpse for a cleaning woman to discover in the morning inflammatory as it was it had drawn a reprimand from the judge as he charged the jury and bade them ignore the overwrought misconceptions of a writer paid to stir up the public sentiment rutledge pushing the recollection aside wondered what had brought her here to the yard it was as unexpected as a resurrection you wished to see me mrs shaw what can i do to help you turn back the clock she answered tremulously but theres no one can do that is there she began to cry in earnest as a young policeman hed dreaded having to speak to friends and relatives of victims dreaded the tears that seemed to fall without conscious will a flood that made him feel exceedingly helpless how do you offer comfort where there is none experience had not taught him an answer rutledge was silent allowing mrs shaw a space in which to recover and then said with compassion no one knows a way to do that it was he thought a prelude to a piteous account of life as the widow of a hanged man followed by an entreaty for money to pay her rent she must be in dire straits to come to the police for help he tried to recall the name of the clergyman hed met while investigating the case it would be in the files surely the parish must offer some provisions for the mrs shaws of this worldshe neednt be reduced to begging she surprised him turn back the clock to that trial she said baldly staring fiercely at him and this time find some way of bringing out the truth caught utterly off guard rutledge found himself fumbling for words i dont quite understand the truth who it was killed them the old ladies she began to dig in the purse she carried with her and pulled out a small handkerchief unfolding it on the edge of his desk she added triumphantly thats your proof right here it wont bring my ben back nothing will but it should clear his name inside the square of cheap cloth was a locket without its chain in the center was the face of a man in profile carved in onyx from what rutledge could see of it against a pearlgray background a lacework of blackenameled laurel leaves framed it she opened the locket for him next inside lay a delicately braided coil of graying chestnut hair protected by a crystal cover she watched him as he studied it guarding it against any intent on his part to take it from her turning it in her rough hands with the delicacy of a merchant exhibiting his wares it was mourning jewelry worn to remind the wearer of a loved one may i he asked she nodded and showed him the reverse and on the back of the locket were several lines engraved in the gold case frederick andrew satterthwaite loving husband d april satterthwaite had been the name of one of shaws victims he couldnt sell it could he mrs shaw was demanding not with that inscription on the back of it anybody would have known at once where it come from what surprises me was that he kept it at all but i suppose he couldnt think what to do with it and its pretty in a morbid way thats gold its set in a red finger with a chewed nail pointed at the setting tapping it rutledge rather thought she was right on both counts this was indeed a piece of jewelry that would have marked the possessor as a thief and murderer and it hadnt been found in ben shaws possessionto his rutledges certain knowledge it had never come to light at all and only a distant cousins memory of the locket had seen it included in the inevitable inventory of mrs satterthwaites belongings one mourning locket bearing name of deceaseds husband and date of his death set in gold onyx profile missing the investigating officer inspector nettlerutledge had not been the first on the scenehad written in his notes the query very likely thrown into the river how did you find it rutledge asked leaning back in his chair the locket was too difficult to faketoo expensive for one thing and for what purpose more to the point where had your husband hidden it god save us no she replied in a harsh frustrated voice if he had would i bring it to you now to what endi ask you what good would it do perhaps to put your mind at ease in regard to your husbands guilt i told you the truth comes out with this and too late to save ben no this i took from my neighbors house yesterday henry cutter his name is the old bitch his wife died last month and he couldnt bear to go through her clothes and such finally he asked me and i found this in the back of the chest where she kept her corsets and drawers folded in that handkerchief the stubby finger stabbed at a bit of color in one corner see its embroidered jac for janet ann cutter and what i want from you inspector is to find out what it was doing in her chest and how it got there i want to know if henry cutter stole it from a dead woman and if my poor husband is innocent i want you to clear his name do you hear me my children deserve thatto have the shame taken awayeven if you cant bring ben back to us hamish said it isna a small thing she wants her small bright eyes glared balefully at rutledge as if hed hanged her husband with his own hands which in a way perhaps he had hed been the investigating officer after philip nettle had dropped dead of a burst appendix it was his evidence built on nettles original investigation that had put benjamin edward shaw on trial for murder in august six years and more ago the shock of her certainty the ferocity with which she faced him were overwhelming and as the implication of her words sank in rutledge felt cold if this locket had been found in someone elses possession at the time of the trial what difference might that have made to the outcome he tried to find something to say something that would dispute her conclusions or support his own position hamish warned him its no wise to be ower hasty the small deadly bit of gold jewelry glittered on his desk mocking rutledge seeming to take on a life of its own they had searched the shaw house from top to bottomthe locket had never been found was not there he would have sworn to that under oath yet here it wasall these years later where had it been and why and gentle god did it matter yes it matteredif he had hanged the wrong man when rutledge failed to answer her mrs shaw regarded him with disdain you dont want to believe me is that it because my ben was hanged for a murderer you think im no better than he was she leaned forward well it wont wash do you hear me ive come to ask for my rights and if you wont help me ill find someone who will mrs shaw he said forcing himself to think clearly i have only your word that this locket was found among the belongings of mrs cutter you should have left it there and risk having him find it im not stupid inspector if he killed those women and not my ben whats to stop him from killing me if i let on what id done as it was i had to pretend to a faintness to get out of that house we spoke with the cutters yes and so you did did you expect him to say youve got it all wrong inspector it wasnt ben it was me her rough mimicry of a mans voice mocked him rutledge said reasonably if you are right why would mrs cutter have kept this piece of jewelry she must have realized that it was dangerous given the fact that her husband may have been a murderer because she was sickly thats why and didnt want to be left alone better to sleep with a murderer than to sleep alone and not have bread on the table when you wake up it was the only bit he couldnt sell wasnt it maybe it was her hold over her husband and as long as he didnt know what had become of it she was safe its not a very sound theory he argued mrs shaw looked him over weighing up the clothes he wore as if she knew their value to a penny youve never known want have you never worried at night where the rent was coming from or how you would pay the butcher and what you was going to do about wornout boots i can tell you what happens to a woman on her own and he could see for himself the suffering in her face but how much of what shed told him about the cutters was her need to find absolution for her husband the truth was he didnt want to believe her the bedrock of his emotional stability the only thing that had brought him back to sanity after france was the yard and the career hed built there before the war by his reputation had been shaped through solid achievement unlike his undeserved glory in the war where he had been driven half mad and shaken to the core by endless slaughter to lose his career now he had never been a hero but hed been a damned good detective hamish mocked aye so ye say youre no sae perfect none of us is you werent there you dont know anything about this case rutledge retorted in anger you werent there mistaking the direction of his sudden flare of anger mrs shaw prodded defiantly if you killed my ben wrongly you owe me restitution my children have gone hungry without him and ive had nothing to give them no way to offer any life at all its my children im defending its too late now for ben struggling with his own vulnerability just now when the war seemed to have returned with unexpected and extraordinary force and against his will already half convinced by the intensity of the widows determination rutledge made an effort to explain how the yard would see her demands he said we cant reopen a case you can she told him interrupting heres a wrongful death and i have the proof whats to become of me and my children why should henry cutter go scotfree while we suffer for what he did the locket lay between them tearing his life apart as well as hers it couldnt be true hed been careful so had philip nettle how could he destroy the past when that was all he had and yet and yet if he had failed ben shaw what then why should his past be sacred untouchable nell shaw got to her feet a middleaged woman with nothing to be gained by coming to him except relief from her personal tragedy an unattractive woman with no graces who would always provoke dislike and even loathing ive a daughter of marrying age ive a son looking to be apprenticed ive done for them the best i could these last years but theres no money to see them right i barely kept food on the table and no ones willing to lift a finger for themnot for the offspring of gallows bait we might as well have gone to the hangman along with ben she began to fold the handkerchief over the locket as if shielding it from his eyes i see ill find no help here well theres other strings to my bow i cant turn back the clock he said unconsciously repeating her words we dont know how this came into mrs cutters possession or why or for that matter when its evidence yes but its not clear proof its something to be going on with if you wasnt afraid to find out that you are as human as the rest of us and got it wrong the truth was he was afraid and at the same time he knew he was honorbound to get to the bottom of this allegation stifling the turmoil that was tearing apart his own mind rutledge tried to put into perspective how momentous the finding of this locket must seem to the woman seated in front of him providing of course that her story was true but he could see no benefit for her in a lie that was the key she had nothing to gain by lying and there was a driving force about her that couldnt be counterfeited it was there in the way she held her body and in the small determined eyes he had never liked this woman from the beginning of the murder inquiry she had been a thorn in the side of authority he tried to disregard his dislike now hamish said aye shes an auld besom but if it were another inspectors case she was complaining of what would you do rutledge picked up his pen and uncapped it drawing a sheet of paper forward mrs shaw listen to me first and foremost we cant search the cutter house on your word alone what youre saying is that my word isnt good enough what im saying is that you took the locket from its hiding place if i send forty men there in an hours time and nothing else turns upif theres no more evidence to be foundthen its your word against mr cutters that the locket was in mrs cutters belongings now or ever she said stubbornly i left the chain where i found it to mark the place rutledge nodded i understand that but the chain could belong to any locket that mrs cutter owned theres no one who can say with authority that the chain my men discover actually belongs to the satterthwaite locket mrs satterthwaite i remind you is dead theres another side to this coin inspector that im telling the truth her eyes met his squarely and youre unwilling to hear it she had backed him around again to his own possible guilt he had always taken a certain pride in his knowledge of people he knew how to watch for the small movements of the body or shifts in expression that supported or contradicted what he was told only a very few people lied well and either nell shaw was among themor she believed implicitly in what she was saying hamish said aye if you canna satisfy her shell go ower your head and there were sound reasons why that must not happen rutledge was not the only officer who would be brought down if the shaw case was shown to be flawed even if her accusations bore only a semblance of truth the yard was not immune from politics or personal vendettas im not sending you away he told her im searching for a practical way of getting around the rules i have to follow ill give you a chit for the locket no never she declared shoving it back in her purse and clutching that to her bosom with both arms its all ive got he put down the pen then you must let me have a few days to look again at the file and then to decide how best to go about this problem i dont have the authority to open this case myself and it wont do you much good to make enemiesfor you will if you begin to annoy my own superiors or mr cutter its to your advantage and mine to proceed with caution have you spoken to the barrister who defended your husband ive got no money he wont give me the time of day i make no promises mind you but i give you my word that ill do my best if i can satisfy myself that theres just cause to reopen the case ill tell you so and give you the name of someone at the home office who will listen to you and if you cant she asked suspiciously then youre free to speak to anyone else here at the yard thats fair i never asked more there was a gleam of gratification in her dark eyes ive waited this long a few more days wont matter will they after rutledge had seen mrs shaw into a cab he sat in his chair and stared out the window at the bare branches of trees that stood out stark and almost pleading against the colorless sky he couldnt have been wrong about ben shaw and yet he had been badly shaken by that locket and mrs shaws ferocious defense of her husbands innocence had rung with conviction if he had been so certain of the mans guilt before how had that altered so easily hamish said your wits are scattered man yere no thinking clearly what if he had been wrong hamish said it isna the end of the world rutledge retorted angrily it was a mans life you werent there hamish agreed readily i was safe in scotland then and alive after a moment he added she willna be put off nor was he the sort of man who could quietly bury truth under a layer of lies rutledge faced himself now and with that a possibility that appalled him like it or not he must get to the bottom of this question of ben shaws guilt like it or not he must find the answer for his own souls comfort hamish growled it isna a matter of comfort its a sair question for the conscience his covenanter heritage had always projected his world in severe black and white it was what had brought him to defy the army and face execution rather than compromise his strengthand his destruction ignoring the voice in his head rutledge considered the next step how did one go about dredging up the past without destroying what had been built upon it this was not the first time hed dealt with families whose anger was as destructive as it was futile when not even a jurys verdict could persuade them of a loved ones guilt but few of these families had ever brought forward what was in their eyes fresh proof of innocence and on that slim balance he was forced to confront his actions of more than six years ago hamish said i saw a magician once when the troop train was held up in london he came to entertain us i couldna be certain what was real and what was false rutledge suddenly found a memory of ben shaws defeated exhausted face when the prison warders brought him to the gallows even if he could clear the mans name there was no way he could restore the mans life shaw was dead like so many others the world seemed filled with phantoms his mind shattered by them suddenly he could feel himself slipping back in the trenches the battle of the somme in july the watershed of his madness hamishs voice brought him sharply back to the dingy confines of his office at scotland yard with its low shelves its grimy windows the smell of old paint and dusty corners heavy in the passages with the sound of footsteps harsh on the wooden floors outside his door and brief snatches of conversations that seemed to have no beginning and no end rutledge rubbed his face trying to remember what hamish had said to him and the voice repeated its no unlikely that shaw himself gave the locket to the neighbors wife a love token mrs shaw willna care to hear that with that telling inscription on the back besides mourning jewelry isnt the most romantic gift is it when mrs cutters own husband was very much alive a promise no doubt that he wouldna be alive much longer it could explain why she kept it you didnt know shaw rutledge reminded hamish but then had he all the same rutledge did know his superior chief superintendent bowles and therein lay a hidden snare that could be as explosive as a mine the shaw investigation had brought a promotion to the then chief inspector bowles who had used the murders to political and professional advantage bowles had kept himself very much in the public eye repeatedly promising the newspapers that this vicious killer would be brought to justice with all possible speed assuring frightened neighbors of the murdered women that everything possible was being done publicly pressing his men to greater and greater effort it was philip nettle who had stumbled on the connection that linked the three victimsthe fact that each had at one time or another employed the services of the same carpenter when work needed to be done a trusted man a caring man one who had trimmed the wicks of lamps brought in coal for the fires oiled locks on the doors kept window sashes running smoothly and generally made himself indispensable and then betrayed their trust the discovery of the murderer had once more pitched chief inspector bowles into the forefront of public attention as philip nettle lay dying in hospital bowles had made half a dozen speeches that cleverly fostered the notion that it was his own intuition that had come up with the crimes solution he had given interviews to magazines and newspapers and he had delivered the eulogy at philip nettles funeral praising the man rather than the police officer kissing the grieving widows cheek with marked condescension she had regarded him with bitterness convinced that bowless callous demands for results had prevented her husband from making a timely visit to his doctor sergeant gibson reading the caption under yet another photograph in a newspaper had said sourly within rutledges hearing youd bloody think the man was standing for parliament sergeant wilkerson had answered aye theres hope he will and leave the yard for good to order the shaw file brought to his office on the heels of a visit by mrs shaw would ring alarm bells at the yard old bowels would hear about it before the day was out and send someone down the passage to ferret out what was going on hanged felons were finished business even if mrs shaw found a hundred new pieces of evidence the yard like the army demanded obedience and rigorously followed the chain of command aye its as guid an excuse as any hamish taunted for doing nothing or a damned good reason for exercising caution rutledge countered getting up from his chair he went himself to the vast cavern where records were kept and after some hunting among dusty cabinets located the folder he was after with his office door shut and no one but hamish to observe him rutledge opened the file and began to read at the end of it he sat back in his chair and watched the reflection of pale november light from his windows as it played across the ugly walls the sheets of paper and notes and conclusions that had been meticulously written seemedin the light of mrs shaws discoveryto lack conviction now and yet in they had rung with truth no one had questioned one henry cutter or his wifeexcept in regard to the comings and goings of ben shaw his reputation in the neighborhood and whether he was capable of killing anyone the residents on either side of the shaw house had had very little to say about their neighbor they hadnt seen suspicious goingson and they hadnt noticed any changes in ben shaws manner after the first murder or the last mrs cutterher given name was janethad unexpectedly provided one important clue the two shaw children had been taken out of the local school and put into better ones a small private school for the son and an academy for the daughter an inheritance mrs shaw had claimed from shaws late uncle records turned up no such inheritancethe uncle had died in debt twenty years before leaving his young son no choice but to emigrate it was not long before inspector nettle was digging deeper into ben shaws sudden financial windfall this had been the point on which the evidence had turned the shaws had been a struggling family until just after the first body was found a mrs winslow many of her belongings had been unaccounted for but it was believed at the time of her death that most of these had been sold to enable her to continue to live independently in her own home it was not until the second murder of mrs satterthwaite that the police had begun to draw a wider net and stumbled on the shaws it was the third murder that had concentrated attention on ben shaws activities on the three nights in question especially after mrs cutter had provided the most important reason to concentrate there but no one had wondered why she was so cooperative could it have been to her advantage a shocking thought that he could have sent an innocent man to the gallows on the basis of a womans perverted evidence rutledge closed his eyes against the pale light looking back instead into the darkness of the past he had been so sure of his evidence and nettles so thoroughly convinced of the mans guilt was he that his certainty was palpable in the courtroom a wellthoughtout investigation the judge had applauded in his summation to the jury for there had been no reason to connect the cutters with the three women certainly no evidence in that direction what could have been henry cutters motive for murder his style of living hadnt altered but the shaws had after the sudden death of inspector nettle rutledge had interviewed the neighbors again including henry and janet cutter nettle had been in increasingly severe pain for several days covering it with wry humor and massive doses of cathartics he often scrawled his notes in a shaking hand that was hard to follow rutledge had left nothing to chance he had backtracked to substantiate each fact mrs cutter had not had kind words to say for mrs shaw a nosy and overbearing woman with few saving graces but she claimed that mr shaw had never demonstrated any vicious tendencies that would account for his killing elderly women kind to animals and all that shed said to rutledge bewildered a good father too and he put up with that wife of his when no one else would always after him to do better with his life provide for his family it doesnt seem right that the smallest sign of wickedness didnt show in his face or his ways how are we to know i ask you if theres no sign to warn us and then she had added almost as an afterthought that last damning sentence and he did provide for his children it hasnt been six months since they were put in better schools never mind the cost she had repeated it for rutledges edification not six months the first murder had occurred just seven months before henry cutter had described ben shaw as a man clever with his hands always called on by his neighbors when something failed to work and ive never known him to take a hapenny for what he done never saw him drunk nor known him to strike his wife it seems queer that hed kill helpless old ladies for what he could scavenge in their houses what he could scavenge had been over a hundred pounds worth of jewelry and small portable treasures that could in the right quarter be sold without questions asked but henry cutter in the notes had called mrs shaw a kind and loving wife and ben would have done anything for her he cared that much for her kill and steal to give her the kind of life she goaded him into providing rutledge had at the time wondered if mrs shaw wasnt equally guilty for hounding her husband to desperate measures to keep her satisfied but there was no law in english jurisprudence to cover that crime even if she had certainly their house had shown an influx of money that their combined incomehis as a carpenter and hers as a shopkeepers assistantcouldnt explain but there were the small jobs that ben shaw did for it seemed that he did charge when his services were sought by those well able to pay he had never kept an accounting of what hed earned in that fashion his wife had probably spent most of it on clothes for the children better schools and certainly better food than their neighbors enjoyed someone had told rutledgea neighbor two houses awaythat shed heard that ben shaw had come from better stock than his wife who had pulled him down if you want the truth common she is determined though she was to give her children opportunities to rise above their station ill say that for nell shaw she never tried to hold either of them back on her own account rutledge would have put his money on mrs shaw as the killer if there had been the slimmest chance of that he hadnt liked her for one thing and hed felt some sympathy for her husband after enduring her sharp tongue in the early stages of the investigation nell shaw had been angry defending her family like an enraged tigress accusing the police of failing at their own duty and having nothing better to do than badger a poor man into night terrors but neither rutledge nor nettle had ever fully explored the background of the neighborswhat opportunities they might have had to meet the three dead women what reasons they might have had to commit murder there was no evidence at all that pointed in their direction even though henry cutters wife seemed to know more about the victims than mrs shaw had she had read about them in the newspapers so she claimed instead he had focused on two facts that ben shaw was often in the homes of the deceased and that after he was charged ben shaw had all but admitted he was the murderer but what if he hadnt beenwhat if afraid from the start that his wife might be guilty hed confessed to distract the police from her hamish said or fra someone else he cared for it wouldnt be the first time that a husband or wife risked hanging out of fear of the truth coming out or out of fear that the other was in danger what if looking deeper rutledge found himself thinking hed come across unexpected evidence that proved clearly that the most obvious pointers were not the most likely after all in one case in ten digging deeper brought out new facts and yet at the time he was convinced that he had dug deeply speaking up after a long and brooding silence hamish said what if ye find that im no the first victim whose death can be laid at your door what if this man died a worse death than mine because ye were no the clever policeman you thought you were as rutledge laid the last of the pages aside he wondered if he would come to regret his decision to retrieve the file but he was committed now whatever he learned about himself there was nothing more rutledge could do that day about his promise to nell shaw nor the next as he drove south of london and back into kent but it was like a sore tooth nagging in the back of his mind and after he had crossed lambeth bridge he made his way south and east to the part of south london where the shawsand the cutterslived it was familiar ground and yet as the motorcar turned down street after street he could see that the once prosperous workingclass houses were showing signs of neglect after nearly five years of war and shortages of manpower and materials england had impoverished herself to win and rutledge found himself thinking that here was the invisible cost in human suffering and hardship many of the factories had shut down and the residential streets were grim in novembers gray chill not even a dog wandered in the gutters sniffing for scraps those who could escape had done so long ago especially those who had found a way of prospering from the war those who were doomed to finish out their lives here had fallen prey to despair and hopelessness among them mrs shaw and so it seemed henry cutter not for the first time rutledge asked himself how henry cutters wife had come by that missing locket ye canna be sure she did theres only one womans word for it rutledge replied grimly it wasnt in the shaw house when it was searched id stake my career on that aye its what youre doing the problem is why would shaw have given the locket to cutters wife for safekeeping when the police were crawling all over his house it would have been safer to pitch it into the thames he fell easily into the old habit of answering hamish of treating the voice in his head as though the dead man sat in the rear seat of the motorcar his constant companion and a fearful presence shaw wasnt the sort to stray from home and hearth but then no one thought he was the sort to commit murder either people are sometimes verra different under the skin if he was clever enough to kill he might ha been clever enough to have other secrets the same could be said of mrs shawor the cutters rutledge passed the house on sansom street without stopping fog was curling in off the river wreathing roofs and sliding over chimneys giving the house and its neighbors a sinister air he told himself he hadnt yet formulated a strategy for his opening move like contemplating a chess game before touching the pieces he thought to himself it was very like thathe couldnt afford to choose the wrong move hamish was saying in the end you must speak to cutter but how to go about that without arousing bowless suspicions the chief superintendent was a vindictive enemy when aroused rutledge wished mrs shaw had had the sense to write to him instead of coming to the yard in person it would have drawn far less attention but then he might have read the letter and done nothing putting it down to a womans refusal to let go of the past her strong presence tearful and demanding and fiercely certain had affected him as she must have guessed it would it might yet prove to be nothing more than that a brooding that had consumed her to the point of believing in her own phantoms a widow whose husband had been hanged for murder must not have had an easy life nor her children he had only to look around him to guess what privations theyd suffered still shed survived it showed in her toughness and her determination he found it hard to blame her for being bitter and angry and if she was right if there had been a miscarriage of justice he was as much to blame as bowles and philip nettle perhaps more so because he had brought the case to trial everything hinged on that locket the autumn weather was at its worstthe clear skies of guy fawkes day had long since given way to a week of heavy clouds and a cold wind today the breathsucking fog seemed to follow rutledge out of london cloaking everything and everyone in a clinging damp choking vapor it ran ahead of him toward the downs silent fingers reaching through the hedgerows and shrouding the trees he could barely see the verges of the road and slowed for fear of running into a farm cart or lorry invisible around the next curve hamish a presence at his shoulder was restless with the tension of driving it wasna necessary to leave sae early yell kill us both before this weather lifts rutledge wasnt sure he would be sorry to wind up in a ditch his neck broken but his sister would mourn and a handful of friends and jean who had married her diplomat and sailed for canada would learn of his death on her wedding journey he smiled wryly at that he had no illusions now about his former fiancee jean would read the news and sigh prettily and say to her new husband my dear ive just hearda very dear friend has been killed on a road south of london ii must believe its a blessing he washe was never the same after the war you know i daresaybut no thats not fair i should never wish to believe hed found a way to end it and the diplomat not very diplomatically would reply briskly you mustnt blame yourself my dear its all in the past now hamish commented his voice clear in the dim interior of the motorcar aye its no a bonny thing to say but it might be true nonetheless rutledge concentrated his attention on the road elizabeth mayhew greeted him warmly clucking her tongue over the weather and saying i was afraid you might not come that youd be glad of the weather as an excuse nonsense he told her kissing her cheek it will lift by noon frances sends her love and im to convince you to come to london for a few days over christmas how sweet of her elizabeth said leading the way to the stairs i may do that ive grown so dull of late ill bore her to death but perhaps it would be good for me we shall see the house was a comfortable georgian manor on the outskirts of marling a pretty village that had enjoyed its share of wealth over the centuries and still maintained an air of quiet gentility set back behind a low brick wall the gardens bedded down for the winter the house now seemed to wear its age more starkly but in summer it glowed with the warmth of the sun and with the rampant colors of perennials with annuals sprawling at their feet then it was timeless and beautiful there had always been a welcome here as long as rutledge could remember but without richards voice in the passages or his long legs stretched out toward the fire after a day tramping on the downs there was an emptiness in the rooms that lamps and elizabeths lighter voice couldnt fill rutledge had known richard mayhew longer than elizabeth had long before elizabeth had come into the picture in his youth hed played tennis here with richard and gone for long walks over the downs following old tracks and pathways whose origins were lost in time it had seemed odd when the summer light lingered late into the evening to think of the ghosts whose footsteps they were following angles saxons romansgod knew what other now nameless tribes had passed this way richard had called it the spell of midsummer the poets are always writing about it i daresay the ancients worshiping the sun thought this a magic time and so it had been before the war had come and swept it all away now the house seemed sad without richard and rutledge found himself wondering if it wouldnt be wiser if elizabeth closed it for a time and took a smaller place in london away from the memories but perhaps those memories were comforting as his own were not she was saying and i must apologizebut weve been invited out to dine and i couldnt tell them no with the hamiltonsyou remember themand of course mrs crawford will be there shes coming up from sussex just to see you melinda crawford was one of the most remarkable women hed ever met as a child shed survived the siege of lucknow during the great indian mutiny of an inveterate and fearless traveler she had seen more of the world than most men rutledge had always been immensely fond of her her memory was as sharp as ever it had been her tongue as tart and her company as charming elizabeth reading his expression said wryly richard adored her too i think she took his death harder than i did it would be an unexpected treat to see mrs crawford again but not tonight he was too tired and his mood too dark for polite conversation it was a rather long drive he began and then stopped would you like to go she made a face not really but bella masters has been having a very difficult time and weve been trying to cheer her up a bit raleigh will come to dine but bella cant get him out of the house otherwise she hasnt said but i have the awful feeling that hes dying and nobody quite knows what to do whats wrong with him a very stubborn infection it cost him his toes and then his foot and now hes about to lose his leg close to the knee blood poisoning he has some sort of apparatus to wear in place of his foot but he hates it bella tries to pretend all is well which doesnt help its lydia hamiltons turn to entertain them and she couldnt make up her numbers im afraid raleigh isnt always very good company were the martyrs thrown to the lions in that case by all means well go rutledge assured her she seemed relieved but said only then come into the sitting room and well have our tea in comfort before its time to dress ive something to show you henrietta the spaniel had just presented elizabeth with puppies five of them still blind and squirming and noisy they lay in a box near the hearth and henrietta rose to greet rutledge before warily allowing him to admire her family elizabeth was on the floor beside the box clearly entranced giving him the name of each tiny ball of fur he could hardly tell one from another except by the livercolored spots but dutifully gave his attention to each in turn while henrietta licked his hand and watched attentively as elizabeth lifted her brood one by one and held the newborns up for his inspection he found himself thinking that elizabeth herself would have made a wonderful mother but there had never been any children in her marriage richard had been philosophical about it early days hed said but time had run out when the maid brought tea elizabeth went to wash her hands and henrietta climbed gratefully back into her box nosing each of her treasures as if to reassure herself that none had gone missing rutledge leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes hamish in the back of his mind was saying something about richard he ignored it and tried to put london and the yard out of his thoughts for the evening it would not do to drag the shaws into elizabeths uncomplicated world and yet rutledge found himself wishing he could talk to her as he would have done to her husband a barrister richard would have understood rutledges dilemma and heard the story out without criticism or comment elizabeth would worry over ben shaws innocence as well as his guilt and leave the subject more tangled than it was she came back into the room just then and seeing him with his eyes closed said briskly you need your tea and proceeded to pour him a cup hamish said a wee dram o whisky would do more good the whisky came at the hamiltons a stiff drink that lawrence hamilton handed him with the admonition youll need this elizabeth had gone upstairs to speak to lydia and the two men were alone in the drawing room rutledge said i hear masters hasnt been well he had met the man a time or two in the courts but hardly knew him at all no he hasnt and its been difficult for him not only the loss of his limb but the constant pain and the dragging down of his spirits he had to give up the law you know and that was possibly worse than amputation he loved his work lawrence was square fair with a ruddy complexion still hes a man of uncertain moods always was for all i know but now its noticeable lydia and elizabeth and a few other friends have tried to make his illness bearable for bella he broke off as the maid ushered in another guest melinda crawford swept into the room with grace a tall woman slim now with age and wearing the evening dress of another reign gray silk with lace high to the throat and binding the sleeves at her wrists her white hair piled high in shining waves was still thick and the handsome blue eyes were unclouded the beautiful ebony cane in her left hand was more affectation than necessity she greeted her host with warmth and then regarded rutledge with interest you survived the war then why havent you been to see me rutledge answered first i had to find my way back into civilian life but it was hamish that he had wanted to hide from her melinda crawford had seen war had nursed the wounded and comforted the dying when she was only ten her experience was so vast that he had been afraid she would instantly read his secret in his eyes he went to kiss her cheek and she held him off for a moment studying his face ah and have you found your way she let him kiss her then and took his arm as he led her to the small french love seat i dont know i expect youll tell me she laughed gently war has done nothing for your manners i see but its good to have you back lawrence is that sherry i see at your elbow he brought her a glass and she sipped it one of the privileges of age she declared is to be able to drink a glass or two of wine without a lecture on moderation this is quite good lawrence i shall require the name of your wine merchant lawrence chuckled indeed hes the same as yours ah but he never treats me as well hamish taken aback by melinda crawford was silent trying to make up his mind about her rutledge drawing up a chair next to the love seat said ive missed you at my age she agreed four years is a very long time i wasnt sure i would live to see you again she studied his face once more but the wicked seem to thrive in this world and im still here thank you for your letters and the books of poems i treasured both i thought you might like the poet o a manning shes dead now ive heard he answered simply yes a tragedy among so many tragedies theres never time to mourn i remember in india there were so many burials we couldnt cry anymore it was almost the same here after this war and youre back at the yard ive heard that as well you forgot my birthday this year i didnt forget i didnt know what you would have liked frances sent a gift from both of us nightgowns suitable for a queen if i have it right silk in fact from the east appropriate she felt very beautiful melinda crawford agreed most of all i would have liked your company for a few hours but then im selfish arent i when so many people are being murdered these days her eyes twinkled but there was an undercurrent of sorrow behind the words the aging face was serene and told him nothing but he had a glimpse brief as a butterflys touch of the loneliness of this extraordinary woman she would not have wanted him to see it before he could answer the door opened and a man and woman came in followed by a young man of perhaps thirty lawrence made introductions and rutledge studied raleigh masters the barrister had been heavyset now his jowls drooped like a bloodhounds and his clothes fit rather too loosely his brown hair was streaked with gray and his frame was a little stooped although that might have been from the crutches under his arm he swung into the room a powerful man still and undaunted it seemed by his infirmities hallo mrs crawford good to see you again my dear forgive me for not shaking hands mr rutledge but i have not yet learned the knack of these sticks his wife came to greet melinda crawford and then spoke to rutledge in a breathless rush down from london are you how very nice bella masters seemed to possess a rather diffident nature and her face was worn with worry as if she slept poorly but there was an underlying attractiveness there and a strength if rutledge was not mistaken that was the last defense against her own weakness lydia and elizabeth returned to greet the newcomers and bella went on in that breathless way we are so sorry to be latethe weather was very bad just past hever nonsense her husband retorted adjusting his sticks as he sat down heavily into a chair i could see perfectly well bella glanced apologetically at the young manwho must have been driving thembut he ignored the remark and came to speak to mrs crawford and then rutledge lawrence hamilton had introduced him as tom brereton and he said now to rutledge did i hear mr hamilton correctly youre an inspector yes scotland yard then youre here on duty actually im on leave brereton nodded i believe lawrence said you are a friend of mrs mayhews yes ive known her for some years richard and i were at oxford together i met her in hospital during the war she read wonderfully wellit was rather like hearing a play everyone came to listen i never had the good fortune to know her husband they tell me he was an excellent barrister i was interested in the law at one time but my eyesight isnt what it was brereton smiled wryly shrapnel they did what they could but i wont be studying long hours anymore yet you drive it was a typical policemans response as hamish was pointing out oh yes i can manage now but they tell me a great many more motorcars will be on the road in the next year or so that might make a difference he shrugged i know kent fairly well it helps mrs crawford was chatting with lydia and brereton continued in a lowered voice shes a truly amazing woman did you know shed been at lucknow during the mutiny i cant quite comprehend it that was rutledge responded she has several interesting souvenirs including one of the greased paper cartridges that sparked the mutiny and the ball that passed through her skirts one afternoon as she carried water to the wounded her mother nearly fainted at the newsyoung melinda was supposedly taking a nap brereton smiled i can believe the story my grandmother told me once that mrs crawford had been quite a heroine but she denies it at dinner they were well into their soup before masters looked up from his spoon and said mrs crawford im told mulligatawny soup is an old indian specialty i shouldnt know mr masters ive never been in a kitchen in my life rutledge nearly swallowed his soup the wrong way but masters took her at her word and grunted well ive never been one for foreign dishes although they tell me the french cook surprisingly well bella masters turned to stare at her husband and rutledge caught a shadow of fright in her eyes searching in her pocket she found a small vial of powder and asked the maid for a glass of water after mixing the two she handed the glass down to her husband on the other side of elizabeth masters shook his head and finished the course without saying more but over the roast of beef he turned to rutledge and asked are you here inspector in an official capacity no fortunately im on leave and have come down to visit friends hmm if the yard knew what it was about youd be looking into these murders of ours it was said with a proprietary air as if they were his own bella said i dont think we ought to discuss here nonsense her husband interrupted theyre the talk of the district you can hardly step into a shop without hearing the whispers all the same melinda crawford put in firmly it can wait until the ladies have withdrawn elizabeth i hear youve been blessed with puppies how many did henrietta produce five elizabeth answered as masters said something under his breath would you like one of them unless ian intends to speak up you have first choice im afraid not theres no garden for a dog at my flat rutledge replied let mrs crawford have her pick lydia said the children would love one dont you think lawrence or two perhaps theyll be squabbling constantly over just one hamilton drawled in mock enthusiasm brereton laughed ill take one of them mrs mayhew ive got a small house but the garden is walled a dog should be quite happy there masters glared at brereton youre not taking it home in my motorcar elizabeth interposed soothingly their eyes are barely open it will be weeks before they can leave their mother bella nodded to her husbands glass the powder was settling to the bottom no longer in suspension do drink your medicine my dear its long past time for it masters grudgingly picked up the glass swirled it irritably and swallowed half of it with a grimace i daresay it could be poison for all i know but i trust you my love she seemed to shrivel before his glare it was the doctor who ordered it raleigh hardly poison lydia signaled the maid to remove the dishes well she said brightly have you heard the gossip that house on the other side of the church has been bought by someone from leeds he made his money in scrap iron during the war or so they tell me the conversation moved on smoothly and bella thanked lydia with her eyes the powder whatever it was seemed to shift her husbands mood and he joined with good humor in the speculation over the newcomer and what effect he might have on village affairs if hes a bachelor every woman within ten miles will be inviting him to dine in hopes of marrying him off laughter met his comment ask brereton here hes never at a loss for a way to spend his evenings brereton answered if hes a rich bachelor hell have the edge ill be forgotten in a day its a beautiful house elizabeth commented im glad someone will live there again for rutledges benefit she added the last of the family died of influenza a year agooliver hendricks he always offered us the pick of his gardens for the church oliver lost both sons in the war poor man richard knew both of them well rutledge himself remembered walter and john hendricks but said nothing what was there to say death had not played favorites it was after the ladies had withdrawn for tea and the port was being passed that masters returned to the subject of murder i cant understand he demanded why the yard hasnt been more forward in this business two bodies in a matter of weeks im afraid i know nothing about the murders sir rutledge answered him i wonder what you are about then to be giving officers leave when they ought to be doing their duty is the height of stupidity the chief constable rutledge began but was interrupted i know the law inspector i spent twentyfive years as a barrister ten of them as kc my question is why does no one take these murders seriously enough to put a stop to them thats unfair lawrence hamilton put in you have to remember i remember only that invalided soldiers are dying and no one seems to care masters retorted when my mentor matthew sunderland was alive he believed that there would come a time when murder was tolerated as long as it inconvenienced no one but the victim i daresay hes being proved right rutledges attention swung back to masters matthew sunderland had been the kings counsel in the murder trial of ben shaw rutledge remembered him distinctly a stooped and thin figure in his black robes his voice and his manner patrician as he conducted the prosecution mr justice patton had treated him with cordial respect well deserved by a man who had served the law for nearly fifty years sunderland was seldom wrong when he cited a precedent and young barristers lived in dread of facing him across the courtroom its interesting that you knew sunderland rutledge said shifting the subject to one he preferred to explore do you recall the shaw trial why should i masters countered i wondered if sunderland had ever spoken of it to you rutledge returned mildly it received widespread publicity at the time sunderland was always conscious of his duty masters replied and convinced that hed done his best i never knew him to feel any doubt about the outcome of any trial hamish in the shadows of rutledges mind and quiet for most of the meal spoke now you didna ask him that masters as if suddenly aware of the small glass with his medicine in it stared at the remaining portion for a moment swirled the contents again and then drained it at one draught by the time lawrence hamilton had described a fraud trial in which he was involved masterss chin was resting on his chest and he was breathing heavily hamilton glanced at rutledge i think its time to join the ladies well let him sleep shall we its happened before rutledge and brereton quietly rose and followed their host to the drawing room bella masters looked up quickly as they came in and relief spread across her face as she saw that her husband was not with them is he sleeping she asked softly when hamilton nodded she said only well it will do him good she had been sitting next to mrs crawford and now came to take a chair beside rutledge i want to say she told him smiling that its wonderful to see elizabeth out and about again its time she put the past aside shes one of my favorite people you know a shadow passed over her face and the smile faded widowhood is something we all must learn to live with god knows every wife must look ahead to the possibility shes a remarkable woman he agreed wondering if mrs masters was matchmaking but she surprised him by adding her eyes straying to brereton sitting by elizabeth now theres someonewell i may be speaking out of turn someone rutledge prompted curious brereton perhaps or was mrs masters warning himthe houseguestoff on general principle theres a young man shes had lunch with a time or two ive seen them in the window of the plough the hotel on the high street i hope its someone suitable a worried frown touched her face he found himself thinking that bella masters wasnt the sort who could prevaricate successfully her expressions were too easily read ill bear it in mind he said answering the concern rather than her actual words he spent perhaps another five minutes sitting with mrs masters and then was commandeered once again by mrs crawford who wanted to know what frances his sister was thinking of letting that handsome major slip through her fingers rutledge laughed i rather think it was the other way round frances enjoyed his company but was not in the right frame of mind to accept a proposal melinda crawford said i do wish she would settle shes a very intelligent young woman and your father spoiled her she wont find his like and she should stop tryingbefore the better choices are snapped up it was rutledge thought a unique way of regarding his sisters spinsterhood he suddenly realized that he shared it caught up as he had been in his own problems he had not stopped to consider why frances was still unmarried had there been someone during the warsomeone he had never known about and she had not wanted to speak of a little more than a half an hour later rutledge and elizabeth took their leave masters rested and less belligerent had departed with brereton driving mrs crawford had gone a little before them her chauffeur summoned from the kitchens where hed been gossiping with the hamilton staff lydia had carried elizabeth off for a moment to review the christmas flower schedule for church services leaving the two men alone hamilton said apropos of nothing you said something earlier about the shaw murders what brought them to mind my chief superintendent rutledge answered mildly he was promoted on the coattails of them we arent allowed to forget that our first cook was horribly shocked by the deaths even though they occurred in london i remember she refused to let a man into her cottage after that she was convinced shed die the same way dreadful to be old and fearful i went myself a time or two to help nail up the back steps or whatever needed doing and always took care that lydia was with me he shook his head the poor woman died in her sleep and wasnt found for two days did you know matthew sunderland at all i knew him to nod to as we passed each other i was too provincial and too young to have the courage to sit at the great mans feet although to do him justice he was never as lofty as he appeared but the man had a regalness about him the white hair and his carriage someone i forget who compared sunderland to general gordonthat same charismatic belief in his own power hamilton smiled to tell you the truth i often wondered how many cases sunderland carried just striding into the courtroom and he had a voice to match deep and impressive enough to read the old testament to savages we wont see his like again this century as she stepped into his car elizabeth mayhew said to rutledge sorry i didnt mean to keep you waiting so long but if lydia and i dont settle the flower schedule ourselves theres endless confusion people by nature want to change things and it takes hours for the committee to draw up a satisfactory list weve learned to circumvent argument by working it out between us as the engine turned over he got into the car beside her then realized that earlier shed folded the rug for her knees and laid it in the rear seat with a cold shock of dread he turned and fished for it his eyes carefully away from the spot that hamish seemed to favor as his fingers touched the wool he drew it toward him it seemed to come with unexpected ease as if hamish had given it a push in his direction but that was imagination and he took a deep breath to dispel the feeling of having come close to the one thing he fearedfinally confronting the nemesis that haunted his waking hours hamish had died in france in in the nightmarish days of the first battle of the somme he had died as surely as any of the war dead shot by a firing squad at rutledges orders shot by the coup de grace that rutledge had administered with his own hand buried deep in the stinking mud that the artillery shell had thrown up killing men like nettles before a scythe rutledge had not wanted to execute the scottish corporal but hamish macleod had been stubborn in his refusal to do what he had been ordered to do and in the heat of battle disobeying an order in the face of his men had left his commanding officer no alternative but to make an exampleand hope with all his being that the young scot would see the error of his ways well before the threat had to be carried out but hamish worn and exhausted and tired of watching men die in the withering fire of no mans land would not lead them out again and rutledge had had to do what he had sworn he would hamish macleod had been a natural leader not a coward respected by officers and men alike but he had been battered by too much death and too little sleep hed watched the corpses piling up hed lost count of the replacements and the shock of the endless bombardments had left him shaken and tormented death had come as a release for himand had nearly destroyed rutledge and while hamish lay somewhere in franceburied securely beneath a white cross lost in an alien garden of thousands upon thousands of war dead hardly distinguishable from the soldiers who slept on either side of himif his ghost walked it walked in scotland not england he had loved the highlands with a passionate intensity and the woman hed left behind there but in rutledges battlefrayed mind there was something that was still alive and stern and real the essence of the soldier hed known so well and hadfor the sake of a battleordered killed murdered rutledge shut the thought out of his mind as elizabeth was settling the rug over her knees and he was putting the car into gear he struggled to break the silence that engulfed him but the first question he could think of was what were these killings that masters was talking about oh i hadnt said anything before youre on leave and i hadnt wanted to bring your work into this holiday masters seems to have had no such compunction he said wryly ive never faced death she said thoughtfully so i cant tell you what id do if someonea physiciantold me i probably wouldnt live much longer but raleigh has fought it bravely its just that hes turned bitteri suppose thats the word the worst of it was hes had to give up his work in london and hes not the man we once knew i expect thats why were so tolerant of him as well as for poor bellas sake she doesnt quite know how to cope he wont let her touch himthey have nurses in for that she sighed drawing herself away from the masterses dilemma the murders there have been two exsoldiers killed one was found on a lonely road the other by a field and no one quite knows who would do such a thingor why the pity is they survived the war and now its not a german killing them but an englishman their own side i find that rather horrible dont you elizabeth had fallen asleep her head against his shoulder he was no more than two miles or so from her house as the crow flew and rutledge could feel the weariness of the long day turning to drowsiness of his own as he drove fighting it he concentrated on the road aheadand swerved as he realized too late that a man was standing at a crossroads almost in his path as the lamps of his motorcar pinned the figure in their bright beams he would have sworn in that instant that it was the face hed seen the night of the guy fawkes bonfire elizabeth came awake as the motorcar veered wildly she said quickly whats wrong rutledges heart rate seemed to have doubled as he fought the wheel to bring the car back to the road he had all but killed the man someonein the roadi didnt see him until i was on him he must stop he told himself disjointedlybe certain the man was all rightthe wing had missed himgiven the idiot a shock perhaps as severe as his ownbut done the man no harm there had been no contact yet he didnt want to go backhe didnt want to find that the figure on the road had existed only in his dreamfilled brain as he had drifted unexpectedly into sleep i dont see anyone in the road elizabeth said it doubtfully turning to look over her shoulder are you sure ian theres no one thereought we to go back hamish said you must go back you canna leave him to bleed to death in a hedgerow rutledge was already slowing the motorcar and with some difficulty turning it on the narrow road dread filled him a deep and abiding belief that if he was right there would be no body and no sign of one and when they reached the crossroads again although he searched for a good ten minutes no one was there rutledge was awake before dawn standing at the windows looking out over the back lawns of elizabeth mayhews house it was a pretty view even in the early morning mists flower beds laid out asymmetrically formed a pattern that led the eye down a grassy walk to a bench overlooking the small pool at the bottom of the garden in summer the beds held a wonderful variety of blooming plants but an early frost had blighted summers growth leaving behind only the skeletons of what once was but what he saw at this moment was not a kentish garden it was the blighted landscape of france it seemed he could still hear the guns using up their stockpiled shells in a mad frenzy of noise and destruction it was as if there was to be no armistice in a few hours the rattle of machine guns punctuated by the sharper fire of rifles added to the din and men were still dying and would go on dying until the eleventh hour he had tried to husband them to stop the waste of life and the long long lists of the wounded but he could hear the cries of pain and the screams of the dying and the scything whisper of bullets overhead a political decision it had been not a battlefield victory the armistice would commence on the eleventh day of the eleventh month at the eleventh hour of the morning november eleven am it had held no reality for rutledge he had stood in the trenches hamish alive in his mind and stared across the bleak tortured land he had known intimately for four unthinkable years and the scots words kept forming in his head i shallna see this eleventh hour i shallna go home with the rest i shallna prosper in the years ahead and you willna prosper either better to be dead better to walk out into that machinegun fire and be dead than to go home to nothing he could hear the voices around him men who had survived talking tentatively about what would actually happen here but not of home not yet no one could quite grasp an end to the bloody great war there was neither jubilation nor hope only an odd reluctance to think beyond the appointed hour as if it would be unlucky he wondered if the germans in their hidden trenches were feeling the same fatalistic acceptance or if they too counted their dead in their thoughts and wondered why it had all begun anyway he didnt know why it had begun this war he understood the political reasoning the invoked alliances the assassination in sarajevo where the austrian archduke had died he had succumbed to the banners and the enthusiasm and the euphoria as all the others had he had trained and shipped out for france and gone into battle with a sense of duty and honor then he had watched it metamorphose into the most appalling slaughter in living memory and still the generals and the political leaders and the press had fought on safe in their cocoons far from the dying appalling coming back to the present he watched a wind lift the boughs of the trees and run lightly across the grass was it barely a year ago that this slaughter had ended with no banners and no enthusiasm and no posturing in a last barrage of shells and the cold gray november dawn he shivered for too many men this was not a day of solemn commemoration but a day of agonized remembrance for him a reminder that hamish macleod had not come home when he went down to breakfast elizabeth was already there good morning she said cheerily then seeing his face the tired lines that marked a sleepless night she went on in a more subdued tone melinda crawford has asked us to tea theres a note that just arrived im to send back an answer yes why not rutledge answered and ill take you both to dinner afterward if you like id like that she agreed she watched him lift the lids of serving dishes on the handsome buffet and fill his plate ill give the staff the day off theyll be delighted sitting down across from her he picked up the napkin ring and then reached for the teapot it was a quiet domestic scene far removed from the images that had haunted him only a short hour ago soothing in a way that he hadnt anticipated as if it had the power to wipe away the past simply by being so normal so undemanding as he looked up he thought elizabeth was about to say something to him and he waited expecting her to suggest plans for the morning but she finished her toast instead eyes dropping to her plate ill just tell the chauffeur were coming she said after a moment hes waiting in the kitchen for my reply rising she walked gracefully to the door and left him to his own meal he knew none better that an appearance of hearty appetite was an accepted indication of good health the knowledge had served him well when he had spent more than a week in his sisters home an invalid after being shot in scotland but elizabeth had been picking at the food on her plate and he wondered what was on her mind the policeman in him was too well trained not to take notice it would he thought come out one way or another in its own good time the door opened and she came back into the room frowning ian the most horrid thing theres been another murdercloser to us this time and on the road we took just last night mrs crawfords chauffeur hadley was regaling the cook and scullery maid with the gruesome details hed come that way this morningthe police stopped him to ask his business rutledge stared at her had he struck the man in his headlamps was this the body that the police were examining even now who was killed was the driver told he kept his voice steady with an effort of will the police didnt say but a farmer who was bringing his horse to the farrier had seen the body and told hadley that it was a onelegged man like the others how did he die i dont think they know yet it wasnt an accident hadley was certain of that ought you to do something the last thing rutledge wanted to do was to go back to that crossroads and look down on the face of a man he might recognize and yet he knew very well that the figure hed seen had had two good legs it was coincidenceand a damned uncomfortable one he had to believe that whatever hed glimpsed was a trick of memory a startling but harmless tearing of the curtain between sleeping and waking hamish was saying you werena asleep at the bonfire theres nothing i can do to help i dont have the authority here rutledge told elizabeth truthfully she pressed her hand to her cheek as if for comfort what a terrifying start to the morning come eat your breakfast and dont dwell on it rutledge responded quietly theres nothing you can do nothing i can do for that matter id only be in the way with a twist of her shoulders as if trying to shake off her unsettled mood she said id never realized quite how unpleasant your work must be dealing with such things no different in fact from a doctors surgery where one patient has hiccoughs and another has a gall bladder he lied with a lightness that he didnt feel but it earned him a smile from elizabeth he reached for the jam pot and said in a more cheerful voice what would you like to do this morning im at your service she bit her lip would it be too much to askcould you help me go through richards things i havent been able to face it alone and thats not why i asked you to come and staybut this isnt starting out as the morning id plannedand she broke off distracted by what she was trying to say but the words wouldnt come whatever they were ill help you rutledge told her on one condition that we try not to make it morbid for your sake if not mine she nodded i wont cry on your shoulder nor you on mine this is what one does after a death in the family isnt it a practical matter before the moths get into the clothes it was her turn to try for lightness she failed wretchedly oh hell she ended bitterly why couldnt he have come home hamish answered her but of course she couldnt hear the words because the guid died and left only the dregs to make the new world as it turned out the morning passed uneventfully the clothes hanging in the wardrobes no longer carried the scent of the man who had worn them in a faint mustiness had crept in despite applications of lavender and they had lost the personality that had given them vitality elizabeth folded and packed them as rutledge took them out and handed them to her the drawers of the chest were easier their contents already folded already in neat piles in the top drawer elizabeth came upon a pair of cuff links engraved with initials she held them for a moment in her hand then passed them to rutledge you gave him thesea wedding gift would you like them back to remember him by he thanked her and took them hed liked richard immensely and had found in him a good friend it was kind of his widow to remember that as the tall case clock in the hall struck the eleventh hour with its deep tolling chimes they both paused in silence standing where they were in the midst of their work as a natural thing rutledge thought he could hear the distant sound of the bagpipes that had buried hamish macleod but it was only a trick of the mind tea with melinda crawford was typical she was in great spirits and refused to allow her guests to enjoy anything less she chided elizabeth for bringing a pot of honey saying you know im not allowed to indulge in such things but the expression of delight in her eyes told them that she would enjoy it hugely turning to rutledge she said growing old is not for most people its too trying one darent eat this or do that or even bend over to smell the garden flowers for fear ones back wont straighten up again you seem to thrive on it all the same he told her well its most certainly better than the alternative he looked around the room found it unchanged from his last visit before going off to war there were the personal possessions shed brought home from india with her beautiful carvings and silks sandalwood fans that scented the warm air and a small teak curio cabinet with ivory inlays where she always kept smaller treasures they were as fascinating as the stories she told about them it was in a way like stepping back into his own past and he found it unexpectedly soothing she rang a little bell at her elbow and tea appeared like magic a wheeled cart with a silver service fine china and from somewhere a single yellow rose she had remembered that rutledge liked cake and had ordered two kinds one with a lemon filling and the other with raisins elizabeth was asked to pour and as she passed a cup to rutledge mrs crawford said you met tom brereton the other night at the hamiltons what did you think of him rutledge replied sound enough a friend i take it of mr and mrs masters brereton was to be raleighs protege and read the law a brilliant future ahead of him the war put a stop to that elizabeth said hes nice we had lunch one day when he came into marling to see the doctor he regaled me with tales about the american expeditionary forces hes a wonderful mimic i was thinking mrs crawford said of leaving him something in my will his life wont be easy if he loses his sight she smiled of course it could be a long wait im not in the mood to shuffle off my mortal coil all the same it would please me to help someone in need brereton doesnt have a great deal of money and independence when one is blind is important it would be a kindness certainly elizabeth said but do you know him well enough can you be sure its for the best i intend to know him better before making a final decision but ian here is a good judge of character id like him to keep my notion in the back of his mind which rutledge thought was a veiled suggestion that he use his resources at the yard to verify breretons worthiness but why had she chosen to speak of this in front of elizabeth the answer followed on the heels of the thought elizabeth said richard knew his family of course toms grandfather served in india at one time did you ever meet him out there mrs crawford set her teacup on the tray we danced a waltz together in agra i was all of twelve and terribly in love he was quite dashing in his uniform but rutledge had the strongest feeling that she was not telling the entire story as they finished their tea and he dutifully ate the last of the raisin cake mrs crawford turned to elizabeth my dear will you go up to my room and fetch the small box youll find on the desk there i dont like to ask shanta to do it her bones are older than mine shanta was the indian ayah who had become the housekeeper much to the shock of the neighbors she ruled the household with an iron hand reminding recalcitrant staff that even the dear queen had had an indian servant and that mrs crawford was following royal tradition rutledge wondered at times how mrs crawford kept any servants at all but they seemed to adore her and seldom left until they were carried out in their coffins as the door closed behind elizabeth melinda crawford turned to rutledge and asked what is troubling you that silly girl who turned you down for a diplomat she was referring to jean who had once been engaged to rutledge and broke it off when he came home shellshocked no besides shes off to canada with him well i hope hes worthy of hermost diplomats are as shallow as she is rutledge laughed mrs crawford was nothing if not partisan when she cared for someone then its something else scotland i had a long letter from your godfather hes been worried about you he says the war has changed you well war has changed us all come to that but you more than most i think it isnt physical i can count all your limbs therefore they must be in the mind these wounds of yours too many bad memories or bad dreams a little of both he answered ruefully it will pass he had feared she would be able to see too clearly he had been right my dear i lived through the great mutiny when we all expected to die and most unpleasantly ive seen things no woman ought to see no nor a man either it does not pass one just growsaccustomed to it one learns to crowd it out and put it into the farthest corner of ones mind he couldnt explain to her that hamish already lived there i try he said youre young and a remarkably attractive man did you know that its time you married had a family and looked forward elizabeth he asked wondering if that was why mrs crawford had sent her out of the room but melinda crawford shook her head frowning no elizabeth isnt right for you my dear and i hope you have no thoughts in that direction besidesi rather think her fancy lies elsewhere his eyebrows flew up in surprise was that what had been on the tip of elizabeths tongue at breakfast that morning before the news of another murder had spoiled the chance to speak to him he wondered bella masters had also hinted at other attachments watching his face melinda crawford nodded in satisfaction as if pleased to discover no attachment here he knew she was fond of elizabeth and was amused still he was slow answering unable to tell her why he could never offer marriage to any woman how would she could sheshare his life with hamish then hearing footsteps coming down the stairs his hostess said in a low voice rapidly and with an intensity that was unlike her remember one thing ian i have seen war at its worst nothing you can tell me will shock me or disturb me if you ever find you need to talk about things best forgotten i shall be here for a time at least dont leave it too long the box inlaid marble contained photographs of a garden party mrs crawford had given nearly thirty years ago and rutledge recognized his parents among the faces his father stooping over his mother with loving attention as he brought a plate of food to her table his sister frances in a trailing lacy gown that all but swallowed her stared at the camera with sober curiosity richard was there a fair smiling child with girlish curls to his shoulders his pose already exhibiting that sturdy masculine grace that had made him a natural athlete and one of the finest cricket bowlers in kent rutledge sat astride a pony his shoes dangling high above the stirrups his face half hidden by a pith helmet tipped over one eye mrs crawford in an elegant hat that was a froth of ostrich feathers was surreptitiously gripping his belt to keep him safely in the saddle it was typical of her to have planned an afternoon that would please both her guests elizabeth was poring over the photographs with exclamations of delight rutledge as keen an observer of human nature as melinda crawford wondered if she had also set out to recapture a time far removed from war on this day of all daysas if she knew what was going through his mind it was an extraordinary kindness he smiled and tried to remember that sunny afternoon for her sake and succeeded in making her happy whether he had succeeded in convincing her that she had chased away all the dark shadows he couldnt tell hamish said i wouldna wager my pay on it on his return to london on the evening of wednesday twelve november rutledge went directly to the yard instead of his flat at this hour in a city the size of london the police presence at the yard was as strong as it was at midday and he was greeted jovially as he strode down the passage to his office sergeant gibson whose irascible manner concealed a very clever mind said ware the wolf at the door as he passed and inspector raeburn paused to warn if youve come for peace and quiet better leave now indeed there was an air of orchestrated urgency about the place another inspector stopped long enough to say old bowels scents promotion hes been summoned to the home office tomorrow possibly something to do with that rash of fires in slough they found a body when the ashes cooled this morning and the hope is its the firesetter not a hapless victim seven firms have been burned out so far and were frantically searching for a link connecting them youll find it soon enough rutledge responded as he reached his office with so many men out of work and wages very low as britain tried to regain her capacity for peacetime industry bitterness often turned to trouble and labor disputes became volatile fire setting was not uncommon hamish pointed out referring to the shaw investigation it isna a good time to bring up the past it wasnt rutledge shut his door against the mayhem and sat down at his desk he had made notes from the shaw file and with luck there would be a few free hours in the morning to visit one or two of mrs shaws neighbors discreetly he drew the sheets of paper out of his drawer and prepared to read through them again seeking any missed clue he had given himself two days to find a sense of perspective about the case instead other emotions had driven it from his mind and yet with the commemoration of the armistice safely behind him almost as if turning a leaf in a mental book he felt a return to a sense of balance hamish reflecting rutledges tiredness from the drive out of kent doubted there would be anything worthwhile to be found in his notes for ye read them on sunday and youre no so puir a policeman that you couldna see it was all trim and proper then still rutledge persevered but the pages were not in proper order and an extraneous letter an invitation to a retirement dinner for another officer was in among them it had been lying on his blotter sunday when he had walked out of the room in plain sight he stared at the sheets in his hand trying to remember how he had left them hamish was right about one thinghe wasnt so poor a policeman that he would mix up his files like this he had learned early on in his career that a meticulous attention to detail was essential to giving evidence in court a muddled record of any investigation was a death knellthe defense would swoop down on the policeman like an eagle after prey and tear him apart pages two and five had been reversed he sorted through them again one five three four two and just after five that extraneous letter a thought struck him then and with it came cold alarm someone had been in his office and gone through his desk in his absence what had they been looking for and in their search had they taken note of this sheaf of pagesor simply set it aside while hunting for another file more to the point what present inquiry of his was urgent enough that new information couldnt wait three days for his return he thumbed through the copied notes again he had nothing to hide the original file had been returned to its cabinet after he had abstracted the information he wanted he had disturbed no onehe had left no particular trail in fact he had simply tried to be circumspect knowing chief superintendent bowles would be the first to be annoyed by any resurrection of his own pastthe inquiry that had begun his climb to his present position no it wasnt bowles there would be no reason for him to come to rutledges office if hed needed a folder he would have sent someone else to locate it and whoever it was no doubt in a hurry had sifted through the drawers contents with only one thing on his mind satisfying bowles rutledge went through his entire desk with great care as far as he could determine nothing was missing the files he was presently working on were as hed left them whatever had been taken must also have been returned coincidence it was the only explanation but neither he nor hamish found it satisfactory the next morning rutledge reported for duty and then at midday after a meeting ended earlier than expected he found his way again to the street of sootblackened houses where the shaws had lived their entire married life winter sun splashed the roofs and walls bringing out every flaw like an aging woman who had ventured out too early into the merciless morning light even the mortar of the bricks seemed engrained with coal smoke and in the windows white lace curtains mocked it number was very like its neighbors upright and lacking any individuality that would offer a hint about the occupants within the iron knockers on several doors were victorian whimsy massproduced rather than a reflection of personal taste one house possessed an urnshaped stone pot that had held pansies in the summer their withered stems falling over the sides like a bedraggled veil but most of the street seemed not to care about the image it presented the white lace curtains were a last pitiful attempt at pride but there was no money to spend on frivolous ornamentation rutledge left his motorcar a block away and continued on foot hoping to attract as little notice as possible but now and again curtains twitched as the women of sansom street inspected the stranger with suspicion he was as much an outsider here as he might have been on a street in budapestoutsiders seldom brought anything but trouble particularly welldressed ones with an air of authority he walked on to the end of the street where a church stood like a beacon its early victorian tower rising above the dingy roofs the door needed paint and the stainedglass windows were grimy but when rutledge stepped inside and opened the door to the nave he was surprised to find the interior as bright and polished as any church in westminster his footsteps echoed on the flagstone as he walked down the aisle and something large and black rose like a goblin from the chairs below the pulpit a scarecrow of a man his robes flapping and his face flushed called good morning is there any way i can help you the rector rose to his full height a feather duster in his bony hand and a cobweb across his chest like a lace collar his white hair in disarray looked like a ruff the smile was genuine if wry rutledge said gesturing around him this is truly a sanctuary well yes we try to manage that my wife had a committee meeting this morning and im frightfully poor at dusting but one tries he paused what brings you to st agnes curiosity i suppose rutledge said slowly i understand you buried a parishioner not long ago a mrs cutter janet cutter it was a guess and apparently on the mark its been three months since she was laid to rest the rector said riffling the feather duster between his hands and sneezing briskly her husband has taken it hard not being used to fending for himself everything at sixes and sevens are you acquainted with the cutters ive met them my name is rutledge i had occasion to speak with themsome six years ago the rector nodded that would be near enough to the time that ben shaw was arrested i was at the trial when the verdict was brought in i recall seeing you there he left the words like a gauntlet between them rutledge smiled yes you have a very good memory in my callingas in yours im surea good memory is a necessity he put the duster down behind the steps to the pulpit and said again what brings you here rutledge took a chair in the first row i dont know recently i received information that intrigued me and like a good policeman i follow my instincts then mrs shaw took my advice the rector responded i wondered if she would it was unexpected rutledge asked she came to see you yes she was quite disturbed she wasnt sure what to do and i told her to begin with the police not with henry cutter it was after all a police matter the rectors long narrow face gave little away he took another chair moving it slightly to face rutledge their voices echoed in the emptiness of the church and rutledge had an uneasy feeling that if hamish spoke the words would echo as well a shiver passed through him the rector was saying toward the end of her life janet cutter was a woman with something on her conscience it kept her restless even with the morphine for the pain but she never spoke to me about whatever worried her and i have no reason to believe it was murder i tell you that because i dont want you to jump to conclusions the evidence fails to support did you believe ben shaw was a murderer rutledge asked bluntly the rector turned away i dont know the answer to that truthfully ben was not a willful murderer it wasnt in his nature but few of us know what temptation will do when were faced with it and we think there are no witnesses to it he wanted more for his family than he could afford to give them did that lead him to theft and murder i would like to think it didnt but then the facts were quite clear still he could have been led the opportunity was there and the temptation rutledge picked up the thread he was following the women were old infirm it was a kindness to end their pain and their loneliness the rector shrugged who can say what went through that poor mans mind if shaw wasnt guilty of murder who was his wife mrs cutter the rector turned tired but knowing eyes on rutledge i dont speculate on guilt i try to bring comfort without judgment im a policeman judgment is my trade so it is the rector rose it has been interesting to speak with you may i offer a word of advice not as a man of the cloth but as someone thirty years your senior and therefore perhapsa little wiser by all means rutledge answered rising as well walk carefully you cant bring ben shaw back from the dead hes long since faced a judgment higher than yours or mine better for him to be a martyr than to open wounds you cannot close again rutledge considered him for a moment yet you sent nell shaw to me the rector smiled a youthful look replacing the somberness yes inspector its my earnest hope that you wont fail either of us outside the church hamish said sourly he prefers riddles to plain speech no i think hes uncertain of his duty and passed the problem on to me or knows a truth he willna own up to it was a cogent remark no one answered rutledges knock at number the shaw home he left walking back to the motorcar deep in thought he had no excuse to call on cutter and no right henry cutter would be well within his rights to complain to the yard of harassment if he found a policeman on his doorstep asking questions about an old murder and his wifes possible role in it but there was another source of information back at the yard rutledge called sergeant bennett into his office bennett had been a constable when ben shaw was tried and hed known the people on sansom street better perhaps than they knew themselves a sharp mind and a sharper memory had brought him to the attention of the yard and seen him promoted bennett was in early middle age now of medium height and with nothing to set him apart from the ordinary man on the street he interviewed time and again it had been his hallmark this ability to fit in rutledge had seen it at work often enough the question was where did bennetts loyalties lie at the yard there was no way of guessing hamish warned then youd best walk carefully rutledge began circumspectly this is in confidence bennett but ive been looking back at the shaw case it seems one of the missing pieces of jewelry may have come to light bennetts bushy eyebrows rose indeed sir curiosity was bright in his eyes id a feeling hed chucked them in the river rutledge was not about to enlighten him i want you to think back to the investigationbefore i came into the picture philip nettle was in charge of the case was there any suspicion that someone other than shaw had had access to the murdered women mrs winslow mrs satterthwaite mrs tompkins there was a charwoman who did for two of them bennett said slowly digging back into his memory not likely to smother anybody frail as she was no oldage pension for the likes of hershe worked until the day before she died the victims went to the same churchst agnes that waswhen they could get about on their own we looked at that connection closely sir but it went nowhere nor did they seem to have more than a nodding acquaintance with each other but as it turned out shaw came to meet them through the church after a fashion the rector asked him to make some repairs for mrs winslow and on the heels of that shaw was contacted directly about the other two which as hamish was pointing out might explain the rectors unwillingness to involve himself in the past shaw was a member of the same church hed repaired the vestry door after a storm warped it worked on the footing for the baptismal font when it cracked but he wasnt local you know grew up in kensington and still had ties there even attending services there in preference to st agnes mrs shaw was said to like that very well shed not cared for the local church seeing herself as above it his mouth twisted it was apparent he had not been among nell shaws admirers but after his marriage shaw appeared to have severed ties with his family or they severed theirs with him mrs shaw must have been a member of st agnes at some time as i recall shed grown up two streets over from sansom had been a member as a girl yes sir theres a story that was set about that she went into service in kensington and married the son of the house the truth was she worked in a corset shop and took a purchase round to the house one day for his mother the mother wasnt at home when ben told his future wife that bold as brass didnt she claim she was feeling faint and could she come in and sit for a few minutes intrigued rutledge asked how did you discover all this it hadnt been included in the written reports it was told me by the neighbors wife mrs cutter i discounted it until i spoke to a neighbor of shaws mothershe was still living in the same houseand she confirmed the corset version bennett looked pleased with himself rocking back on his heels still that had no bearing on the murders it was an afterthought the policeman overriding the man what was your opinion of the helpful mrs cutter now there was a deep one butter wouldnt melt in her mouth but shed just let slip a bit of the story see and then wait for you to pry the rest out of her as if she was reluctant to finish what shed begun rutledge had met others of mrs cutters ilk in his career did she know the three dead women odd that you should ask that sir bennett answered scratching his dark chin she swore she didnt but she went to that same church didnt she had done for twenty or more years rutledge smiled any chance that she might have been tempted to murder them after all her situation was hardly better than the shaws bennett considered the question as he studied rutledge as to that i cant say but mr nettle god rest his soul remarked once id not care to be in mr cutters shoes if he strayed too far from hearth and home interested rutledge asked and had he strayed or been tempted to stray do you think he was the only one defended mrs shaw most of the street couldnt abide the woman i was never sure what to make of that to tell you the truth sir except that she was a strongnatured woman that sort often attract weak men as he was leaving the yard for the day rutledge found himself thinking about bennetts last comment he wished there was a viable excuse for calling on cutter but without making his interest in the shaw case too apparent there was nothing he could do at this early stage as hamish had warned him several times that day he ought to watch his step bennett was very likely trustworthy but he was also ambitious and rutledge had learned from his first day at the yard that ambition ran rampant in the passageways and offices he himself had never craved promotion it was a mark of achievement but he had long since discovered that he preferred dealing with inquiries firsthand instead of rising to the level of delegating authority to others he had found too often that objectivity was lost with ambition and pleasing ones superior officer became more important than getting to the root of an issue philip nettle who had been the first officer charged with the shaw caseor the winslow case as it had begunhad complained several times that bowles was pushing him to conclusions you cant know that bowles was fond of saying stick with what you do know man and leave imagination to the press aye hamish agreed it isna always wise to look for complexity when there is none complexity rutledge retorted as he walked out the door was often what saved the innocent judging only by the obvious facts could lead a policeman astray it isnt the guilt of a man he said as he turned the crank on his motorcar that we set out to establish but the truth in a case and sometimes thats buried deep aye hamish agreed bitterly i wouldna be lying sae deep in a french grave if there had been time to sort out the truth wincing rutledge put his motorcar into gear and turned out onto the street you gave me no choice he said i couldna give you a choice hamish agreed else there would have been a longer list of the dead on my ain soul i couldna bear it as yere haunted so was i unsettled that night rutledge considered what to do about the shaws the wisest course was to ask mrs shaw to hand over the locket to chief superintendent bowles and wash his own hands of decision he could walk away then with a clear conscience but if bowles refused to take the matter any further what then push that small damning piece of jewelry out of his own mind as if it didnt exist pretend that there was no question about shaws guilt even though he knew there was hed seen the locket he had absolutely no doubt about its authenticity the truth was he wasnt as certain that he could trust bowles and whatever he decided the rearrangement of the papers in his desk drawer had left rutledge with a feeling that bowles was already looking over his shoulder waitingfor what for you to put a foot wrong hamish responded id no gie him the shovel to bury you with ive been pitched into doing the devils work rutledge said any way you look at it bowles may crucify me for trying to find the truth mrs shaw will damn me if i walk away and shaw himself will haunt me until i know what happened aye its a fearsome thing judgment i wouldna be in your shoon in the morning tired and hampered by the restlessness that was hamishs response to rutledges own uncertainties rutledge went back to the church where he had stopped on his first visit to sansom street the rectorthe name on the door read baileywas in his small cluttered office at the back of the church and rose to greet rutledge with a quiet interest ive come back again rutledge said because i have more questions to ask they arent official you can refuse to answer them if you wish but i need information and theres no other way to get it except to ask you look tired mr bailey remarked as the light from the windows fell on rutledges face sleepless night was it one of many he could have said instead rutledge admitted in a way im on the horns of a dilemma you see he set his hat on the chair beside him and began to explain bailey listened in silence rutledge trying to read his man came to the conclusion that bailey was not as struck by the events of the last week as he himself was or else hid his curiosity more cleverly i cant resolve your problems the rector said when rutledge had finished i have no reason to think that ben shaw was innocent and no reason to believe that he was guilty the courts drew that conclusion not i i simply offered comfort to the family and helped them survive pilate couldnt have said it better rutledge commented bailey smiled if i judge to what end will that come should i have lectured mrs shaw on her poor choice of husband from what ive heard he was a cut above her but a poor provider or perhaps hed given her a taste for the kind of life she really wanted to live and then walked away from it himself bailey pointed out i never discovered why he chose to work with his hands when he might have done much better for himself using his mind if his family rejected his wife he may have rejected their way of life and taken up something more suitable to hers as i remember she was left to fend for herself from an early age she hadnt been given his opportunities its true she had no family to speak of nor did shaw for that matter there was a sister but she died shortly after the hanging and i recall a cousin whod run off to australia in after a rift with his father there was no way to reach the man and no reason to expect that he would come if someone had tried i was told he hadnt come home for his mothers services when she died and hed been as close to her as anyone neville i think his name was and whatever caused the rift it was apparently severe was there anything between shaws wife and the neighbor cutter he seemed to speak well of her when interviewed few other people did cutter liked mrs shaw why i cant tell you and i wont guess but the odd thing was she was very different in his company than she was ordinarily marymy wifeeven spoke of it a time or two hamish said leave it and speak to mrs bailey for once rutledge agreed he asked a final question clearing up another possible direction as he stood to bring the interview to an end did mrs cutter visit the poor or the infirm as part of her duties as a member of this church most of the women have served on committees to visit those who are no longer able to come to services its considered a christian duty again mary would know more about that she has served on most of the womens committeesthe duty of a churchmans wife rutledge thanked him and left he found the rectory just around the corner on a side street a fresh coat of paint on the door setting it apart from its neighbors mrs bailey answered his knock drying her hands on her apron if youre looking for my husband youll find him in the church office this time of the morning she was a slim womansome would say bonywith stillfair hair and a smooth face though her throat and hands gave her true age away rutledge smiled and replied my name is rutledge ive just spoken with mr bailey and he suggested i might do better to ask you the questions im trying to answer rutledge she repeated the name thoughtfully we never met at the time but you must be the policeman who was assigned to the shaw inquiry nodding as she placed him she said my granddaughter told me you were a very finelooking man for a policeman she was eight at the time and murder had very little meaning for her thank heavens he could feel himself turning red mary bailey smiled oh dear im afraid i never mind my tongue as i should in a clergymans wife its a dreadful sin but ive found over the years that if i attach one interesting fact to someone i can keep a face and a name in my memory forever helpful when everyone expects the rectors wife to know exactly who they are and how important they might be she invited him into the kitchen where she was making bread the scents of warm yeast and rising dough were comforting her hands moving almost without direction began to knead the ball in the bed of flour this wont wait she explained and im sure your questions wont either what do you need to know has someone else in our parish been involved with the yard it was as if she had someone in mind he thought and was fishing no just an odd coincidence that occurred some days ago and when it was brought to my attention i wanted to put it to rest a piece of the jewelry missing at the time of the shaw murders has come to light im trying to find out whatif anysignificance that might have she studied him her blue eyes reading more than he was comfortable with and as the inspector involved you want to know if this changes anything thathappened in a wordyes he replied nodding she kept her eyes on her hands now yes well what is it you want to know he began indirectly mrs shaw did she serve on any of the womens committees visiting the ill the poor she didnt attend services here after her marriage but she was never comfortable with that sort of need i called on her once to ask if she might know of anyone looking to be a companion to an elderly man recovering from a leg fracture i thought at the time it might mean an extra bit of money for her if she could use it but she was clear on that point as well as her dislike of dealing with the infirm her neighbor mrs cutter was very active until her health broke we could always depend on janet cutter and she was a very good cook as well shed often bake a little extra and put it in a basket to take to someone under the weather still janet kept to herself you know she wasnt one to sit and gossip i put it down to shyness but she seemed to have a kind heart and fingers that stuck to bits of jewelry hamish asked mr cutter was one of the few people who defended mrs shaw when we were closing in on her husband he thought she was a very different person from the general impression of her his wife on the other hand was not as kind mrs shaw was never a very pretty woman but she has a very bold and defiant way about her mrs bailey added more flour to the bowl some men like that rutledge tried to picture mrs shaw flirting and failed he said as much mrs bailey laughed i never suggested she was flirting but her manner was bold she could manage tradesmen very well she could take charge of a situation and deal with it she was unflappable if the butcher overcharged her or brought her a less than satisfactory bit of beef she would face him down without embarrassment or tears now see here mr whoever i wasnt born yesterday and i know that that chicken is old and if you dont take it back i shall complain to my neighbors about the poor service youre offering these days how do you know this he asked intrigued because she said turning to face him the same tradesmen come to my door and over the years you hear things she dropped her voice a level and said in a brusque tone i fear mrs shaw isnt herself this week she complained fiercely about my cabbages i ask you have you ever had reason to doubt my cabbages its a way tradesmen have to play one customer against another and if i say your cabbages have always been quite lovely then the rest of his route hears that mrs bailey at the rectory is particularly fond of his cabbages what did ben shaw think about mrs cutter ah interesting you should ask that she murmured giving the bread dough a good thumping i think think mind you theres no proofthat when he was younger and drinking more heavily henry cutter was not above striking his wife when in his cups ben shaw was not used to the world he married into and came to live in he was sentimental and rather nice he would have been the knight in shining armor if janet cutter had cried on his shoulder ready to take on her battles but not to move into her bed if you follow me and yet he was accused of smothering three elderly women rutledge gently reminded her as a policeman she reminded him in turn you are not easily fooled well after nearly fifty years dealing with a church one comes to understand politics human nature and human frailty in unexpected ways the infirm are not always pleasant and clean and defenseless they can be illtempered nasty and terribly cruel their rooms often smell of urinesoaked bedding dirty bodies and bits of stale food they have bedsores and bad breath and suspicious natures their caretakers often abuse them because theyre helpless and because patience wears thin the knight in shining armor come to nail up shingles and repair windows doesnt last long even if the first time hed arrived in full array this doesnt excuse ben shaw you understandbut it is important to realize how easily such a thing might have happened rutledge had not walked into the scenes of the crimesphilip nettle had done that the women had long since been removed to the morgue thin and small under their sheets defenseless and pathetic youre telling me he said slowly that anyone might have killed them a man a woman not a monster what i found most unusual about the crimes was that anyone had killed the three women at all why not just randomly take what you like a silver spoon here a mans pocket watch there they would have missed something yes but who can say when they missed that spoon just how long it had been gone weve had cases where men come to the door with apparently respectable intentselling mousetraps or books of household hints and then finding no one at home they break in and take what they like easier to do when the inhabitants are elderly ill women asleep in their beds hed looked into that himself chance burglaries an easy way to add a few pounds to a doortodoor sellers pocket there had been no reports of any such burglaries in this part of london for a year before the murders hamish intent and interested said but if they complained the auld women and the thief had taken fright rutledge finished the thought in his head aloud if mrs cutter had found herself on the verge of being caught and hanged would ben shaw have volunteered to go back and speak to the old womenand when they refused to be silent silenced them forever mrs bailey set her loaf in the waiting pan its a shocking suggestion inspector not one that i care to contemplate to tell you the truth is there anything else you wish to know stillit made sense it would explain how a man like shaw had gotten himself involved with murder mrs bailey had been more helpful than she knew but rutledge realized as he drove across the thames back to the yard that he might also have underestimated the rectors wife in a parish where there were no garden tea parties or sunday luncheons with the gentry the rector and his wife had learned how people lived with the small degradations of little money poor health hard work and not much beauty the baileys would have had few illusions about their neighbors and over the years acquired a rather pragmatic view of their flock they had ministered in the truest sense without judgment at what cost to themselves he wondered there was a message waiting for rutledge when he arrived at the yard chief superintendent bowles wanted to see him braced for an angry confrontation rutledge went along to bowless office anything but angry bowles greeted him with his usual cold stare and brief command to sit down sit down there were papers all over his desk and he hunched over them with frowning intensity before saying to rutledge youve been in kent have you yes to visit friends hmmm whats your opinion of these murders i have none i dont know anything beyond the fact that there have been more than one looks bad damned bad the chief constable is not happy and his people havent found anything to be going on with incapable lot apparently bowles had never held a high opinion of police work outside london no thats not kind mainly its out of their line of experience you served in the war youll have a better sense of whats happening im sending you down to have a look be quick about it if you can the chief constable has friends in high places neednt say more on that score he passed a sheaf of papers across to rutledge who began to scan them as he suggested i should think devereaux would be the best man but bowles paid no heed some bloody foreigner to blame most likely unexpectedly rutledge was reminded of the face at the bonfirein the headlamps of his motorcar as if in warning rutledge looked up into the yellow eyes of his superior they were staring at him speculative watchful deliberately taking a different tack to test the waters rutledge replied the hoppicking season is over the extra workers have gone back to london or maidenhead wherever they came from i could deal with that end of the investigation from my desk worth looking into bowles agreed taking the remark as a course of action but they want someone on the ground in kent hand over whatever youre working on to simpson hell cope inspector simpson was as everyone knew bowless latest protege a weakchinned man with a spiteful nature he was in the words of sergeant gibson generally to be found toadying up to old bowels right pair the two of them there was rumored to be a wager on how long it would take simpson to make chief inspector over the list rutledge found himself wondering if it was simpson who had gone through his desk and as if reading his mind bowles added i hear a mrs shaw called on you a few days ago a bland voice a glance out the window to indicate that this was mere curiosity on the chief superintendents part fishing rutledge chose to be circumspect yes ben shaws widow his hanging still haunts her sad story shall i send simpson along to have a talk with her the yellow eyes were mere slits now short of bringing her husband back i doubt theres anything anyone can do even simpson rutledge paused she hasnt prospered since shaws death i expect she was hoping for a handout yes well shaw ought to have considered his family before taking to murder bowles stirred in his chair preparatory to dismissing rutledge see what you can do in kent ive already told the chief constable youll be there smartly it was an unmistakable warning get out of london and dont meddle with things best left alone rutledge made a point before leaving his desk to remove any papers connected with the shaws simpson if mining for trouble would find none but on his way into kent he paused in sansom street and again left his motorcar where it would attract less notice he walked as far as the shaw house and then to the neighboring door of henry and the late janet cutter its no wise hamish told him therell be someone to see and in the end a tale will be carried back to the yard there may not be another chance rutledge found himself wondering if simpson had already questioned the constable on this street it would be like him a girlofallwork opened the door to him her hands red from laundry mr cutters not to home she confided in the tall attractive stranger on the doorstep hes just off to work after his dinner but i wouldnt look him up there mr holly is not one to like gossiping on company time it had all the earmarks of a quote overheard from her employer she smiled up at rutledge with artless interest then remembered her duty is there a message youd care to leave sir did you serve mrs cutter before her death he asked i dont remember you here before the war there had been an older woman as he recalled worn down with childbearing and worry who did the heavy work i came in she said when mum had tommy mum wasnt well after and mrs cutter asked if id like to work instead and a good thing too for tommy was trouble from the start colic a cloud passed over her face darkening her sunny spirits mum and tommy were took by the influenza within a day of each other she nodded wisely she never knew he went best that way was mrs cutter a good employer did you enjoy working for her she wasnt a bad employer the girl said groping for words to explain how she felt mum said she were different before the stroke jollier it was as if that took the spirit right out of her and she seemedsadwhen i came here as if there was a burden she couldnt carry and it was getting heavier with every year that went by and finally it buried her under its weight did you have trouble pleasing her he encouraged her guileless chatter the stroke had occurred after the trial mrs cutter had been well enough the last time hed come here to question the couple oh it werent that so much as the heaviness of her mind it was like working in a house where thered been a death as if black crepe hung on the mirrors and the shades were drawn for such a young girl as hamish was also pointing out it would have been a depressing atmosphere and mr cutter did he find the house bleak too mum said he was bewildered but when i came in he was more resigned the missus was young for a stroke mum said came on of a sudden like a flash of light mum heard her calling and then the sound of someone falling down the stairs frightened her witless to find mrs cutter lying up against the balustrades halfway down and not able to move doris and betsy and i had nightmares hearing it but the boys wanted her to tell it over and over again where was your mother when this happened hanging out the clothes she left a sheet dragging to run in he thanked the girl still more of a child than a woman and walked back to his motorcar thoughtful and uneasy i ought to find henry cutter he told himself as he drove on to the lambeth road and turned toward kent its no been pressing for all these years hamish reminded him it hasnt no rutledge agreed and fell silent trying to remember the case not in hindsight but the way it had unfolded at the timethat was what was hard how hed felt how hed thought how hed watched the evidence build he had been another man then young idealistic a stranger to the hollow shell who had come back from the war and for months struggled to rebuild his peacetime skills he had more in common with the voice of hamish macleod than he did with his prewar self that ian rutledge might have lived six centuries ago not a mere six years somewhere they had lost each other november anywhere in england was a cold and often rainy month the air was heavy damp and chill and with the sun retreating toward the equator the shorter days seemed to drag through their appointed hours with a dullness that sometimes made the difference between sunrise and sunset a matter only of conjecture had the sun risen was it setting or was there another squall of rain on its way along the rivers fog could hold on for a good part of the morning and heavy clouds finished the late afternoon long before night could fall the lingering sunsets of midsummer when light filled the air well past eight and nine and sometimes as late as ten were a thing of memory a depressing season hamish said the rain was worst in france i couldna get used to the rain it had soaked their greatcoats and left shoes a soggy rotting mess and it had ruined tempers brought out the miasma of smells from the trenches and made the heavy mud so slippery that a man could lose his footing and go down as he raced across no mans land rutledge had fallen more than once feeling the swift plucking at his shoulder or elbow where machinegun fire had barely missed him and then scrambled back to his feet into the steady scything waiting for the blow to his body that never came never more than just that ghostly plucking living a charmed life had frightened him as much as it had defeated him hed wanted to die kent was a fertile part of the country covered with pasturage and hop gardens with orchards blazingly white in spring and apples or plums or cherries hanging darkly from summer boughs agriculture was its mainstay though there had been iron at one time and the cutting of the great forests for making charcoal to smelt the iron had opened up the weald to grass for sheep or horses or the plow there was still industry along the medway and shipbuilding on the coast where the tradition of putting to sea was strong but most of kent was green with ash and beech and sometimes oak in the hedgerows or marching in shady rows down the lanes this was also the gateway to england from the continent the path taken by invaders by priests by merchants and by the weavers who at the request of edward iii had come to teach the english how to turn their valuable wool into far more valuable cloth prosperous and rural and content most of the villages turned their backs on the doverlondon road and got on with their lives in peace marling was a pretty village even by kentish standards settled on a ridge overlooking the long slope of land that fell away toward the weald a high street ran through the center dividing where a triangular space opened up and created the irregular square that had held the guy fawkes bonfire the tuesday market here had been one of the villages mainstays for generations giving it status among its neighbors the square had been cleared long since of the last of the ashes and today lay quiet and colorless in the cold rain that had followed at rutledges heels even the cavalier standing bravely in the wet on his plinth appeared to huddle under his plumed hat rutledge knew where to find the police stationit was several doors down from the hotel where hed dined with elizabeth mayhew and her friends after the bonfire tucked in between a bakery on the one side and a haberdashery on the other the station occupied one of the old brick buildings still carrying proudly the georgian facades that gave marling its particular character the midday traffic was light a few carriages and carts a motorcar or two and women hurrying from butcher to greengrocer to drapers shopone pausing to speak to a friend pushed her covered pram with metronomic rhythm back and forth back and forth another carrying a small wet dog in her arms was lecturing the animal for running into the road warning it of dire consequences on the surface it was a peaceful scene a prewar england in some ways seemingly detached from the hardships and shortages that scarred sansom streets inhabitants in london hamish observing it said you wouldna think murder had been done here or ever would be no rutledge agreed but night falls early this time of year its always after dark that people begin to look over their shoulders he left the motorcar by the hotel and when he entered the police station was greeted by an elderly sergeant dressing down a young constable who was red about the ears the constable glanced up with undisguised relief at the interruption and earned another condemnation for not paying strict attention when the sergeant sent him on his way the young man scuttled out without looking back the sergeant straightened his jacket squared his shoulders and met rutledges glance levelly identifying him at once as a stranger sergeant burke sir what can i do for you inspector rutledge from the yard im looking for inspector dowling hes just gone home to his meal sir i expect him back on the half hour the sergeant studied him come about the murders then sir yes thats right well the chief constable knows best sir but i doubt even the yard can help us theres no sense to these murders at least not so far unless weve got ourselves a shellshocked soldier who thinks hes still at war rutledge flinched as the remark struck home the sergeant leaned against the back of his chair thick arms resting on the top to ease his weight ive been sergeant here for fifteen years he went on and was constable for ten before that and i can tell you this is the first inquiry where ive not got a hint about whos behind it no whispers in the shops no words dropped in the pubs nothing that makes me prick up my ears and wonder like theres always a root cause waiting to be found if you look hard enough but im blessed if we can see it the only thing the victims have in common so far as we can tell is their service in the war poor men all three who served their country well and came back with little to show for it but the loss of a limb no heros welcome nor bands playing nor offers of work a crying shame to see the lads lying like old rags by the roadside and feeling helpless to do anything for them how well did you know them i watched them grow up you might say sir never any real trouble from any of them except what youd expect from highspirited lads with time on their hands nothing vicious or mean yes i understand rutledge responded neutrally knowing well that it was human nature to praise caesar after he was dead thats mainly why im here another pair of eyes another perspective in the war were you sir four years of it burke nodded then youll know better than most what the lads went through well then inspector dowlingll give you what little weve found shall i fetch him for you sir no let him finish in his own good time rutledge left promising to return in half an hour he thought for a moment about calling on elizabeth mayhew but instead went to the plough for his lunch at a table to himself by the window he looked out on the square and watched people going about their business in the rain a bobbing of black umbrellas above black coats a bowed head here or there and one man hurrying along with a newspaper held over his hat rutledges own hat sat in the chair opposite him darkly spotted with rain it was he thought as good a way as any to prevent companyhamish or someone elsefrom taking the empty chair for the darkpaneled room was quite busy with custom as if the rain had discouraged people from making the journey home for their midday meal hamish said from just behind his shoulder yon sergeant has a level head rutledge came within a breath of answering the voice aloud used to its cadence in his mind stopping himself in time he responded silently lets hope dowling is as competent when hed given his order he turned again to the window hoping to put an end to hamishs conversation and he saw elizabeth mayhew just taking leave of a man in a heavy coat whose back was to him she was smiling her face alight upturned as she leaned toward the figure rutledge found himself suddenly jealous not for himself but for richard mayhew dead now and buried in france as schoolboys he and richard had tramped in the face of cold winds that in winter blew across the hoo peninsula like a knife bringing mists on their heels or in summer followed the old saxon ways that crisscrossed the kent countryside footpaths now but once the high roads of a dim past serving settlers warriors or pilgrims adventures that had shaped their boyhood and through that fashioned the men they would become theyd gone their different ways soon enough but each had carried with him that mark of selfreliance and independence learned on the downs and in the marshesexperience that had served them well in the war theyd discussed that once on a bombedout road in france where theyd briefly crossed pathsunaware that it was for the last time richard had said the first thing ill do when i get home is walk out over the downs again when im too tired to sleep i retrace my steps and find that solitude again and the silence rutledge had answered smiling i never expected that learning to tell time by the stars or guess at wind speed would save my life one day it was a game then do you still have your uncles compass richard had dug it out of his pocket holding it out like a holy relic never without it do you remember the night we were washed out by the rain i thought id never be that wet again but we were our first week in france while my men were cursing and swearing i was standing there laughing only it was summer on the downs and a damned sight warmer than december in the lines they had had nearly ten minutes before the snarl of traffic had opened up and rutledge had had to move on richards last words had been when the war is over im going to have a son and ill teach him everything i know about that safe other world but i wont tell him about this one its too obscene a week later richard was dead and there would be no sons in his second year at oxford richard had fallen deeply in love with elizabeth hed been absentminded and daydreaming by turns plotting ways to see her again driving his tutor to despair when elizabeth had gone to italy in the spring for her mothers health rutledge had never seen a happier groom on their wedding day or a bride more beautiful or two people more perfectly suited to each other it was time for elizabeth to put her mourning asidehed said as much himselfbut was it time for her to fall in love again for the glow on her face was telling rutledge had seen it before hamish said theres no accounting for the heart but surely rutledge countered a love like theirs lasted the man is dead hamish reminded him theres wee comfort in memories when the other side of the bed is cold and empty rutledges own fiancee had deserted him but the woman who had loved hamish mourned still his last word as he lay dying had been her name fiona was more faithful than jean who had preferred to put the war behind her the man walked on passing the cavaliers statue without looking back elizabeth followed him with her eyes standing stockstill where hed left her then lifting the black bowl of her umbrella she moved on with a spring in her step as if the rain had vanished rutledge felt an extraordinarily strong sweep of loneliness as if here in the window of the hotel dining room he was cut off from the quiet voices and soft laughter that filled the room on the other side of him and cut off too from the villagers going about their business in the weather an observer with no role in the reality of life he lived with the dead in more ways than one hamish said yell never know better its the price of what ye are inspector dowling was a thin man with a nose too large for his face its weight seemed to pull him forward stooping his shoulders but the brown eyes on either side were warm and friendly like a dogs shaking hands with rutledge he said im glad youre here sergeant burke should have sent for me he was kind enough to suggest it but i took the opportunity to have my own meal at the hotel good food there is it dowling said almost wistfully my wife dear heart that she is has never mastered the culinary arts rutledge smothered his smile dowling shuffled papers on his desk with a sigh well then on to this business of the murders each of the victims lived within a twentymile radius of marling all were exsoldiers men with perfectly sound reputations the last victim was found close by marling but the others were discovered along the road coming in from the south there were no signs of violenceno wounds no bruises youd have thought looking at them that theyd stepped off the road for a brief rest how did they die if there was no violence an overdose of laudanum but in suspicious circumstances im told by the local doctor that amputations often leave behind a residual pain as if the limbs still there and hurting from whatever it was that made removing it necessaryin these cases machinegun fire or shrapnel and the infection that followed amputees each of them got about on crutches he shook his head myself i dont know how id deal with that thank god ive never had to find out suicide then machinegun fire and shrapnel tore at a limb making it nearly impossible to save rutledge had seen the aid stations with the bloody remains piled high under a tarpaulin waiting for disposal its not likely for two very good reasons each was the sole support of his family and his pension ended if he died i dont think any man in his right mind would leave his family destitute if he could still feed them and clothe them however bad the pain got hamish quietly agreed rutledge was thinking instead of raleigh masters who resented his lost foot with a bitter passion and yet he clung to his life as if only to make those around him suffer through the blight of his own he wondered if there was a similarity if these victims had also made life wretched for those around them that might explain one murder not three dowling was saying moreover ive spoken with each of the widows they absolutely refuse to consider suicide but wives and widowswitness nell shawwere often the last to accept the desertion of their husbands even in death and theres one other small detail here these men had been drinking wine before they died but no one seems to know where it came from this wine not from home certainly there was none in any of the three houses and no one recalls seeing any of the three men in a public house the nights of their deaths what time of night did they die it was after eleven certainly thats the latest time weve been able to establish the bodies werent discovered until close on to morning when the light was improving ive sent my men round to talk to everyone who might have been on those roads after dark they all swore there wasnt a body lying there when they passed but dusk came early in november a dark bundle in the high grass at the side of the road might not be visible hamish said how many would stop to ask if a drunk needed help and the next day how many of those would admit theyd passed by without stopping it was an interesting point why were the victims out on the road at that hour eleven oclock or later rutledge asked dowling if they hadnt been visiting a pub where had they been for the most part they were looking for work picking up whatever they could find all three often went from village to village accepting lifts when one was offered walking if they had to taylor had been mending a fence webber repaired furniture and bartlettwhod been a glazier before the warhad gone to sit by a friends bedside the man had been gassed at ypres and was dying lungs burned out as a rule the three victims stayed the night where they were if there was work sleeping in a barn or outbuilding whatever they could manage which also explains why there was no hue and cry when they didnt come home rutledge said thoughtfully and all three killed at night hamish said what did they see that they shouldnt have seen which was a reasonable key to unexpected murder these men had stumbled on something they shouldnt have still death had come on three different nights and on three different roads kent was hardly a hotbed of crime where something evil lurked at the crossroads waiting for dark smuggling had once been a cottage industry along the coast but that was long past dowling tossed his papers aside weve combined our efforts inspector grimes in seelyham and inspector cawly in helford and i keeping an eye out for strangers hanging about questioning everyone whod seen the victims the day before they were killed making a master list of everyone who admits to being on the roads each of the three nights and weve come up with what we could have told ourselves before the killings began the victims knew each other they were poor they were wounded in france but half the exsoldiers in kent fit that description and if thats what the murderer is after hes got an endless supply of choices why these three and so close to marling i can tell you that grimes and cawly will be happy to drop this business into your lap inspector but im a stubborn man and dont give up easily before leaving the hotel rutledge had arranged for a room his glimpse of elizabeth mayhews face as she stood in the rain on the high street had made him uncomfortable about staying with her for a few days although she would have been the first to urge him or would she she had asked him to help clear out richards clothes in preparation for what it was none of his business he reminded himself and yet it had left an oddly unpleasant taste in his mouth as if he had been excluded from what had always felt like a family circle hamish said you were nearly sure at breakfast that she was on the point of speaking her mind and she stopped herself id like to know why it would have beeneasier coming from her instead it was as if the relationship had changed in unexpected ways taking along the young constablenow silent and shywho had been dressed down by sergeant burke rutledge set out to visit the places where each body had been found put yourself in the murderers shoes rutledge suggested to the young man as they drove past the square and out of marling on the way to seelyham how well would you need to know this part of kent in order to find a quiet place for a killing constable weaver brightened as if no one had asked his opinion before id say ours are fairly welltraveled roads he answered after a moments thought anyone coming down them in the direction of marling would see the empty stretches youd only have to keep in mind where which meant hamish pointed out that the possibilities were wide open were the three dead men heavy drinkers theyd not say no to a pint sir if someone was buying they didnt have the money for much else they hadnt developed a taste for wine in france theres a story about that now you mention it some of the marling men took shelter during a storm in a burnedout french farmhouse it had a wine cellar and the men helped themselves they were sick as dogs for two days after drinking the lot weaver chuckled tommy bilson brought home the silver cream jug he found there under a mattress and it shined up something wonderful i told him i ought to arrest him for stealing it he suddenly remembered who sat beside him in the motorcar and cast an anxious glance in rutledges direction it was as old as warfare this propensity to appropriate souvenirs rutledge had seen countless small acquisitions while boxing up possessions of the men hed lost there had been no way to discover where these objects had come from much less who might have owned them once for the most part hed closed his eyes to them and sent them home one of the most touching had been silver buttons for a bride who would never wear them to the altar weaver pointed just ahead where a line of trees marched along a winding stretch of road giving some protection from the sun or rain rutledge pulled the motorcar to the verge the constable was saying seelyhams not more than three miles in that direction inspector grimes was called to have a look at what a farmer had found and he sent for us they got out to stand by the trunk of an ash tree its thickness offered an ideal place for a man to rest if he was drunk or tired shadowed by tall grass and the branches overhead it was also an ideal spot where a body might be disposed of there were no cottages or farms within sight just here no windows overlooking the road but a hundred yards or so in the direction of marling an overgrown drive wound between leaning stone pillars to a house protected from view by trees and a thick shrubbery only its roof and several chimneys were visible over the treetops too far away to hear anything too far to see the road still who lives there rutledge asked pointing out the gates nobody now the family died and the lawyers are trying to find the heirs gone to new zealand for a fresh start or so im told tell me about this first victim what was his name taylor thats right will taylor he worked in the hop gardens before the war but theres not much call for a onelegged man in that line hed found a job in seelyham putting up a fence that had blown down with the last storm good with his hands and married with two children did you know him rutledge asked weaver had missed the war by a matter of months too young to serve but probably eager he was my brothers agesimon was lost off gallipoli when his ship went down weaver replied somberly and i know taylors wife as well alice was in school with my sister too young to marry but her mother signed the papers the sort of man whod find himself mixed up with something he ought to leave alone rutledge asked looking up and down the quiet road i never knew will to be dishonest he used to complain about the hop pickers from the east end lightfingered and always after the girls hed say hop picking was laborintensive help was brought in during the autumn to take in the crop and sometimes the same workers were called on to do the haying first they were often the dregs of londons east end willing enough to work for wages and sometimes representing the third and fourth generation hired out to pick it was good income with winter coming on a little something laid aside for the coalman or a sick child or gin to warm the inside of a man when the cold winds blew a goodly number of the pickers came from the maidstone area bringing with them their dogs and their children both of which ran underfoot like chickens weaver stared down at the broken stalks of last summers wildflowers i dont see will taylor mixed up in anything sinister he was bent on feeding his family took losing his leg hard an active sort who liked working out in the air but he was trying to manage somehow rutledge said did his wife have anything to tell you i questioned alice myself weaver responded but she didnt know much he was staying over in seelyham to finish the fence saying hed come home when it was done she didnt expect him for another day or two sergeant burke went on to seelyham and asked about taylors work the fence was done properly and a day early taylor was told he could wait until the morning but was eager to get home and set out after his dinner was taylor carrying his pay yes sir and it was still there in his pocket youd think wouldnt you sir that a thief wouldnt fail to find that the second victim had been found on the road from helford it ran into the seelyham road at an angle just outside marling lying in a ditch by the side of fields he was almost invisible until the sun rose high enough to pierce the shadows beyond where weaver stood with rutledge the hop gardens spread out toward a distant farm tucked into a fold of land their frames and their green vines gone for the winter the gardens looked bare and fallow an oast house one of the most recognizable features of the kent landscape reared its head like a decapitated windmill close by a stand of trees its white walls streaked and wet from the rain inside it was an oast the drying kiln that was an essential part of the processing of hops tell me about this manwebber rutledge encouraged weaver as they got out in the rain and stood by the spot what sort was he most everyone in marling knew who he was not the sort youd find carousing of a saturday night hed had a strict upbringing and his mother was temperancemad a carpenter by trade made tables and chests and the like as his father had done before him he was in helford recaning chairs the caning webber did was known all over no breaks and no missed steps was there money in his pocket yes sir we found two pounds hamish commented a clever man now hed ha taken the money and put it in the puir box to confound the police rutledge responded aloud without thinking both of them married taylor and webber not likely to be unfaithful would you say weaver answered him they werent likely no sir past an age for wild oats and that theres no jealous husband looking for revenge the third body had been found close by the crossroads where rutledge thought hed seen a face in his headlamps he felt an odd frisson of cold down his spine as he got out of the motorcar as if there were traces of something unnatural here still a scent or lingering shadow hamish ordinarily quick to point out foolishness was a highlander who understood moods but the corpse was a local man not a straying doppelganger harry bartlett had gone to visit a friend who was illand ended by dying before him bartlett wasnt what youd call a staunch churchgoer weaver was saying he had a reputation as a hellraiser before the war and was the first in marling to sign up told everyone he was tired of bashing local heads and thought hed try a few germans he was a good soldier from all reports that lot often are but he got hung up on the wire one night that last spring of the war and when they brought him in he was near to bleeding to death hamish was asking a question rutledge said did these three men serve in the same unit weaver blinked yes sir i expect they did the kent men stayed together looked out for each other officers had found that men who knew each other fought better side by side they often died side by side when a shell went up in their faces rutledge walked along the road for some distance then turned and walked back all right then the war find out all you can about where they served and who their friends were sir i cant see how that might help the wars been over for a while now it hadnt ended for them had it after a last look around rutledge turned back to the motorcar they drove back to marling as dusk was falling and the road seemed long lonely hamish commented a man with crutches would accept a ride so he would rutledge silently agreed but why should he be saved from a painful walkand then be killed still it was something to consider what had these three men had in common besides lost limbs according to weaver not much beyond their workingclass backgrounds and their service in the war bartletts wife peggy was a girl hed married since coming home and there were no children dowling had been right there was hardly any evidence to build on what had brought these men face to face with a killer greed a secret that was dangerous to know a killer wouldnt offer a man a glass of wine and then fill him with laudanum unless he first wanted to learn something from his victim where had they drunk together rutledge listening to hamish in the back of his mind wondered how many more would join this unholy clutch of dead men before the police found any answers the rain fell with depressing steadiness cold and coloring everything a bleak gray even the church at the top of high street seemed dark and dreary its ragstone facade streaked with damp and the dead flower stalks among the churchyard stones a sign of desertion rather than loving memorials what did you grow in the churchyard in winter besides ivy and hellebore rutledge wondered as he drove back to the hotel too late for michaelmas daisies and too early for pansies he washed up and unpacked his luggage then came down to the dining roomto find melinda crawford ensconced at the best table she looked up as he came into the paneled room and smiled broadly either im in my dotage or youve answered a maidens prayers he laughed and came to join her what brings you to marling i could ask the same of you but ive already guessed that in your case its murder in mine it might well be ive been left at the altar in a manner of speaking by whom he asked surprised i was invited to dine with the masterses but bella says that raleigh is in the foulest of moods and the cook is threatening to give notice and poor bellas at her wits end so i left fortunately i remembered that the hotel here has quite good food and i thought i might perhaps ask elizabeth to join me and have you he couldnt alter the wary note in his voice she wasnt at home either mrs crawford sighed the one thing i hate about getting old is ones shrinking circle of friends but here you are quite a delightful surprise and im going to enjoy my evening with a handsome young man rather than a crabby old one has masters taken a turn for the worse i doubt his body has but his temper most certainly did i could hear him roaring from the front hall if the man hadnt been such a brilliant barrister and the most charming of people id say he was paying for past sins still i have both my limbs and i cant imagine what it must be like not to no reason to take his temper out on his wife bellas not as cowardly as you might think in fact she may in the end prove to be stronger than raleigh if she doesnt poison him first i think tonight id have had a go at it rutledge felt his spirits rising melinda crawford was a charming woman possessed of wit and insight and a very clear view of human nature at the moment she was the perfect antidote to his depression the meal was excellent and the conversation exhilarating leaving hamish out as if shutting the door the scot was still making up his mind about mrs crawford in another time rutledge heard him muttering shed ha been burned at the stake for witchcraft amused rutledge had silently answered or been the mistress of kings they talked about the war and about india where shed spent her childhood and about kent do you know what i remembered most about kent as a child in india she asked rutledge at one point that it was green no i remembered the orchards trees filled with white and pink blossoms like butterflies and i remembered the man on stilts with grape leaves on his head good god when they do the twiddlingthat is when theyre tying the hop strings from the ground to the wires that run on the wooden framework built above the gardenstheres a man on stilts who does the high knots its quite a difficult taskthe vines as they grow follow those strings and mustnt be led astray and such a man will often wear a hat to keep the sun off his head this one had found young grape leavestheyre not unlike hop leaves you knowand had twisted himself a bacchus crown to keep his head cool we stopped at the hop farm to water the horses and he came over to the carriage and bent down to peer in at me making a face because i was tired and cross i was instantly enchanted and i wanted to see him again she smiled i was quite in love with a man on stilts and what did mr crawford when he arrived on the scene think of your infatuation he was a tall man ive always fancied tall men thats your claim to my affection by the way and he went to the bazaar in agra one day and found someone to fashion him a pair of stilts i was grown up by that time and knew better than to laugh when he went headfirst into the nasturtiums rutledge chuckled and then sobered i think elizabeth mayhew has found someone to love yes mrs crawford said pensively as she poured milk into her tea i tried to warn you of that i wasnt in danger of falling in love with her no but youd put her on a pedestal you know richards widow shes quite human like the rest of us who is this man he heard the edge in his voice i dont know i havent been invited to meet him but i hear from my seamstress that hes from northumberland and quite handsome i wasnt aware that elizabeth or richard had friends in northumberland my dear ian what does that have to say to anything mrs crawford demanded amused i meant he replied testily that its likely to be someone shes met since the war since richards death yes i should expect it is he was buying a trinket for a lady a shawl my seamstress told me it was described to me in great detail because it was so lovely and quite a harmless gift the very next week i happened to see elizabeth wearing that particular shawl i didnt ask how she came by it occasionally i do remember my manners her lips curved in amusement but her eyes were no longer smiling nor did she tell me when i admired it hamish spoke up for the first time in an hour shes no happy with this match but she willna tell you why they spent the remainder of the meal talking about mrs crawfords years in india in the span of her life the subcontinent had changed enormously the vast private holding in the hands of the east india company had collapsed in the great indian mutiny which had seen such bloody horrors at cawnpore the british government had taken over the country after that and in the course of time disraeli had made queen victoria empress of india equal in majesty to the german kaiser wilhelm britain had poured civilians and soldiers into the subcontinent since then and now there were rumblings of a movement for independence it will come mrs crawford said in time but what will happen then is not to be thought of im glad i wont be here to see it civil war is always the bloodiest and this mr wilson in america has pushed through the selfdetermination clause he was so bent on having it will bear bitter fruit mark me wellintentioned people are often blind to the results of their good deeds rutledge said germany is broken and under the heel of heavy war reparations from what i hear people are starving in the towns and theres no money to buy food or fuel yes if i were a german i would get out try my luck in argentina or chile sell up beg borrow or steal the money for my passage and go if the best people leave how will she rebuild or more to the point how will she be rebuilt in what form i think id stay and fight of course you would she nodded and in the end be shot for your pains germany isnt ready for democracy india is better suited for change than germany because theyve learned from us how a country is run theyd inherit our infrastructure the railroads and the communications systems the trained bureaucracy and so on its the religious issue that will tear india apart in germany it will be the vacuum of leadership hamish said intrigued my ain granny never traveled more than thirty miles in any direction the glen was her home she never fancied telling her menfolk how to run the world rutledge answered your grandmother never had the opportunities that came this womans way as if shed been a party to the exchange between rutledge and hamish mrs crawford smiled and added politicians never heed old ladies its more than time we women had the vote and showed them a thing or two rutledge laughed youd make a superb prime minister dont be silly she retorted mr churchill already has his eye on filling those shoes gallipoli was a setback its true but he wont languish forgotten for long after seeing mrs crawford to her motorcar and placing her safely in the hands of her driver rutledge went back into the hotel and asked for a telephone he knew elizabeth mayhew was on the exchange but there was no answer to his call the operator told him after ten rings there appears to be no one at home but there were servants in the house he found himself worrying about elizabeth and unable to sleep as the bells in the clock tower struck the hour of one hamish said it willna matter what you want its her life and no your own the next morning as rutledge stood shaving in front of the framed mirror above his washstand he began to feel a stirring of intuition as he reviewed what he had seen and heard about the three men who had been killed near marling a stirring that was just out of reach in his mind a pattern that was on the edge of consciousness he had felt this kind of thing before when he was working on what seemed at first to be disconnected events and facts for there was always a key in murdera logical progression of circumstance that led to the destruction of another human being he knew what had brought these men out into the night to walk a lonely road home it was the wine that was incongruous how was it offered and where under what pretense what had happened then had the men been left to die on the roadside or had the killer watched each die before abandoning the body that was a macabre thought walking down the stairs to his breakfast rutledge tried to recreate the scene in his mind instead he found himself intercepted by the elderly desk clerk who had been standing behind the reception desk as if waiting for someone for him it appeared good morning inspector there areumtwo persons who asked for you ive put them in the small sitting room two persons someone then not acceptable in the eyes of the hotel staff rutledge cast about in his memory elizabeths servants perhaps he remembered she hadnt been at home last night when melinda crawford had telephoned ill see them he followed the mans directions to the small sitting room usually dark and unused at this hour but watery sunlight poured in now and the two women sitting on the edges of the chintzcovered chairs by the hearth looked up nervously as he opened the door one of them rose to her feet her red face tired and drawn the unbecoming black hat she wore matched the threadbare black coat giving her an air of poverty and depression the younger woman accompanying her stood up more slowly her eyes anxious as they scanned rutledges face her blue coat illfitting in the shoulders was a slightly different shade from the blue hat she wore with a surprising degree of grace the older woman was nell shaw she had managed to track him down mrs shaw rutledge began completely unprepared to find ben shaws widow here in marling as out of place in kent as a blackbird would be in a gilded cage i went to the yard yesterday and asked for you a sergeantgibson his name wastold me youd gone down to kent to look into a murder i thought you was looking into my bens murders rutledge said gently mrs shaw i must go where im sent but she interrupted him again ive traveled all night well nearly we got a lift on a lorry from covent garden and then from maidstone came most of the way with a farmer carrying pig meat to the butcher shops hereabouts and we walked from helford why didnt you come and tell me you was not in london anymore weve been waiting for word her voice was accusing on the verge of tears the young woman beside her blushed and looked down at her shoes rutledge regarded her taller than mrs shaw with fairer hair and a very fine complexion she seemed out of place in the older womans company catching the shift in his attention mrs shaw added this is margaret bens and my daughter shes of an age to be married and what prospects do you think shes got the daughter of a hanged man its not fair to burden her with what they say her father done a wrong ought to be put right the flush deepened and margaret shaw bit her lip as if wishing the floor might open and swallow her rutledge said sit down mrs shaw miss shaw ive done my best to look into the earlier investigation as i promised i would seating themselves warily they regarded him with doubtful eyes theres nothing i can point to so far that upholds your belief that your neighbor was somehow involved there are a number of ways that mrs cutter might have come by the locket name one mrs shaw demanded harshly he hesitated your husband may have given it to her a mourning pendant inscribed for a man she didnt even know and his name all over it and no way of hiding it you must be right barmy to believe my ben would have done such a stupid thing yes i know mrs shaw i understand you dont understand you was like the rest of them eager to see my ben hang for what was done to the old ladies it was easier than digging out the truth he tried to keep his voice level as i told you earlier theres no proof he said that the locket was in your neighbors drawer we have only your word for that oh yes because my husband was hanged im a liar am i well let me tell you if it had been in my house all this time someone would have discovered it and you searched the very rafters in the attic didnt you where do you think i might have hidden it away in the teapot among my corsets the young woman winced mama no im being honest thats what im doing theres no one else to speak for us love and we cant sit back politely and hope for the best mrs shaw rutledge said please listen to me i must have irrefutable proof in order to ask my superiors to reopen this investigation she stared at him can you sleep nights with us on your conscience her voice was hard angry my bens dead and unjustly so you gave evidence against him in that courtroom and might as well have put the noose around his neck with your own hands im telling you he was not guilty and you tell me that there has to be proof when god stands in judgment of you will you tell him that there was no proof hamish stirred into vicious life yere burning in hell alreadyand no just for ben shaw rutledge said mrs shaw im doing what i can within the limits of my power no listen to me i have no authority to open this investigation do you understand me but i have asked questions youve spoken to henry cutter it was accusing not yet let him tell you that his wife had a stroke after ben was hanged and never got out of her bed again let him tell you that her own son by her first husband was the constable on one of them streets where the victims lived and let him tell you that george peterson left the police force months after the trial and two years later was found drowned in the sea off lyme regis where hed gone to drink himself blind there had been nothing in philip nettles early reports of the shaw investigation that had linked george peterson with the cutters nor had much official notice been taken of petersons subsequent death it had been petersons duty to alert the yard of any connection and he hadnt informed anyone why rutledge said are you telling me that this man peterson could have robbed and suffocated those women not your husband he tried to bring back to mind the young constable whose patch it had been tall lanky quiet there had been some question around the yard about his suitability to deal with the stark reality of murder but no question about his family background had arisen and wouldnt have if hed used his fathers name hamish said there was a lapse yes philip nettle ill and soon to die had been as careful a man as any on the force covering every possible aspect of any case but somehow the constable had never come under suspicion never questioned or it would have appeared in the files he was the law and not investigated one of the hunters not the hunted dear godhow many other oversights had there been mrs shaw was saying i only know the one thing that my husband wasnt guilty and we had no way of making anybody listen you yourself believed in his guilt i saw you turn away at the sentencing mrs shaw sucked in a quick breath as if the charge had been a physical blow then said harshly you made a believer out of me then i was tired and shocked and i had two children to care for all alone and i didnt know what to make of anything ben said or the barristers said or the judge said that kc with the white hairhe stood there quoting verse and precedents and latin like moses handing down the ten commandments and i couldnt follow a word of it all in a voice that would convince a saint that he was a sinner matthew sunderland for whom the law was a lofty profession but also a pulpit hamish wondered derisively she looked ill the strain of her obsession beginning to tell and the long tiring journey to kent dont you think constable peterson would have protected his mother if she was the guilty party mama margaret said leaning toward her mother almost protectively youre not to distress yourself like this well manage we always have nell shaw ignored her saying instead to rutledge look at the girl shes got her fathers blood in her the looks and the height and the graces she deserves better than to languish in some nasty workroom where shell be worn out at thirty and no one to care about her when im gone it isnt right and you must open your eyes and see what youre condemning her to rutledge said mrs shaw no im putting it bluntly when you sent an innocent man to the gallows you cursed his family too wheres the guilt of that on your shoulders tell me wheres the guilt she got up rather clumsily her swollen feet heavy in her tightly laced shoes im going back to london where i belong but if youre half the man you ought to be youll not sleep until you do something about my ben youll find out whats behind this business and whether theres any hope for us but youd better do it soon i cant sleep nights anymore for thinking over whats right and wrong id rather end up in the river and have it all over and done with she marched to the door margaret trailing after her apologetic and at the same time defensive the girl cared about her termagant mother and she was worried please cant you at least listen she seemed to say as she turned her eyes pleading in place of her voice rutledge said let me make arrangements for your return mrs shaw wheeled to face him i maynt have much else inspector but i have my pride if you wont help my ben i dont want your charity i will help he heard himself saying but as one man i cant promise that ill accomplish miracles we arent looking for miracles were looking for fairness she walked away her head high her body chunky and compact her daughter followed after her uncertain what to do uncertain how to help watching her rutledge was reminded suddenly of her father ben shaw had had that same lostdog manner that resigned acceptance of whatever fate had thrown at him deserved or not he had been afraid and wary and patient as the law ground to its foregone conclusion of guilt and he had not had the spirit to fight on lifeor years of marriage to a woman of a different class and upbringinghad defeated shaw long before the judgment of the courts shaw was one of the victims not one of the shapers of events if he had killed those women he had done it in desperation for the money his family needed he had accepted the courts decision with a crushed spirit that didnt know where to turn for solace and he had gone to his death a pale shadow of the man he could have been ben shaw had never fought he had never tried to stem the march to the hangman in any way it had been seen as a sign of his guilt his acceptance of the right of the law to punish him for what he had done hamish said aye a victim then echoing mrs shaw he asked how will ye sleep with ben shaw on your conscience i canna follow you therebut he will rutledge closed the door of the sitting room behind him and walked through the foyer of the hotel he was no longer hungry standing on the street outside he tried to decide what to do he was in the midst of one investigation and bedeviled by another he should be clearheaded and have his wits about him and instead he was having to face himself in ways that he had never thought possible mrs shaw was a master at one thing if nothing elseshe knew the demon of guilt would be his undoing and the tenuous connection he had been trying to build for the marling murders had slipped unnoticed from his mind in the end rutledge tracked down the shaws and drove them back to sansom street himself mrs shaw had protested but he had swept that aside and handed her daughter into the rear of the motorcarto share the seat with a restless hamish mrs shaw was silent most of the way her black hat and coat giving her the air of a lump of coal capriciously shaped in human form this wont change my mind she said once i wont be cozened by a kindness into forgetting whats due me and my family no one is trying to cozen you rutledge replied i have business in london but she made no answer to that as if she didnt believe him when the shaw women had been returned to their home rutledge went in search of his sister frances she was dressing for a luncheon and called to him from her bedroom ian is it urgent in a way he went upstairs she came out of the dressing room wearing a very stylish suit and carrying a matching hat in her hand sitting down to brush her hair she said you look tired darling whats wrong he took the chair by the pair of windows overlooking the square and the houses that stood around it elizabeth mayhew has she said anything to you about a new man in her life francess eyes met his in the dressingtable mirror interesting no she hasnt shes still mourning richard as far as i knowive tried to talk her into coming to london for several weeks but she doesnt want to leave kent for very different reasons now i think shes involved with someone who might be somehow connected to a series of murders im working on frances put down her brush and turned to face him are you sure of this ian its rather sudden her new interest and who is the man anyone we know the english view of acceptable social contacts anyone we know he shook his head i cant tell you his name i do know hes from northumberland i have the word of mrs crawfords seamstress on that a brief smile touched his eyes and then faded but theres something odd here hackles rising on the back of the neck he thought about that for a moment and then added or jealousy for richards sake your intuition is seldom wrong she told him it may be colored all the same its not my place to ask questions but if you could do itquite casuallyit might be a good thing frances considered him theres something more here than elizabeth mayhews affairs of the heart her eyes searching his face she said again whats wrong rutledge smiled wryly what he would have liked to say was i may have seen a ghost if i have its no matter i can live with ghosts and wait for her common sense to assure him that he had done nothing of the sort frances had little patience with nonsense but her intuition was often as sharp as his own when she jumped to conclusions they most generally were the right ones and the war was a part of his life he wanted very much to keep shut away from her instead he answered theres been a series of murders in the neighborhood of marling ive been working on the case for the yard no one not even melinda crawford knows who this man is that elizabeth is attracted to i think ive seen him once from the back why is she keeping him a secret from her friends elizabeth could well be dragged into something unpleasant if hes using her in some fashion or isnt quiterespectable arent you overreacting just a little she asked putting her jewelry on her face hidden from him is there any reason to think that this man could be involved in your murders have you good cause to believe he should be found and questioned put like that he answered wryly i suppose im jumping to conclusions its probably no more than coincidence frances was settling her hat on her carefully groomed hair adjusting it to a becoming angle that set off her face shes an extraordinarily attractive woman rutledge found himself thinking with their mothers perfect skin and cameocut profile the slightly arched nose and the very intelligent eyes once hed wondered if she had been in love with ross trevor his godfather david trevors son or if there was some other man who had come into her life and taken her heart away with him she had never spoken of it just as he never spoke of hamish or the war or what loneliness was as if reading his mind frances said her eyes not meeting his in the mirror you know you could do worse than elizabeth mayhew you and richard were very close he wouldnt have minded you stepping into his shoes not that im matchmaking thats the very reason i cant rutledge answered after a moment hed always be there between us like a ghost she asked lightly well its time for me to leave would you mind giving me a lift we can talk on the way but they didnt when they reached the mayfair restaurant she got out saying ian whatever is worrying you it isnt elizabeth mayhew is it theres more on your mind than her affairs or the murders i think theres a sense of guilt somewhere i think perhaps you feel you ought to step into richards shoes for his sake and because you wont youre afraid youre letting him down by not preventing elizabeth from getting hurt he considered and then rejected the possibility i feel some sort of responsibility for richards sake we were friends for years but a sense of responsibility doesnt go as far as marriage then it was armistice day it unsettled a good many people you know you arent alone there she was searching for clues her fathers daughter he had been a very fine lawyer and he had had a strong intuitive streak that both his children had inherited rutledge didnt answer all the same she hesitated for a moment we all live with devils of one kind or another i dont know how to exorcise them except by surviving somehow against all the odds it was far too close to the mark and she must have read something in his face for he heard a sharp intake of breath as if she had finally guessed what was on his mind my mistakes may go to the gallows he told her the innocent along with the guilty and they are buried and sometimes they are resurrected it was said in a rueful voice as if laughing at himself the truth doesnt change she told him father always believed that still its easy to alter the trappings of truth ill remember that as his sister stepped away from the side of the car rutledge added you wont forget about elizabeth she blew him a kiss darling i wont forget he drove off hamish saying in the back of his mind shes no the commongarden variety of sisters shed have made a damned fine barrister better than i would have if id followed in our fathers footsteps aye there was a moment of silence as rutledge threaded his way through the thick of midday traffic then hamish followed up on his earlier thought it is no very surprising shes no married rutledge glancing at his watch decided he had time for one more call before he left london henry cutter worked at a shop where tools were designed and fabricated his office high above the floor where machines made any conversation impossible was cluttered with invoices and paperwork and there were ink stains on his fingers a thin man with a long jaw and sunken eyes he looked up as rutledge entered the room then frowned i know you he broke off squinting in an attempt to place the man before him rutledge inspector rutledge from scotland yard surprise lifted his eyebrows thats right youve changed he stopped and said instead of completing the thought we all have to be blunt about it is there anything wrong ive come about an old matter ben shaws conviction and hanging for murder mrs shaw worries aboutera miscarriage of justice cutter sighed shes got a very pretty daughter and shes determined for the girl to marry well shes asked me a dozen times in the last month what i remember about the police and all the questions we were asked its as if she worries a raw wound unable to leave it alone life hasnt treated nell kindly you know still shes a woman who draws on hidden strength and faces up to what cant be run from i respect that what do you remember rutledge asked interested i remember how upset my wife was cutter answered shed known the women well not known them if you follow me but shed called on them from time to time as a church visitor years before when her health was better and she was more active did she believe shaw was guilty i never asked her cutter looked away he was a very likeable man janetmrs cutterwas fond of him in a manner of speaking rutledge found himself thinking that cutter was not a man of grace or charm plainspoken and unimaginative a plodder he was beginning to understand why cutter admired nell shaws strength the question then became was cutter capable of murder and why if he had a reasonably comfortable life should he be driven to it i understand she had a son who died before she did janet was married before peterson fell ill of diphtheria when the boy was almost two years old she was expecting another child and she miscarried the worst part of that was she felt shed let her husband down by being so ill herself and she blamed herself that the boy had been left to the kindness of neighbors while his father was dying and his mother was miscarrying as a result she was overly protective to the point of smothering him but in my opinion he was weak from the start was george never could settle to anything and in the end killed himself he stopped surprised that hed confided in this man who listened with an air of thoughtfulness that made confession easy as if unjudged mrs shaw had already answered his next question but rutledge said quietly how did he die he could feel hamish stirring in the back of his mind he drowned after a moment looking down at his hands cutter added lost his footing and fell into the sea while walking by the harbor one night that was the official finding accidental drowning it saved his mother from the pain of learning it was suicide according to the police george had been drinking heavily and there was a suspicion that hed been despondent at any rate he was fully clothed and it was after midnight they put as good a face on it as they could but i always felt janet suspected the truth she was never the same after that he was the first policeman on the scene of one of the shaw murders yes thats true he came to his mother the night after mrs winslow was found dead cried like a baby janet told me afterward that he had a horror of dead bodies he didnt like touching them hamish said it doesna ring true he was a constable as if hed been a party to the conversation cutter went on i could never understand thatgeorge had elected to go into the police force he must have known what it involved he shifted the papers on his desk i could never understand him for that matter janet told me he took after his father she thought that might have something to do with it but george and i never saw eye to eye tell me about him cutter said sharply the mans dead you cant be worried about anything he could have done im interested in the man who was constable when mrs winslow was killed ive only just discovered that he was related to neighbors of the shaws taking a deep breath cutter replied well i dont know that it makes any difference now he was the kind of child who ran headlong to do something he wanted to do and only thought better of it later he was never in serious trouble but he was always unsettled and unpredictable never really good at anything janet thought the sun shone out of him and that was that i was glad when he left home we had a happier life then mrs shaw found a locket in a drawer belonging to mrs cutter did she tell you that a locket no she never mentioned it what kind of locket his eyes were suddenly wary janets jewelry a piece of mourning jewelry belonging to one of the dead women it was missing at the time shaw was arrested husbands seldom rummaged in their wives lingerie as hamish was pointing out cutter was saying with rising alarm here shes not trying to say my wife had anything to do with those deaths i wont believe that not of nell youre trying to stir up trouble nell shaw brought the locket to me because it was missing evidence rutledge replied without emphasis id like to see it im sorry rutledge answered unwilling to tell cutter that mrs shaw had kept it i cant show it to you look i cant help but feel sorry for her shes had a rough deal shaw tried but he wasnt like ushe wasnt used to hard work his body wasnt what youd call strong all the same its far too late to save ben or his family the door opened and a man stepped into the office from the look of him and from cutters sudden stiffness rutledge realized that he must be the owner holly was that what the cutter maid had called him the man stared from rutledge to the account books cutter had put aside and he asked something i can do for you rutledge rose thank you no mr cutter has kindly given me the directions i need cutter shot him a grateful glance and rose also rutledge left closing the door behind him but he could feel the owners eyes burrowing into his back hamish grumbled i canna see whats been gained rutledge answered its odd that time can change the direction of an investigation so radically we should have known about george peterson hamish retorted its you changed nothing else there was no response to that he made his way through the busy shop and out into the street it was raining again when he reached marling rutledge left the car at the hotel realizing that hed missed his lunch and his tea he found a small shop down the road from the police station and went in asking what they could provide in the way of sandwiches late as it was the woman behind the counter settled him at a small table for two and bustled away to the kitchen except for four women sitting at a table near his the shop was empty although a couple came in a few minutes afterward laughing and shaking out the rain from their coats for a time the four women were silent as if wary of the strange man almost in their midst they couldnt know who he was not yet he hadnt met many of the villagers there was nothing for the local gossips to pick up he could almost hear the unspoken speculation about who he was and what business he might have in marling the natural curiosity that strangers sparked in a small town was lively even his voice was out of place an educated london accent rutledges tea and sandwiches arrived he thanked the shop owner and poured a steaming cup watching the tea swirl up to the lip when they had exhausted their silent conjectures the women quietly picked up the thread of their earlier conversation at first rutledge busy with his sandwiches ignored what they were saying and then realized almost too late that they were in the middle of a discussion of the funeral they had just attended something about their cryptic references alerted him in time to hear one comment in particular wasnt as if none of us knew the circumstances this from the woman who had her back to rutledge a crying shame a woman wearing a black feathered hat replied setting down her cup of tea and reaching for another iced cake i dont know whats to become of us with the roads unsafe and murderers on the loose hamish said quietly they havena said whose death it was they mourned but im thinking rutledge cast a swift glance in their direction noting who was speaking the feathered hats neighbor on the left smoothing her black gloves on the table beside her nodded i wont let my harold walk as far as the pub of a night and hes fuming about it something fierce the fourth woman who was wearing spectacles agreed who on earth would want to kill a soldier back from the war i ask you hes suffered enough aye hamish noted its as i thought the first woman said its a bolshevik plot thats what it is look what happened to their own royal familyslaughtered along with those pretty little girls and the tsar a cousin of king edward as was the kaiser the glove smoother snapped my father always said foreigners are never to be trusted hamish agreed it was the same in scotland we looked with suspicion on the other clans the next glen ower the woman wearing spectacles sighed i pity the taylors alice and her children never had two pennies to rub together but she always put a good face on it what are they to do now taylor was the first man killed the black hat nodded setting the feathers bobbing in concert ive some mending and sewing ill ask her to do for me shes a good needlewoman and taking in sewing will tide her over until the oldest boy can work it mustnt appear to be charity the speaker took off her spectacles polishing them we must be careful about that and we might consider ordering our christmas goose from susan webber im told her poultry is very nice and then the glove smoother said hesitantly you know young peter webber might have seen who it was that did it webber was the name of the second victim hes only eight the woman in spectacles protested hes got eyes hasnt he was the retort he said something to me at the funeral he said thered been a man on the road the night before it happened asking for his father when peter replied that he was working over to seelyham the man asked what regiment hed been in and where hed fought odd sort of thing to ask theyd all fought together the first woman replied everyone knows that theyd tried to stay together the men from marling and helford and seelyham looking out for each other rutledge had finished his tea and the thick wedges of egg salad sandwiches but he poured himself a second cup his attention on the table of women hamish listening as well murmured ye must find the webber boy didnt do them much good did it serving together the woman wearing spectacles wanted to know my fred says they lost more because of that the first speaker the one with her back to rutledge said soothingly i wouldnt give young peters words any weight like as not he means well but my guess is hes hoping for a little attention no need to upset his mother again there was agreement at the table and then the feathered hat said we ought to do something for mrs bartlett as well ive a bit of ham left from sundays dinner and ill take it over to her straightaway with some of the bread and the potatoes if youll look in on her tomorrow and the next dayjust until she gets past the worst of it the woman wearing spectacles said ill see whats in the gardens that she might care for the mourners rose and walked across the tearoom to settle their account as they closed the shop door behind them the owner spoke briefly to the new couple and then came over to clear away the empty table rutledge waited until she was nearest where he sat those women he said do they live in marling the woman wiped her hands on her apron and turned he was the stranger here and she was debating how to respond to his curiosity inspector rutledge scotland yard he told her ive a need to know theyre local the owners face remained doubtful as she studied him theyve just been to the funeral of the man killed along the road the other night peggy bartlett couldnt offer them anything afterward though the womens institute had said theyd see to some refreshment but peggy wouldnt hear of it i cant say that i blame hershes beholden enough for the vicar and the coffin i hope the police find whoever did these terrible things and send him to the gallows her kind face was suddenly grim and unforgiving walking to the police station rutledge decided it would be best to speak to sergeant burke the man was just settling into his chair he looked up at rutledge his eyes tired i expect youre wanting inspector dowling sir he hasnt come back from the bartlett funeral i was glad to escape early its hard to watch women cry and not have any comfort to give rutledge answered actually ive come to ask if anyone spoke to young peter webber after his fathers death burke rubbed his forehead with a thick fist he was that upset no one had the heart to ask him anything hes just turned eight there wasnt much he could tell us about his father webber was away most of the lads life they were just getting acquainted again you might say rutledge took the chair in front of the sergeants desk i understand that but i have a feeling it might be a good idea to speak to him burke said warily what put you onto the lad i heard four women in the tea shop discussing the funeral and his name came up in the conversation peter doesnt know me but hed speak to you i think if you encouraged him rutledge repeated what hed overheard burke heaved himself out of his chair well then peterll be on his way home from school about now we can look for him they found the boy trudging along the road in the rain head down his shabby coat dark across the shoulders a slim child with long hands and long feet a promise of height to come burke instructed rutledge to stop the motorcar just ahead of the boy youre wet through lad he called mr rutledge here will give you a lift home burke said getting out to open the rear passenger door come along then and mind you dont set your muddy feet on the seat with alacrity the boy did as he was told it wasnt often he was offered an opportunity to ride in a motorcar he settled quickly in the seat but leaned forward as hamish seemed to do from time to time his eyes fixed on the instrument panel could you blow the horn then he asked bubbling with excitement could you blow the horn please sir burke chided him please sir peter repeated shyly and laughed with glee as rutledge squeezed the rubber bulb rutledge thought ben shaws son was this age when his father was hanged there was something about the boy the fineness of his hands and skin that spoke of better breeding than a laborers child in that lay the similarity burke said your mum getting on all right is she enough food on the table he quietly gestured to rutledge to stop the car at the next house peter answered were faring well enough but he had the thinness of a growing child who was always hungry mr rutledge here is interested to know more about your pa hoping to help us find the devil that did it did anyone come looking for him do you think before he died the boy squirmed a little in his seat i dont remember yes you do peter it wont go any further i promise you but it might do some good tell us then after a short silence the boy said i never saw him before theres a start burke said encouraging not from marling then do you suppose no at least no one id know by sight what else can you remember not very much as if the lengthening silence urged him to say more peter added he wasnt as heavy as you are but tall like the vicar after a moment consideringly he wore a greatcoat like a soldier but he wasnt a soldier id say the vicar is five foot eleven burke said in an aside to rutledge and to peter what was his coloring then peter shrugged fingering the back of rutledges seat his hands busy and his eyes on them he was fair he took off his hat as he stood talking to me smoothing back his hair that was after id told him pa wasnt at home what did he want with your father did he say no and then he just asked where hed fought in the war and with what regiment as if he was looking for someone and pa might have known the man i see and his age peter what would you say that was he was pas age thereabouts could you please blow the horn again sir my little sisters looking out the window rutledge obliged peter laughed again but it wasnt as carefree as the first time he made a movement to leave the car but burke sat where he was anything that set this mans face apart that you remember a large nose a cleft in the chin eyes too close together peter shook his head and turned to see if his sister was still watching the house was a small cottage on the edge of marling with a rough garden in the front and a roof that needed rethatching chickens and geese scratched in the muddy earth in a large pen behind the cottage peter began fumbling with the door unsure how to let himself out burke said all right peter answer my question and you can go in to your tea theres nothing about his face peter protested i dont remember his face just his voice what about his voice he sounded strange as if he come from liverpool or maybe cornwall different he was fidgeting with anxiety eager to be gone not like a londoner then the boy shook his head i know what londoners sound like they come for the hop picking so they do burke got out in the rain and let the boy down well done peter you neednt talk about it to anyone else best not peter nodded with a bob of his head toward rutledge he was gone up the walk to the door where his little sister let him in as burke got back into the motorcar he said to rutledge not much there id say a fair man tallish and not from kent well id just as soon believe this murderer wasnt one of ours it was a familiar refrain none of us would be guilty of such a thing hamish who had reclaimed the rear seat for his own commented yon description would fit half the men in england burke was adding like as not hed lost his way there was a man dying that night you know gassed a good many friends came to say goodbye but in the middle of the week a working man couldnt travel far most of the dying mans visitors would have been kent men their accents familiar to the boy rutledge was uneasy fair tallish and not from kent it was a description that also fit the man hed thought for an instant hed glimpsed at the bonfire and again along the road near to where the last victim bartlett was found hamish said with relish you willna be satisfied until you find a rational answer but theres no likely to be one burke was saying all the same ill ask for a list of the men who came to say goodbye to bob nester the exsoldier dying of his lungs itll do no harm as rutledge climbed the stairs to his hotel room hamish said the shaw woman shes distracting you fra your duty here answering from habit rutledge said tiredly it doesnt matter ive given her my word oh aye and these dead exsoldiers did ye gie them your word as well what have we got so far to build with a childs description of a stranger the wine the fact that all of these men had lost limbsthat theyd served together and they died at night it will take more than that to find a killer if you were no so distracted youd see another link rutledge had hung his coat across a chair to dry he stopped as he bent to remove his shoes waiting for hamish to go on but there was only silence he said where they drank the wine ive already considered that someone had transportation a cart a wagon a lorry a motorcar in some fashion those men were lured into traveling with someone or stopping somewhere with someone but no in the empty house with its stone pillars there was no sign that the grass had been beaten down it was true no vehicle had traveled up that drive since the summer rutledge had seen the tall grass but not registered its significance if you were a weary man walking home on a cold night and someone offered you wine for warmth and courage rutledge said pacing the room would you take a drink if i knew him id no be suspicious except to wonder how hed come by the wine if he was poor like me yes i agree but if he was a stranger aye it would be different and the difference would be the manner in which the wine was offered to drink enough to die from the laudanum a man would have to be well on his way to being drunk apropos of nothing hamish quietly quoted an old toast heres tae us whas like us gey few and theyre all deid rutledge shuddered all deid the words triggered a memory that had no beginning and no end that was only an unexpected glimpse through the shadows of rutledges mind a resurrected image that made no sense and yet was as clear in that instant as it must have been in a very different venue the man by the bonfirehe ought to have been in uniform but not an english uniform a torn and bloody german uniform his room was suffocating closing in on him rutledge lifted his coat still wet from the chair and pulled it on again better the outofdoors even the rain than staying here and smothering he couldnt understand why these bits of unrelated memory seemed to jump into his mind and then lead nowhere what was triggering them what was bringing them to the surface whenwhatever they representedthey had been buried in the depths of a past the conscious brain rejected dr fleming who had saved his sanity had warned him that there would be flashbacks from time to time as the mind sorted through the dark recesses and found a way to cope with them its only natural nature abhors a vacuum you know dr fleming had said far more cheerfully than rutledge had thought warranted the minds amazing it will bury something it cant faceand then begin to resurrect it to fill in the empty places of memory he had studied the haunted man in front of his desk you dont remember the end of the war do you you dont recall where you went what you did or why ive got some of the pieces they came from your military file but they dont make much sense only you can fill in the blanks and eventually you will how you will handle it will depend on how strong you are emotionallyhow stable your life seems at the time all i can offer you is this an open door come and talk to me ill do what i can to make it more comfortable for you rutledge pulled out of the hotel yard and turned north even if he could simply walk in on fleming and sit down in his office what would he say that he was afraid of someone hed seen someone who was deadwho was german how many germans had he killed he wondered wryly he should be haunted not by one face but by thousands without consciously addressing a destination rutledge drove out the marling road and soon found himself close by the place where the first exsoldier had been killed it was as if one part of his brain had continued the conversation with hamish about the murders and the other had wandered into a no mans land of its own he could see the leaning stone pillars through the rain and slowed the motorcar it was truethe tall weeds and grass growing up the drive had that tangled springing airiness that told him no vehicle had passed over them in some time weather had beaten the stalks down here and there without breaking or crushing them it was nearing dusk he drove on toward the line of trees searching for any other means of reaching the house in the distance but it was an unlikely possibilitydowling and his men would already have taken note of any attempt to go through the grounds his head was turned and so it was almost peripherally that he saw the woman standing at the side of the road in the rain staring up at the gray laden clouds visible between the trees rutledges first thought was that it was mrs shaw waylaying him again for this woman wore a dark coat that seemed to engulf rather than fit her her silhouette shapeless and without grace he saw as he came closer that she was wearing a mans greatcoat and that it swallowed her slimmer figure she clutched it close to her throat as he touched the brakes is there anything you need he asked drawing even with her her face was pale the line of her brows like charcoal smudges above the darkcircled eyes im all right she said and then as an afterthought thank you he shifted into neutral uncertain and then switched off the engine opening his door he stepped out into the road she turned away as if trying to ignore him i dont like leaving you here it will be dark soon my names rutledge inspector rutledge from london if you will let me take you to your houseor to the police station she turned at that her eyes seeming to bore into him london is it she took a shuddering breath well it wont bring will back will will taylor he was my husband they found his body just here they said ive come to see it for myself i didnt want to before but i she stopped rutledge said gently as he walked toward her perhaps it wasnt the best of ideas to come to this place not in the rain surely i never really knew him you see we were married and then he went off to war he came home twice once with the broken arm and then again when the germans blew his foot off they kept him in hospital then and id go and sit by the bed but the ward was full there was no privacy you couldnt talk not really talk i understand he said no you dont she said bitterly nobody does he had more in common with them the other men in that ward than he did with me his wife theyd all lost a limb too he wasntdifferentthere still one of the lads she took a deep breath fighting tears i was beginning to think there were no whole men left in england rutledge said nothing there was no comfort he could offer mrs taylor looked him up and down as if assessing his wounds they werent visible and he felt himself flushing as if guilty of being whole you were in the war were you he nodded you came home with nothing missing its all right for you you didnt have to find a new way of learning to live to earn your keep will had to do that and even when he was sent home the last time we werentcomfortabletogether it was like having a stranger in the house i hardly knew what to say to him nor he to me loving him wasnt the same i couldnt get used to no foot it hadnt healed well the stump and we had no common ground of any kind except the marriage and the children she was speaking not so much to him as she was to the place of her husbands death as if excusing to the shade of will taylor what had gone wrong in their fragile postwar relationship it would bring no comfort to mrs taylor to tell her that hed seen the other side of this coinhasty romantic weddings a patriotic fervor and in the beginning dozens of love letters that flew back and forth like doves how many men standing watch in the night had cleared their throats and gruffly admitted im worrit theres a difference in her letters noo i think theres someone else darkness shielding anxious eyes voices lowpitched she doesna write sae often and she says she hardly kens what i look like anymore but then i have only a wee photograph mysel and she must ha changed in two years ive begged her for another but she canna find anyone with a camera she says a cough as if denying the unspoken fear they had sometimes come to him to beg for leave not just the married men but the single ones who had left someone behind one soldier had stood there clutching in his hand a scrap of newspaper bearing the photograph of gladys cooper the actress pointing to it hed said earnestly shes mair real to me noo than maggie what am i to do anguish sharpened his face and his eyes had pleaded where he could rutledge tried through channels of his own to find out what had happened to the wives at home but sometimes the truth was more bitter than the suspicion and he had concealed that rutledge said now mrs taylor i think i ought to take you home it wont help standing here in the rain surprisingly it does she told him forlornly i feel closer to him here than i do in the churchyard i was afraid when sergeant burke came to the door that will had she faltered surely the other deaths proved that he wasntdidnt kill himself alice taylor shrugged only will knows that she brushed her wet dark hair out of her face and began to walk slowly to the motorcar turning her head once she looked back at the line of trees i wish i didnt feel guilty as if id driven him to whatever it was happened to him rutledge held the door for her and she climbed into the motorcar as he got in after cranking the motor he said did anyone come to see him before he died a stranger a man you didnt know she turned to him i dont know to tell you the truth will took to walking out while i was doing up the washingup after dinner as if he didnt have anything left to say to me or i to him one night he came back and asked if i remembered jimsy ridger i said i did and i was sharp about it jimsy was no friend of wills and he said someone was looking for jimsy but hed given the man false directions he didnt like his cut those were his words i didnt like the cut of him she nodded flicking wet hair out of her face again in her own way she was a pretty woman with such white skin and dark coloring welsh perhaps or cornish what did he mean by that do you think i cant say i wasnt interested in jimsy ridger he was in wills company and i never liked him very much why he was something of a scoundrel jimsy was lightfingered like he never stole anything from us that i know of but he wasnt someone i quite trusted i was afraid he might be hanging about looking for money where is jimsy ridger now she looked out across the wet fields in hell for all i know he didnt come back to kent after the war hed been to paris and won money at cards so it was said kent wasnt for the likes of him after that but then who knows with someone like jimsy rutledge took her to the small cottage she pointed out as hers it was halftimbered of a style popular in the late victorian era but the plaster between the black beams needed paint and the chimney sagged she looked up at it will was going to find someone to repair the chimney i suppose thatll be up to me now he came around to open the door for her and she stepped down into the wet grass that met the rutted road in an irregular verge ill do my best to find your husbands killer he said she had walked up the muddy walk before she turned i dont know that it matters she answered him will didnt much want to live anyway maybe the murderer did him a favor mrs taylors voice lingered in rutledges mind as he drove down the roads that led out of marling and toward the nearest villages then back again forming a mental map of the ground where the three murders had occurred as darkness fell he could see the lights springing up in the windows of farms and cottages off to either side none of them close enough to matter they would ha been dark again the occupants in their beds and sleeping soundly hamish said when the killing was done country folk arent likely to keep late hours yet someone had he found himself wondering if mrs bartlett and mrs webber had felt as estranged from their husbands as mrs taylor had done it was hard to believe that one suicide had sparked two more as desperately tired men gave up trying he himself knew the fierce silent urge toward death when there was no hope left but hamish always practical said where did they buy good wine that was always the sticking point the wine he drove in the early dusk toward marling his headlamps picking out the overgrown hedgerows and the dark pockets of thick grass between trees that sometimes marched in avenues for a little distance vistas that in summer were glorious with a patchwork of green were now brown and dry and the long sweep of the land had lost much of its charm he was not more than a hundred yards from the first cottage marking the outskirts of the town when he saw someone quickly moving into a clump of trees edging a field moving as if afraid to be seen pulling hard on the brake rutledge brought the car to a halt and got out running toward the faintly seen outline of a human form the trees thinned almost at once as he plunged into them and brought him out into another field his feet sank heavily into the wet plowed soil where the summers crop had been turned under for the winter cursing he tried to pick up his pace but it was useless then the figure ahead of him stumbled and fell and swore harshly rutledge reached him before he could flounder to his feet hardly a murderer he thought in disgust as the thick miasma of drunken breath hit him in the face before he could put out a hand to help the man to his feet leave me alone the man shouted struggling to shake off his grip whatve i done to you to chase me off the road then he was standing now a man with dark sweaty hair and filthy work clothes rutledge realized that one shoulder was different from another saw that the man had a useless left arm it hung without life clumsily and straight catching rutledges glance the man clapped his right hand over the shoulder in a protective action that was clearly habit now rutledge said what are you doing out here it was the voice of command looking for a quiet place to sleep it off if its any concern of yours men sleeping it off have been found dead the next morning or havent you heard im not drunk enough to die im not drunk enough to stop hurting either whats that to you the slurred voice was bellicose the man stood his ground with nothing more to say come on rutledge said tired of argument ill take you to the police station where you can sleep until youre sober enough to go home i dont have a home anymore the man said beginning to feel sorry for himself she said if i got drunk again not to come back but its all there is now getting drunk his hiccup turned into a sob by the time theyd reached the edge of the first field the man was on his knees sick by the base of a tree rutledge waited impatiently for him to finish and then got him to the motorcar and inside it where do you live he asked when they were moving toward marling whats your name bert holcomb if its any of your business from seelyham but if i drink in the pub there the barmaid goes to my wife i come here and tell her i have two days work he groaned that was good beer i lost i cant afford no more this week what happened to your arm the war caught it on the wire like all the other poor bastards the doctors saved it but its worthless now i cant move it on my own he leaned his head against the back of the seat god my mouth tastes something terrible did you know the men whove been killed outside of marling taylor webber bartlett we were together through most of the war men of kent we were proud of that im going to be sick again rutledge brought the motorcar to a swift halt and waited again when the man crawled back into the vehicle he groaned wretchedly i never could drink the way the others could a shudder ran through him do you know a man called jimsy ridger the ravaged face turned toward rutledge what do you want to find him for goodfornothing bastard where does he live second person to ask me that today rutledge said who was the other person i dont know he gave me money and i drank it where did you meet him walking over from seelyham did you tell him where to find jimsy ridger there was a gurgling laugh now how could i do that i dont know myself but i wanted the money badly enough to make up a good story after depositing the sodden holcomb at the marling station rutledge went on to the plough he felt tired and restless a man at loose ends afraid of his past now and afraid for his future he had been very certain he was right in the shaw case how many others had he botched in blind belief that his experience and intuition were infallible would he botch this one as well he felt like getting as drunk as the man on the road except that he knew it would not buy peace hamish said judgment is no a safe profession my father said that to me once rutledge remembered as he walked up the stairs toward his room he said the law was only as good as the men who devised it and the men who carried out the burden of it he turned down the passage stopping before his door and staring at it for a moment before opening it what is there about the shaw case that isnt satisfactory why have i been digging into the past and doubting everything that was done he shut the door behind him and walked to the window it looked down the back garden bleak in the november darkness with the stumps of cabbages and the withered leaves of carrots and the ferny yellowed wisps of asparagus as dead as his spirits tonight the answer was not hard to find when selfdoubt awakens it feeds on itself rutledge said aloud under his breath shaw was guilty i know that for a certainty yet hed uncovered other possible motives now it was pandoras box an overturned case where everything that spilled out pointed accusing fingers at him for not seeing them before hamish reminded him mrs shaw is a verra persuasive woman that was true the fact that she was unattractive in every sense and that he had disliked her from the start had perhaps shaped his view of her and of events then and now but she had aroused such guilt in himsuch a fierce doubt of his own abilitiesthat he was unable to see his earlier actions as clearly as he had done when philip nettles death had first thrust the affair into his hands rutledge turned away from the window and fumbled for the lamp on the desk watching the flame bloom and brighten his room the brass bed gleamed and the white china of the washstand pitchers reflected a golden light with bowles baying for results there had been unnatural pressure on the investigating officers results results results they had worked nearly around the clock interviewing cataloging statements going back again to ask other questions trying to sort through the simple lives and the tangled activities of everyone who had had contact with the elderly victims for the previous two years the dustman the man who brought the coal the grocers boy who delivered boxes of goods the butchers boy the woman who came to clean and to cook one meal a day the man bringing the post the visitors from charities and churches nurses who came to see to bedsores or bathe their patients the chimney sweepit had been an endless task sorting through the sheets of closely written notes collected from all the officers assigned to the murders and yet shaw had slowly emerged slowly been identified his life probed his activities examined until the timing had damned him he had maintained that when he left each of the women was still alive but coincidence could be stretched only so far and shaws way of life had been changed by the small pieces of jewelry and silver frames and bits of flatware that had been sold to men whose own livelihood lay in convenient memory loss and a rapid dispersal of questionable goods to other dealers not one of them had described ben shaw the man was forty young graying balding a woman they thought workingclass no better than she should be shabbily dressed and poor but with a posh accent hard to trace these remnants of a dead victims life without help but one or two had come to light in the windows of small shops noticed by eagleeyed young constables eager to make their mark one of those constables had been janet cutters son by her first marriage george peterson the suicide rutledge paced the floor his mind absorbed in the past hamish scolded ye canna solve the problem gnawing at it like an auld dog wi a shinbone theres work to be done here you canna ignore it rutledge recalled mrs taylors weary face and the uncertain future of young peter webber hamish was right this was not the first time hed had to juggle cases when there was heavy pressure for answers there had been times before the war when he hardly slept at all and one of those times was the shaw case where had that mourning locket spent the last six years he looked at his watch decided dowling might still be at his desk leaving the room he ran lightly down the staircase in the main lobby and strode out the door turning toward the police station the evening was beginning to clear a sharp wind brushing out the rain brushing out the cobwebs as well hamish wanted to know inspector dowling was just turning to walk home rutledge called his name and the man stopped looking around im late for my tea he said and im tired come to the hotel and have dinner with me i need to talk to you and this is as good a time as any torn between his obligations at home and the chance of a fair meal dowling stood there in the street his face a picture of his struggle yes all right then ill meet you at the plough i ought to tell my wife ill be late he walked on and rutledge retraced his steps to the hotel halfway there he encountered elizabeth mayhew on the street ian she said startled what on earth im in marling for the present assigned to deal with these murders oh she bit her lip as if uncertain what to do whether to invite him to dine with heror perhaps to stay at her house for the duration reading the dismay in her eyes he said gently ive a room at the hotel come and dine with me one night but not this evening ive got a meeting with dowling hes a good man she said distractedly id heard they had sent someone down from london i never dreamed it might be you and the puppies theyre thriving it was the first thing that came into his head their old easy companionship had evaporated like the evenings mists and he felt nearly as awkward as she evidently did yestheyre growingtheyre quite adorable actually playful and sleeping less now that their eyes have opened she stopped as if after such an enthusiastic report she felt she ought to invite him to come and see henriettas brood for himself the silence stretched out as she searched for something else to say i mustnt miss my meeting he said will you leave a message at the hotel desk when youll be free for dinner relieved she replied of course imim glad youre here ian i look forward to dinner and then she was gone a quick smile begging for understanding as she went on down the street in the direction of the church he turned to look after her saddened by the change in their relationship but if there was someone a new man in her life then there would be little room left for richards old friends and he could appreciate that sea change if he were courting a young woman whose late husbands friends were in the picture their presence would cause a certain degree of unease particularly judging whether the widow was yet free of the past and what his own role would become if she wasnt but he wasnt courting elizabeth he was watching her fade from his life a pleasant memory that was no longer his to enjoy richard rutledge said to himself as he turned again and walked on to the hotel its not my place to play dog in the manger elizabeth must make her own way but the sadness lingered and a certain unacknowledged responsibility he remembered what his sister frances had said youre afraid you are letting richard down hamish remarked shes no on her way to the altar only in the direction of yon kirk and it was true time enough to worry later dowling regarded the ploughs menu like a starving man faced with a banquet rutledge watched in amusement as the inspector chose very carefully as if half afraid such an opportunity might not come his way again after theyd ordered dowling leaned back in his chair sergeant burke has told me about peter webber how much faith do you put in what the boy had to say i dont know rutledge answered honestly but its a place to begin tell me do you know someone called jimsy ridger good god how did you come to hear of him apparently someone has been asking for him as in someone who might be our murderer as their soup was set before them rutledge replied its hard to judge but rather a coincidence dont you think tell me about ridger dowling spooned up the carrotandonion soup with great gusto then said hes not local never was as a boy he came with the hop pickers out of maidstone a rough sort of child with a bullying nature and a particularly unclear concept of personal property there were innumerable complaints about him the hop pickers often camped or caravaned you see there were precious few things worth stealing but it was easy enough if you saw a mans pipe you fancied or a silver bangle forgotten on a bench even a bit of ribbon for the hair most of the adults and the children who were old enough to work were too tired to be overly troublesome but the younger ones with too much energy and too little guidance were always skirting trouble ridger might have become the ringleader if hed been clever enough to go about it in the right way but he was always out for himself for our sakes i was always glad he hadnt seen his golden opportunity he came in the autumn then for the picking and sometimes the haying before that depended on the weather you see when one finished and the other began he finished his soup with a sigh of satisfaction at any rate dowling went on ridger was soon off to fairer fields of endeavor he ran away to london with an older boy and his mother didnt have the energy to care nothing was ever proved against ridger but there was a trail of near misses petty theft some minor forgery cheating old women out of their savingsthe sort of trouble a boy is likely to fall into running with the wrong crowd im surprised you followed his career dowling grinned hardly that from time to time id be contacted by london when theyd run out of likely places to look for him he kept his ties in kent i doubt he cared tuppence for marling it was more a case of going to earth when london got too warm for him one spring he came back to work in the orchards and after that he moved on to the hop gardens he disappeared one day and then was back in the autumn with a swollen eye and a cut on his chin deep enough to leave a scar i suppose he never had a home of his own in the true sense his mother was a decent enough woman but she produced children like rabbits and never seemed to know where half of them were they fell into rivers and out of trees and over wallswed clean them up and send them back to her for a scolding rutledge said not a vicious man then ridger dowling frowned no id not call him vicious on the other hand ridger was out for himself and that sort can sometimes turn violent he was in the war the woman serving tables brought them a platter of roast chicken and dowlings eyes gleamed with hungry relish he fell to with an apologetic smile after a few mouthfuls he answered he joined the army here in kent with the rest of the men hereabouts he told sergeant burke at the time that he felt closer to them than to his friends in london or trusted them more is my guess still ridger had a wonderful way with him when it suited him he could call the birds from the trees as my grandmother was fond of saying and from all reports he was a good soldier and the best scavenger in the regiment rutledge had known more than a few of those himself a scot in his company a man called campbell had a knack for disappearing and then coming back hours later with a full haversack tins biscuits matches even a cold roast hen with cold potatoes probably scooped up from some french farmers abandoned kitchen campbell had found dry socks after a week of rain and gloves in the middle of winter and whisky for those too well to go back to aid stations and in too much pain to stand their duty officers tried to keep the thievery to a minimum but what they didnt see they couldnt stop what became of ridger after the war rutledge asked hes back in london i expect unless hes gone to earth again hamish suggested and someone thinks hes in kent the campbells of this world excellent scavengers though they were occasionally forgot the rules and made enemies dowling ordered a flan for his dessert and rutledge settled for a plate of cheese the inspector sighed as he put down his spoon i must thank you he said with a wry smile i feel blissfully content after dowling had left the hotel rutledge searched for the man who usually served behind the desk haskins was his name and he had just finished his own meal in the kitchen his napkin still under his chin he pointed out the telephone and rutledge put in a call to london sergeant gibsons gruff voice came over the line yes sir you wanted to speak to me im looking for a man named jimsy ridger rutledge gave gibson a brief sketch of ridgers background and history hes probably in london and he may have returned to his old ways or he may have acquired a new name and taken up a more respectable line of work but someone will know how to find him even so gibson chuckled he wouldnt be the first to turn respectable and find old friends on his doorstep anything else sir hes a personable man with a scapegrace way about him when he puts his mind to it he added as an afterthought he could be passing himself off as an exofficer rather than a common soldier gibson noted it not many of them in the stews of london he retorted dryly ill see what i can come up with sir but it will take a little time rutledge gave him the number at the plough and rang off as he walked up the stairs hamish said yon ridger is a wildgoose chase like as not true enough rutledge answered in police work we often close more doors than we open on the other hand will taylor was killed hours after he was questioned about ridger and our drunken friend tonight had been asked about him i dont want to find ridger appearing as our cooked goose in the middle of a trial the nights dreams were a mixture of unsettled thoughts and emotionsthe sounds of gunfire in the dark the flashes of light the arcing descent of flares the first finding shots of artillery and rutledge was hunched behind the barrier of the trench wall waiting for a lull to go over the top the living hamish was with him and others long since dead and he tried to keep up their courage as the minutes wore on and then he was standing in a twilit kent road talking to alice taylor and searching through the hop fields for the boy peter webber mrs shaw was sitting in the car a baleful presence with her daughter weeping in the seat beside her rutledge woke with a start his body wet with sweat his eyes searching the room for somethinganythingthat was familiar he had no idea where he was and then the shape of the window and the pale light of a moon feeling its way through the thinning clouds brought him back to the plough hotel and the small village of marling he got up and washed his face hamish lurking in the shadows of the room said something and rutledge shook his head hamish repeated its almost dawn so it was rutledge said the summer dawns came early at the front you never liked them there was no much worth seeing when the light strengthened except for the dead and the wire and the men coughing with the damp or the gas rolling in aye the highland scots used to the open hills had been good at spotting the telltale sweep of a german gas attack all their lives theyd seen sea mists and that particular floating gauze that was ground mist in the valleys they knew the feel of the air before these blew in and they knew the different feel of the air before the gas came toward them on still mornings when the wind wouldnt disperse it too quickly hamish had often been the first to cry a warning they had fumbled for their masks shielding any bare skin and waited for the attack to pass over them anyone too slow anyone with an illkept mask breathed in the fumes and felt the linings of his throat and lungs burn with a fire that was unforgiving the damage once done lingered for whatever remained of a mans life looking back at the past in that odd moment there was something besides the haunting voice and the haunted man in the quiet dark room that bond that held together soldiers over millennia the shared experience of the devastation of war returning to bed was useless it wouldnt bring sleep rutledge bathed and shaved and then dressed his mind occupied with murder in this quiet part of kent sitting in a chair by the window he waited patiently for the hotel to rouse from the night and then went down to breakfast at the appointed time the dining room was empty and a yawning girl was just opening the drapes that shut off the view of the street she looked up smiled and said i expect youd like your tea id be grateful he said returning the smile she blushed and looked away hurrying to the door that led through to the kitchen as he turned to the window he saw a man driving a familiar motorcar pulling up at the hotel the man too was familiar it was tom brereton whom hed met at lawrence hamiltons dinner party a guest brought by raleigh and bella masters the man whom melinda crawford was thinking of including in her will brereton came striding into the dining room and didnt at first recognize rutledge his eyes were on the kitchen door and when the girl serving tables came through with rutledges tea he called do you suppose you could manage toast and a pot of that for me as well she led him to the table just beyond rutledges and it was then that brereton peered at the man from london and paused as if trying to place him rutledge greeted him by name and reminded him of the dinner party brereton nodded yes thats right the policeman from scotland yard what brings you back to kent the murders here i suppose do you mind he gestured to the other chair at rutledges table no please join me brereton nodded to the girl and she went off to fetch his tea im half asleep brereton said sitting down bella was worried that raleigh had finished his drops and finally sent one of the servants down to my cottage to ask if id mind coming in this morning to ask the doctor for a new supply for his pain brereton grimaced its more for his moodiness theyve given him a new foot you know and it hurts like the devil both physically and psychologically if he could manage it hed have his ravaged one back i expect that giving up his practice would weigh heavily on a man like masters yes thats probably more true than we know he lived for the law and hes at sixes and sevens now his tea and a plate of toast arrived and brereton added as he poured hot milk into the cup i dont suppose masters has ever been easy to live with hes a remarkably clever man nothing else has ever touched him the way the law did and hes having trouble filling all those empty hours bella fusses which doesnt help but then shes worried sick about him they end up aggravating each other to the point of scenes he shook his head its rather sad hes not likely to take up growing vegetable marrows rutledge agreed smiling im surprised that he hasnt thought of writing about his career at the hamiltons dinner party he spoke warmly of matthew sunderland he must have known or worked with a number of famous men interesting possibility i ought to drop a hint along those lines sunderland was raleighs mentor and his standard youd think the man walked on water the way raleigh extols his virtues i wonder if he could be objectivesunderland made his share of mistakes from what ive heard rutledge said did he there was a famous case just at the turn of the century hushed up of course but sunderland was reportedly tooerfond of the wife of the man he was prosecuting there was an odor of vengeance about the proceedings as if hed gladly see the man punished not for the alleged crime but for marrying the woman sunderland had fancied for himself naturally ive never asked raleigh if there was another side of the story where did you hear this it was during the war i had taken a train back to hospital after leave and i found myself seated with an elderly barrister we talked about the law for most of the journey and he made a comment about the famous mr sunderland having feet of clay apparently there was a lampoon that showed the qcas he was thenas david sending bathshebas husband not to the forefront of battle but to prison for life in any event the jury decided otherwise for whatever reasons and it was one of the few cases that sunderland ever lost hamish added dryly i canna see him taking a fancy to yon harridan i saw sunderland in top form during the shaw trial he was impressive shaw oh yes the man hanged for murdering women in their beds it was another trial that created a good deal of publicity sunderland died within the year i think brereton smiled wryly bella tells me raleigh all but went into a decline there was no suggestion of illness or impairment in the courtroom according to raleigh it was a sudden death sunderlands heart simply stopped he was sitting at his desk dictating letters to his clerk and between one word and the next he was gone brereton took out his watch and peered at it intently as if having trouble reading it another half hour before the doctors likely to be up he put the watch away carefully the truth is the man you saw at the dinner party is a far cry from what he once was raleigh has lost the edge that made him a superb barrister he probably wishes he could die as swiftly as sunderland did in all likelihood he wont live out the winter its sad to watch a man deteriorate rutledge agreed its bella i worry about shes going to wear herself into illness if she isnt careful and he doesnt seem to notice or to care theres a selfcenteredness in dying rutledge pointed out brereton looked up at him so there is in blindness too the difference is in age and perspective ive still much of my life ahead of me and i dont fancy spending it tapping along the pavement with a cane he said restively i must go bellamrs masterswill be anxious i may be able to persuade dr pugh to let me in he stood and looked around for the girl who had served him then went to the kitchen door to call to her after settling his account he came back to the table i live in the cottage just down the road from the masterses house if you find yourself in the neighborhood stop and have a drink with me rutledge thanked him and after brereton had gone finished his own tea but it was still too early to call on elizabeth mayhew and when the serving girl came back to clear the table he ordered his usual breakfast by that time the other guests in the hotel began to arrive and the room took on new life as voices filled the spaces he sat by the window watching the street come to life as well as carts moved among the shops bringing in chickens and cabbages and beets and loaves of bread fresh from the bakery a small cart filled with baskets of apples rolled past the farmers cheeks as round and red as his wares his bald pate gleaming in the first rays of the laterising sun through the glass rutledge could hear the clock in the church tower strike the hour faintly brereton driving out of marling was hunched over the wheel intent on avoiding an accident how had brereton felt about the murdered exsoldiers rutledge wondered had he understood their suffering better than most and felt the irony of their death in a peaceful country finished with war or had he secretly envied them their quiet and painless end hamish said he isna blind yet ask him in five years which was more to the point his breakfast finished rutledge set out to do what had been on his mind since dawn elizabeth mayhew was surprised to see him at this hour but he apologized with the reminder that he was in marling on yard business youve lived here since well before the war he said as he followed her into the small reception room off the entry hall do you remember hearing of a jimsy ridger she frowned the name isnt familiar at all richard would have known he knew better than most what went on he had deep roots here people talked to him confided in him she looked around her at the comfortable room her home since her marriage im considering selling up there are no children to inherit i might as well let the house go to someone who can keep it as richard would have wished startled he said but its been in his family forwhat seven generations at the least i know theres a cousin somewhere out in kenya i think if hes still alive a remittance man im not sure richard would have liked the idea of his inheriting black sheep in a family were sometimes paid handsomely to take themselves out of england with a monthly stipend to smooth their road and nip in the bud any fond thoughts of returning home uninvited elizabeth smiled wryly if youd married jean youd have been looking for a country place wouldnt you this house would have suited youand that would have suited richard but we seldom know how our lives will turn out do we where would you go rutledge asked keeping to the main point to london i had thought about traveling she said vaguely europe is in a shambles and i dont quite picture you in the wilds of america or the missions of china like melinda crawford one of the puppies awakened by their voices yipped from the other room and elizabeth turned the subject by saying quickly oh you must come and see how theyve grown which in fact they had but rutledge was not to be distracted as she handed him one of the puppies to hold kneeling by the box on the cold hearth elizabeth said canada perhaps and then caught herself as she remembered too late that jean too had gone to canada rutledge pretended hed made no such connection and admired the puppies then he said will you do something for me you know the masters family better than i do can you askskirting the reason whywhat mrs masters recalls of a case in london before the war he described the shaw murders for elizabeth and the brilliant prosecution that matthew sunderland had mounted what in particular do you want to know she asked confused this has nothing to do with the murders here does it its an old case he said lightly but one i was assigned to when i was young and far from wise id like to know if sunderland described it to his friends or if raleigh masters ever discussed it with his wife at the time it attracted considerable attentionit would be natural to relive it elizabeth nodded ohyes werent you about to ask raleigh when he had one of his spells ill try to see what i can learn it was as if she was grateful that the request was impersonal but i dont know that bella can tell me much if it wasnt raleighs case i understand that a shot in the dark if you will her eyes probed his face then she said unexpectedly ian is something about this case worrying you you havent been quite the same since you were here the last time you know i shall do this of course i shall but if theres a reason you arent telling me i want you to know that you can trust me he could have told her that she was the one who had changed not he hamish said aye but who planted the seeds of doubt in your head it had been melinda crawford its not the case itself he answered elizabeth now its the people who were involved ive been reading through their statements again and as he left the house he thought theyd come to a sad pass he and richards widowlying to each other as they never had before dowling had left a message for him at the plough rutledge walked on to the police station and learned from sergeant burke that the marling inspector was already on his way to seelyham rutledge asked has anything happened am i to follow him burke shook his head i doubt theres any new development sir or id have heard it as soon as i came on duty constable smith informed me that inspector grimes over in seelyham had sent a man along to fetch inspector dowling but there mustnt been any urgency sir the inspector waited half an hour at the hotel for you before setting out i expect its no more than a meeting to consider next steps and inspector dowling included you as a courtesy you shouldna have lingered on your ain business hamish scolded its no right to muddle the past wi the present when in rome rutledge thought but this was marling and it was an opportunity to meet grimes in seelyham he thanked burke and was gone but hed no more than turned the crank and started the engine when a young woman stepped out of the hotels side door and paused as if waiting for him to drive on it wasnt until hed climbed behind the wheel that rutledge his thoughts far from london realized he knew her it was nell shaws daughter she simply stood there prepared for rejection miss shaw he said tentatively he dredged his memory for a name and somewhere in the mists of the past he remembered that she was called margaret her face clouded with uncertainty cleared as he recognized her its my mother she said hurriedly im so terribly worried about her with a repressed sigh he asked is she ill shall i ask the doctor to come to the hotel nell shaw was he thought a better tactician than half the generals at the frontbut then as hamish was pointing out perhaps she had a better cause after all rutledge was the man who had brought her husband to judgmentand thus to his death shifting the burden of his selfdoubt to her shoulders blaming her for demanding what she perceived as justice was shirking his duty to himself and to the law im sorryno shes in london i came down alone thanking god for small mercies he said more sharply than hed intended i must drive to seelyham my business there cant wait ill have to take you with me we can talk on the way she hesitated as if half afraid of him gnawing her lip like a child margaret he said more gently would you prefer to wait here until i come back i cant promise how long it will be on the other hand if you drive with me there wont be any distractions or interruptions we can discuss whats wrong with your mother along the way and ill see you safely home from seelyham flushing with embarrassment and gratitude she nodded and rutledge handed her into the passengers seat before turning toward the main road out of the village as they passed the ironmongers a man leaning wearily against the wall stared blearily at them rutledge recognized the drunk holcomb from the night before belching heavily the man turned on his heel and shambled on rutledge wondered if the man was sober enough to make any better sense now but he couldnt stop picking up the thread of margaret shaws earlier remark he asked why are you worried about your mother its like an obsession miss shaw told him earnestly as if relieved to find someone who would listen she was not as hard as her mother nor as intelligent he thought shelteredby choice or by circumstancesshe was not worldly in the true sense and he wondered if she really understood why her mother was so adamant that the past be expunged clearing your fathers name he glanced toward her her face reddened again she had that kind of fair complexion that registered shifts in emotion easily shes convinced papa didnt kill anyone she cant sleep she cant eatits all she thinks about how long has this been going on all these years or since she found the locket shes always railed against the jury but since the locket shes been like a madwoman tell me about finding the locket theres nothing to tell she went next door to help mr cutter as hed asked and when she came home she looked sick as if she was about to lose her dinner she was that upset she locked herself in her room ive only known her to do that twice before the day papa was taken away and the day the letter came what letter i never saw it but after she read it she cried for hours then she came out of her room and was herself again a letter your father had written she frowned i dont see how it could be it only came this autumn but i overheard her tell mr cutter that a cousin was dying she said everyone is gone theres no one left and what has been your feeling all these years about your fathers guilt he asked quietly without judgment she shook her head i never cared whether papa was guilty or not it didnt matter when they took him away i wept all night i hated the police i hated you he was my father i didnt know how we were to get along without him and indeed its been the hardest thing weve ever had to face nobody understands hamish said she would ha been at an age where she doted on him it was true rutledge recalled the stricken whitefaced child standing in the doorway staring up at her father waiting for him to tell her it was all a mistake that hed be home by the morning and shaw had looked at her pain in his eyes and said nothing the boy her brother ben had been belligerent beating his fists against the young constable escorting his father crying out to let him go hed done nothing but the girl had been unable to speak crushed by events not even coming forward to kiss her father as he turned a last time on the road and looked back at her its important to realize that your mother may be wrong that shes going to be disappointed rutledge began slowing in the wake of a lorry i know shes desperate and afraid and clinging to hope but what if there is none so far ive found nothing no real proof to support her belief that this new evidence thats no true hamish thundered its no the truth rutledge silently defended himself i will not give her false hope it wont help her mother and it wont serve her he said adamantly nothing is black and whiteits more often shades of gray hamish replied defiantly aye so you say his upbringing in a barren harsh land compounded by his rigid faith had always set out the lines of battle cleanly one faced and dealt with life and if necessary with death it was what had led him to refuse a direct order in the field this stubborn suicidal belief that compromise was unacceptable hedged in by exhaustion and disgust and grief he had had nowhere to go and so had chosen execution rather than lead even one more man to his death in the teeth of the german guns evidence rutledge went on overriding the protest is sufficient to satisfy either the police or the home office that this file should be reopened but theres the locket mama says you havent spoken to anyonethat youve come here about other murders and forgotten us the girl bit her lip again and turned to look out at the fields mama says she broke off as her voice quivered pride forbade her to cry in his presence i know what your mother says he told her more gently and i have spoken to people who remember your father and his trial and nobody wished to help she said forlornly im not surprised who else could have killed those women there was a long silence he hadnt expected an answer he said finally i can understand why your mother took the locket from that drawerit was human nature it was vindication and she didnt think beyond that possibility still mrs cutter is dead we cant question her about how it came into her possession but i dont think mrs cutter intended to harm papa when she told the police about the change in our circumstances i think when georgethat was mrs cutters son from her first marriagetold her about the murders she saw a way to make trouble for mama because she wanted papa to come to her for help your father worked in the victims houses not your mother but mama was always after papa to ask pay for what he did and he wouldnt hear of it mrs cutter told me one afternoon that mama would go round to the houses herself and say that we were desperate for whatever they could spare mrs cutter told me that mama would ask to be remembered in their wills if the old ladies couldnt pay much nothing in the original testimony suggested that mrs shaw had had any contact with the victims was this the truth or a fabrication how did mrs cutter know these things i dont know i was afraid to ask her her son george did you ever speak to your parents about her accusations margaret shook her head vigorously oh no it was shameful to think of mama begging which might have scuttled janet cutters intentions he drove with only half his mind on the road it would be easy to believe that mrs cutter had simply used the killings to her own advantageexcept for that locket the locket put an entirely different complexion on the interactions between the shaws and the cutters would janet cutter have asked her son george to bring her a small token some property of the dead that she could use in her persecution of nell shaw and instead the police had taken her literally and investigated the husband not the wife shed have buried the locket away then for fear it would condemn the wrong shaw mistaking his silence margaret shaw turned to face rutledge it will break mamas heart if you fail her i dont know what im to do then mama has always been that strong how will my brother and i survive without her her voice ended in a wail that made him flinch rutledge swore to himself he mustnthe couldntafford to find himself entangled in the emotional turmoil of the shaw family his objectivity slipped with every encounter the locket was damningbut where had it come from that was the crux of his dilemma where had the locket spent the last six years it couldnt have been in the possession of janet cutters dead son unless hed sent it to her in a final and desperate need to justify his suicide it would be a tidy answer hamish interjected sourly the whole case was revolving around janet cutter and she was dead rutledge said your mother means well margaret but shes living under the delusion that the police and a jury and a judge were wrong in their findings and that doesnt happen very often thats what mama said to usit doesnt happen very oftenbut they wronged your father and they wronged me and they wronged you mama was there in the courtroom she could see that a jury believes what the lawyers tell them what the police tell them but papa never said a word in his own defense who gave his side the defense had put up the best arguments it could but the most damning evidence had been shaws refusal to deny his guilt when the police had questioned him hamish said if mrs cutter had told him what she told the lass and he believed her lies he would have taken his wifes place in the dock for the sake of the children rutledge completed the thought miss shaw was silent for a long breath then she said stoutly i never liked mrs cutter there was a slyness about her shed be very kind offering tea cakes or hair ribbons and then once i was lulled into accepting shed begin to pick and pry shed ask about my parents about my father i didnt know how to stop her or turn the questions it was like being pinned the way insects were in a museum display i saw once what sort of questions what papa and mama talked about together if they had arguments what my father had given my mother on her birthday it was as if she couldnt bear for them to be happy together on the outskirts of seelyham oast houses lined the fields like misshapen windmills lacking their sails miss shaw asked about them staring over her shoulder i was never much in the countryside she said artlessly i dont know anything about flowers or trees but i like them rutledge thinking of the shabby cheekbyjowl houses of sansom street replied i expect you do you should consider going into service in the country if hed been on better terms with elizabeth mayhew he could have recommended this girl to her but she was considering selling up and there would be no place for margaret shaw when new owners took over the pretty face turned to him brightening i could couldnt i if mama doesnt find a way to help us i learn quickly if im taught hamish said covenanter to the bone its no a very fine future service for many girls with no other place to go it provides a home rutledge pointed out at that hamish snapped and salves your conscience aye on the outskirts of seelyham was a huddle of halftimbered cottages with thatched roofs that led into a broadening of the road a few side streets and a small green with two and threestory brick buildings on either side one of them half covered with ivy and sporting a sign identifying it as the seelyham arms around the corner stood a small public house with a pair of benches on either side of the door the church was set on higher ground where a lane branched to the right and the churchyard wall ran along the lane for some distance beyond sharing it on the other side with a rather shabby house that rambled into three wings its plaster faded to a soft cream and the pointed windows reflecting the church tower the police station a farmer walking his dog informed rutledge was just beyond the pub rutledge left miss shaw in the parlor of the seelyham arms ordering tea and sandwiches for her before walking along to the station it was crammed between a pair of shops one with meats hanging in the window and the other a bakery displaying an array of cakes and bread he found dowling talking with a heavyset redfaced man who was introduced as grimes the local man on the scene the small office stuffy with the heat of bodies and the smell of stale food was almost claustrophobic in atmosphere rutledge quickly found himself wanting to leave the outer door standing wide gruff and to the point grimes declared ive just been acquainting mr dowling here with the names of men whod be included on any list of possible victims if our murderer widens his range seemed to be a good idea to say something to each man and weve just done that rutledge wondered how many ablebodied men had gone marching off to war out of the villages tiny population he sat down in the chair offered him and replied i take it that they served with the marling men grimes looked him over the height the thinness of the face the haunted eyes but something in rutledges appearance made up his mind for him thats right except for two that went to sea he sighed the farmers got used to their being away managing somehow but its not the samenever will be and no money to mechanize what did these men have to say rutledge asked not what youd call helpful information dowling sat there and watched them and hes of the same mind nobody seems to know anything we dont grimes passed a list to rutledge who scanned it quickly none of the names were familiar whats more id already spoken with the rector comparing impressions you might say he knows seelyham as well as or better than i do and theres been no indication of secrets or trouble that hes aware of he stirred in his chair glancing briefly at dowling all the same the men and their families are worried you could see it in their faces hamish said if theres trouble theyre no likely to confide in either priest or police and hamish was right men who had stood shoulder to shoulder in the terrifying bombardments leaning against the slick mud of the trench walls as they waited for the signal to go over the top were as close as brothers what passed between them was kept to themselves and they looked out for each other the scots under rutledge were as feuding a lot as hed ever come across in civilian life but theyd close ranks before an officer turning bland faces his way and swearing that all was well admirable in some ways this silence and infuriating in others it could well turn out to be deadly now grimes was saying ive asked about strangers as well not one of these men has seen someone hanging about there was a boy who came down with the hop pickers a jimsy ridger has someone from their ranks been searching for him rutledge asked ridger might not be viewed as a stranger if theyd served with him if there was no one spoke up i recall ridger as a matter of fact an unlikely lad to settle down to a decent living to my knowledge he hasnt been around since the war ended a year ago grimes picked up the thread of his discussion but the women now theyre a different story and thats where we were heading when you walked through the door if you want to come along id ask only that you let me do the talking taking acceptance of the invitation for granted grimes got heavily to his feet and dowling said diffidently ought i to wait here too much officialdom no you might as well hear whats said the three men walked briskly in the direction of the brick cottages that stood in a cluster where the high street ran into the marling road for the most part the homes were well kept sedate with white curtains at the windows and pots of flowers set in the sunny doorways mrs parker lives here grimes was saying indicating one of them you can see how that pair of windows in the front room overlooks the street he tapped lightly on the door and stood back an elderly woman opened it a crack and peered out at them now then mrs parker grimes said with gruff affability ive brought mr dowling and mr rutledge here to listen to what you told me you saw the other night if youd not mind repeating it for us she was swathed in shawls stooped and breathing with noticeable difficulty she didnt offer to invite her visitors in she stood her ground in the doorway clutching the frame and the edge of the door as if to support herself a brief gust of wind stirred her thin gray hair and she stepped back into the shelter of the entry she spoke to them from there like a frail ghost of the woman she must once have been her large frame shrunken with illness and age i dont rest of a night as you know very well bill grimes i sit by my windowsa gnarled finger pointed out the one hed indicated earlierand sleep in my chair when i sleep at all it was last tuesday night i think it was there was someone walking by and i leaned forward to tap on the glass did you know who it was well i thought i did i thought it was tommy jacobs and one of the twins had taken ill and was it she glared at him you know very well it wasnt you went straight to his door after you left here and asked him yourself i know mrs parker grimes answered patiently but these gentlemen dont if itud been tommy hed have stopped and told me what he was doing out at that hour instead he crossed the road there head down and hurried off as if he hadnt heard me and how would you describe him she pressed her lips together trying for breath he looked like tommy jacobs she said after a moment tall good shoulders he had on a heavy coat and his hat it was cold that night thats all i saw ill let you step in out of the wind then mrs parker kind of you to talk to us i appreciate it grimes tipped his hat again she looked from him to dowling then to rutledge ive seen him before she said indicating the inspector from marling but not him mr rutledge has come down from london grimes informed her she gave rutledge a toothless grin her bright blue eyes suddenly dancing from london is it mr parker was from london i always fancied london men with that she shut her door firmly and left them standing on the street do you believe her rutledge asked grimes i think i do shes not well but her eyesight is keen enough and so is her mind dowling said her windows are near enough to the street for a clear look at the man they considered the story for a moment longer before walking on if her testimony was the only one we had id be more chary of taking it seriously grimes said the next woman in a way corroborates what mrs parker saw but before we walk on notice the direction of the church from here rutledge and dowling turned to observe that the church was closer into town now look down there the house set back from the road in the trees it was on the outskirts of seelyham a good fifty yards away and rather finer than the cottages rutledge thought it might have been at one time a dower house judging by the low brick wall in front and a handsome portico grimes set off with determination explaining as he went miss judson and her father live in that house its called the swallows and its too far off the road to see whos coming and going but that same tuesday night miss judson went out to fetch the rector to her father he isnt well and sometimes he takes a bad turn and wants to make his peace with god she does what she can to keep his spirits up rutledge said they live together then oh yes miss judson is what you might describe as a mature lady id guess mr judson is well past his three score years and ten they had reached the property and were walking up the drive when a woman with a dog came out of the house went down the stone steps and stopped to stare at them with interest before moving in their direction inspector grimes she said nodding to dowling and rutledge a tall angular woman in her forties with clear gray eyes and a nononsense manner she waited with composure for grimes to explain himself ive brought inspector dowling from marling to speak with you and inspector rutledge from london id like them to hear what you told me frowning miss judson said you attach more importance to it than i do i daresay we do grimes agreed affably but in police work its the small things that sometimes loom large in the end she faced the other two men and explained in her abrupt fashion i had gone to fetch the rector to my father as i walked down the drive and turned toward the rectory i passed a man coming out of seelyham it was late and i didnt expect to find anyone else on the road i nodded as i passed him and went on to knock on mr sawyerss door when the two of us walked back the man was nowhere to be seen did you recognize him rutledge asked indeed not how was he dressed well enough to be a gentleman certainly not shabby enough to be a beggar even though he was on foot were the last house you see and i thought perhaps he might have been staying at the arms and couldnt sleep i suggested as much to inspector grimes here could you see his face or judge his coloring she smiled there was no moon inspectorrutledge is it i wouldnt know him again if he came to tea except that he had a good bearing i thought perhaps hed been in the war they thanked her and took their leave as grimes walked back to the main road he told them i asked at the arms there was no one who might have taken it in his head to try the air well after midnight two ladies visiting a cousin and a pair of travelers too drunk after their dinner to have made it down the stairs again without breaking their necks then we have a man walking out of seelyham on a tuesday night no one was murdered on a tuesday rutledge pointed out but there was on a saturday grimes reminded him and heres the other bit of the puzzle another woman was walking through the churchyard around nine oclock saturday evening she was coming home from sitting up with a child with croup rounding the corner by the church she walked straight into a man coming out of the bushes he was living rough she thought and she didnt care for that she walked on and came to find me but by the time i reached the churchyard hed taken the hint and moved on she spoke to him grimes laughed miss whelkin would ask the devil who he was roasting over the fires of hell if wed sent her to fight the kaiser the war would have been over in two years rutledge smiled such women were the bane of ordinary villagers and the delight of policemen she stopped stockstill and wanted to know if he was waiting for someone theres a young girl here in seelyham who is no better than she ought to be and miss whelkin was of the opinion the man was loitering for a chance to meet her she asked him outright and he answered that hed come a long way and was tired hed fallen asleep when he went into the church to pray she was fairly certain he was from cornwall has she visited cornwall my guess is that she hasnt grimes replied sourly but she swore he could pass for tristan whoever he might be when hes at home rutledge who had been studying the churchyard turned to look sharply at grimes tristan his first thought was the opera but he doubted miss whelkin had ever set foot in a london theater she was not likely from grimess description to be a lover of foreign works how old is she this miss whelkin fiftyfive if shes a day grimes declared her father was schoolmaster here for most of her life then shed have known the idylls of the king tennysons romantic series of poems about arthur and his court they had brought the round table knights back into fashion and all things gothic tristan grimess face cleared tennyson he nodded recalling his school days i had to learn a good bit of his poems by heart dowling was talking to grimes and rutledge shut out their voices as he dredged his memory there had been a painting just before the war very popular with londoners c tarrants portrait of a young fair man on a narrow grubby back street of a midlands town staring up at an aeroplane overhead ignoring the signs of poverty all around him the young mans eyes were fixed in wonder on the miracle of flying earthbound he longed for the skies like a grail knight blind to the misery of the world in his vainglorious search for the miraculous cup and the artist had called it tristan there had been two schools of thought on the intent of the portrait and much had been written about it the show had been a triumph much later rutledge had met the man who might have posed for that knightly figure miss whelkin would probably have agreed with the artist about the depiction of tristan there had been reproductions of the painting in bookshops and she might even have seen one of them but why had she connected that tristan with a stranger from cornwall hamish said you canna be sure she did rutledge said aloud i think we ought to speak to miss whelkin youll have to come back then shes off to her sisters in canterbury for the week miss whelkin visits her every november like clockwork they dont get on together its a trial for both of them but shes bent and determined to do her duty by her kin dowling wistfully suggested luncheon at the hotel before returning to marling but rutledge still had to address the problem of nell shaws daughter grimes and dowling set off toward the police station where dowling had left his bicycle and rutledge walked on to the seelyham arms margaret shaw had managed to reach marling on her own but it was necessary to find her safe transportation back to london with promises that he would not forget her mother and would visit her as soon as possible rutledge handed her into the carriage of an elderly and respectable greengrocer driving to london to see his dentist he also gave her fare for a cab to take her across the river from charing cross there was trepidation in her face as she asked but what must i do about mama i cant go home and tell her theres nothing new and watch her worry herself into one of her blinding headaches shell be fit to be tied if i come back emptyhanded rutledge said did she send you to me the girl shook her head no but shed want to know where ive been and who i saw shes that strict ill have to tell herif i lie she catches me out and its all the worse last night she sat on the side of my bed and told me she was at her wits end she had that pinched look about her eyes as if the lamp was too bright she stared around her at the village of seelyham her gaze wandering to the stone church tower green with moss and the hummocky ground of the ancient churchyard do you believe papa killed those women truly believe it as her eyes swung back to his face she read the uncertainty there before he could control the doubt that had plagued him since the day her mother had walked back into his life it doesnt matter what i believe he said wearily the key to this muddle was very likely the stroke janet cutter had had shortly after shaws sentencingand shortly after her sons suicide come to that but which piece of news had destroyed her if the truth were known did you know george peterson he asked then margaret was surprised hardly at all he was grown up when i was a child and i was rather afraid of him because he was older as if digging into her memory she answered slowly he was a policeman and mama would threaten to call him to come and take us away if we were naughty it was a common enough threatin many households the police had replaced the devil as a deterrent to bad behavior rutledge smiled following her own train of thought margaret shaw said i dont know why mrs cutter cared for papa he was whimsical and i think she must have liked that how did henry cutter behave toward your mother oh he was always asking her advice i think he admired mamas strength and papa liked mrs cutters softness she reminded him of growing up somewhere else not sansom street it was almost as if theyd all married the wrong people i dont expect to wed she added with a candidness that was a measure of her own lost childhood theres too much heartache it seldom comes out right rutledge drove inspector dowling back to marling halfway there the inspector began we dont see many murders in this part of the country not like some of the towns where theres an uncertain element maidstone for instance or rochester dover sees more trouble being a port where all kinds mix the last murder in marling was just before the war a son who killed his father before the old fool could marry again and change his will i understand that kind of violence the son felt he was being cheated out of his inheritance and the father was bent on having a pretty young wife she knew a good thing when she saw it and if there was blame anywhere it lay at her door she was greedy not to put too fine a point on it she saw the father could give her more than the son without her stirring up the pair of them that farmer would be alive today but the courts cant take such behavior into account if they could a jury would have hanged her along with the dead mans son it was in some ways the story of the shaws a wife wanting what she couldnt have rutledge said its straightforward at least i once had an investigation that hinged on a lamp where it had actually been placed before the crime through a window the murderer had seen something in the room that triggered an explosive anger jealous anger but only because the lamps light illuminated it in that position once the lamp was moved we saw nothing out of the ordinary there was nothing to give her away dowling glanced at rutledge wheres our lamp then he asked i understand what youre saying but i cant apply it to our situation the roads rutledge answered each of the dead men had a family at home other eyes to see whatever transpired it put the men out of reach in a sense but they were always accessible along the road the question is what drew each of these victims into the killers net circumstance opportunity or trickery dowling turned his head to consider the road behind them they had nearly reached the trees where one of the victims had been discovered taylor the first it cant be theft the inspector said ticking off the possibilities on his fingers these three had little worth stealing no one stole what they did have and no one stands to gain from their deaths as far as i can tell the murders took place on different roads different nights thats a vote for opportunity not circumstance they had the war in common of course and theres jimsy ridger rutledge said if someone was looking for jimsy he wouldnt have to kill a man to ask where to find him he might kill a man he thought would warn ridger then i think its time we found out where ridger is and what he knows about this business in the event neither dowling nor rutledge had to search far for the missing jimsy ridger sergeant gibson had left a message at the plough it read in regard to the man you want hes not in london rumor has it hes dead my guess is that hes in hiding no one is prepared to say where rutledges reaction was im not surprised hamish said aye it stands to reason hed go to ground if theres someone looking for him and the man searching for ridger may be a step ahead of you he may ken that ridger is in kent yes it makes sense rutledge took the stairs two at a time and spent the next half an hour finishing his notes about the conversation with grimes in seelyham he debated driving to canterbury to look up miss whelkin and then decided against it she would be home again in a few days closing the notebook he sought out sergeant burke and asked the man to draw a rough map of marling it was nearly tea time when rutledge pulled into the drive at the home of lawrence hamilton and his wife lydia they had been his hosts when he met raleigh masters and rutledge was certain they would know as much about this part of kent as richard mayhew had done he was surprised to find that bella masters was already there she looked tired unhappy but her face brightened as lydia hamilton welcomed the newcomer and offered him a cup of tea mrs masters said after the courtesies had been observed ive come to invite lydia and her husband to dine with us tonight but they have another engagement could i persuade you to join us mr rutledge there will be only six im afraid tom brereton mrs crawford elizabeth mayhew and you but i can promise you a fine dinner and lively conversation lydias face turned away from mrs masters pleaded with rutledge to accept it was not common for a policeman to be invited to dine it was indeed a measure of mrs masterss desperation that a stranger and a lowly inspector would be acceptable at her table for his own reasons rutledge agreed ill call for elizabeth if you like he said that would be lovely lydia put in i think i hear lawrence rutledge said if you dont mind ill meet him in the hall there are a few questions id like to put to him she nodded and then a look of alarm spread over her face as if his words had touched a wellspring of concern that was swiftly hidden he thought ironically that it was the policeman she dreaded lawrence was coming down the stairs when rutledge stepped into the hall and shut the sitting room door behind him hamilton held out his hand and greeted him with a smile i hear we have another guest mrs masters ive accepted a dinner invitation in your stead rutledge answered lightly in return i need a favor i hope to heaven bellas made peace with her cook or youll be back demanding my firstborn hamilton retorted humorously leading rutledge into a small study closing the door he said in a more serious tone whats this about the murders id heard youd come down to help the local people any progress none he took the chair that hamilton indicated and looked around the room it was a studycumoffice where open law books and stacks of paper indicated an ongoing brief hamilton gestured wryly and said i cant find a reference its there somewhere but i cant put my finger on it i asked raleigh if he recalled it but he said id earn my keep if i find it on my own rutledge said he may have forgotten it himself hamilton laughed the mans memory is famous matthew sunderland taught him that early on to cultivate a good memory i sometimes think that raleigh would be pleased to discover that sunderland was his father it would be the crowning moment of his life tell me about sunderland he was one of the best men of his day toward the end there was something that wasnt noticeable early on an arrogance a certainty that he was never wrong it persuaded judges sometimes i never discovered whether this was a pretense or if sunderland actually believed strongly in his own judgment needless to say he was convincing as hell did you ever work with him the shaw case and one other before that most of my cases were not of a caliber to rate matthew sunderland kc yes well he was a watchword for years almost an assurance of conviction when he was prosecuting now tell me what is it you need from me certainly not the past history of a dead man but it had been what rutledge needed still he said i wonder if you recall someone named jimsy ridger good god jimsy was an eel convicting him of anything was impossible he never came my way of course but ive heard enough tales about him most particularly since hed spent a goodly part of his life where i lived and no one in london let me forget it he wasnt actually from our part of kent but he had a habit of popping up here at the least likely moments tell me about him not his criminal history but what you know of him hamilton got up to offer rutledge a glass of whisky and then sipping his own said ruminatively he came with the hop pickers a wild lad with no sense of fear and no one really to look out for him consequently he fell in with the wrong people or they fell in with him it was almost word for word the description that sergeant burke had given rutledge i need a picture of him as a man he said studying the amber liquid in his glass but not drinking i doubt that anyone can give you that jimsy was as charming as a snake and as quick but no one got through the charm into the person behind it he had more energy than most and had learned to skirt the law with impunity underneath the surface i always thought he was lonely no lonely isnt the word i think he paused trying to find the right explanation jimsy was one of those people who never successfully formed friendships he was too devious and too questionable in his character for most people to like him he never got close to anyone that i know of and as a result he was dangerous there were no ties you see to hold him in a way he was like matthew sunderlandodd though it might sound he walked in his own shadow and showed the world only what he thought it fit for the world to see rutledge stopped by elizabeth mayhews house to leave a message that hed be collecting her in time to drive to the masterses house for dinner she was waiting for him in the hall when he came to lift the knocker on her door later in the evening she opened it herself and said ian i could have had myself driven over you neednt have come i came because ill enjoy your company more than my own thoughts tonight she looked up at him as he closed the door behind her and ushered her down the walk to his car a fitful moon slipped in and out of the trees and a bank of thinning clouds its thin crescent cold in the november air youre tired arent you ian i wish you hadnt let bella persuade you to dine with them come to that i shouldnt have either but melinda crawford will be there and i couldnt let her down nor i he settled her into the motorcar with a rug for her knees as before and then went to crank the engine as he climbed in beside her she sighed it was as if she had had other plans that shed changed and regretted having to do so rutledge said as they went down the drive did you ever see the tarrant exhibition in london before the war there was a painting there that caused a great deal of comment the name of it was tristan richard liked it i wasnt fond of it she replied he was drawn to flying you know i thought the painting made it seem far too glamorous or to put it another way i wasnt eager to praise anything that would encourage his attraction she laughed bitterly i was afraid that flying machines would take him from me i couldnt even imagine then that war would do that and id be helpless to prevent it its not wise to love too well hamish said she didna ken what you were asking about yon portrait it was trueelizabeth had taken rutledges question at face value remembering her husband not reminded of anyone else he said as if moving on no not wise at all but richard was intrigued by the concept of flight hed told me once that he would like to see the downs as a bird could and how the weald stretched beyond the horizon we were limited to he was intrigued with maps and this was the ultimate opportunity to draw the face of the earth he once talked for hours with melinda about the project to map india i think under different circumstances hed have been among the first to volunteer he was drawn to adventure perhaps i never really had him in my heart the way i thought i did he loved you very deeply it made dreaming very safe because you were there to come home to she moved restlessly id rather not talk about richard just now he changed the subject and as they drove through the night reached a truce in whatever silent war lay between them raleigh masters greeted his guests with a chilly courtesy rutledge saw his wife glance at him several times an uneasiness in her eyes but their host was pleasant and made an effort to draw out his guests they were seated in a drawing room where the elegance was growing shabby around the edges as if there was no money to renew the drapes or the gilding in the plastered ceiling the house georgian and foursquare possessed a beautiful staircase in the entrance hall and a collection of exquisite venetian glass displayed in cabinets between the doors the light from the lamps caught the colors and gave them a depth that was jewellike whether the collection was valuable or not rutledge couldnt judge but the quality was there in shape and design bella had gestured toward the cabinets as she ushered him into the drawing room and said diffidently my fathers hobby glass my mother traveled to italy every winter for her health and in his free time my father roamed the old markets in venice searching for unexpected treasures raleigh doesnt care for italy nor for the glass rutledge thought melinda crawford looking rather tired greeted him with warmth and kissed elizabeths cheek as if delighted to see her brereton standing by the hearth shook hands with rutledge and asked quietly any progress early days yet rutledge told him it was the standard formula but even as he spoke the words hamish was reminding him how empty they were brereton said kent has always had an independent spirit my guess is that whatever people may suspect they wont point fingers rutledge was saved from answering by a query from elizabeth regarding a mutual friend in london twenty minutes later as they were finishing their sherry dinner was announced and rutledge found himself escorting mrs crawford she pinched his arm as if in warning as they followed their host and hostess through to the dining room even if this meal is inedible you must swallow every mouthful for bellas sake she hissed under her breath he smiled and said ill try but it appeared the cook was intent on making amends the roast of pork seasoned with rosemary was as delicious as any rutledge had ever eaten as the conversation flowed around him he listened to two threads that seemed to intertwine and then separate local gossip of the ordinary variety to be heard at any country dinner table in englandand an undercurrent of speculation about the newcomer from leeds who was buying one of the larger houses in marling whether he intended to live there or if it was purchased for a son or daughter whether he was the sort one would wish to meet or the sort one ignored theres money bella was saying and i hear from john sable that hes renovating the house and gardens john sable owned a small construction firm in helford brereton explained to rutledge across the table he wont come cheaply elizabeth responded id asked john about working on the drains and he sent a note quoting an exorbitant sum brereton said too bad our leeds friends not interested in the old property out on the road to seelyham the one with the stone gates shame to see it go to rack and ruin but i suppose we must wait on the lawyers to sort out who inherits bella nodded i remember going to a party there oh well before the war it was mrs mortons seventieth birthday and her husband wanted to cheer her up a bit there were lovely old pieces in that house i remember she was mourning the fact that there was no one to pass them on to only a distant relative out in new zealand i think it was influenza took both of them last year and the house has stood empty ever since therell be damp and dry rot and heaven only knows what else before its finished and wholl pay for that i ask you rutledge found himself thinking that people like the mayhews and the hamiltons and indeed the masterses with their declining income and rising prices would be hardpressed to keep their homes as once their ancestors had but the new money the war money would manage quite well the man from leeds for one has anyone actually met this man brereton asked looking around the table after a moment of silence elizabeth said tentatively i think i mayve everyone turned to stare at her and she went pink it was quite by accident and very brief she said stumbling over her words id gone to helford at the end of last month to meet someone taking the train down from london and a man was asking the stationmaster about transportation to marling he had a rather loud voice although he was dressed well enough she broke off shrugging i didnt see his face rutledge his attention caught listened to elizabeth mayhew but said nothing hamish murmured ye ken no one would think to ask the likes of mrs mayhew about strangers raleigh masters ignoring the small glass containing his medicine that stood beside his plate was finishing his fourth glass of wine instead the glitter in his eyes was the only thing that betrayed him he sat like a toad waiting hamish alert to rutledges own watchfulness growled ware as elizabeth paused glancing around the table uncertainly as if shed gone too far bella opened her mouth to speak and then closed it sharply raleigh said we are an odd lot we english we judge a man by his voice and the price of his clothes god help us if we are born brilliant but poor and have nothing to indicate the quality of our minds elizabeth said haltingly i didnt mean no of course you didnt melinda crawford interposed bracingly raleigh is simply reflecting on our propensity to judge from outward appearances a barrister would certainly not fall into that pit she was rutledge realized drawing fire on herself masters said rather nastily he wont last long if he does all the same there is something to be said for a mans upbringing it generally tells in the end as the old saw would have it you cannot make a silk purse out of a sows ear i shouldnt care to try mrs crawford retorted you would tell me then that your friendships are all of a sort that reflects well on your judgment of people i never choose my friends because they reflect well on me i choose them because theyre interesting i consider boredom far more soulcrushing than the seven deadly sins and so i have made a point throughout my life never to be bored it has i think kept me young but masters apparently wasnt to be deflected from whatever was on his mind rutledge watching him was reminded of a prosecutor waiting to pounce it was he thought a natural mannerism in a man who had spent his life judging others masterss eyes swept down the table to his wifes face and i i think shall never grow old we learn to put up with distasteful things at the end raleigh its hardly the end bella protested her voice anguished as if he didnt believe her masters swept on i know whereof i speak my dear otherwise i shouldnt be reduced to entertaining a policeman at my table people are not overly fond of watching death creep up on themselves or others but perhaps mr rutledge is accustomed to it there was a moment of stunned silence broken only by the sharp intake of breath from bella masters her face was pale with embarrassment rutledge could feel himself reddening at the insult hamish said starkly you canna quarrel with him but before rutledge could speak melinda crawford was there ahead of him raleigh she said in a voice that brooked no argument illness is not an excuse for bad manners you will apologize to all of us for your rudeness he glared at her she returned the stare with the authority of a woman who has spent a lifetime learning her own worth rutledge thought she faced down the mutineers in india masters has forgotten that after a moment raleigh said why should i apologize i ask you he comes to dine in the guise of a guest but who knows what actually brings him here policemen dont have social lives or if they do ive never heard of it and behind my back he asks questions of a derogatory nature about a man whose boots he is not fit to lick matthew sunderland was my friend and my mentor rutledge turned to look at bella masters guilt was written clearly in her appalled expression he knew instantly that elizabeth had spoken to her at his requestand she had passed the query on to her husband he replied im afraid youve misunderstood ive never spoken derogatorily about matthew sunderland i have expressed an interest in one of his cases one in which i myself was involved odd dont you think masters inquired of the table at large generally when a policeman has a question concerning a trial he goes to his superiors this means i fear that mr rutledge is afraid he had not prepared his case well enough and wants the reassurance that he is right in his assumption of guilt it was too damned close to the truth and for an instant rutledge found himself thinking that chief superintendent bowles had been in touch with raleigh masters but that was not very likely hamish was roaring in his ears telling him that masters had seen through him and he had nowhere to turn but rutledge responded with courtesy as you were not a party to the trial sir im afraid i must rely on the opinion of others before his host could frame a retort mrs crawford was on her feet raleigh you are not only rude you are very drunk she turned to the maid standing stricken behind mrs masterss chair will you summon my driver please i am leaving bella i must tell you that i will not dine with you again until your husband has apologized to me and everyone present bella her voice trembling said mrs crawfordmelinda but her husbands voice cut across hers he was standing now also something in mrs crawfords face had finally penetrated the alcoholic haze and touched him or else he had fired all the salvos hed intended ladies and gentlemen i beg forgiveness for my behavior if you will excuse me i shall retire mr rutledge you have been a gracious and pleasant guest in my home i dont know what possessed me to attack you but you must put it down to my intemperance raleigh bowed retrieved his cane and walked steadily from the room closing the door softly behind him rutledge had the feeling that he was very nearly sober bella was almost in tears i dont know what to say she began melinda crawford replied briskly its better if you say nothing there is never any defense for rudeness she signaled to the maid i think were ready for our tea if you please and i believe the gentlemen will join us in the sitting room tonight she nodded to elizabeth and brereton then said to rutledge you behaved with generosity my father would have commended you for keeping your temper but i will tell you that the man who insulted you is not the man i have known for some years now we shall put this behind us and have our tea with a sweep of her skirts she ushered the stilltrembling bella toward her own sitting room with elizabeth at her heels brereton said following them with rutledge its true he isnt the same man but that hardly changes anything rutledge still seething with anger smiled and said i am a policeman you know it must be the first opportunity he has had to break bread with one and it marks a dramatic change in his circumstances all the same brereton began and then went on i would have believed raleigh masters was guilty of murder before i would have believed what has become of him he stumbled catching his foot on the edge of the carpet in the hall and swore the loss of his eyesight rutledge realized must be worse than brereton admitted even to himself they drank their tea dutifully and kept the conversation bright and reasonably unforced when a proper length of time had passed to do so gracefully the guests took their leave and left rutledges last glimpse of bella masterss face as she closed the door herself on her departing guests caught the mask of civility slipping and a black despair behind it elizabeth said as they reached the road to marling i was never so appalled in my life raleigh has been unbearablebut never insulting dont think about it rutledge told her he will have to make amends to his wife now shell be hard pressed to find any dinner guest willing to put up with his temper i dont think its temper elizabeth responded considering it its something else i dont know death creeping up enough to make any man despair rutledge agreed but hamish was saying from the rear seat i willna believe it its no death nor the wasting something else rutledge tended to agree with him and returned to the possibility that chief superintendent bowles knew mastersit wasnt unlikelyand had dropped a hint of some sort but that didnt make sense either elizabeth was finishing a remark that hed missed ending with i shall have to invite bella to tea without raleigh to let her know im not blaming her for her husbands behavior shes never quite known how to cope with his moods you know but she adores him there isnt anything she wouldnt do for him he was reminded of what margaret shaw had said about marriagethat it seldom works out the way it ought to what is the medicine he takes in that glass laudanum i suspect it is for pain initially of course but it helps with hismoods or created them elizabeth sighed why do so many people hurt each other he had no answer to that question and in the silence that followed he remembered the conversation about the house in marling that had been sold to a wealthy merchant tell me about the man you saw at the train station in helford theres really nothing more to tell he was exceedingly well dressed you could almost smell expensive tailors but his voice was overloud and it grated new money that was my first thought describe him physically im not sure i can it was a nasty evening and he was wearing a heavy coat and a hat my guess is that he was fair she looked across at him tallish id say but not as tall as you a bit on the heavy side perhaps but with the coat it was difficult to tell he came rushing into the waiting room spoke to the stationmaster and then went out again id been standing inside out of the weather but richards motorcar was waiting by the gate he must have seen it and so i turned away for fear he might ask if i was driving in the direction of marling she smiled ruefully he seemed to be the sort who might be encroaching it was inbred in an englishmans nature this dread that someone casually met might brashly overstep the unwritten rules of acceptable behavior it was perhaps at the root of raleigh masterss abhorrence of a policeman in his house a visit to the stationmaster then tomorrow morning to follow up on this man elizabeth mayhew had seen they had reached elizabeths house and she was thanking him for driving her he saw her to her door and then turned to go she called ian he turned again yes but whatever it was she was planning to say she changed her mind it was visible in her face however much she tried to hide it perhaps we can have lunch one day while youre here brightly spoken id like that he said and watched the door close quietly before walking back to his motorcar the lobby of the plough was empty when he came through a night lamp burning by the desk and another by the stairs but when he opened the door to his room he found a sheet of paper slipped under it one of the staff had taken a telephone message for him it was from sergeant gibson in regard to the person youd inquired about he made it home from france and then ended up in the river theres a grave to prove it in maidstone so much for tracking down jimsy ridger rutledge thought as he shut his door and began to take off his coat yet someone was combing the countryside trying to run the man to earth someone without sergeant gibsons resourcessomeone who hadnt discovered the maidstone grave but why was this same person killing men you canna know its the same man doing the killing hamish reminded him thats true rutledge said answering aloud from old habit when he was alone the voice seemed so real then that he could almost hear it echoing around the walls helford was a small village with a tall spired church and a churchyard set behind a low stone wall that boasted the remains of wildflowers in the crevices a pretty sight in the spring the main street wound down a hill houses and shops spread on either side of it before curving away in the direction of marling the railway station sat on the northern outskirts as if added as an afterthought which it had been helford itself predating the train by some four hundred or more years hop gardens and farms encircled the town picturesque in the brightening morning light several very nice old houses faced the main street one of them pedimented and the other boasting an elegant bay window there had been money here and an air of gentility lingered the tudor gatehouse of a sizeable manor house lay at the bottom of the hill tall and graceful with a battlemented facade and an assortment of shields announcing the proud heritage of the family within its aged stone church lay just up the hill green lawns and halfburied tombstones visible beyond its wall after a courtesy call on inspector cawly rutledge went in search of the stationmaster the man was still at his breakfast the next train isnt due for another hour he told rutledge when hed been tracked down to a cottage not far away you can wait at the station if you like its open rutledge explained his interest in a traveler who had arrived from the coast one evening at the end of october during a rainstorm hes not a local man he was looking for transportation to marling he added the stationmaster idly stroking his graying edwardian beard stared at the floor heavy rain was it we had only one passenger on the nineforty from the south and the tenten was late by two minutes coming in from london youre asking about the nineforty then because there was a lady here to meet the passenger on the tenten ive seen her before traveling to london on occasion a lady elizabeth mayhew that would be right he was what you might call a turnip in velvet and he made a right nuisance of himself indeed after the train pulled out he came into the station and told me he needed to reach marling that night i said i doubted hed find anyone who would drive him at that hour in that weather im willing to pay whatever is asked all you have to do is send for someone send who i wanted to know i wasnt about to get wet through running errands for the likes of him he wasnt best pleased i can tell you i have to reach marling he said again as if i was deaf and finally i told him hed have to put up at the hotel for the night and in the morning have freddy butler send for one of the lads who regularly take the goods wagon over to marling well he wasnt about to arrive in marling with the chickens and cabbages he said he wanted a proper carriage the stationmaster chuckled if hed been the gentleman he thought he was id have told him the smith kept a carriage he could have in the morning he left cursing under his breath rutledge smiled did he indeed go to the hotel he didnt my guess is he was smarter than he looked and knocked on the first door he came to theyd have sent him to the smith was there anything more that you noticed about him he had blue eyes id not have remembered that but freddy butlers son john had eyes the same color like the summer sky john didnt come back from arras how would you describe him educated a londoner from the midlands and how am i to guess that hes not a kent man i can tell you i know what a kent man sounds like had you seen him before that night or after he came back this way a day or two later didnt he to take the train again and he looked like the cat that supped on cream whatever his business in marling he was that pleased about how it went cheeky bastard after some discussion with sergeant burke and a half hour of searching rutledge ran to earth the agent who was handling the sale of the house in marling that the leeds merchant allegedly had his eye on mr meade was alarmed to be faced with a policeman across his desk and a policeman from scotland yard at that for if theres anything untoward about this man the sale will not go through he fiddled with the papers on his desk fastidiously edging them with one side of the blotter before moving several envelopes in the other direction and adjusting the position of the inkwell rutledge said blandly ive no reason to believe that hes involved in any crime on the contrary im after information that will close doors not open them meade was not reassured he doesnt live in kent at leasthe will when the sale is completed i cant see how he could help you and i hope it wont be necessary to contact him it could put him off living here to find scotland yard on his doorstep about murderers loose in marling all the same rutledge persisted i need to know whatever you can tell me about him with a sigh meade said wealthy hes prepared to sign for the house and on his behalf ive already spoken with a man in helford who can begin renovations immediately as soon as the paperwork is completed and thats not allhe wants to restore the gardens the house was once noted for its gardens but thats in the spring of course when the weather rutledge said interrupting describe him if you will younger than id expected considering the fact that hes done as well as he has fair putting on the weight of prosperity id say im told he made his money up north in leeds or thereabouts meade was clearly more impressed with the mans money than anything else about him name aldrich franklin j aldrich the agent responded reluctantly the firm originally belonged to his fatherinlaw i believe mr aldrich lost his fatherinlaw and his wife to the influenza and has decided to sell up and move away why did he choose kent the better climate thats what he told me i daresay now hes made his money hed like to enjoy spending it and no doubt theres a desire to put some little distance between himself and his roots if hes looking to set up as a gentleman meade seemed to run out of virtues to extol and looked out the window at the busy street how often has aldrich traveled to kent most of our negotiations have been by letter through his bankers he came one weekend at the end of october to view the property i had described id actually offered him two or three possible choices but he seemed to be in no doubt about the kind of house he wanted it explains his success i should think knowing what he wants how did he make his fortune i haventerfelt free to ask him hes a very private person actually he did tell me once that the war had treated him well and from that i assumed hed been in manufacturing of one sort or another thats where most of the money was made aldrich wasnt the first to make a fortune from the war but even meade seemed to feel uncomfortable with that he added almost as an afterthought its no bad thing for marling to have fresh blood coming in as if in apology for his own eagerness to conclude this sale a widower of course hamish observed as rutledge finished his questions and rose to go yon aldrich will be good company for raleigh masters when theres no one left to dine wi him rutledge smothered a smile there had been no time to consider lunch and rutledge had bought a pork pie and apples at a small shop on the high street before calling on mr meade he finished the apples as he made his way back to the scenes of the killings drawn by reasons he couldnt explain the roads were quiet at this hour of the day and clouds were building to the east over the downs threatening yet more rain a cold wind had blown up as he came to the line of trees where will taylor had died and he reached for his coat as he left his car what was there about these stretches of country roads out of sight of witnesses that had invited murder rutledge had always depended on intuition on a sense of what was there beneath the surface unplumbable unless the mind was open to receive whatever swam up from the depths and into the light he had no way to describe his intuition he had never really questioned it but something was there not on commandintuition was never amenable to conscious will it simply responded in its own fashion with an unexpected knowledge he walked the length of the line of trees and tried to feel some response that would help him understand the terrible thing that had happened here but nothing came no small whisper of knowledge or breath of emotion it was as if these trees older than he was open to the wind and elements to time and space and seasons had nothing to offer him except mute witness here a man died we dont know why smiling wryly at his morbid imagination he went back to the motorcar and turned toward the other two scenes hamish always at his shoulder unseen but never mute had nothing to say his mood dark rutledge stood at the place where kenny webber had died and listened to the soft soughing of the wind in the bare trees he was standing so still that a small meadow mouse crept out of the high grass to stare at him before scurrying off to safer ground there was nothing rutledge told himself that fitted any particular theory well enough to support it but the shaw case had been much the same no clues to the killer of women who had little to steal but whose pitiful treasures had offered a poorer man hope it had been sheer accident that the police had stumbled on the name of a manofallwork who had come to help and ended up killing would it be the same thing here would these two cases seemingly so similar to a man tormented by the past end up with the wrong suspect hanged he shivered at the thought and turned back to the motorcar and hamish the practical scot whose family tree boasted feuding clansmen through centuries of bloody warfare insisted it isna the same in the light it isna the same the murders happened at night rutledge stopped in his tracks and he was walking here in the light where everything was different even on the battlefield the night had been different from the day you could see what was coming in the daylight you could prepare yourself for defense or attack at night sounds seemed to roll in from nowhere movement was hidden and stealthy a wind jangling the wire a man coughing the unexpected stirring of the ratsnerves raw and alert jumped like live things and eyes watered with trying to pierce the darkness for the first sign of anything that could kill rutledge said its true and bent to crank the motorcar his mind already busy in the country it was not uncommon for people to walk long distances there were few means of transportation as available as shanks mare and a good many of the horses kept for carriages or riding had been swallowed up by the war to die dragging heavy artillery or wagons in the mud of france work many of them were not accustomed to bicycles were a common means of getting about in the countryclerics used them police constables boys delivering groceries and housewives pedaling into the villages to market a bicycle then for a man unaccustomed to country distances and he thought he knew where to find one rutledge walked through the hotel doors and turned toward the dining room in search of a cup of tea the man behind the desk said inspector theres a letter for you it came in the morning post he turned back and the man limped around the desk to meet him halfway glancing at it he couldnt place the writing it was rounded curlicued as if the owner had been at great effort to conceal his or her normal hand going through the dining room door he tore open the envelope and unfolded the letter it had come from mrs shaw this woman he thought tiredly would haunt him like the husband hed sent to a doubtful death dear mr rutledge i am hoping you are making some progress in the matter of my husbands innocence i cannot think why you have not come to see henry cutter and look for the chain to the locket that is still lying in mrs cutters chest where i left it the locket is proof that someone besides my ben killed those women and i dont know why it is taking so long to bring the truth to light my heart is breaking with the weight of my worry and yet nothing is happening to help my family recover from this terrible burden you mustnt let us down we are counting on you to save us it is poor recompense for not being able to bring my ben back to life but it will give my children a chance to live properly when the stigma is removed from our name i do not want to die of hard work and hopelessness it must be god who rectifies the wrong done to my poor husband but you have it in your power to give something back to me and mine your trusting servant nell shaw rutledge swore under his breath she was a master at touching him on the raw she seemed to see into his soul and find the most certain way of stirring up guilt and mistrust of his own judgment she had brought her daughter with her she had come on swollen feet to hunt him down and she held over his head like the sword of damocles the knowledge that he may well have failed her and her children and yet he was beginning to see too the will that must have driven ben shaw to murder to satisfy the needs that this woman had felt were rightfully hers middleaged and far from attractive nell shaw still had a power that was intransigent and unyielding and yet henry cutter had admired her strength he read the letter again she pleaded as well as any kc he thought bitterly her abilities wasted by her station in life and her limited opportunities but was she telling the truth he didnt know nell shaw believed it and that was all that mattered to her rutledge slept for four hours rousing himself at the end of that allotted time with the internal clock that more than one soldier had taught himself to usewhen a lighted match to see the face of a watch spelled death from a waiting sniper or machinegunnerhe dressed in dark clothes and pulled a heavy black sweater over his head lacing his boots he went through a mental checklist satisfied that he was ready he descended the back stairs and slipped out to the hotel yard the night porter kept his bicycle there and from casual observation rutledge had noted that it arrived at the same time every evening departing at the same time every morning in between it was never moved availing himself of it rutledge tested the tires and the brakes and then reassured that it would serve him well enough mounted it and rode out into the quiet high street it was a little after tenthirty by the clock in the church tower as rutledge looked up at the cavalier on his plinth pleased to see that the face was shadowed by the broadbrimmed hat and the bronze was lackluster in the pale light of the stars the heavier clouds had blown through as he slept leaving behind wet roads a colder wind and clearing skies he pedaled steadily without haste a nondescript man on a nondescript bicycle head down as if tired and looking forward to home and his bed on the outskirts of marling he turned toward seelyham his eyes already accustomed to the dim light and his ears picking up the night noises the bark of a fox off in the fields an owl calling his mate from the deep shadows close to the trunk of a spreading oak the whisper of wind through the autumn grasses and the dead stalks of summer his tires made a rhythm of their own soft and sibilant never intrusive when he had reached seelyham he turned at the crossroads for helford a lone traveler with no company except his own from time to time he whistled not for his own sake but to throw off any suspicion that he was himself the elusive murderer the last thing he wanted as hamish had warned was someone mistaking him for a killer and trying to get in the first blow hamish unhappy over the heavy shadows and fading moonlight was wary as watchful as he had been leaning against the trench walls in france hed had a keen eye for movement while their best shot had stood at his side with his rifle ready to fire where his corporal pointed but there was no one here with a rifle no one to stand guard rutledge had once loved the night he had been at home in the open spaces of the downs or the dales of yorkshire or the valleys of wales like many englishmen of his time he had found walking a means of reaching outoftheway places where he was completely alone open to the sounds and smells and mysterious moods of a land inhabited over centuries stretching back in time selfsufficient and capable of protecting himself if need be he had never thought twice about the dangers or the loneliness neither superstitious nor overly fanciful he had felt safe in the dark however strange the place however far from civilized society it might lie this after all was england france had taught him a different kind of night with star shells and artillery fire and snipers and dread of the first faint glow of morning when the gas came over night didnt cloak it concealed and death lay in the blackness of a shell hole or behind the blasted trunk of a tree death came out of the night as often as it came out of the day but in the night it could break a mans nerve such memories were only just beginning to fade a little the space of a year had taken the edge off the tension and the watchfulness but had failed to put them behind him the year had given rutledge back the ability to sleep through a night and to look people in the eye without wondering what they could read in his face but hamish was still there his uncertainties were still there and unexpected shocks still threw him into the chaos of selfdoubt an awareness of the changes that had not yet come might never come hamish reminded him of the roman candles at the guy fawkes bonfire and rutledge winced at the memory it was stupid to react irrationally to fireworks and yet fear and its bloodbrother selfpreservation were so deeply buried in the very marrow of a soldiers bones for so long that they were hard to root out to start at sounds and sudden movement to act primitively and quickly was the difference between living and dying even when he had wanted so badly to die the bodyand bloody luckhad taken the choice out of his hands fear and courageand boredom the three faces of battle rutledge threw off the past and concentrated on the night but there was no one abroad not on the roads he had chosen to take he paused from time to time standing astride his bicycle and listening feeling the darkness feeling the loneliness the three men killed here were at home on these roads they knew them intimately and this familiarity was their shieldas well as their gravest peril they considered themselves to be safeand so they would be vulnerable unsuspecting a farmer passed with a sick calf in the back of his cart calling to rutledge with the cautious voice of a man who was worried about strangers on the road after three murders rutledge answered him saying far to go my sons a better cowman than i am hes willing to try his hand at saving her good luck then thankee i may have need of luck before the nights done the farmer spoke to his horse and before he was out of sight turned down a narrow lane toward the distant shapes of a barn and a house rutledge rode on already beginning to think he was on a wildgoose chase and needed good fortune himself but now he knew that whoever stopped these men had been considered by each victim to be safe with hamish carrying on a conversation in the back of his mind rutledge reached helford and then turned back toward marling the muscles in his legs were beginning to complain about the unaccustomed exercise and he ignored them this part of kent was vast enough that three roads hardly touched the sum of choices that he could have made still rutledge had passed all three murder scenes waiting for his senses to be tweaked for something in the quiet night to speak to him but there were only the foxes and owls and once a hunting cat frozen in a tense crouch as he came upon her with a twitch of her tail she had jumped into the tall grass and vanished dogs barked at his passage desultory and without ferocity as if merely doing their duty the wind had picked up cold knives cutting through his sweater a motorcar was ahead of him for a short distance turning off into a side lane that rutledge hadnt noticed before on the map it had appeared to go nowhere down to a wooded stream and up the hill beyond to a field he pedaled on staying with the main roads rather than break off from his triangular sweep in the end he came back to marling emptyhanded tonight there was nothing in the darkness that wanted to be found he would have to try again rutledge secured the night porters bicycle where he had found it and wearily made his way to the back door of the hotel it was still unlocked just as he had left it hours earlier so much for the night porters rounds the man would most likely be asleep somewhere warm and quiet rutledge was thinking too that somewhere warm and quiet would be inviting as he moved through the empty kitchens and service quarters to the door that led into the lobby letting it shut silently behind him he strode swiftly down the passage and rounded the stairs with one hand on the newel post ware hamish spoke sharply in his mind a woman coming down the steps toward rutledge her coat open in the warmth of the hotel gasped in startled disbelief at what seemed to be a dark and sinister figure hurrying toward her in the same instant rutledge recognized elizabeth mayhew and stopped stockstill in surprise at finding her here of all places and at this hour ian she said uncertainly is that you elizabeth ian you must comefor the love of god you must come i dont know what else to do she said with breathless intensity oh please she reached him where he stood at the bottom of the stairs her fingers clutching the thick dewwet knit of his sweater pleading with him her face was streaked with tears and tight with fear i didnt know what to doi knocked and knockedyou werent there i didnt know where to turn he took her hands in his holding them firmly his were cold from the night air but she didnt seem to notice elizabeth take a deep breath and tell me whats wrong there isnt timecould we go in your motorcar i ran all the way from the house i dont think i have the strength to walk back indeed she looked to be at the end of her tether rutledge led her to one of the lobby chairs but she refused to sit no we must go hes bleeding the last words came out with a sob rutledge said the motorcar is in the hotel yard this way he took her through the kitchen passages where he himself had just walked moments before and out through the small flagstoned entry that led to the back gardens and sheds she sat huddled in the car as he drove fast down the high street and he glanced at her once or twice to see if she was all right as they pulled up in the drive beside her house she was out and running before he could stop the engine swearing under his breath he followed her she came to a halt at the main door bending over something on the front steps rutledge was beside her in time to see a mans face lift up from the cradle of his arms the features twisted with pain even in the faint light of the stars the face seemed unnaturally pale the mans hair was dark with sweat and it was hard to judge its normal color who is he rutledge asked elizabeth how did he get here i had gone to lydia hamiltons for a womens committee meeting and when lawrence brought me homehe was here oh please do something did lawrence see him no no i told him i could find my own way rutledge knelt down beside the figure are you hurt tell me where elizabeth said his shoulder his chest i dont know when i tried to help him to his feet there was blood everywhere it was horrible knife the man managed to say one hand groped toward his left side rutledge pulled away the heavy cloth of the mans coat and felt the hot warmth on the sweater under it his hand came away black with blood weve got to get him inside and send for a doctor he said no the injured mans voice was firm as he spoke the single word echoed almost immediately by elizabeths breathless no nonsense rutledge responded briskly and held out his hand your key elizabeth she hesitated then she gave it to him torn between worry and what seemed to be a fear of bringing the stranger inside rutledge was already heaving the man to his feet noting with relief that he seemed to have both arms and both legs and there was no wine on his breath there was a small lamp burning in the entrance hall left for elizabeths return beyond that table was an ornate jacobean chair and rutledge got his burden lowered into it just as henrietta the spaniel began to bark ferociously from behind the closed door of the sitting room distractedly elizabeth called to the dog to hush go to her or youll have every servant in the house down here to see whats happening rutledge commanded and elizabeth hurried off calling the dogs name and shushing her the man slumped in the chair seemed to be slipping in and out of consciousness his head rolling on his shoulders rutledge working swiftly managed to get the coat off and was just lifting the sweater to rip it and clear the wound when his eyes met those of his patient he froze staring gentle god it was the face from the bonfireit was the german in the poor light of the stars with the grimace of pain distorting the mans features rutledge had failed to notice any resemblance and even as he stepped back in alarm the painfilled blue eyes stared back at him recognitionand resignationin them the man started to say something shook his head and then found the words in english a long way from france his voice was quiet pitched so that elizabeth couldnt hear him her soothing words to the spaniel had roused the puppies and they were whimpering rutledge with hamish hammering at the back of his mind asked harshly who the hell are you a dozen images pressed and overlapped and faded with such speed that he was unable to sort through them or comprehend their significance he was on a roada road filled with figures men he didnt knowthere were caissons and lorries abandoned where they stoodvoices he couldnt understandconfusion and a blank impenetrable haze dont you know ive come the man winced caught his breath and went on ive come back from the dead you dont belong here true yes i know that rutledges mind was reeling fighting shock and disbelief and then relief surfaced the realization that what hed seen on guy fawkes day two weeks before had been no hallucination no slippage of the mind into madness the man was real he was real rutledge had no idea who he wasor where he had come fromexcept out of the darkness of war and hamish was saying but hes deid you said yoursel hes deid i thought you were dead rutledge found himself repeating aloud i watched you die yes well i am hard to kill the man shivered and rutledge came back to the present staring at the warm blood on his fingers at the sweater thick with it he reached out and fumbled for an instant lifting the heavy wet wool then found his pocket knife and began to cut it away with his hands busy his mind seemed to anchor itself as if rejecting anything but the work that needed to be done he could hear elizabeth walking back down the passage her feet hurrying the man cautioned hastily we will talk about the war another time not now she came into the hall moving quickly to help rutledge pull away the last of the ripped yarn gasping at the dark wet blood all over the mans shirt rutledge cut the shirt in its turn saying to elizabeth water hot if you can manage it and cloths bandages then send someone for the doctor his voice sounded different in his ears strained and brutal she went away quickly to do his bidding but not before hed seen the glance exchanged between the german and elizabeth leave her out of this the german was saying she has nothing to do with this i will go with you to the doctor you must not bring him to this house it would cause he stopped and caught his breath again it will cause comment talk what do you call it gossip you should have thought of that before passing out on her doorstep i had very little choice i was nearer this house than wherewhere i am living now youre a german national rutledge was still trying to sort through it the man managed a smile even german nationals need aneed a roof when they travel this hurts like the very devil the knife blade had slashed down from the shoulder across another older wound that had scarred over on the mans chest deep but not dangerously so rutledge working carefully explored the wound someone didnt very much care whether they killed you or not he told the german what had you done to him to deserve this i had done nothing i was walking along the road my coat over myover my arm there was a man at the side of the road as i came closer he hobbled out and struck then he washe was gone sweat was running down the mans face his jaw set now against another wave of pain quivered with the effort to keep himself alert elizabeth came back with the water in a kettle and cloths with which to bathe the wound lying across a basin she handed them to rutledge and stood back looking close to fainting herself go find the doctor rutledge told her pouring the water into the basin and dipping a cloth into it almost too warm he thought the stove must have just been banked for the night but she stood there mesmerized unable to move rutledge cleaned up the wound as best he could unable to staunch the bleeding even with the water and pads of cloths in the end he simply packed it and wound strips of linen around it it reminded him more than he cared to admit of his own wound hardly a month healed the cook hamish was saying willna know where her tea towels have got to and rutledge saw the embroidered initials on one of the strips an absurdity in the nightmare like all nightmares he thought to himself give him something to drink whisky with a little of the hot water to dilute it he said to elizabeth and like a sleepwalker she turned away to do as he asked the german drank it down gratefully when she handed him the crystal glass and he gave it back to her with a wry smile however will you explain this to the servants tomorrow he asked glancing at the bloodied cloths and the basin full of dark red water it was as if he were trying to tell her to get rid of the evidence of his presence elizabeth starting awake from her shock said illill deal with it she bent down to lift the basin of water at rutledges feet and nearly dropped it as she looked into the bloody depths as she walked away to pour it out forgetting the kettle sitting on the floor by the chair the german said you have a motorcar i thought i heard one before you came yes its in the drive then if you will get me out of here i will tell you whatever you want to know im taking you to the local doctor and then to the police station no i think you will not do eitheither of these things once youonce you have heard what i have to tell you he tried to stand to pull his coat over his bare shoulders but the effort was too much he sank back in the chair saying ruefully i think you must help me again i dont quite seem to knowto know where my feet are elizabeth came back picked up the bloody towels and strips of clothing with distaste and carried them away with the kettle she said returning i put the cloths in the stove its an awful smell but theyll burn she looked up at rutledge expectantly as if waiting for him to solve all their problems hamish said she wants him to go but she isna happy with his going indeed she seemed to be torn her hands gripping each other tightly the knuckles white as the silence in the hall lengthened rutledge said peremptorily elizabeth go to bed ill see to him you look as if youll fall down any minute hes not dying theres nothing more you can do he needs better medical care than this he gestured to the rough bandaging rousing herself with an effort she said angrily just because youre a policeman and then she stopped thoroughly ashamed its because im a policeman that im telling you to go to bed he answered without heat leave this to me he will live and ill see to him she stared at him for an instant longer and then without looking at the german walked to the staircase it was with some difficulty that rutledge got the wounded man out of the mayhew house and into the motorcar afterward he walked back through the open door and looked around the room there was no sign that they had been there neither blood nor bits of cloth nor shifted furniture he went out again shutting the door firmly behind him the man in the passenger seat was slumped to one side as if trying to cushion the torn muscles of his shoulder hamish was asking where does your duty lie then ye canna protect the lass from this folly it was true throw the german into a police cell and by morning elizabeth would be pounding on the door demanding to see him folly indeed shes no the only person who has seen him hamish reminded him he canna go free there was the webber child for one and certainly miss whelkin in seelyham who had described tristan and the drunk on the road holcomb would he be able to identify this man witnesses indeed and even though they had failed to place the accent the german strove to conceal they were all certain that he was not a kent man they wouldna know him for a german he speaks verra well rutledge cranked the motor and got in thinking rapidly the wound was clean enough and bandaged well enough despite the simple field dressing hed applied to stop the worst of the bleeding there was timetime to decide whether he carried this man to the doctor or directly to the police station leaving it to dowling to summon the doctor hamish was muttering behind himloudly enough or so it seemed to be heard by all but the very deaf i cant deal with it now he silently responded leave it he pulled out of the driveway and drove back into the center of marling stopping his vehicle under the gaze of the cavalier beneath the broad brim the eyes seemed to bore into rutledges as if judging him rutledge looked away and took the car out of gear setting the brake he turned to consider his companion as if sensing his attention the other man struggled back to alertness i know who you are rutledge spoke with more confidence than he felt youre a german officer that much has come back to me i dont know why you should be in britain much less here in kent i dont know why a man should stab you without provocation if im to decide what to do with you i need the truth the man said nothing and in the lengthening silence under the barrage of hamishs complaint rutledge was thrown back to another timeanother place there had been speculation since the beginning of the month the first of november a year ago now the allies had made great stridesthe germans were in disarrayberlin had been taken over by a revolutionary councilthe kaiser was to lead his troops out of france to restore order at homethere was widespread famine in germanynegotiations for a truce had begunbroken downit was impossible to separate truth from rumor the only certainty was that the fighting and dying hadnt stopped and then on november word came down just after nine in the morning that a document had finally been signed and an armistice would go into effect at the eleventh hour of that day not a victory a truce to end the stalemate the news had left rutledge in emotional turmoil torn between an unspeakable relief for his men and an overwhelming weight of guilt for failing so many of themthe thousands who hadnt lived to see this dayhe moved in a fog of mental exhaustion faces living and dead seemed to crowd his mind and the wording of the kind letters hed written to parents of men he hardly knew killed before they had had a chance to serve as more than cannon fodder seemed to float in his brain for more than two years hed seen himself as a dead man like them it was only a matter of time before he joined them and now the war was ending while he was still alive as watches moved slowly toward the appointed hour the fighting never faltered and thenwithout fanfare or flourishit ended men were standing in the trenches half dazed by the silence uncertain at first some openly weeping exhausted weary beyond the ability of sleep to renew their spirit they were wary of celebration lest it lead to another disappointment another grief numbed and unprepared they had nothing to say then one or two men climbed warily over the top for the last time moving to stand by the first rolls of wire staring across the devastated landscape that was once the rolling green farmland of northern france before tons of shells and thousands upon thousands of bodies had been ground into the earth by the madness of war men began to touch each other began to laugh with nervous humor began to acknowledge that they were alive that they had survivedand then looked around as if half expecting to find the shades of the dead staring sadly back at them soldiers came to wring rutledges hand and thank him for bringing them through others were hugging each other in a rising euphoria and then stopping as if not knowing what they should rightfully be doing ashamed of feeling at all a few germans had come out of their trenches staring at the english lines their faces grim their shoulders slumped with despair and relief someone called across no mans land someone responded in the other lines and then it was quiet for a time as if men who had fought so long and so hard had nothing else to do with their lives and felt the emptiness of nothing behind them nothing ahead of them rutledge began to issue orders parroting the instructions hed been given a single voice pitched to normal levels sounded strange without the backdrop of battle or the silence of anxious waiting one by one his men turned to listen to him these soldiers who would if the war had gone on for another week another month have died soon and by his handled out to fight and suffer while he himself survivedwere finally going home war was suffering for the wounded for the survivors for their families at home for the bledout land around them and the dead horses and stark blasted trees that bore no resemblance to anything living as he spoke it began slowly to dawn on him that he too was going to survive after all he would not die it was such a horrific realization that he couldnt cope with it his mind went blank and even the voice of hamish macleod his constant and unrelenting companion since the summer of was stilled he had no memory of what happened after that where he had gone what he had done how he had managed to simply walk away this man bleeding in his motorcar long after the war had finished knew more than he did dr fleming at the clinic must have known a little about the blank days from official reports there had been compassion in the doctors eyes and it had hurt rutledge more than the truth might have done but fleming had refused to tell him it was the doctor felt far safer for his patient to come to it naturally the german was watching him i saw you at that ridiculous bonfire and again on the road when you tried to run me down as a matter of interest why did you leave me back there in france i was still alive rutledge said holding on to reality with a grip that was iron i dont remember the end of the war i dont remember youor yes i do a little but only since the bonfire you dont remember anything about ending up deep behind our lines what the devil were you doing there we looked up and there you were standing within feet of us terrified us we thought at first you were a dead mansome apparition out of hell someone spoke to you rutledge closed his eyes and in the blackness there like a flickering scrap of film he found images he had been walkinghe had no idea where he was going or why and eventually hed come to a road for there were men all around him and voices buffeting him making no sense he had stood there waiting to be shot waiting for oblivion the german beside him was saying something but rutledge couldnt shut out the images now all he had wanted was for the pain to end for the blessed release of a single shot instead some half a dozen soldiers had turned toward him a montage of faces with moving lips defeated tired eyes and the filth of the trenches filling the cold november air one of the germans had stepped forward staring hard at rutledge then mimicking reaching for a cigarette to offer him and then he took his hand back again with a shrug when rutledge made no move to accept it he didnt want a cigarettehe wanted to be shot an officer came then looking closely at his irregular visitor and then he was saying something to his men the two of them were walking side by side away from the rest rutledge thought he doesnt want to shoot me in front of them and was content there were so many soldiers at first and then the road seemed empty and darkness was coming down not the darkness in his mind but the early dusk of november he found himself wondering if this was still the eleventh and where the officer was taking him one body lying along the road here would be anonymous forgotten his sister would probably never know what had become of him just as wellit would spare her the shame he lost track of time he couldnt be sure whether hed been following the german for a few minutes or for far longer the only anxiety he felt was whether the man would lose his nerve and not shoot there was some sort of exchangefurious and loudvoiced unexpected jarring and as rutledge struggled to make sense of it there was a shot at close range in the split second after the report as the echo faded rutledge gratefully waited for the pain for the spreading agony and for the death that would end it but it didnt come there was nothing he turned toward the german officer confused unable to understand how the man had missedand watched the german fall in slow motion to the ground a dark red bloom opening on his tunic no he had shouted the single word in disbelief somehow they had shot the wrong man and then with the swiftness of habit he was on his knees ripping open the buttons fumbling in his pocket for a dressing stuffing it into the bubbling wound but before he could staunch the bleeding the german officer sighed and went limp rutledge became aware that there was someone standing over them rutledge looked up seeing him clearly for the first time a refugeean old man i need dressingsa doctor un medicinvite il est mort the frenchman said contemptuously bien sur and then in rough english one less boche rutledge looked down and saw that there was a pistol in the old mans hand still pointed at the germans throat you should be glad englishman they killed enough of you they killed my wife and my child in the bombardment these bastards rutledge staggered to his feet his mind suddenly clear and fury wracking him the frenchman shrugged they nearly took paris that time i said id get even god has been good he has offered me many chances the venom in his voice was as shocking as what hed just done the german hadnt even had time to draw his luger in selfdefense he spat on the still body stooped his hair a straggling gray under an old beret a twisted foot with hatred burning in his eyes and the madness of revenge burning in his soul he looked a last time at his victim then he walked on as gnarled fingers began to reload the pistol stroking it like a mother fussing over her child rutledge found his own pistol and raised it to bring the man downand then held his fire there had been enough killing enough enough he tried to revive the german and when that failed he walked on ithought you were dead rutledge told the wounded man i watched you die he had said the words beforethis time he understood them i lost consciousness from the collapsed lung thank god someone else came that way and got me to hospital did you kill that old fool he was insane hed lost his family rutledge said tiredly you were there and he shot you because you were wearing a german uniform he didnt add the final irony that the old mans family had died forty years before in another war it didnt signify anyway the german sighed and what the hell were you doing coming through the german lines like a sleepwalker scared the hell out of us was it a head wound ive never seen such agony in one mans face you just stood there as if you wanted to be shot and put out of your misery i did rutledge said after that shooting he must have walked until he was too exhausted to carry on he never knew for certain where or when hed been stopped someone had given him strong coffee and let him sleep and soon after he must have been turned over to a doctor and a pair of nursing sisters he remembered the bitter odor of disinfectant on their clothes as they took him in charge a silent grayfaced officer with no visible wounds and no way of communicating he was shipped to england finally a tag pinned to his coat giving rank and name and destination like so much baggage he knew hed crossed the channelthe smell of the vomit of seasick men filled the compartment after that nothing a man with no memory save for a voice in his head that no one else could hear and nowhere to go that wasnt another living hell a man who was already dead and had not found a way to die until one doctor found by his distraught sister had unlocked the silence and made him feel again it was the one thing he had prayed would never happen he had not wanted to go home trying to clear his head to concentrate on the present and leave the past rutledge reached across the motorcar and examined the bandaging on the germans chest youre bleeding again which is it to be the doctor or the police im too tired to care i dont want either i want to get out of marling and back where i belong he stopped as if hed said too much where do you belong rutledge asked the cold night air was beginning to smell of dawn he wondered how many people looking out their windows had seen the odd sight of a london policeman and a wounded german exsoldier sitting together in a motorcar in the middle of the square for all the world like old friends i belong in germany damn it but theres nothing there no food no work no hope i came here using a cousins papersgunter manthy is dutch but through our mothers a friesian like mebecause i was looking for something stolen from me during the war it happened he stopped swallowing the pain it happened when i was briefly taken prisoner by a unit from kent the things valuable at least to my family it is i shouldnt have carried it with me when i went to fight but it had belonged to every soldier in my family since the time of frederick the great it was a talisman to bring me home safely if i can find it i shall have to sell it i have nothing else of valueexcept a farm which no one can afford to buy and that no one will work with me unless i can pay them the money will take meme and my childrento chile or argentina away from germany i must find it i cant go home emptyhanded you dont know what it is like there now and thats why youve been killing these exsoldiers because they didnt have it or wont tell you who does how many more have died that we know nothing about he thought how shall i tell elizabeth i havent killed anybody damn it the german retorted wearily but whowhoever it was nearly got me killed tonight i tell you he was stabbing me before i could even throw up an arm to stop him it was worse than the warin the war you knew to be on your guard rutledge rubbed his eyes they felt as if sand had scoured them dont lie to me ive proof that youve been searching for jimsy ridger the german stared at him who told you that rutledge waited after a moment the german said yes all right his name was given me when i protested to an officer as we arrived behind your lines ask for jimsy ridger tell him its an order hes to give it back but ridger had returned to the trenches and no one could tell me how to find him there what did he take from you a small silver traveling cup very beautifully chased and thethe story told in my family is this since the friedrichtasse came into our possession weve survived every war weve fought in i wanted very much to come home again and i foolishly carried it with me how valuable is it in pounds i cant tell you i was hoping i might sell it to a museum or to the treasury in the church at oldenburg i dont know but to the highest bidder certainly he let his head fall back on the seat im hurting like hell what are you going to do with me i cant sit here any longer rutledge took a deep breath there are witnesses a woman in seelyham yes in the churchyard a busybody i left there as soon as she was out of sight a child yes yes he was very nice i did him no harm but he believes he saw his fathers killer his father was dead before i could find and speak with him and a drunken exsoldier you stopped on the road he told me a lie but i suppose id have done the same in his shoes its evidence enough given a good prosecution to see you hanged but there was another agenda besides hanging and rutledge had come face to face with it where are you living if i tell you was the wry retort youll have grounds to take me in charge anyway i havent rejected the idea with mrs mayhew god no in an empty house out on the marling road close by where the first soldier was killed i told you it was grounds rutledge put the engine in gear i want to see for myself theres not much to see except in the kitchen where i have made a bed for myself im not a vandal i needed a safe haven and i cant afford to pay for it is that why youre courting elizabeth mayhew the german moved too quickly and swore furiously i am not going to hurt her but she has been kind and i didnt know where else to turn tonight im not going to hurt her how many men had said thatand then had done it anyway hamish insisted i canna believe a word hes told you youve already hurt her rutledge replied as he turned the motorcar shes vulnerable and she thinks shes in love is there a wife back in germany she died when my son was born i have not made love to mrs mayhew no but you didnt need to shes already compromising herself for your sake if you dont find this cup of yours will you convince her to marry you and use her money instead i tell you i have not hurt her i canti wont ive comebelieve me or not as you choose but i swear she will come to no harm through me the damage rutledge thought had been done small wonder that elizabeth mayhew had never had the courage to tell him where her heart lay it was along the marling road near a burnedout oast house that the german roused himself and said just there i was stabbed there he pointed clumsily with his good arm see for yourself there is no body lying aboutnot even mine rutledge stopped the motorcar and got out to examine the road in the light of his headlamps but there was not much to see several scuff marks but no blood hamish commented the sweater would have soaked first which was true enough rutledge walked along the verge on either side of the road finding himself a sturdy stick with which he could probe the tall grasses and bushes laying them aside to look beyond them if a body had been left here it was gone now or had crept away he got back into the motorcar and the german demanded did you see ill come back at first light theres nothing now neither your blood nor anyone elses the german grunted then you must be blind he accused or else determined not to see rutledge made no comment driving on into the night i dont know your name rutledge told the man beside him as the motorcar turned down the dark and rutted drive that led between the stone posts and up to the empty house the dry grass thrashing against the coachwork hauser gunter hauser the german said rousing himself again if there is whisky in that house i shall drain the bottle he directed rutledge around to the rear of the house where a yard door had been pried open then held closed again with a bit of wire for a manor house this one was smalla country squires home rather than a grand estatewith gardens along the south front and outbuildings in a courtyard formed by the stables on the west there was an air of solidity about the house and at the same time a forlornness as if the last owners had not foreseen the straits to which it had come waiting for the lawyers to settle the familys affairs and find a relative who had probably never seen nor ever wanted the responsibility for the family dwelling the gardens standing out in the headlamps as rutledge turned the car were overgrown with a summers weeds their outline no longer sharp and clear nature had already begun her efforts to reshape the manicured paths between the beds and grass lifted seed heads like small rockets in the darkness the paint on the outbuildings had begun to flake and peel giving a scabrous look to the walls where the headlamps spread them with light a window high in the stable had blown in from a windstorm and the air of decay all around the yard seemed to promise a dreary interior with some difficulty rutledge managed to get the german into the stoneflagged kitchen and after the man had lit a lamp on the table deposited him in the nearest chair hausers face was gray with pain and exhaustion rutledge himself felt like falling asleep where he stood instead he walked along the passage toward the formal rooms of the house the stairs ran up into blackness beside him as he reached the main hall paintings or mirrors carefully shrouded and secretive climbed the wall beside the steps dust sheets covered the furniture like shadowy ghosts looming out of the darkness without sufficient definition to betray what was beneath them here he thought in the drawing room must be a piano and over there a square table and a cabinet or a chair here he lifted that sheet to look under it and found a drinks cabinet with cutglass decanters still half full taking up a pair of them he walked back to the kitchen he found hauser leaning on his good arm lips tight against the pain here rutledge set the decanters on the table beside him and crossed to the cabinets to find something to put the whisky in in for a penny in for a pound i dont suppose anyone will care anyway if we drink all of it the dishes had been packed away settling for two clean jam jars he came back and poured a stiff drink in one of them a smaller amount in the other adding water from a metal pitcher he pushed the full glass toward the german the man drank shuddering thank you i should have seen that doctor after all but there would have been too many questions rutledge was silent so after a moment the man said what is it you want with me theres something or you would have handed me over to the local police the blue eyes narrowed with effort studied rutledge intently unwilling to be led too far too soon rutledge said thoughtfully theres enough evidence to hang you you know that we havent found any other explanation for these murders witnesses motive opportunity only what points to you i havent come here to kill englishmen i was sick of that long before the war ended there may be good wine left in the cellars of this house did you use it to trick your victims theres your weapon he watched the face before him with interest a good kc could bring a conviction suddenly he could see an image of raleigh masters in a courtroom using his voice and his dry wit to shape the thinking of a jury you cant kill men with wine the germans voice was bitter no but you can with laudanum i have no laudanum youre resourceful youd find it if you wanted it a few drops in the glass to start with and then more in the second glass the victim would be drowsy by then and not realize how dangerously close to disaster he was especially if hes already taking the medication for pain did you bring them here and kill them rutledge looked around the kitchen with the bedclothes heaped in one corner nearest the stove you could drag them out and find some means of carrying them off a bicycle a horse borrowed in the night a handcart leaving them beside the road where someone would discover them sooner or later the german said appreciatively its a clever picture youve drawn a jury would no doubt believe it as a matter of interesthaving left me for dead oncewould it sit well with your conscience if i was hanged rutledge flinched no and then as if the words were drawn out of him against his will he said where did you find me when the war had ended he tried to keep his voice steady he failed hauser looked at him you really dont know no if i had a map i could probably show you one of my men asked you if you had any english cigarettes we had none and no beer either but you merely stood there damnedest thing id ever seen and you dont remember very little what was it a head injury we couldnt see a wound and nobody wanted to touch you to try to take your cap off something like that rutledge agreed the tension in his body almost choked off his breath hauser nodded thats the conclusion we came to someone said youd better get him back to his own lines but no one volunteered we didnt care in a way the war was over for us and we didnt care about much to be honest and yet you took me back i took you as far as i could too far as it happened i stopped a frenchman an old man to ask if hed guide you back to the english lines he gaped at me as if he didnt understand me my french is fairly goodaccented but good instead he pulled an ancient pistol from his pocket and shot me the astonishment of it was still in his voice i saw you kneel and start to do something with a dressing and then everything went black i thought hed probably kill you as well but when i asked the men whod found me they said there wasnt another body just mine i decided youd simply walked away and never looked back rutledge drew a harsh breath i dont know what happened after that i suppose someone thought at first i was a released prisoner laterback in englandsomeone came to visit me in hospital out of curiosity i expect or the doctors may have sent for him but i couldnt make sense of what he was saying and the nursing sister came and took him away he cleared his throat he couldnt tell this man dressed in ordinary civilian clothes and a long way from the front how badly shellshocked hed been how confused those months in hospital had been head wounds hauser was saying they do strange things he made as if to shrug it off as if it were too far in the past to matter anyway the question now is what are you to do with me he swallowed the rest of his whisky at a gulp set down the jam jar and waited his eyes fixed on rutledges face rutledge got to his feet one of his leg muscles cramping and lifted the dressing on hausers chest the blood had stopped running and was beginning to make dark clots along the edge of the wound he thought it must be painful for the man to breathe hamish said reversing fields if ye take him to the police theyll clap him in irons and close the case silently arguing rutledge said hes probably guilty aye but first ye find the one that did the wounding and why aloud rutledge answered the question hauser had asked i could take you in let them charge you and come to the hanging or i could leave you here until ive looked into your story i dont think youre up to walking far hauser gave a grunting laugh not tonight i wont promise tomorrow rutledge turned and examined the cupboards the german had brought in tins bread a sausage and a bowl of apples there was cheese wrapped in a cloth and the pitcher for water watching him hauser said i couldnt risk a fire smoke rising from the chimney would have attracted attention ive bathed and shaved in cold water no different from life in the trenches when you think about it although we were a damned sight more comfortable in ours than you were in yours which was true ill leave the decanters here for the pain not to give you dutch courage for an escape does mrs mayhew know where you are living is she likely to come here searching for you outraged hauser swore mein gott nein no he struggled to get to his feet and failed she and i have met yes but she knows nothing about me i have dutch papers she came into the church in marling where i was trying to stay warm out of the wind she thought i was praying we talked about the greenery she was bringing for the service that wednesday evening id seen something much like it in the gardens around this house so i thought she might have come here i was worried but she had found them on her own property then we talked about the flatness of holland and the tulips i met her again on the train to london quite by accident we talked about the war and books whatever we could think of we have only talked but for a lonely woman rutledge thought companionship was precious and a meeting of minds was but a steppingstone to wishful thinking he left then still unsure how far he could trust the german and drove back through the gates toward marling tired to the bone he ignored hamish and concentrated on the road dairy cows were making their way to pasture streaming across just ahead of him forcing him to stop and wait there was no one with them but the cow at their head knew her way as well as any farmer plodding with empty udders they ignored him except for one young heifer who stared with dark and friendly eyes as if the motorcar was a curiosity had he made the right decision about hauser dawn had broken as rutledge drove into marling he felt grubby his beard rasping against the sweater under his chin leaving the motorcar in its accustomed place behind the hotel he went in through the yard door and up to his room the bed was inviting the room cool enough for sleep but he shaved and bathed then dressed for the day noting that there was blood on the cuffs of the shirt hed taken off he washed it out himself and left it to dry by the window breakfast was a hurried affair a mere restoking of the fires of energy and a second cup of tea gave him a second wind when rutledge walked into the police station afterward sergeant burke said affably mrs mayhew was here asking for you alert rutledge said and what did she want with me something about urgently needing to find you she looked as if she hadnt slept anything wrong burke was too sharp to be put off with excuses rutledge said she had an alarm in the night tell me who might be walking down the marling road late besides a killer scratching his jaw thoughtfully burke answered well now theres not so much traffic as once there was people being wary eager to be home as fast as they can the gentry in motorcars and carriages dont mind as much when rutledge didnt respond he added its hard to say sir without an hour to judge by after midnight lord love you sir theres not much likelihood of anybody being on the road then not with three dead already hamish said aye it may be the killing has stopped for that reason rutledge responded silently or someone has discovered that jimsy ridger is dead to burke he said if you hear any news of trouble get in touch with me as soon as you can that i will sir but theres no report so far burke answered doubtfully hamish agreed aye wholl tell the police he stabbed a man even out of fear for his own life elizabeth mayhew was in her sitting room her eyes red with lack of sleep and tears where is he she got up from the comfortable chair by the fire looking forlorn and far younger than her years safe for the moment rutledge had sat in this room with richard and elizabeth many times the bookshelves the hearth the table where theyd taken their tea when there were no guestsit was all sadly familiar the carpet was worn in one corner where long before the war one of the young dogs had chewed at it there was a photograph on the east wall that he himself had taken of the house and elizabeth had framed familiar i thought you might have turned she stopped is he at dr pughs surgery i couldnt think of an excuse to call there hes not at the surgery nor is he in a cell at the police station you shouldnt concern yourself with this man she flushed with anger i havent concerned myself with this man but before she could rashly commit herself to something she would regret rutledge interrupted brusquely hes safe elizabeth for the time being i havent decided what to do about him but you should understand that hes a suspect nonsense hes staying in a hotel in rochester theyll vouch for him there and tell you hes a respected dutch citizen here on personal business is that what hes told you she began to pace the floor rutledge silently remained on his feet as well elizabeth turned on him youre trying to make me believe that such a man could be guilty of murder i wont listen if you turn him in to inspector dowling i shall swear that he was with me when the murders occurred it was like an obsession her blindness she believed in this man she thought was dutch and she would place her own reputation in jeopardy to protect him you cant i was here the night the last man was killed rutledge stood there watching her thinking that he didnt have the kind of experience to cope with this he considered lydia hamilton and rejected that idea lydia was a friend of the mayhews yes but she would come to see elizabeth in a vastly different light if she knew what was happeningand it would stand as a barrier between the two women after elizabeth had come to her senses his sister frances then but she too was a friend and elizabeth would find it even harder to face her because frances had been very fond of richard melinda crawford he couldnt bring himself to worry her hamish warned it isna wise to interfere id like to see him elizabeth said flushed and this safe place youve found for him id like to go there now putting his own friendship with richards wife on the lineand realizing with a bitter sense of loss what he risked in doing thisrutledge said firmly no not now not later ive told you hes a suspect in these local murders and until hes cleareduntil i can clear him of suspicion you cannot openly befriend him it would ruin you i dont care about ruin i do care about this man it had been put into words her infatuation they stared at each other and fear crept unbidden into her eyes ian he shook his head ive had no sleep he said more curtly than he intended and youve had very little yourself im leaving before one of us says something we cant take back walking out the sittingroom door without waiting for an answer he saw her face before he could take his eyes away from hers and read in them her determination to search on her own for gunter hauser rutledge went back to the vicinity of the burnedout oast house to look for signs but even in the pale sunlight he could see nothing that either supported or refuted the germans story looking around he saw that it was an ideal spot for an ambush another of those empty stretches of open land he himself had passed here on the night porters bicycle a good hour before the attack hamish said he could be lying but if there wasnt an attack herewho had slashed the germans chest with a knife and where fatigue was catching up with him as he drove back into marling the road seemed to dance in the watery sunlight and the trees flickered like a fan as he swerved to miss what he thought was someone in the high grass along the verge only to realize it was the shadow of his own motorcar passing with him he knew rest was essential he stopped for petrol then carried on to the hotel and allowed himself two hours of restless sleep and he was on the road again turning between the stone pillars and down the overgrown drive to pull up outside the kitchen door the house in the midday light was a richly shaded brick with stone forming the portico and steps and facing the front windows a family home made for light and laughter and children not for pretensions and grand aspirations a quiet residence set in the countryside and surrounded by its fields and pastures and woodland shielded from the road by old trees and great banks of rhododendron that were now sadly in need of trimming crows flew up from the chimney as rutledge got out of the motorcar and stood looking around him this was the england he had fought for and it was already dying the crows might as well be vultures shaking off his somber mood he walked briskly toward the kitchen door knocking once before opening it hamish called ware but there was nothing to be wary of gunter hauser far from a threat was lying on the makeshift bed deeply asleep and snoring like a drunk before rutledge could step forward and shake him awake the man came out of his sleep with the abruptness of a soldier instantly cognizant of where he was and that danger was approaching and definitely not drunk opening those blue eyes he fixed rutledge with a feverish stare and said you is it rutledge came in and took off his outer coat you look like the very devil yes well i feel like it i couldnt sleep for hours when i finally did it was like the sleep of the dead forcing himself to sit up he regarded rutledge quizzically am i to be taken into custody not yet im taking you to the doctor in marling first over my dead body sit down it hurts my shoulder to look up at you rutledge pulled out a chair from the table and sat after a moment he chose his opening gambit youre the best suspect i have id earn a commendation for solving these murders so quickly you must see that youre here in england under false pretenses and thats only the first strike against you whats more theres business in london that needs my attention he kept his voice level and his eyes hard it would not be to your glory to find out in a courtroom that you were very wrong as a matter of interest have you ever hanged an innocent man it was too close to the mark rutledge looked away before he could stop himself so there was a pause and then gunter hauser asked it was a shocking experience for mrs mayhew finding me bleeding all over her steps has she recovered i expect shes out searching for you with a first stop at the hotel in rochester where shes certain you are staying it was hausers turn to look away so she will quickly be disillusioned lies have a way of coming home to roost like the crows on the roof which should have awakened me and didnt is there any more of that whisky id prefer schnapps but beggars arent choosers it wont settle well on an empty stomach rutledge got up taking out the bread and the sausage cutting off a chunk adding a slice of cheese to make a sandwich for hauser then he went out to the motorcar and brought in the thermos of hot tea hed asked the hotel to put up for him hauser eyed it with interest but laughed when rutledge poured it and he saw it was tea how the english can drink tea is beyond a europeans imagination but it is hot and just now i am grateful rutledge laced the tea with a little whisky and passed it to hauser teadrinking englishmen defeated your armies if you remember no it was the americans did that we couldnt fight all of you what do they drink the yanks bourbon i expect rutledge answered and was silent while hauser got down the food and most of the tea seeming to be a little stronger after that the german said you dont know what to do with me im a problem like a dead horse the truth is rutledge told him i have you just where i want you for the moment we cant seem to lay hands on the man who stabbed you is he up the stairs under one of the sheetshrouded beds hauser laughed see for yourself no one will stop you the outbuildings then the laughter faded i have killed no one i was the one who was assaulted if you remember describe him then this man hauser frowned he was perhaps my height and there was something wrong with the way he walkedi overtook him easily or perhaps he was intoxicated rutledge considered the drunk he himself had brought in had holcomb armed himself with a knife since then hauser was saying at any rate i was soon catching him up he crossed the road then and i expected to pass by on my side with no more than a nod did he speak to you no when i was even with him he came at me with the knife i didnt see it in his hand at first he was on me and the knife was already cutting my chest ive told you this already the frown deepened what is it i dont know i would have said he was not a common laborer on his way home hethere was something in the way he moved i dont know where did he go after he stabbed you i have no idea he was thereand he was gone on foot i was too busy just then to care hauser finished the tea and then setting the cup aside he said ive been wounded before i know the drill yes hamish was stirring in the back of rutledges mind hauser said what is it that haunts you i ask because whatever it was it nearly got me killed in france and it could very well get me killed here rutledge stood up searching in the cupboards for a pitcher will you be able to manage for a few more hours ill draw some water for you and set the tins of food on the table with the bread and whats left of the sausage where you can reach them thats very kind of you still watching rutledge hauser said is it because i know about france that youre afraid to take me to the local police ive had some time to think about this matter you see its either that or youre worried about mrs mayhews reputation or perhaps rutledge said walking toward the door having killed one innocent man ive found it the easiest way to do my business like a tiger thats tasted the meat of a human being ive learned to like it hauser waited until rutledge was about to close the door then said i had nightmares long before the war was finished i saw the dead come back for me and my weapon jammed and i realized that i couldnt stop them anyway they were already dead i woke up screaming i lied and said that i hated rats running across my legs i dont know whether my men believed me or not i suppose the blood of heroes had run thin by my generation i was not the stuff of soldiers i was a farmer like the man who must have built this house i understand him far better than i understand generals it was in a way a confession but rutledge couldnt in turn bring out the shadows that tormented him he couldnt speak of hamish and the somme or that blind and terrible walk through the german lines shutting the door behind him he could still hear the voice of the man in the kitchen you will not heal until you face your nightmares a priest told me that and he was right rutledge found the pump and brought the filled pitcher back to the kitchen setting it on the table not all demons can be exorcised he told hauser no i do not envy you my friend rutledge ignored the germans parting shot rutledge spent half an hour making a concentrated search of the outbuildings blotting out his fatigue and the emotional upheaval that was the aftermath of reliving his own disgrace he felt clearly the numbness of a year ago as if in bringing it into the open he had released the pentup mass of it into the present what did it matter he thought wearily ive failed so often what does it matter there was work to be done and he could do that try to do that until someone found out how hollow he was and replaced him and ben shaw hamish asked quietly i dont know god i wish i did there was nothing unexpected hidden in the sheds and stables for that matter rutledge would have been surprised to stumble over a bodyhauser was cleverer than thatbut thoroughness was never wasted and yon german knows verra well what yere doing out here it was part of the game but there was one interesting find after all in the carriage house rutledge came across a motorcar with worn tiresand a small amount of petrol in the tank there was no way to tell how recently it had been run a brief examination told him that it could still run hamish reminded him the grass wasna beaten down on the drive until you came here he was on foot when witnesses saw him and the townspeople in marling would recognize the mortons motorcar if hauser drove it there ill ask meade if theres another way in here still its interesting isnt it you could move a body verra well in a motorcar at night or offer a tired man a lift driving back to marling rutledge gave some thought to what to do about the german he couldnt ignore the fact that he was aiding and abetting a fugitive whatever reasons he might summon to explain it away hauser was an educated clever man he had been a german officer and rutledge was well aware that he himself was vulnerable to the mans manipulation of whatever had happened in france he still wasnt sure he had the whole truth of itor whether hauser had simply used the bits of memory rutledge did possess to cast himself in a heros role hamish had his own view its the deid on your conscience that torment you no the german you havena made peace wi the ghosts i killed them i counted the dead that unspeakably long night before you were shot someone ought to have put me up before a firing squadfor murder they were hardly more than boyswhen they lay wounded or dying they called for their mothers it was slaughter and i couldnt tell them no hamish answered tiredly it was better to die believing they were no wasting their lives it was better for their families to feel it wasna in vain the cruelty was knowing as you and i did its the reason you willna face the shaw casehe was defeated and died a broken man and you see yourself in him rutledge said you werent there you dont know i wasna there hamish agreed but jimsy ridger is deid and if yon german didna kill him he still could ha killed the ithers in the end rutledge went to the police station and sought out inspector dowling without preamble he said id like to pose a theoretical question theoretical is it dowling asked regarding his counterpart from london with curiosity rutledge took the chair across from dowlings desk if you were on the roads outside marling last night and someone attacked you would you report it dowling frowned most people would i think were there theoretical wounds lets assume there were well then the doctor would be your first thought after that its out of your hands isnt it the doctor will be reporting to the police anyway and what about the attacker what would he do go home and pretend nothing has happened as he may have done three times before what if he isnt the killer were after what if he attacked out of what he saw as selfdefensea terrified man striking first for fear of becoming victim number four in the dark our theoretical man might have seemed threatening or appeared to be deliberately following him an honest mistake as it were hed still go to ground dowling rubbed his chin to tell you the truth ive been afraid something like this might happen but strike you say as with a cane a knife a pitchfork rutledge smiled strike as in assault theory doesnt disclose further details well have to find this man and ask him why not find the victim first if hes still alive hes a witness the victim has his own secrets he wont come forward of his own accord dowling said i should think considering this theory of yours that the hands of the police are tied i dont care for that there are men dead after all if rutledge said the victim here is a red herringand there may be reasons to think soto bring him forward would overshadow the search for the real murderer people would be eager to believe its over and let down their guard dowling leaned forward in his chair staring at the londoner if youve made up your mind why tell me this cockandbull story because rutledge answered unsmiling i dont want to be seen as going behind your back but for various reasons its best for the theoretical attack to be kept quiet at the same time i need to hear any rumors or gossip that might begin to float about and you need to know how to listen for them i dont like working in the dark you arent rutledge got to his feet find out if you can who was on the marling road last night near a burnedout oast house and why he was armed and what made him strike first the theoretical loose ends he waited wondering if hed misjudged his man wondering in truth where dowling would standwith him or against him hamish predicted grimly he will stand wi yefor now and then turn on you there was a strong possibility of that dowling studied rutledge for several seconds all right he said finally ive not been able to solve these murders on my own thats why the chief constable sent for you ill find the answers to your questions but by god when i do ill expect the answers to mine fair enough rutledge replied you might begin with our drunk from seelyham and then earnestly he added if i tell you the whole story people are going to jump to conclusions that will only muddle the facts i need your help but i dont want it prejudiced by my suspicions theres probably enough circumstantial evidence to charge my theoretical victim but when we do the real killer will be the one who goes to ground and the chances are we wont winkle him out again youve an odd way of putting it but i see your point dowling answered reluctantly on the other hand i heard from london that you were a secretive bastard who played his own game perhaps theres more to that than i was ready to believe rutledge smiled not secretive merely careful youll still be in charge here long after im gone if im wrong you wont be brought down with me he went back to the hotel and made an effort to sleep for a few hours but his usual ability to close his eyes and ignore the world around him eluded him and for a time rutledge lay there on the bed rigid one arm flung over his closed eyes and his mind wrestling with one image after another he could feel the tension in his bones and for a while he thought he would never sleep again it began to occur to him that there was one grain of good in the disaster of his war a single saving grace he knew now hed never abandoned his men before the fighting ended he hadnt walked away from the line while they were dying whatever else he had been and done he had not forsaken them and with that he drifted into a restless sleep it was sometime later that he was summoned to the lounge elizabeth mayhew was waiting there she was beyond anguish now her eyes burning in a pale face her hands tightly gripped together as if to keep them from shaking ive looked everywhere i telephoned the hotel in rochester theres no one registered under that name he sat down on the small footstool beside her chair what name do you know him by gunter hauser of course has he ever shown you his papers no why should he do you go about showing people yours she remembered that he was a policeman i mean at dinner parties or a cricket match of course not looking at her dark blue coat and the patterned silk of her collar he was reminded of the shaws and their faded illfitting clothes and that reminded him in turn of something that melinda crawford had told him did hauser give you the gift of a silk shawl elizabeth turned her head its none of your business which answered his question you know he was married and that he has children her eyes came back to his it doesnt make any difference what kind of life will i have as richards widow shall i travel as melinda crawford did after her husband was killed or take up charity work set my cap for someone like you who was richards friend long before he was mine because id rather have a safe marriage and children than none at all you dont know what its like ian you arent a woman its so easy for you to find love was it he said only im not criticizing you elizabeth i am trying to protect you what if this man is a murderer ive got witnesses who could identify him people who will swear that hes been stopping exsoldiers and asking them for information about jimsy ridger it casts a very bad light on his activities when thereve been murders among this same group of men if you love him of course ill do what i can for him but if hes guilty of murder i cant let him walk free nor should you expect me to she seemed to shrink into herself suddenly small and defenseless and very afraid in the overlarge chair oh ian how did we ever come to this he could see the tears in her eyes and the sorrow he didnt have an answer to give her if richard had only come home none of this would have mattered would it she asked but he didnt and i have to accept it and try to forget and look out for my own future gunter is a man very like richard you know in many ways he likes music and books and poetry and he loved his farm hes described it to mehow the brick house and barn form one great building how smoky the chimneys are when it rains for days how the windmills keep the land drained so that crops can grow how he hunted ducks along the canals when he was young hes not dutch elizabeth hes german he must have been describing his cousins way of life not his own the papers he carries belong to his cousin they arent his either elizabeth stared at him appalled no it isnt true isaw him during the war my dear he was a german officer theres absolutely no doubt about that fact she began to cry the tears spilling through her lashes her eyes awash if youre lying to me ill never forgive you she whispered never he reached out to take her hands in his but she pulled them away tucking them around her out of sight rutledge offered her his handkerchief and after a moment added i think you should go to stay with mrs crawford for a few days it would be best shell be happy for the company she fumbled with the handkerchief then and wiped her eyes ive got to go somewhere i cant bear to walk into that house now where his blood was all over the floor and richards memory is everywhere i look ill drive you if you like ive made a terrible fool of myself havent i her eyes begged for a denial no i think you were ready for comfort and love and warmth again im sorry it isnt possible he stood up looking down at her ill take you home and then come back in an hourtwoand drive you to mrs crawfords what will you tell her i wont tell her anything she wont ask why youre there she never does the rest is your decision do you think she loved anyone else after major crawford died youll have to ask her that he said gently i never have rutledge went back to the house with the stone gateposts while he was waiting for elizabeth to pack her cases the german was sitting up his face washed out by pain but his eyes alert the fever seemed to have abated how is she the question seemed drawn out of him by something in rutledges face upset im taking her to a friends house for a few days hauser nodded thats best so its safe now to bring me to the police have you driven the motorcar in the carriage house ive been afraid to someone might recognize it i walk wherever i need to go or hire a carriage im considered quite respectable in marling you know ive told them that my ancestors came over with william of orangeyour king william the third london was overrun with dutchmen then they owned land here some of it very valuable he smiled wryly i wish it were true but my ancestors lived in friesia with its heath and sand and the north sea wind we didnt meddle in politics except for the friedrichtasse weve never consorted with kings rutledge looked at the bread and sausage on the table youll need more to eat ill see to it meanwhile what about the doctor i warn you its the first step toward a prison cell i cant prevent that but god forgive me if i let you die elizabeth mayhew wont a flash of sadness swept over the handsome face she isnt in love with me not yet but she could have been in a very different world from this no im going to be all right if the fever doesnt come back again id like more water if you dont mind i cant work the pump yet rutledge brought him a pitcher of water more whisky no its making my head thunder hauser paused look why should i have killed those men its ridger im searching for do i give the impression im someone who would be overcome by a murderous fit of temper laudanum isnt hotblooded enough for that ridger is dead rutledge told him buried in maidstone where he was born i doubt youll find your cup his sort would have sold it long ago hauser sighed id thought about that his face wreathed in a selfdeprecating smile he added on the other hand i might have got those men drunk in the hope theyd tell me what they knew about ridgerand then misjudged how much would kill them i dont know why you killed them rutledge replied yet revenge perhaps all three served with ridger that cup is a very good storybut i have only your word that it exists and so far your lies have been plentiful and extremely persuasive but theyre beginning to catch up with you and with that he was gone melinda crawford was delighted to see them and there was another guest at the tea tablebella masterswho was decidedly not she greeted rutledge with a flush that rushed up under her fair skin like a burn and said with embarrassment i was just leaving but this offers me another opportunity to say mrs masters he interrupted her with a smile i hope youll stay and enjoy elizabeths company theres work waiting for me in marling im afraid and ive only driven her over as promised he turned to elizabeth standing beside him with a worried expression on her face as if wishing bella masters at the devil ill come for you whenever you say the word youllyoull keep me informed she begged i will melinda crawford no fool had caught elizabeths expression and looked at rutledge quizzically now tell me you wont have a cup of tea ian one cup and then ill walk you to the door myself elizabeth dear do sit down you look as if youre feeling a little sick from the motorcar elizabeth crossed to the hearth and held out unsteady hands to the blaze im cold thats all bella its wonderful to see you gathering her wits and her social graces about her like a cloak she smiled raleighs better i hope he was abominable the other night ive only just decided to forgive him bella seemed to relax a little her eyes still on rutledge he has his good days she agreed the truth is hes not content with an invalids role and it grates more than we probably know i ache sometimes watching him try to manage a far cry from the world of the courts trying to hold back tears she picked up her spoon and vigorously stirred her tea mrs crawford had poured tea for elizabeth and now handed rutledge his cup it was hot and strong and sweet without milk shed have added a discreet drop of something stronger if she could hamish said beginning to get mrs crawfords measure my granny would ha done that elizabeth was saying something about time lying heavy on her hands as well and turned to mrs crawford ive come to stay a few days if youll have me my dear id like nothing more ian must have told you how much ive complained lately about no one to talk to id go up to london if the weather werent so cold i feel it now more than i did used as i was to a hot climate rutledge drank his tea standing by the small inlaid chinese desk that sat out of reach of the sunlight pouring through the window bella regaining her composure said raleigh prefers a good fire these days i can remember when he insisted that the windows be opened wide each morning it was outrageous but he couldnt bear to be too warm id slip around behind him closing them as soon as he left a room they laughed melinda crawfords eyes met his and he dutifully commented ive never quite understood how men fought in wool in india they dropped dead of heatstroke she said silly fools he drank his tea and set down the cup i really must go elizabeths cases are in the boot then ill come and see that theyre carried up to her room mrs crawford replied rutledge took his leave of mrs masters and kissed the cheek that elizabeth tentatively offered him then he followed his hostess into the echoing hall she caught his arm and pulled him into the music room now tell me what this is about she hissed elizabeth looks as if shes been crying let her explain in her own fashion she will after mrs masters has gone but i found out about the silk shawl and im not sure i can keep elizabeths name out of whats about to happen i brought her here and you must find a way to hold her ill do what i can even if i must take to my bed for a day or two you look as if you havent slept at all nobodys dead i hope no he thought watching her expressive face that he would like nothing more than to stay here himself and put everything else out of his mind her hand reached up to touch his cheek it was cool and smooth like silk ian strength is a wonderful thing you know but sometimes a man can have too much of it you cant save the world from itself if people are intent on destroying themselves they will and sometimes they dont care if they bring others down with them thats selfish but its human nature ill remember he turned toward the door and then stopped i need cloths clean but old and lintfree and some laudanum if you have it and whisky and your promise to say nothing about any of this she asked no questions go see to elizabeths luggage take your time over it ill have everything ready he made a great fuss over bringing in the cases carrying them up the broad stairs himself as shanta came running protesting vigorously that he must do no such thing by that time mrs crawford had returned with a small oddly bulging sack ive added some soup she said breathlessly it will do no harm he kissed her hands and was out the door but before he had shut it behind him she was already opening the door to the sitting room saying briskly the most stubborn man he insisted on taking up the luggage himself hamish grumbled yere digging your ain grave deeper its no verra clever rutledge had debated his best course of action driving with a silent elizabeth huddled in her seat staring out at nothing but once he committed gunter hauser to the police saw him taken into custody and charged it was out of his hands this whole affair and right or wrong solid evidence or not it was all too likely that the german would go to trial and the case against him as an imposter in the country on false pretenses would make the murder charges far more believable it was one thing to bring in the guilty it was another to doom the innocent like ben shaw for one he swore hamish said i canna find a reason for his killing those men nor can i yet if it wasnt the friedrichtasse what was his business with jimsy ridger something else stolen that he canna name rutledge turned at the crossroads for marling passing a dogcart that held a pretty girl and two younger sisters her fair hair was almost hidden by a tam the long blond tendrils blowing in the wind her cheeks pink with cold it could have been before the annihilation of a generation it was dusk when he turned into the drive of the manor house hamish complained ye canna keep coming heresomeone will ken a motorcars driven through the gates now rutledge said ill deal with that later when i have the time hauser had lit the candle on the table and as rutledge walked up to the door he heard the scrape of a chairs feet on the stone paving of the kitchen floor its rutledge he said as he came through to the kitchen hauser haggard and unshaven snapped you scared the hell out of me id fallen asleep in the chair ive brought soupa beef broth i thinkin this thermos and new dressings and more whisky in the boot are bread and pork pies and apples along with more cheese hauser sniffed hungrily at the thermos and exclaimed my god its like the broth my grandmother used to make where did you find it sit down and let me look at the wound hauser did as he was told and grimaced as rutledge peeled the bloodcaked dressing away from the skin looking down he said its not infected thank god not yet its clean enough theres a good chance youll live rutledge used one of the precious cloths to bathe the wound and then rebound it this time with more finesse than hed used in elizabeth mayhews house that should do ive brought something besides the whisky if the pain keeps you from sleeping or to keep me from wandering i could drive away in that motorcar i wasnt able to do it today but by tomorrow yes you could do that rutledge agreed impassively he found a kitchen bowl that would hold the broth and a spoon handing both to hauser he said conversationally all things considered what will you do now that ridger is dead theres no choice but to go home i havent the money to waste on wishful thinking the crows flew up in noisy protest and rutledge stepped to the door to look out but there was no one there only a prowling cat he came back to the kitchen satisfied tell me why do you think these exsoldiers were killed seating himself on the edge of the heavy wooden table he said you must have known about them did you think that because you were whole no one would touch you i didnt have the luxury of waiting the killer out i told you money is short when its gone i have nothing and nowhere to turn he ate the soup with relish men kill for passion and they kill for money and they kill to keep a secret take your pick they kill for revenge hauser regarded him for a moment spoon in midair so you have been asking questions about me concealing his surprise rutledge said the old frenchman shot you for revenge its common enough in wartime still you must know about my brother a pause did you bring the laudanum so that when the police come they will find it in my possession oh yes i looked in the sack while you were seeing to the crows im a suspicious man i told you it was brought to help you sleep i want the hangman to find you healthy enough to break your neck as you fall through the trapdoor hauser put the cap on the thermos of broth leaving half of it for later as if hed lost his appetite rutledge said tell me about your brother theres nothing to tell except that after the cup was stolen my brother erich was killed he looked away the wound was still rawer than the slash on his chest perhaps if we had had the cup he would still be alive call it superstition if you will so i had every reason to kill jimsy ridger but no one else and yet you claim youll sell the cup if you find it if we stay in germany my son will be old enough to fight in the next war theres always a next war if i take him away from europe he wont need the protection of the cup hell be safe hamish cautioned he would make a verra fine chess player but i wouldna turn my back on him rutledge rising from the tables edge conceded the point rutledge was walking down the passage to his room when the maid her arms full of brooms and mops a bucket clutched in one hand smiled at him mr rutledge mr haskins at the desk asked me earlier if id seen you theres a telephone message for you it was from chief superintendent bowles when he had been located his voice came down the line affably ive had no word on the situation in marling no progress to report eh so far theres nothing new but the killing has stopped for the present the chief constable will be grateful for that blessing but its not good enough theres bound to be something to point in the murderers direction what does the local man have to say dowling murder at night on a deserted road leaves very little to be going on with by the time police reached the scene morning traffic had already obliterated any tracks or other evidence not good enough bowles repeated there was a pause the chief constable informs me youve dined with the great raleigh masters rumor says the mans dying rumor hamish was pointing out had clearly said a great deal more he seemed lively enough rutledge replied trodding carefully he was reminiscing about matthew sunderland i remember him from the shaw case ah so thats why you were looking at the files indeed it was a matter of luck rutledge agreed to hear someone of masterss caliber discuss the legal implications of a crime particularly one id worked on wary bowless voice changed and what did he have to say hes of the opinion that sunderland was one of the most brilliant legal minds of our age i would have to agree with him dining out is all well and good you know but youre there to find a coldblooded murderer id prefer to see more progress made on that front indeed sir bowles rang off and rutledge hung up the telephone with unusual care hamish said he went through your desk or someone reported to him but he isnt quite sure what brought mrs shaw to the yard else hes waiting for your heid to be well into the noose rutledge went to call on mrs bartlett and mrs webber alone and overworked the widows looked older than their years hamish said distastefully id no want to be a policeman id no want to question the grieving its the only way to find a killer sometimes oh aye and yed be happy telling your ain secrets susan webber brushing her auburn hair back from her forehead with one hand was holding on to the shy little girl burrowing into her mothers skirts with the other peters sister it was kind of you to let peter ride in your motorcar she said as she led rutledge into the parlor and turned up the lamp it smoked as if it needed trimming a basket of folded laundry sat on a table in the passage and there was evidence that cabbage was part of their dinner menu he could smell it boiling im sorry to trouble you he said but im sure you are as eager to have an answer to your husbands death as we are she said what good will it do then it wont bring peters father back and it wont make my life any easier kenny might as well have died in the war id got used to him being away after the first year then he was back and he needed more care than these two he looked up to see peter standing quietly in the doorway is there anything you can tell me mrs webber that might be useful did your husband have any enemiesor any friends he didnt trust kenny wasnt back home long enough to make enemies and his friends were in the war with him or dead i dont know why anyone would want to hurt him or us and why would he stop along the road somewhere and drink wine he never liked wine it made his stomach raw he may have learned to like it in france she shrugged kenny learned to like a lot of things in france didnt he that i didnt know about the french pox for one he was cured he said it was jimsys doing thats what i was told jimsy got him a surprise for his birthday it was a surprise right enough did you know ridger well him her voice was contemptuous he was one of the hop pickers my mother would have locked me in my room if id shown any interest in that direction one summer when jimsy was twelve he helped kennys pa to build a fence and kennys ma was kindhearted and let him stay to supper many a night i dont think jimsy ever forgot that and he was always respectful of kenny thats what kenny said when i railed at him about the whore that jimsy knew he was homesick and down because they was going into the line again the next morning and kenny had a premonition hed be killed but he wasnt was he as rutledge left peter followed him out into the front garden staring longingly at the motorcar at the gate rutledge showed him how the crank was turned and let him peer into the drivers seat at the gauges on the panel when peter hopped down to the road again rutledge got behind the wheel peter said one night i saw my pa come home in a motorcar hed been working out on one of the farms i was at the window watching for him he said he liked riding in it and would do it again if he got the chance when did you see this motorcar do you remember the child smiled shyly up at him one night i dont know when can you tell me about the driver peter shook his head he wasnt interested in anything but the vehicle did you see your father in this motorcar again the fair head shook again it was the only time he came home early did your mother see the motorcar no shed gone to sit with mrs goode who has a baby as rutledge pulled away peter said running along beside the motorcar i think it was a woman older than my mother old mrs bartlett sitting by her kitchen fire looked up at rutledge with swollen eyes the handkerchief in her hand was crumpled sodden i miss him most at night you know because hed come home then and id not be alone anymore the tiny kitchen scrubbed clean had an emptiness about it as if mrs bartlett had given up on cooking when harry worked somewhere and stayed the night i never could sleep the way i should when you heard he was dead did you suspect anyone did you think of anyone who might want to harm him she looked up at rutledge with complete bewilderment no it was a murderer it wasnt someone we knew rutledge changed his tactics mrs bartlett im trying to find something that connects the three victims their service in the war for one and the fact that they lived here in marling can you think of anything else she considered the question it doesnt make sense that anyone would want to hurt harry he was a good man they were all good men and it was cruel when theyd already suffered so much and then unwittingly she quoted nell shaw i dont know what im to do without him i dont know how im to get on did your husband know someone called jimsy ridger how should i know as she broke down completely rutledge asked if there was someone he could bring to her she shook her head and so he made her a cup of fresh tea and she drank it gratefully he wondered if she had eaten all day as she settled into a calmer state he took his leave where were the women of the church tonight when she needed their comfort at home with their own families and unaware the next morning he found hauser shaved dressed and waiting for him the wound looked dry and as if it had begun to heal changing the dressing rutledge said its nearly time to make a decision about you mrs mayhew is she all right shes in good hands hauser nodded im happy to hear it but he didnt sound happy he ate a good part of the food rutledge had brought with an appetite a farmers breakfast he commented finishing the last of the bread and bacon very good so have you found the man who knifed me it wont have proved an easy thing to do he was a coward hell hide himself well not yet rutledge toyed with a bit of eggshell drawing imaginary lines on the table hauser said come now you are a good policeman are you not there was humor in the mans face but not in his cold eyes i dont know rutledge said getting up from his chair to rinse out the thermos and set it on the drainboard by the sink ive learned that when a man wants something very badlyas you say you want this cuphe will measure the cost carefully and if it comes down to it hell willingly pay whatever price is demanded the important thing is to understand the consequences you were in the war you know better than most what its like to face death i think youd go to the hangman with few regretsexcept perhaps for your children startled hauser had the grace to flush it would be very easy to hate you he said after a moment no we were out there in the trenches rutledge heard a rough edge to his voice on different sides but we were out there thats a soldiers bond hauser got up and walked to the window ill have to move on you know people will see where your car has been theyll be suspicious he sighed its going to be damned inconvenient his majestys government wont house you as well rutledge agreed hauser said in a different voice you know i never killed them you wont hang me for the sake of your career rutledge collected the thermos and walked to the door tomorrow after that it wont be in my hands anyway he left wondering if he were making a mistake hauser could walk away now is that what he wanted deep in his own soul in marling he found a note waiting from melinda crawford it read simply i think youd better come reluctantly he drove to her house on the sussex border he wasnt in the mood to be questioned about hauser shanta opened the door to him saying quietly you are to go upstairs he followed the direction of her eyes walking up the stairs and turning to the left in the back of the house melinda crawford had made for herself a comfortable sitting room that overlooked the gardens she was waiting for him there standing by the window as he opened the door she turned ian what has happened he asked relieved to see that she herself looked well enough except for the deep concern on her face elizabeth she left this morning without telling me when shanta went in to bring her her morning tea the bed was empty we waited for a time thinking she might have gone for a walk but theres a horse gone from my stables as well and my groom tells me that it must have been taken sometime close to dawn rutledge swore under his breath did she tell you about the german yes i think shes afraid youre going to hang him foolish girl but there you are mrs crawford examined him critically you look terrible you did yesterday but i put it down to this business with elizabeth it isnt is it im tired thats all ive been bicycling over the countryside and then dealing with her german she rang the small bell at her side and shanta came in almost at once with a tray glasses and decanters mrs crawford poured a whisky for him and passed it to him drink that my dear tea built an empirewe need something stiffer to see us through elizabeths histrionics she had the feeling you knew this man is it true yes from the war he nodded she thought there might have been some ill feeling between you not ill feeling rutledge fell back on the old cliche he was the enemy melinda crawford considered him for a moment and he felt like a schoolboy squirming under the gaze of a stern schoolmaster what happened to you in france ian you were on the somme were you not rutledge could see his hand trembling as he lifted the glass he set it down again and said trench warfare she smoothed the fabric of her skirt as if she knew he didnt want to meet her eyes when i was in india i watched people die sometimes peacefullysometimes quite horribly not just in the mutiny you know it was a poor country and people simply died along the road in the courtyard of a mosque in the shelter of a banyan tree i have seen the taj mahal one of the most elegantly beautiful shrines in the world ive lain in a blind in the middle of a night to watch a tiger walk softly down to the river and drink but i had nightmares for years about the butchery at cawnpore where the women and children were massacred in the bibighar i heard my elders describe how some of the murderers were blown from cannon rather than hanged do you think you can shock me he said boxed into a corner and trying to shift the conversation did you offer to drive one of the marling victims home one night did you take him up in your motorcar yes i saw him limping down the road and instructed my driver to stop hadley was horrified but i didnt care compassion takes many forms you should have told me why i didnt murder him i only saved him from a long walk home rutledge said all the same and then he answered her question in the only way he knew how i cant tell you about the war please dont ask me to tell you about it does this german know what you wont tell me only a very small part of it he reached again for the whisky and nearly spilled it for gods sake dont ask me then there is nothing that this man can tell elizabeth that would harm you or that she could use against you nonothing it wasnt completely true but he could think of no one who could profit from the knowledge that gunter hauser possessed then you are free to do whatever is required to take him into custody if that becomes necessary and there will be no repercussions he could feel himself beginning to breathe again the tightness in his chest no longer bands biting into the flesh i cant believe he began and then realized that he didnt know elizabeth any longer i think she must have gone to find himand elizabeth isnt stupid she can put facts together exceedingly well she must have some idea where to look he hadnt considered that she thought he was living in a hotel in rochester it was a lie hed been living in the kitchen of an empty manor house on the marling road the morton house and you took him back there i find myself wondering why i took him back there because i needed information i dont know if that was right or wrong still it was a personal decision not a professional one yes i see that did you owe him your life ian not precisely but i nearly got him killed after the war had ended my dear i cant imagine that you would have taken the man anywhere but gaol if you truly believed he was a murderer i dont know he said with honesty i cant be sure as far as i can seeand i have known you much of your lifeyour judgment is no more impaired than mine whatever transpired in france you must never let it conquer you do you understand me understanding is one thingliving up to that standard is another he said wryly melinda crawford said i recognize courage when i see it ian now what are we to do about elizabeth before she makes an utter fool of herself she took his glass and added to it he was able to lift the whisky to his lips this time and the warmth seemed to spread through the icy grip of tension ill have to go back to marling and i shall go with you if im there we can probably salvage her reputation they left ten minutes later when rutledge reached the mortons drive he already knew what he would find in the manor house kitchen in the event he was wrong elizabeth mayhew sat at the table where rutledge had left hauser only a matter of hours ago she faced him with a shaky calmness hes not here she said i told him to go back to germany while he could i told him that for richards sake i couldnt marry a german but i promised id find that cup for him somehow my penance if you like you shouldnt have interfered because you believe hes a murderer i dont know the answer to that question i dont care i want him out of england out of my life out of my mind for gods sake there are three men dead rutledge began the stress of the morning leaving him shorttempered then find out who killed them she got to her feet i told him to take the horse as far as the helford railway station id send someone later to fetch it the outer door had opened and mrs crawford stepped in distastefully regarding the signs of occupation in the kitchenthe tins of food the bedding on the floor the water pitcher next to jam jars and a whisky decanter on the table you should have told him to come to me elizabeth id have taken him in and kept him until this business has been sorted out she said youve put ianand yourselfinto an extremely difficult position you arent in love with this man you know youve fallen into an infatuation you havent known him long enough to destroy other peoples lives on his account now i suggest we all leave this place as quickly as possible ill understand elizabeth if you would rather not return to my house she lifted her skirts to walk gracefully out of the kitchen leaving the two of them standing face to face hamish was saying id search the house if i were you but rutledge was aware of the emptiness around him of the sense of someone having walked out of a room just before one walks into it hauser was no longer here rutledge drove elizabeth mayhew in to marling and left her at the door to her house it was clear that she didnt want his company or anyone elses at the moment when he walked out to the motorcar again melinda crawford told him weve missed our lunch if you ask me to dine at the hotel with you i wont say no i shouldnt worry about elizabeth if i were you shes feeling quite selfrighteous at the moment but it wont last as they drove past the cavalier on his plinth mrs crawford gestured in the statues direction my husbands family she said he was quite a hero defending charles the first to the death it was seen as a brave thing at the time but the family lost its title and its lands under cromwell and never recovered when they arrived at the hotel rutledge offered to order a room for her to rest nonsense im not as fragile as i look my dear id like to speak to inspector dowling before we go to the dining room do you mind waiting its a matter of unfinished business i understand ill sit comfortably in the lounge and beg a glass of sherry from the clerk feeling as if hed been ground in the mill of the gods rutledge walked on to the police station to find a grinning inspector dowling sitting behind his desk like the cheshire cat your theoretical victim walked in half an hour ago and gave himself up stunned rutledge said why on earth and stopped himself short he said he was innocent of murder and wanted his name cleared he said he was attacked on the road north of marling by someone who mistook him for the killer from the look of the knife wound in his chest someone was very nervous indeed id like to see him hes in dr pughs surgery at the moment with sergeant burke in attendance the grin disappeared what do you know about this business hamish hissed walk softly hardly more than ive told you as for why i didnt bring him in the first reaction of everyone in the county would have been we have our murderer hes a very fair candidate the newspapers will be full of righteous condemnation dowling sighed yes and you were right reputations will fall over this but now hes given himself up and what am i to do with the fool god knows keep him here for a few days let him help you with your inquiries is it true that jimsy ridger is dead so im told then said dowling if i cant charge this german and ridger is dead weve got no case at all were back where we started from when the yard sent you to marling at the plough the lobby was full of luggage a steamer trunk with labels from expensive european hotels and ocean liners was surrounded by matching cases in calfskin some six or eight of them a uniformed driver was crisply instructing the housekeeping staff on what went where as rutledge walked toward the sitting room he found mrs crawford watching from her chair by the door she said youd require seven camels for that rutledge laughed camels are thin on the ground in kent who is the new arrival so far theres only the driver on view judging from his demeanor were being honored by no less than a duke the man from leeds very likely they went into the dining room together and after rutledge had ordered for them he said hauser has turned himself in to the local police but not under his own name hes using that of his dutch cousin hes presently at the doctors surgery pugh hes a good man she sat back in her chair and sighed hauser is just the man for elizabeth after all she declared quixotic theyll be quite happy together i thought you would be opposed for richards sake yes but thats water over the dam now we must learn to let go as well i shall miss her i can only hope that shell be happy an english stepmother might not sit well with little german children what will the police do with this man i dont know rutledge answered as their first course was set before them the dining room was filling up with marketgoers coming in for their meal i cant see what reason he might have had for murder the monetary value of that cup is all well and good after the cup was stolen his brother was killed in action revenge she considered the possibility but a cold revenge dont you think without passion or satisfaction hauser said much the same thing i lived in the east for a very long time ian i suppose ive absorbed a little of their way of thinking to kill in this fashionwith wine and then laudanumyou must apply yourself to the task you must watch and weigh enough too little and the victim will live to describe how he came so close to deaths door too much and the victim empties the contents of his stomach before the drug has been effective i think the question you need to ask yourself is why anyone would do such a thing its far more grim in my view than using a weapon it was an interesting point but where did it lead as if shed read his mind melinda crawford said meditatively it would suggest that your killer is mad or that he derives some satisfaction from watching the process of death as if to acquaint himself with it hamish said shes no so verra far from death herself she spoke no so verra long ago of her will rutledge heard him he couldnt remember the rest of his meal the conversation had taken another turn this time to less dramatic topics but in the back of his mind he couldnt shut out the words tumbling over and over like stones as if to acquaint himself with it rutledge went to the police station after driving melinda crawford back to her house gunter hauser was sleeping but he heard the door to his cell open without opening his eyes he said the doctor praised your handiwork and asked me repeatedly who had seen to the wound should i tell him elizabeth expected you to take the train to london yes well shell be very disappointed he opened his eyes and sat up stiffly a bargain mr rutledge we both have secrets you and i i would be very happy to keep yours if you keep mine early days to decide that there was a single chair in the room and rutledge hooked it with his foot then sat down i asked dowling he says theres been no progress on finding your attacker you can hardly think i wounded myself hardly no im of the opinion hes not going to surface hes no fool he cant be sure who he slashed yon drunk you questioned hamish pointed out is a verra strong possibility in the dark he may have mistaken hauser for you he doesnt fit hausers description aye well you canna be sure o that rutledge concentrated his attention on hauser at a guess you didnt tell dowling how long youd lived rough at the manor house it is one thing to confess another to confess everything i learned that in the war you know theres no certainty that others will see a situation quite as you do rutledge got up to leave elizabeth will blame you the german said but theres not much either of us can do about it im not in love with her if thats what youre asking it was true no but you feel a cavaliers responsibility elizabeth is stronger than you think rutledge went out the door without responding tired and in no mood to talk to dowling or anyone else in marling rutledge found himself driving toward the small cottage where tom brereton lived it was old a halftimbered yeomans house with a crooked roof beam and a massive wisteria twining up the porch and into the thatch boasting only a few rooms upstairs and down land enough around it for a pretty cottage garden and an atmosphere of sturdiness that belied its age it was ideal for a man living alone at the gate a small sign next to a bicycle identified it as rovers end he left the motorcar on the grassy verge and went up the short walk to the door brereton opened it surprise in his face when he saw who had come to call id offer you a warm welcome but from the look of you whisky would be more acceptable i expect it would rutledge had to bend his head to step through the door and inside the beams were hardly more than an inch or two above him the room was small but there were windows at either end and a fire on the hearth bookshelves chairs tables and chests were crowded in upon each other as if brereton had crammed the contents of two houses into this tiny space for a man going blind it isna a verra safe place to walk rutledge found a chair by the hearth and watched a gray cat rise up from it yawning with arched back it blinked at him and then leapt to the floor tail high as if reminding him that his use of the chair was at most temporary thats lucinda she came with the furniture both inherited but i dont mind shes company of a sort sit down brereton poured two small whiskies and handed one to rutledge its prewar i inherited that too an aunt raised me and she detested sherry like the late queen victoria she preferred the smoky flavor what brings you here rutledge sat and stretched his legs out to the fire what do you know about these murders what do i know brereton sounded surprised only what i hear and thats generally what gossip considers worthwhile passing on are you looking for information no peace brereton chuckled youll find that in plenty out here the only house near rovers end belongs to raleigh masters and as neighbors go hes invisible i can step out into my garden of an evening and hear nothing but birdsong or the cry of an owl i like it most people would find it daunting most people rutledge thought would find approaching blindness daunting but as hamish was pointing out what was the alternative how is your neighbor by the way he just went up to london to visit his doctor i drove him bellamrs mastersdidnt accompany him theres no change in his condition but colder weather wont help his circulation six years ago he might have considered the south of france during the winter not now not so soon after the war changing the subject brereton added how are elizabeths puppies faring i ought to go see for myself i suppose something in his voice the way he looked away caught rutledges attention a yearning was there an attraction there carefully concealed thriving rutledge replied what will lucinda make of a dog joining the household shell whip him into shape just as she did me a comfortable silence lengthened rutledge toyed with his whisky watching the firelight in the swirls of amber liquid he thought if i gave up the yard i could live like thisbut for how long how long would i be content of an evening lately ive been thinking about your murders brereton said after a time and ive come to a possible answer rutledge set his glass down on the table at his elbow and said with interest id like to hear it yes well im no policeman but it was a gentle death was it not as murders go i mean suicide is that what youre thinking brereton frowned not exactly but aneasinginto what the murderer might see as a better world unbidden the image of melinda crawfords face rose in rutledges mind how does he choose his victims i dont know so far his compassion extends only to exsoldiers it may be that he was one himself hamish was pointing out that melinda crawford had nursed wounded men during the mutiny rutledge shut the voice away remembering mrs parker struggling for breath and sleeping upright in her chair by her window he said then youre suggesting that he doesnt have a wide circle to choose from or that hes wary of approaching people in their houses for example bob nester who died of burnedout lungs the logs shifted on the hearth throwing breretons face into the shadows or your presence in marling has deterred him before he could widen his net all right well accept that why does he use wine do you think the wine doesnt worry me for all we know its what our man prefers anyway if youd found an empty bottle now that might help narrow the field you could ask wine merchants in the larger towns who purchased it no what intrigues me is the merciful death its a chilling idea rutledge agreed he wondered where brereton was taking his discussion at first it had seemed no more than an intellectual exercise now is it chilling i mean were looking at it from our own viewpoint arent we the murderer may see it entirely differently raleigh masters has lost part of a limb hes very likely to lose the rest of his leg hed have a better understanding than most of what taylor webber and bartlett were suffering brereton laughed raleigh doesnt have compassion to spare for his own wife i doubt hed give much thought to exsoldiers struggling to scratch a living theres your blindness yes well it wont ease my suffering to kill blind men however much i may sympathize ill tell you what started me down this road though mrs crawford once remarked that as a child during the lucknow siege she learned what deprivation was for a very long time afterward she felt terribly guilty about wasting even a scrap of food or a drop of water if she couldnt eat a crust of bread shed feed it to the birdsthe antseven the monkeys that sometimes came into her mothers garden later she was sure this obsession must have driven her mother to distraction but the point is she had to deal with this guilt in her own fashion what other kinds of guilt are there and what other ways have people found to work through them mrs crawford is not a likely suspect rutledge answered no of course not but she proves a point in a way what if someone cant bear to watch these men hobbling down a road and finally decides to put an end to it she had given peter webbers father a lift home in her motorcar brereton said for the sake of argument how do you feel as you stand over a murder victim you cant be objective you have to feel something passion possibly anger disgust vengefulness a policeman cant afford to feel rutledge answered slowly he mustnt let emotion cloud his observations first impressions are important all right bad example lets take interviewing suspects then you pry into the deepest darkest corners of their lives and what you learn is disturbing but it turns out neither they nor their secrets have any bearing on the case youre working on how do you walk away from that it isnt always possible rutledge conceded picking up his glass and drinking from it and if youve learned something that could be set right even though you betrayed a secret would you do it no im not god i can bring the guilty to justice or try to i cant go around righting wrongs brereton smiled but there must be a great many people who dont have that discipline it must be tempting after a while to play god and you think someone is doing that in marling i dont know brereton answered but its an interesting thought isnt it after the claustrophobic atmosphere of the cottage rutledge was glad to drive away the cold air swept past his face and he felt he could breathe more easily it had been an odd conversation hamish said ye noted the bicycle leaning against yon garden wall he had it provided all the transportation that brereton needed to go where and when he pleased it was possible that brereton was confessing after a fashion was it likely rutledge couldnt find in the mans background anything that would translate to murder but london could tell him more about that tired he turned at the crossroads for marling halfway there he stopped by the trees where will taylor had been found and got out again to stand and look at them he had been here in the dark hed been here during the day and there was nothing he could learn from this place where had these men died where theyd been foundor somewhere else even if brereton was right and these were merciful deaths there was no dignity in lying in a ditch to be found by some passerby why had the murderer cared about the manbut had no qualms about abandoning the corpse this rutledge thought was the major problem with breretons theory a motorcar approached from marling a last errant ray of sun catching the windscreen and flashing across the trees in a bright glare uncertain whether the driver had seen him rutledge stepped nearer the verge of the road waiting for him to pass instead the vehicle slowed and stopped after a moment a man got out retrieved his crutches and with difficulty walked toward the londoner rutledge could see that bella masters was in the rear seat a dark shape whose hat was all that betrayed her gender she stayed where she was behind the chauffeur as raleigh approached him rutledge waited to see how the man would open the conversation instead masters paused to look at the stone columns and the flattened grass of the drive someones been here he said the new zealander i expect someones taken over a whole floor at the plough with that kind of money he wont think much of the mortons estate youve met him rutledge asked curious i thought he was from leeds leeds that could be the staff was atwitter when we stopped at the hotel for tea youd have thought god himself had arrived service was terrible i saw the luggage rutledge said hes here to stay at a guess yes well its a wonderful facade all this fuss isnt it even if hes poor as a church mouse an entrance an actor once told me is half the play there was a silence masters moved nearer rutledge and regarded him thoughtfully why are you so fascinated by matthew sunderland ive told you i was one of the men assigned to the shaw case and that was disposed of six years ago so it was rutledge answered neutrally it was an interesting trial i should think it would be one that sunderland himself would have talked about from time to time raleigh stared at him the flush of anger mottling his face like a change of skin damn you you know as well as i do that he barely finished the trial before he was taken ill that was the last case hed have enjoyed discussing with anyone stunned rutledge said i didnthe showed no sign of ill health it was a classic performance you didnt know him you didnt have any concept of what he was capable of how could you judge a man like that you werent fit to wipe his boots perhaps youre more sensitive to his problems because you did know him well and therefore saw lapses the rest of us masters cut him short are you trying to overturn the shaw decision it wont do you much good the villains dead leave him to rot im trying to get at the truth rutledge told him bluntly id like to know whether the evidence is as strong in hindsight as it was at the time he thought masters was going to have an apoplexy he was my mentor the man i admired more than any other i wont stand by and watch you destroy his reputation for the sake of somehe fumbled for a word some modern desire to cleanse the conscience hardly that or was it what if there is new evidence new evidence are you mad how could there be any new evidence a locket has turned up one that was included in the list of mrs satterthwaites possessions but was never found masters was silenced the color began to drain from his face leaving him white and shaken i wont let you do this do you understand youre easily broken and i shall take pleasure in arranging it break me if you like rutledge answered will that change the truth raleigh walked several steps away his crutches stabbing the earth then turned back it was a fair and just verdict im sure it was with the information available what if thats changed would you rather sunderlands reputation stand undeservedly you dont know what he went through you dont know anything about the pain and the courage and the sheer will that carried him through the last year of his life hamish said its no use his minds made up i dont want to destroy sunderland i want to find out if we misjudged ben shaw how very considerate of you how very enlightened the words were chill and offensive we arent going to solve this rutledge replied if you like ill sit down with you and present my findings and you can be the judge no if you tell me that im wrong no then im afraid theres nothing more to discuss rutledge turned to walk back to his own motorcar masters said dont walk away from me inspector it was a warning rutledge half turned we have no common ground it will do no good to savage each other he walked on masters said i know about your sister his voice was low pitched not to carry beyond rutledges ears rutledge stopped not sure hed heard correctly he faced raleigh masters again you dont even know my sister thats true i dont know her but she and your dear friend richard mayhew had an affair just before the war they were very much in love mayhew betrayed his wife for her and would have gone on betraying her if the war hadnt sent him to france rutledge cold with anger said youre lying am i richard mayhew alas is dead you must ask your sister if you want the truth if you dare orperhaps youd rather spend the rest of your life wondering masters smiled now you know how it feels to see your idol stripped of his honor rutledge had no real memory of the rest of the drive to marling he had stood there watching raleigh masters return to his motorcar and climb painfully into the rear seat it moved off as if rutledge no longer existed as if he were no more than another tree standing rooted at the side of the road it isnt true that was his first thought and then came niggling doubt how fond frances had been of richard mayhew how well shed known him long before elizabeth had stolen his heart how close they had been over the years how devastated frances had been when the news came that richard had been killed in action her letters to her brother at the front full of grief how willingly she had faced loneliness it wasnt true the man was a master manipulator it had been the signature of raleighs success in the courtroom hamish said it doesna signify it had naught to do with you what they did yere no their keeper and that was true it was something that lay between his sister and his best friend it was not his business opening it up would only hurt elizabeth mayhew but the painful doubt had taken root all the same and he tried to find a way to accommodate it and still love two people who were an infinite part of his life he could see why raleigh masters had used this final weapon to explore it would hurt the wrong people a lesson in the cost of opening up the past hamish asked at the hotel there was a quiet madness the dinner hour attracted a large group of diners eager to glimpse the man who had arrived with such fanfare the room was crowded the woman seating guests said affably im afraid it will be an hour at best were quite busy tonight marling hasnt seen this much excitement since the war ended i hear you have a guest from new zealand she frowned new zealand i hadnt heard that hed gone there the man with all the luggage oh no hes from leeds hes just bought the hendricks house near the church rutledge dredged in his memory for the name mr aldrich yes thats right i was misinformed then where is he in his room i expect cook says hes ordered a tray sent up she smiled conspiratorially everyone will have a good dinner and no satisfaction shy is he i wouldnt know i havent seen him myself but im told hes just sent for mr meade amused rutledge said he cant stay in his room forever true if youll have a seat in the lounge as rutledge took her advice hamish said you willna have to travel to leeds to speak to him thats a small consolation most of the dinner guests had come in pairs or in groups he felt a wave of loneliness he was shut off from elizabeth melinda crawford was at her house it was odd to find himself questioning her role in a murder investigation it made him uncomfortable and uneasy someone spoke behind him good evening he turned to find inspector dowling my wifes gone to stay with her sister for a few days to look after her gallstones painful rutledge agreed beware what you wish for he chided himself dowling sat down in the next chair i oughtnt be here she left a meat pie in the oven but i fed it to the dog rutledge laughed and how is the dog the last i saw he was groaning in the back garden dowling sobered i shouldnt disparage her cooking a man has to accept what he cant change the dining room is full whats on the menu tonight gossip for the first course have you met marlings newest resident as a matter of fact i havent sergeant burke has in his opinion this man aldrich will do a rough diamond but hell settle in the gentry wont care much for him but the merchants will profit dowling paused my prisoner swears hes not involved in murder i brought young webber in this afternoon to have a look at him the boy recognized him and ive sent word to inspector grimes to have miss whelkin brought down when she returns to seelyham i daresay shell have no difficulty identifying him i wont argue with that is he a murderer or simply clouding the water god knows rutledge turned to look out the window at the dark street my men have been asking questions it appears this man had lunch one day with mrs mayhew and that hes met other important people in and around marling on apparently legitimate businessan exploration of his familys activities after coming to england with william the third there will be repercussions if hes innocent theres the dutch government to consider as well rutledge said i warned you he would complicate the investigation dowling took a deep breath and were no closer to finding a killer i met raleigh masters today on the road he seemed to think the man who is heir to the morton estate is here in marling as well i expect he misheard but im told john boyd the morton solicitorand mr masterss as well i daresayhas had a letter from the heir hes made a fortune in new zealand and has no interest in the bequest the house and land are to be sold a pity and it was rutledge thought the house deserved better the clerk from the desk came into the lounge looked around and then walked quickly toward rutledge inspector rutledge theres a telephone message for you he held out a folded sheet of paper rutledge opened the sheet and read the brief message you must come at once its urgent and it was signed margaret shaw was there anything else rutledge asked the clerk no sir but the young woman was in tears very upset indeed dowling said is this another case in a way rutledge stood up ill have to see to it fifteen minutes later he was on the road to london the shaws were not on the telephone short of contacting the yard and asking that men be sent to the house to find out what the emergency was rutledge had no choice but to go himself it was a long dark drive and weather was moving in from the east a damp wind laden with the promise of heavy rain before dawn staying awake was a problem and he was nearly certain that this was a wildgoose chase another dramatic reminder from nell shaw that her husbands fate ought be his foremost priority on the other hand he couldnt risk ignoring margarets cry for help to fill the time he turned to the past what had really passed between shaw and the women he had been accused of smothering why had he been tempted to kill each of them need his wifes ruthless prodding to provide more and more opportunities for their children hamish said you canna know the answer to that but at a guess he comforted himself with their condition yes i can understand that those women werent going to recover and they were probably afraid of dying alone and neglected of lying there until someone came in and found them they must have looked forward to his visits hed learned early on that murderers often could convince themselves of the rightness of what they had done still theres the connection with mrs cutter was her son involved was she trying to protect him or did she use him to try to put the blame on mrs shaw aye the locket george peterson could have pocketed that to gie to his mother yet she never used it against the shaws why did peterson kill himself because he didnt like police work as weve been told or was there more to the story he wouldna be the first policeman to die by his own hand it was true after the first long months of working with the worst of human nature of seeing violent death and recognizing evil for what it was a callous disregard for the lives and property of others either a policeman developed a hard shell against the nightmare of his job or he began to drink sometimes when the shell cracked or the drinking failed to dull the mind a man withdrew into himself and built not a shell but a wall against any emotion at all or he put an end to all of it rutledge himself drawn to law enforcement because of a firm belief that the police had the power to give the dead a voice to offer in a courtroom the evidence of the scene and the body had discovered soon enough that he was losing his objectivity and it had been a long difficult climb to a level of professionalism that had allowed him to function without losing his humanity young george peterson might never have succeeded in reaching that level as the lights of london came closer and he could see the city shining in the misting rain the smell of the river borne on the wind and the heavy odor of coal fires hanging between the clouds and the rooftops he turned toward sansom street and finally pulled up in front of the shaw house every light seemed to be burning the house startlingly lit like a beacon in the west end it would signify a party in number sansom street it was an omen rutledge got out of the motorcar and stretched his shoulders postponing the moment of walking up to the door and lifting the knocker margaret shaw was there as if she had been waiting just on the other side and he walked into the narrow hall a passage led to the back of the house with narrow stairs climbing to his right and doors into rooms standing open on his left margaret was in tears her face red and streaked as if shed been crying for hours mama is upstairs she said ive been that frantic i think its her heart you should have called a doctor not me he said and then regretted it the doctor came margaret told him and left he said it was something shes eaten he gave her a digestive powdershe wont touch it she says its poison and she just lies there clutching her chest and asking god why he deserted her wheres your brother mama sent him to stay with a friend i dont know what excuse she made but they agreed to keep him for a day or two rutledge followed margaret up the stairs and into a bedroom that faced the street the bedclothes were rumpled and tossed half on the floor half covering the fully clothed woman lying in their midst her hair was a birds nest tangled and spiked with sweat her shirtwaist and her skirt wrinkled and twisted as he walked toward the bed she turned her head to see who was there and froze dear my god she cried staring at him and sat up with such hope blazing in her eyes that rutledge turned away he said to margaret bring your mother water and towels a brush for her hair then put her in that chair he gestured to the single chair by the door ill wait downstairs no mrs shaw for your own sake and your daughtersyoure in no state nell shaw stretched out her hand no dont leave me youve got to help me i cant do it all myself i cant anymore mrs shaw what does it matter to them janet cutter is dead her son george is deadit wont matter to them if the slate is wiped clean for my ben and their names are substituted for his i cant perjure myself is it perjury look at my girl am i to put a dead woman ahead of my living flesh it could have been that bitch next door it could have been her as easy as it could have been my ben and they cant hang her can they they wont dig up her corpse and hang her in the prison yard all you have to do is tell the police that you was wrong that theres proof now that she did the murders theyll want to know how she did itwhat opportunity she had why she should have killed the womenthere had to be a reason her son then good god hes a suicide he must have had it on his conscience and after my ben was hanged he couldnt bear it any longerhe took his own life she was on her knees on the mattress begging theres the locket you saw it lovein the tall chest there the top drawer give it to him and let him take it to the yard he can tell them what the truth is and get the verdict reversed and clear your fathers name give it to him margaret went to the drawer and opened it her hands trembling as she searched among the handkerchiefs and gloves finding what she sought she brought it to rutledge her face strained and on the verge of tears again rutledge opened the handkerchief to look at the contents the locket fell through his fingers and onto the floor as he bent to retrieve it cold metal and stone in his hand he thought god forgive me i dont know what to do and yet he did out of the shadows had come an answer the only answer he had failed to explore he had examined the possibility of the cuttersof janet cutters dead soneven of mrs shaw herself being the true killer he had never looked at ben shaw except as a victim as he straightened up he said mrs shaw where had your husband hidden this locket there was a different note in his voice hamish said ware rutledge thought she was going to die then we searched the house he said implacably we never found it where was it nell shaw crumpled before his eyes covering her face with her hands she lay back in the bed and thrashed moaning from side to side from an angry demanding harridan she had become diminished a woman without spirit and without hope margaret ran to her throwing an accusing glance at him hamish said it canna be true rutledge answered grimly you werent there he left the room and went down the stairs in the kitchen the remainders of a meal lay on the table greasy plates scraps of sausage and bread he took the kettle filled it with fresh water and set it on the stove then opened cupboards until he found cups and saucers as he took them down he could see that his hands were shaking guilt he thought then about what tom brereton had said about guiltabout the need to work it out but why had mrs shaw suddenly taken it into her head to remove the locket from its hiding place and put it in among mrs cutters clothing why to what end yes it would make a difference in her childrens lives as well as her own to clear her husbands name but the passion driving her had been ferocious he reviewed everything he knew or had learned about the shaws and margarets words came back to him she went next door to help mr cutter as hed asked and when she came home she looked sick as if she was about to lose her dinner she was that upset she locked herself in her room ive only known her to do that twice before the day papa was taken away and the day the letter came what letter i never saw it but after she read it she cried for hours then she came out of her room and was herself again the teakettle sang a cheerful note startling rutledge back into the present mrs shaw had judged him well he thought and with a cleverness born of desperation she had found the one chink in his armor his understanding of ben shaws broken spirit his fatal willingness to doubt his own judgment like a tightrope walker fighting for his balance he had been swayed by the wind of her vehemence uncertain unable to ask for help or support from his superiors a man caught in a dilemma that cast doubt on the one part of his life he needed most to believe inhis career the perfect foil to nell shaws intentions but why hamish said she learned that you had survived the war rutledge shook his head it went beyond that he poured three cups of tea when the pot had brewed and set them on a tray with sugar and milk then took it upstairs nell shaw was sitting slumped in the chair by the door as margaret struggled to make up the bed alone rutledge set the tray on top of the tall chest carrying a cup to her it was hot and sweet and she drank it thirstily margaret with the bed straightened up sat forlornly on one end of it and sipped at her tea as if afraid it might be poisoned she looked old worn an image of herself far into the future rutledge felt sorry for her he said taking his own cup and going to stand by the window i think we need to get to the bottom of this matter nell shaw drained of emotion said youve destroyed us you know that no that began when your husband murdered three helpless women he done them a favor you dont know the truth you dont know how they lay there day after day with nobody to talk to nobody to see to them except my ben and the old charwoman who cleaned a little and cooked a bit hed come home of a night and shake his head with the pity of it he said once it would be a mercy if they was released from this life ive prayed that it would come but it never did where was the locket hidden it was pinned to my corset under my petticoat in a little sack along with some other money hed picked up as well why in gods name did you try to shift the blame to mrs cutter i never liked her and that son of hers the policeman he stole more from those houses than my ben ever did some of the possessions listed as missing we never had but there was no way to prove what we suspected that bitch betrayed me to save her precious george and he went and killed himself from shame it got her back a little for him to die almost the same week as my ben i didnt see any reason why with both of them dead i couldnt use them the way theyd used us hamish broke in you canna be sure thats the truth either rutledge said you could have told one of usone of the officers here to find evidencewhat you suspected not without letting on that we knew which hed stolen and which he hadnt we was afraid to george was a policemanwho would have listened to the likes of us she raised her head and stared at him you can still set this to rights with a little help we could still clear my ben why is it so important to you i told youmy children look at that girl of mine and tell me i was wrong and what about the letter for the second time that evening her face turned gray with shock her lips tightened she said nothing hamish already ahead of rutledge said that letter wasna to her it was to her deid husband you might as well tell me rutledge said ive guessed most of it bens cousin who went to australia is coming home and you thought he might be willing to help you if you could prove youd been wronged she glared angrily at him thats charity then what did this man want he didnt want anything neville was dying and he wrote to ben to tell him that hed always admired him for staying home and making a good life for himself here carrying on the family name with pride he was ashamed of the way hed spent his own youth and he said god had punished him for that taking his son at gallipoli we never even knew hed married but he must have and he took the loss of his son hard and he wanted to leave his money all of it a whole bloody fortune to benfor old times sake her bleak redrimmed eyes stared at rutledge daring him to pity her ben predeceased him he began thats right you cant leave money to a dead man but if i could prove that hed been wrongfully hanged if i could show hed have been alive still if he hadnt been taken from us i thought i might stand a chance at the inheritance neville didnt know you seehe hadnt kept up with ben or us he hadnt ever heard of margaret and young ben he was leaving it all to ben and ben was dead and thats when you decided to risk claiming youd found the locket next door in mrs cutters possession i was afraid if it all went wrong the police might think id taken it and id be clapped in jail but then i heard you was back at the yard and i thought if i got to mr rutledge he might listen to me with georges suicide it was easy to believe janet cutters son was guilty of something and with her stroke coming when it did it would be easy to think she knew more than she should and was guilty of letting ben die in her sons place hamish said mrs shaw nearly succeeded it was wrong of you rutledge began wrong be damned she cried with a little of her old blazing spirit it was my family i cared about wouldnt you fight for yours if you had to hamish reminded him you fought for your menbut you didna fight for me rutledge retorted you refused to listenyou preferred to die struggling to collect his thoughts he said aloud if you spoke to a lawyer and wheres the money for that to come from i ask you i could scarcely pay for my way to marling much less hire a solicitor who knows his arse from his elbow i was desperate and something in your face when i came into your room at the yard made me think youd listen that i could make you believe in ben she had nearly done it she had shaken him to the core and driven him to listen to her demands to ask questions to revive at least in his own mind the trial that had left its mark on so many people it was a near run thing hamish was saying with yon matthew sunderland ill and the constable guilty of theft and mrs cutter knowing what hed done it might ha turned out differently differently yes rutledge answered silently but it was still ben shaw who put the pillows over the faces of defenseless women and smothered them then why did ye no uncover the rest of the story at the time because when george peterson was taken on he hadnt told the yard that his mother remarried nobody knew of his relationship to mrs cutter because he and his stepfather didna see eye to eye it was one explanation there might have been other reasons who could say what had tormented george peterson as if shed heard rutledges thoughts nell shaw said i never knew what possessed george but something did he was always looking for somethingsomewhere to belong he was like one of them icebergs you never saw what was below the surface only the little bit at the top she looked across at her daughter forgotten in the anguish of the last hour margaret was quietly crying lost in misery you shouldnt have heard any of this poppet im that sorry rutledge left half an hour later as he came out into the street he found henry cutter standing by the motorcar staring up at the shaw house whats happened he asked his face pale and shaken i heard such terrible screams whats happened mrs shaw wasnt well her daughter sent for me for the police cutter asked frowning not the doctor he came and went rutledge said but this wasnt within his province i dont think shes ever got over what happened to ben no he was on the point of telling cutter about the locket instead he asked as if merely curious she told me that your stepson also was troubled beyond the ordinary i never understood him janet claimed i never tried but he made it too difficult and i gave up i thought everything would be better after hed killed himself but it wasnt it killed my wife too that and shaws hanging she took that hard she had airs and graces my wife did in some ways she should have married shaw not me ive always been a plain man he looked up at the brightly lit windows again are you sure theyre all right rutledge would have liked to tell him the truth but again he stopped himself you might call in the morning and ask if theres anything they need cutter said doubtfully i dont know rutledge moved around him to crank the motorcar and then climbed behind the wheel no i dont expect you do he said in resignation and after a moment drove away he stopped at the end of the quiet street and rubbed his face with his hands his eyes burned his very soul felt dry and warped remembering the question that brereton asked himabout the secrets he uncovered in peoples lives and how he dealt with themhe thought i cant pass judgment on what nell shaw wanted to do hamish replied her husband sowed the wind and she reaped the whirlwind it was a very blackandwhite interpretation of tragedy and in its way true rutledge dropped his hands to the wheel again ill speak to lawrence hamilton he might be able to help her its no your business the murders in kent are the murders in kent he ought to be pleased that he hadnt been wrong in his judgment of ben shaw but that was no consolation nor did it offer insight into these other deaths or a sense of purpose and renewed dedication there was only emptiness judgment had its well of sorrow and compassion had its pitfalls all the same he was glad he hadnt walked away from nell shaw as he might have done it would have been the cowards way for a moment he considered going to his sisters house in the city and staying the night there it would offer him peace and a little comfort but before the evening was over he was afraid hed blurt out raleigh masterss accusation about frances and richard mayhew and that was not to be borne tonight instead he turned toward kent and his empty hotel room where only hamish shared his mind that was where he ought to be in the event there was no sleep to be had dowling had left a message under his door the chief constable called tonight after you left wanting to speak with you he believes theres sufficient evidence against this dutchman to charge him with the murders its out of our hands rutledge read the words again and then crumpled the sheet of paper into a ball damn them all he thought five minutes later instead of trying to sleep in his bed he was walking to the police station and asking the constable on duty for the key to the prisoners cell if hauser had been asleep he showed no signs of it as rutledge unlocked the door wait ill find the lamp the german said and after a moment light bloomed in the dark room shadows falling across rutledges face good god man you look worse than i do hauser exclaimed i live an exciting life as you will shortly the chief constable is preparing to charge you with the murders of three men on your evidence theres damned little of that no on circumstantial evidence theres wine in the cellars but theres no laudanum i poured that out before i left the house yesterday morning and threw the bottle into a field on my way into marling rutledge laughed bitterly i never meant for it to convict you no i know you didnt im beginning to get the measure of you i wish i could say the same for you rutledge answered the problem is youre an honest man and you know that i am not i am safe in believing you but you may find yourself in trouble if you believe me exactly did you kill those men there are no witnesses here not even outside the door and any confession is your word against mine a good barrister could claim that i had very good reasons to want to see you convicted elizabeth god i hope she wont come into this she has already dowling has found out that she lunched with you at the hotel one day and has been seen several times speaking to you they will say i used her to buy respectability yes all right if you want me to swear im innocent i shall on my brothers soul his face was sober the blue eyes intense in the lamplight hamish pressed do you believe him rutledge answered does it matter aloud he added tell me does this cup of yours exist there are records in my family letters i can probably prove it was with me during the first years of the war if someone can track down the men serving under me but that would lead to the truth that my brother died after the cup was taken from me it gives me a reason for murdering exsoldiers from kent who were in the unit that captured me better to believe i was here searching my family connection with england youve made a tangle of your life so i have hauser answered regretfully but then i expected to be gone in a few days find ridger demand the cup be returned and home again it seemed quite simple when i borrowed my cousins papers rutledge turned back to the door is there anythinganything at all you can tell me about these dead men hauser rubbed his jaw with the tips of his fingers feeling the beard there ive thought of little else shut away in here elizabeth was right you know i should have taken the train to london and the next boat to holland it would help if youd seen something suspicious out there wandering around in the dark i couldnt even identify the man who stabbed me but think about this if you offer a man a drink that is drugged a drink hes not accustomed tothis wine of yourshow would you go about it id have a drink first myself to show the bottle was safe thats because youre aware that its drugged no you would offer him the wine to keep out the cold you may have driven these roads but you havent walked them long after dark as i did at first the exercise warms you and then you begin to feel tired your shoulders ache and then your face grows cold and your hands the feet last youd be glad of a drink by and by i cursed myself for not bringing a flask with me it was an interesting approach all right anything else hauser yawned youre the policeman youll think of something rutledge slept hard when he awoke to a cold and raw thursday morning he lay in his bed trying to bring his mind to bear on the days work ahead as he shaved he sorted through all the possible motives that he had uncoveredhausers revenge for ridgers actions guilt compassion and a pure and callous evil not the work of a madman nor of a passionate man but of a wary one what drove ordinary people to the point of murder he considered the three women who had been married to the victims had there been some collusion among them to rid themselves of a husband who had become a stranger and a burden they hadnt bargained for in the glamorous exciting days of sending a soldier off to fight the hun if so they had concealed it very well and yet mrs taylor had called her husband a stranger mrs webber had confessed to rutledge that her husband had been unfaithful in france mrs bartlett spoke of being afraid to be alone but perhaps she preferred it in some objective and welldisguised corner of her mind how easy would it be to kill your own husband or had they drawn lots each taking on the responsibility for a man not their own was that why the deaths had occurred on a dark road at night was the wine a gamble that had sucked the victim into conspiring at his own death yere avoiding yon crawford woman im doing what i have been sent here to do oh aye then ill talk to mrs crawford i wont destroy a friendship on a whim as it happened rutledges first item of business was a brief encounter with lawrence hamilton they had met in the triangular square within touching distance of the cavaliers broad back what brings you to marling at this hour rutledge asked after greeting him hamilton shrugged an errand of mercy i expect elizabeth has asked me to act for this man dowling is holding for the murders indeed im not happy about it but elizabeth was adamant and distraught do you know what this is all about lydia is very worried i can tell you its elizabeths place to answer that not mine the man dowling is holding is trying to keep her out of it he carefully avoided giving hauser a name whats between them how serious is it hamilton prodded theres nothing between them as far as i know i think elizabeth isinfatuated yes i gathered that and the man hes not what you expect in other circumstanceswho knows well damn the war anyway if richard had come home this wouldnt have happened as he started to drive on toward the station rutledge laid a hand on the car ive a favor of my own to ask whats that a mrs shaw london sansom street shes got no money and probably no hope of any its about a will she needs someone to act on her behalf to protect her childrens interests hamilton chuckled youre a dangerous man rutledge do you realize that i havent known you a month and now im dragged into a murder case and asked to take on a questionable will rutledge smiled and it touched his eyes lighting them from within yes well were neither of us in the law for peace of mind richard always said you were a philosopher with that he drove on leaving his motorcar in the hotel yard as he walked through the gate up to the webbers door rutledge found himself thinking of peter and his younger sister what would become of them if their mother was a murderess would they suffer as the shaw children had done or were there relatives to take them in and give them comfort this was the distasteful part of his work on the other hand who had spoken up for the dead men who had heard their voices dowling was more concerned with a killer on his patch than he was with men who had slipped into oblivion they were a blot on his record and one to be removed rutledge knocked lightly on the door it was monday morning and susan webber sleeves rolled up was elbow deep in her tubs she greeted him with surprise and said drying her arms on her apron im just finishing the wash im sorry to interrupt i must ask a few more questions she led him into the room where they had talked before sitting stiffly in a chair facing him hamish said youd think she had a guilty conscience but rutledge put her nervousness down to talking to the police at all you told me you couldnt think of anyone who might harm them your husband or the other men and you were not prepared to believe your husband had killed himself yes thats right what for kenny knew we had little enough with him alive youd managed throughout the war without him perhaps it would be easier to go on that way she stared at him bringing up two children without a man go and speak with bobby nesters wife he died of the gas and shes making do as best she can shed dreaded the day when he was gone and shed got nothing and nobody or try talking with my peter when he wants to leave school and help me and im telling him that schooling is his only way out of this life people have been good to us and im not denying it kenny would have been proud of that but its not the same itll never be the same again wholl marry a woman with two growing children and take on that burden there was a sincerity in her voice that made him ashamed of how little a grateful countrya warbankrupted countrycould do for its soldiers and their families but with hundreds of thousands dead and so many wounded to care for proper compensation was out of the question even a pittance was better than nothing its part of my duty to ask unpleasant questions he told mrs webber inspector dowling would have done it better no she said tiredly he wouldnt have asked at all but then he knows me and peggy bartlett and alice taylor or thinks he does she smiled faintly yes theres that too i understand inspector but i didnt kill my husband whats between us is between us or was better or worse the vows read and i didnt make it easy for kenny to kill himself either whoever did that never thought about those kenny was leaving behind did he i expect the one you want doesnt have children to bring up or hed have thought of us before handing the wine to our men at one time i was fairly certain that jimsy ridger had a hand in it that one jimsy always lands on his feet his kind generally does i cant see him coming back to marling were none of us good enough for him now jimsy did well in the war i expect kenny told me once that jimsy found a teakettle full of gold buried in among the onions in some frenchies garden i expect its true though kenny swore he never saw it luck follows the jimsy ridgers of this world not always rutledge told her ive learned that he drowned in the thames and is buried in maidstone did he now she said with some surprise something in her face changed what i wouldnt have given to be there at his funeral rutledge had no better luck with peggy bartlett or alice taylor though mrs taylor was more unsettled by his questions i dont understand why youd want to believe any such thing it isnt what i believe he answered its what i must do ask unpleasant questions and suggest unpleasant possibilities yes well you must be desperate to think one of us turned murderer i am desperate he admitted i need to find the truth before theres another death i heard theres someone taken in charge if thats true why are you wasting time over the likes of me because the evidence against him is not satisfactory whose fault is that she demanded not mine rutledge drove from his last call the bartlett house toward melinda crawfords home on the sussex border she was in a chair by the windows watching the play of light across the lawns and the distant downs its very beautiful she said turning as shanta ushered him into the sitting room i dont know why ive seen far more exotic landscapes in my time how is elizabeth i dont know he sat down in the chair she indicated and closed his eyes will you answer a question honestly of course you know that he opened his eyes she saw the wretchedness in them and caught her breath for an instant was there ever anythinganything between richard mayhew and my sister she regarded him for a moment who told you there was elizabeth idrather not answer that not yet melinda crawford said i can tell you truthfully that i never saw any relationship between them that exceeded the bounds of friendship i think they cared greatly for each other but that was all he couldnt be sure whether it was a denialor an affirmation that she herself had not witnessed any untoward relationship in spite of her own doubts it troubled him its not precisely the answer i wanted to hear he said after a moment are you asking me if they were lovers yes he replied baldly i dont know ian but i can tell you that they never gave me any cause to suspect them of misbehavior she smiled my dear do you think either frances or richard would be so stupid as to arouse suspicion if they were intent on adultery id always wondered why frances hadnt married it never occurred to me that she couldnt marry the man she loved ian who told you this you must always consider the source when theres malicious gossip thats just it i have and i dont believe it i dont want to believe it but its there a worm niggling in the back of my head and i cant walk away from it someone has set out to hurt you i ask you again was it elizabeth no if shed even suspected i think id have guessed shes not a very good liar well that makes me feel a great deal more cheerful she glanced out the window again and then said and the murderer have you found him yet not yet there was a wariness in his voice he couldnt prevent it and our german friend i havent got any name to put forward in place of his the chief constable is eager to close the investigation and he will after that its all in the hands of the courts who is taking the brief elizabeth has asked hamilton mrs crawford nodded yes a good choice i do rather wish shed asked raleigh masters surprised rutledge said i thought his health had forced him to give up his practice so it did but he needs such a challenge right now it might be the salvation of him at the germans expense rutledge answered ruefully why are you so ambivalent about this man am i he asked startled i think you are ive never known you to be indecisive what did you do to hauser in the war i nearly got him killed he answered getting up to pace the room but he didnt die did he no then you dont owe him a life do you i expect i dont except perhaps my own for what thats worth have you a stronger suspect than hauser no yes she smiled youll do the right thing ian you always do but how could he he thought when the choice could very well lie between this woman he cared so much for and a man he didnt want to see hanged it was late afternoon when rutledgereached marling and he found three messages waiting for him at the hotelfrantic requests from inspector dowling for his immediate presence without preamble dowling said as rutledge walked into his office thank god youre here theres been another murder well take your motorcar if you dont mind where who is the victim he was already following dowling through the office door down the passage to the street mr brereton im afraid out the marling road the house where he lives has been turned upside down and theres blood everywhere where have you been when did you learn about this not a quarter of an hour ago a man called adams delivering firewood for the winter reported it ive been trying to reach inspector grimes in seelyham to ask him to block the road north sergeant burke has already put men at the crossroads and im damned shorthanded and this morning we had to let that dutchman gomr hamilton is that clever he even spoke to the chief constable and in the end we had no choice but to agree to release him where is the man now they had reached the hotel and were walking swiftly around to the yard god knows sergeant burke saw mr hamilton at the plough but he was alone that was at noon did this man adams see the body so far all the murders have been at night on the road its a different pattern its different yes but id lay odds its the same killer who else could it be marling is not so cosmopolitan that we can boast of two murderers running amok in the same month he cranked the motorcar for rutledge and climbed in adams didnt search the house and rightly so he came straight here crying murder sergeant burke is at the crossroads and ive sent weaver to fetch dr pugh it will be crowded in the back but we can take them up with us rutledge driving out into the square said no dowling said be sensible man we need them adams carried burke to the crossroads and hell be staying there with another man but where would hamish sit rutledge fought down sheer panic reminding himself that it was an illogical reaction hamish lived in his head however often the voice seemed to come from just behind his shoulder and yet he was so accustomed to the reality of hamish in the seat behind him that he couldnt breathe at the thought of men crowding him out sending the dead scot to jostle with dowling for space in front rutledge had lived in dread for three years that he would turn one day and come face to face with the voice whose owner he never saw that no one heard that was the nemesis in his mind it took a formidable act of will to accept dowlings proposition they found the young constable weaver his face shiny with nervous sweat standing at the gate to the doctors surgery and even as they drew up and the constable stepped into the motorcar pugh came running out his door bag in hand to join him in the rear seat dr pugh was a slim man in his fifties with a high forehead and an air of competence ive had to put off the rest of my patients he said i hope this isnt a mad scramble for nothing weaver says adams didnt see the body they drove quickly out of marling and at the crossroadswhere harry bartlett had been killed the night rutledge was driving elizabeth mayhew home from the hamiltons partyhe could recall clearly the germans face in his headlamps eyes wide and alarmed where was hauser now burke nodded to the two men manning the block across the road and climbed into the motorcar beside the doctor rutledge could feel the springs dip under burkes weight and he felt too the claustrophobic sense of humanity crowding in around him cutting off escape and air thrusting hamish into the forefront of his brain burke was saying its not likely well find our man at the cottage sir by now hes more than likely well on his way to wherever it is he goes to earth thats as may be dowling answered sharply but this is the closest weve been to him well make the best of it silence fell and the sound of the motor was clear in the fading light a reminder of speed but not fast enough to satisfy rutledge as hamish grumbled incessantly from the direction of sergeant burkes lap rutledge drove grimly increasing his speed in spite of the wet and rutted road he had passed fields several farms and was coming up on the small stand of trees that led to breretons cottage when dowling said we ought to pull up here no need to spoil whatever prints may be there rutledge stopped the car and waited as they all alighted as the cool air blew through the open vehicle he could feel relief sweeping over him as if a veil were being lifted the chiding voice in his head subsided and he shook himself like a dog half a shiver half a shudder getting out to follow the others he kept his eyes on the road among the wagon tracks droppings imprints of tires and the footprints of a man in heavy boots there was nothing of interest their killer would have been too clever to leave his mark in the mud when he could walk on the grassy vergehed already shown himself to be careful and elusive adept at escaping detection rutledge caught the other men up as they turned in the gate the bicycle was gone and he pointed this out to inspector dowling then hes well ahead of us im afraid dowling answered with a sigh the door was ajar apparently the way adams had left it in his haste to report to the police a neat stack of firewood covered with a tarpaulin stood to the east of the house and adams must have looked in to ask for his money after delivering it as they began to push the door wider lucinda came to greet them her tail high as she made a sound of welcome sergeant burke scooped her up and held her against his chest as he stepped into the cottage the room was not wrecked as rutledge had expected but there were unarguable signs of a strugglebooks scattered a lamp and chairs overturned a table on end and what appeared to be blood drying in front of the hearth lucinda had stepped in it at some point her prints led across the patch and back onto the bare floorboards there was also a smear of blood on one wall and streaks on an overturned chair drops scattered here and there as dark spots on polished surfaces and the floor of brereton alive or dead there was no sign but most telling was a bottle of wine spilled on the table and running down to puddle on the edge of a bit of carpeting two glasses sat next to the bottle one of them still a quarter full as sergeant burke putting down the cat moved heavily toward the other rooms calling breretons name dr pugh saw the wine and went over to lift it sniffing the contents laudanum rutledge asked i shouldnt be surprised but ill have to test it to be sure the doctor put out a finger as if considering tasting the wine in the glass then prudently changed his mind dowling was squatting by the pool of blood on the hearth weaver following burke looked rather green rutledge said judging by the blood weve seen so far how seriously wounded was brereton it would depend on where the wound was located not an artery of course theres no pattern to show that still pugh turned to walk on into the kitchen and stopped short look it would appear someone dragged himself across the floor here burke was already examining the drying streaks but they stop just outside the kitchen door there he pointed out and mr breretons body isnt in the house rutledge stepped around the doctor and looked at the smears were they drag marks where something heavy had been pulled toward the door or had someone crawled half dragging himself toward the only means of escape the question is he said wheres brereton trying to hide in the woodsor already half buried in the leaves somewhere out there would the killer have taken the time to hide a corpse or was he interrupted by adams arriving on the scene and brereton got away inspector dowling scanning the trees beyond the garden said well need a score of men to search out there sergeant burke reminded his inspector we cant wait for a search party he might be bleeding to death right now dr pugh said ill make a cursory search with the constable at his heels he stepped beyond the smears and out the door moving along the grassy path that bordered the small kitchen garden and the herb bed stopping at a garden shed pugh peered inside pulling the door open only as far as needed he looked up again at the men in the kitchen shaking his head taking care to observe where he put his feet he moved rapidly toward the boundary of the cottage and the beginning of the wood nothing so far he called to the watching men i cant see anything to indicate theres been a body dragged along here stilleven if brereton had passed out he might have come to his senses and managed to walk away under his own power burke stepped back into the house the odd thing is he said that this attack happened well before dark today not like the others sir should someone be sent along to mr masterss house to be sure theres been no trouble there its little more than a mile by the road with servants in the house sergeant they shouldnt be in immediate danger our priority right now is brereton unless theres a path that brereton might have taken through the woods trying to reach help burke shouted the question to weaver still searching and got the reply no sir no path that i can see unsatisfied burke said ill just have a look on my own sir as its getting on toward dark rutledge crossed to the sink in the kitchen and saw that there were no dishes waiting to be washed up possibly indicating that brereton cleared away after his luncheon and the stove was banked but then brereton often dined with the masterses rather than make his own evening meal the buffer between raleighs temper and his wifes anxiety a high price for a good dinner he tried to picture the scene as it might have occurred had brereton answered the door expecting to find adams arriving with the wood and instead was greeted by someone else standing there smiling and expecting to be invited in hamish said you canna tell the fires no lit he may have been in the garden clearing out a place for the wood rutledge called to dowling who was inspecting the rest of the house how trustworthy is this man adams completely id say church sexton thirty years a farmer his sister is the housekeeper to the rector id as soon believe sergeant burke was a murderer lucinda came to rub against rutledges legs recognizing a familiar scent shes verra calm hamish said yes id observed that as well rutledge answered him thoughtfully but then whatever happened here is over theres nothing to frighten her nowno loud noises no angry raised voices burke coming back through the kitchen door reported if theres a path i cant find it dr pugh following him added theres no sign of breretonand i called out identifying myself weaver is still searching but the light has gone and its dark under the trees cleaning his feet on the scraper by the kitchen door he walked back into the sitting room and shook his head as he studied the signs of struggle ive met tom brereton hes come to me on mrs masterss behalf a number of times and i know of course about losing his eyesight all the same he was a soldier and id say he was well able to defend himself unlike the other victims who had to deal with crutches hurt of coursetheres the blood in the sitting room still even assuming he drank any of that drugged wine he must have inflicted some damage of his own but where is he now rutledge said thinking aloud we dont know how badly his attacker was hurt do we brereton might well have turned the tables and gone after him sergeant burke was making notes a rough diagram of the house then the sitting room sketched in and an x marking the location of each visible bloodstain he said mr breretons a clever man he would have come directly to inspector dowling and reported the identity of his assailant my guess is he was dragged into the kitchen while adams was stacking the wood and then was carried off to hide the body as weaver walked back into the house burke added well have to have that stack of wood taken down weaver get on it man dowling coming back into the sitting room nodded i agree but hamish who had spent the last ten minutes arguing in rutledges head did not he talked to you about the wine he reminded rutledge he would ha been suspicious as soon as he saw it rutledge standing to one side was reviewing his last conversation with brereton in light of hamishs adamant stand he had wondered then if brereton in his roundabout fashion was making a confession if the man was already contemplating disappearing would he have staged his own death it would have had the opposite effect another murder would have galvanized the police into furious action it would be far simpler to say that he needed more specialized eye care and to make arrangements with raleigh and bella masters for the care of the cottage and of the cat no very likely brereton was what he seemed a victim but why in the daylight rutledge came again to that question and hamish answered it here its as isolated as anywhere on the road and i canna believe hed open his door after dark but in the daylight he wouldhe did when you called he had all his limbs aye but he was going blind nearly as bad as losing a legif the murderer canna abide the sairly wounded but why would hauser come here and slaughter brereton was he truly searching for jimsy ridger or had that been a ruse from the start rutledge walked through the house again looking with care at the scene in the sitting room dowling was searching now for the weapon poking about behind the furniture looking in the hearth brereton would have let the german into the house if hauser had used elizabeths name yet the bottle of wine would have put him instantly on his guard he himself had told rutledge that wine was key to the investigation unless elizabeth had sent hauser to brereton surely against hamiltons orders to stay out of it and brereton jealous himself had brought out the wine he fetched raleigh masterss medicines for mrs masters laudanum for pain and the moodiness hamish suggested rutledge turned to dr pugh did you prescribe laudanum for mr masters pugh watching the drawing burke was completing said with some surprise dr talbot in london prescribed it among other drugs it was agreed id see that the supply was replenished as needed going back to harley street so frequently was difficult for mrs masterssadly her husband sometimes refused to allow it breretonvictimor murderer either way melinda crawford would be distressed she had intended to remember brereton in her will because of his approaching blindness pitying him as she had once pitied peter webbers father and taken the tired exsoldier to his house in her carriage hamish said aye one soldier will trust another brereton would find it easier than most to walk a distance with a man on crutches and then offer him a drink to pass the time it was falling into place rutledge felt an urgent need to find elizabeth mayhew and make certain she was safe dowling had finished his search rutledge said to him im going back to marling is there anything or anyone you need to be brought back here dowling turned to pugh doctor are you ready to go back ive already missed my afternoon hours ill stay until we are sure brereton doesnt need me weavers just finishing up ill send him with you rutledge he can find us some six or a dozen men to walk through the wood back there theyll need to bring lanterns oil all the torches they can lay hand to if mr breretons out there somewhere the sooner we find him the better alive or dead the young constable was silent most of the way back to marling tired and grubby from unstacking the wood he picked at a splinter in the palm of his hand looking up once to say to rutledge in disbelief weve not been away more than an hour after a bit he added i was glad not to uncover him amongst the wood the others were asleep like not bloody do you think hes dead then rutledge busy with his own thoughts had no wish for conversation but he said remembering janet cutters son george who had not liked touching dead bodies i wish i knew he dropped constable weaver at the police station and then drove on to elizabeth mayhews house she greeted him with open hostility hes not here i dont know where he is lawrence made me promise id not try to contact him i ought to hate you no he said with more gentleness than he felt at least she was safeyou know i havent had much choice in any of this you cant blame duty for callousness he let it go elizabeth tom breretons missing her face tightened with shock what do you mean missing just that the cottage is empty theres furniture overturned blood everywhere and no sign of him or of whoever came to call on him and theres a bottle of wine on the table most of it spilled out onto the floor but theres probably enough left to tell us if anything has been added to it because of his blindness but i thought only amputees were being killed her hands covered her mouth i dont understandhave you come for gunter againbecause of tom ive come on my own inspector dowling is still at the cottage and theyre searching the wood that lies behind it the problem is we dont know anything at this stage but people will start pointing fingers soon and it would be much better if i found hauser myself rather than wait for dowling to do it times short you see and the longer it takes to catch up to him the more suspicious it will look i tell you lawrence forbade me to speak to him then ill go find hamilton take me with you before he could argue she ran for her coat and came back again pulling it on with urgency hamish reminded him better under your eye it was true as they got into the motorcar elizabeth said ian im sorry lately weve been at each others throats and i think its worry and the strangeness of all of this business and the fear he thought but didnt say aloud she wouldnt hear a word against hauser in her foolish certainty that he was all she believed him to be but beneath that determined defense was rutledge knew the niggling fear that she could be wrong when he didnt at first respond she went on i love you dearly i always have i always will but im not richards wife any longer we cant go back to that old comfortable life againand you cant protect me from the consequences of his death i have to make my own way then she added forlornly its just that nothing seems to be working out the way it shouldnothing seems to be right lydia admitted them to the hamilton house startled by rutledges grimness and the pallor of elizabeths face she led them to the room that hamilton used for his study and after a nod from her husband went out again shutting the door behind her without preamble rutledge said do you know where i can find your client he said he was going to maidstone something about searching there for a relatives grave jimsy ridgers more than likely or looking for any of ridgers surviving family who might have that damned cup is he coming back here hes promised to return in the morning lawrence hamilton pulled out his watch and looked at the face its a long journey he was hoping to find a lorry or a carter going that direction why whats happened its brereton hes missing and therere indications of a violent struggle in his cottage the police are there now mounting a search i want to find hauser before inspector dowling thinks about looking for him good god hamilton was on his feet staring at rutledge youre not telling me that this man could have anything to do with brereton going missing elizabethyou assured me he was perfectly respectable elizabeth said ive already been through this with ian no he just thinks its best to find him over her head rutledges eyes met hamiltons keep her here he ordered ill know where to reach you both yes yes i understand youll send word as soon as you can as soon as theres anything to tell you he turned and was gone leaving behind him a flurry of questions elizabeths voice higher with worry lydia coming in begging someone to explain what had happened hamish said as rutledge put on his headlamps yere no going to maidstone youll never find him no ive a feeling he may be closer than that where he was before the morton house rutledge went back to the crossroads and turned for the morton estate on the seelyham road in the distance behind him he could see the lights of another vehicleweaver very likely ferrying men back and forth to breretons cottage in commandeered motorcars rutledge turned through the stone gates driving to the stableyard and leaving his motorcar in the shadow of one of the sheds the grass was still thick and high around it in the beams of his headlampsthe morton motorcar was still inside as he switched the lamps off it seemed that absolute darkness fell blacker than before there was no moon and the night was quiet the crows long since gone to roost in trees beyond the house were silent and the house loomed black bulky and uninviting walking briskly he went to the kitchen door inspector dowlingor someonehad latched it more securely now working by feel he spent several minutes on the length of wire until he had it open if hauser was indeed here hed already heard the motorcar coming up the drive hed be waiting but not in the kitchen otherwise hed never have rewired the door so firmly rutledges efforts had given him time to prepare to select his own arena for confrontation if he was here and not in maidstone minding his own business the kitchen was in darkness hauser its rutledge he stood there listening to his words trapped against the walls and ceiling there was no response after a time he began to move around the room his probing hands outstretched found the lamp it was cold when he touched the chimney the matches were just beside it nearly tripping over a chair as he stepped closer to work with the shade and the wick rutledge swore silently light bloomed a bright and golden glow that sent the shadows in the kitchen fleeing into corners there was no sign of occupation in this room no food on the table the pitcher back on the sideboard where it belonged the bedding returned to whatever room it had come from but then a man like hauser wouldnt be caught twice like a rat in a hole rutledge waited until the wick had caught well and then he took up the lamp and moved out into the passage he could hear his own breathing in the confined space swinging open the door he said again hauser its rutledge the light preceded him out into the hall picking out the sheets and the shrouded furnishings giving an odd life to the long flight of stairs and to the rooms he walked into one after another he was clearly visible in the aura of the lamp and took care to give no appearance of hostility it was an eerie experience the silence fraught with nothing the urgent whisper of hamishs voice in his head his quiet footfalls as he moved slowly carefully examining any place large enough to hide someone the lamp was growing heavier in his hand the heat warming his face anyone in the kitchen could have heard him fumbling with the latchanyone in the house would have heard him stumbling against the chair and there were many ways to disappear here if hauser was innocent why should he hide but then hed learned to his cost that the police were not as sympathetic as elizabeth mayhew had been rutledge stood in the hall and called hausers name again then listened to the stillness around him after a moment he walked on methodically investigating making certain that each room was empty before moving on to the next he was beginning to think hed been wrong that hauser wasnt here rutledge climbed the stairs no longer on guard yet unwilling to stop until he was certain he went into the first of the bedrooms found nothing and moved on in the third deep inside a mans wardrobe was a small valise he set down the lamp and opened the bag inside were personal items clean clothing a pipe and some tobacco and a worn photograph of a smiling woman standing by the gate of a barnlike house her fair hair shining in the sun and documents in the name of one gunter manthy of the town of gronigen in holland on a square of paper someone had sketched a likeness of a chased silver cup with details laboriously added it was very convincing a propor an heirloom hauser had never really left this house he had given himself upbut he had concealed his belongings including the photograph where they wouldnt readily be found the safest place he could think of someone had cleared away the bedding and food in the kitchen to give the impression the house was no longer occupied allaying any suspicion that he might return which meant he expected to come back and retrieve his possessions had hauser gone to maidstone just as elizabeth believed he would in the slim hope that jimsy ridger had passed that silver cup on to someone in his family then whats become of brereton hamish asked if yon german is still alive and out of harms way a very pressing question now he was at the end of the passage on the second floor when he heard something the sound traveled far in the empty silent house hamish said softly ware brereton or hauser who had followed him here rutledge stayed where he was listening his hearing had of necessity been acute on the battlefield where sound was a betrayer and hamish had always heard what he could not he asked into the silence of his head where on the ground floor came the reply after a moment and as rutledge held his breath for an instant to listen more intently he heard it again thump at first it sounded as if someone had bumped into a chair in the darkas he himself had done in the kitchen and then as his brain processed the nature of the noise identified it documented and explained it he was not prepared to believe it his first reaction was no and yetit made a dreadful sense here was the hidden killer the murderer seemingly with no motive one not driven by familiar emotionsnot guilt nor compassion nor greed nor vengeance a hidden face turned inward toward a grief that had no means of expression and how in the scheme of things had that grief turned to murder hamish pressed are ye verra sure it has to be theres no other answer rutledge responded grimly we looked at the wine and not the laudanum we looked for any connection with victims and there was none we looked for opportunity and didnt see how it could be accomplished we told ourselves it was the darkness that matteredwe told ourselves it was the roadwe believed it had to do with men whod fought together and in the end it was none of these things it all came back to dying the sound came again a footfall too heavy to be concealed echoing through the silent house and rising up the open stairwell in the hall then yes aye rutledge stayed where he was furiously thinking through his experiences in marling chief superintendent bowles had been aware of his revived interest in the shaw caseand had laid his plans accordingly hed used the chief constable and raleigh masters to keep his eye on rutledge and hed isolated his troublesome inspector in kent where he could do no harm but it had backfired this stirring up of passions and fears raleigh masters whose own obsession was matthew sunderland had been primed to dislike and distrust the man sent down from london and hed had no qualms about showing it publicly but the fear that drove raleigh masters had nothing to do with matthew sunderland raleigh masters had already suspected who the killer was and had done his best to throw rutledge off the scent a subtle legal minds misdirection it had succeeded admirably because rutledge had been thoroughly blinded by nell shaws vehement determination driven and cornered and harangued into half believing her web of lies hed been distracted by gunter hauser and elizabeth mayhew by that sudden return of a missing part of his memory and the truth about the end of his own war he had been vulnerable and masters the wily barrister had recognized that but what had raleigh masters seen that he hadnt a multitude of small signs the first withering of the spirit eyes that looked away a silence where there had been conversation an empty bed the sound of a motorcar in the night little wonder that rutledge had missed them he hadnt been privy to them and whenever there was a chance that he might see too much hed been passionately attacked by masters driving him out he set the lamp down in the room nearest him where the door was still ajar and with great care he closed it behind him shutting off the light walking with the quiet tread of a soldier accustomed to the stealth of night attacks rutledge went down the passage and then descended the flight of stairs to the first floor the darkness seemed absolute after the brightness of the lamp and he could feel like pressing ghosts the presence of someone else standing below him looking up toward him from the hall rutledge the voice was pitched to carry im here so you are there was an inflection of satisfaction odd place to find you i couldnt think why youd come here but it suited me well enough too did you follow me with great difficulty im afraid yes and id seen you outside the gates before this if you remember the grass was beaten down rutledge began to descend the stairs do you know where brereton is its my blood not his flung around the sitting room if thats what youre asking i believe he went up to london on a private matter last week hed mentioned something to that effect it had slipped my mind where is she id like you to see for yourself what did you do with the lamp i could follow it through the windows its in a room upstairs a delaying tactic if you will leave it then you must drive ive done all that i can this day rutledge came down the last half dozen steps in the darkness the face of raleigh masters was shadowed with grief and pain a caricature of the man who had ruled courtrooms like his predecessor sunderland they walked together through the hall into the kitchen passage and out into the night masters was limping heavily leaning on his cane as if in great pain the night air smelled of damp as if rain was on the way underfoot the scurrying of mice rustled the leaves there was no wind the trees were stark against the black sky rutledge cranked the motorcar while masters heaved himself with difficulty into the passengers seat drawing his bad leg in after him the other vehicle stood halfway down the drive where masters had left it and rutledge was forced onto the lawns to drive around it did she use the motorcar offering them a lift and a little wine to keep out the cold i didnt know she could drive you always had someone do that she learned when my leg first began to trouble me porter the chauffeur is half senile we use him only when theres no one else they had turned out of the stone gates passing the tree where will taylor had been found neither man spoke of it after a time raleigh masters said i would like very much to kill you you know its strange to admit after years of serving the law that i could so easily break the most weighty of them its all too easy to kill rutledge answered remembering hamish that was the war its not the same rutledge didnt argue silence followed them the rest of the way at the brereton cottage a lonely constable stood guard touching his hat as he recognized rutledges car somewhere among the trees the search for brereton must be continuing but there was no sign of lights or men a mile or so farther on as he turned into the drive that led up to raleigh masterss house rutledge said tell me about brereton she went to kill him you know but he wasnt at home she believed after youd called on him that he must surely have witnessed her coming and going the wine was there on the table the first glass poured when i walked in shed just sat there waiting she looked so tired we argued and when i reached for the wine to pour it out her face seemed to fall apart like shattered porcelain it was rather horrible i tried to calm her down and instead she fought me like a tigress as if taking her fear and her grief and her anger out on me i was hardly her match and i really thought she intended to kill me there and then i fell twice and the last time i lay on the floor as still as i could until shed gone the scene violent and shocking was vivid in rutledges mind masters took a deep shuddering breath i suspected i didnt know but i suspected it was a practice for death yes she thoughtgod forgive hershe thought that it would be easier when they removed the rest of my leg just to end it but she wasnt sure how to go about that it took her two attempts before she got the mixture right the first man taylor was hours dyingshe told me this afternoon it must have been dreadful to watch and i had a nurseshe dared not risk arousing the womans suspicions by making me unexpectedly ill webber was easier but to make absolutely certain she tried again bartlett that was she chose men who were suffering as i was not someone who was healthyuntil brereton but there was his blindness you see it would have masked the real reason for killing him he stopped hamish demanded do you believe him then rutledge silently answered him ill see what his wife has to say first if shes coherent please god dr pugh is still at breretons cottage aye as the motorcar drew up in front of the house rutledge asked masters where are the servants is someone with her they were given the day off early on she didnt want them to see her walking down the drive to breretons cottage since porterour chauffeurwas gone as well i had to drive myself there which meant i had to put on this damned false foot and even so it was unbelievably difficult raleigh refused help getting out of the car his heel rang heavily against the metal frame as he tried to manage the long step to the ground swearing he stood there grimacing against the pain and then walked steadily up to the door of the house in the light from the hall shining through the narrow lancet windows by the door rutledge could see masterss hands clearly for the first time they were cut and bruised where he had tried to stave off blows his face was bloody from a head wound that was still oozing from under his hat and dripping down his temple to soak into his torn collar a slit cheek had swollen grotesquely acknowledging his stare masters said impassively she used my cane she took it from me and broke my grip with it when i tried to hold her rutledge said again where is she go on he replied wearily go in and see your handiwork i wish to god youd never set foot in kent he slumped against the doorframe his back to the house looking ready to drop there was no color in his skin except for the ugly streaks of blood but he watched with venomously cold eyes as rutledge opened and stepped through the door ware hamish warned the staircase ran up the center of the hall as it always had the glass cases of venetian splendor stood where they had always stood a beautiful room lighted with candles and lamps but as he looked up rutledge could see swinging slowly from a carefully fashioned noose the dead body of bella masters she had used the upper balustrade as her gallows and was hanging free in the stairwell her face shielded by her disheveled hair was turned away from him but her neck was broken the angle of her head seemed obscenely coquettish murderers hang the words ran through his mind like an epitaph it shook him as few things ever had for several minutes he stood there hamish silent at his shoulder simply looking up watching the pendulumlike motion of raleigh masterss wife aloud he asked did you do this it was hard to keep the anger out of his voice no while i was at breretons trying to collect my wits she came back here she did what she had to do then he said with difficulty my enemies would have enjoyed prosecuting her did she want you dead so very much i dont think it was that it was just that she knew me so very well and she was terrified at the end that it would be up to herdeciding when it would happen and so she tried to accustom herself to death and perfect the means of death she didnt want me to suffer instead she suffered for me his voice broke masters added after a moment it wasnt pity i dont think it was pity in her own way she saw it as love but there was doubt behind the tentative words he pushed himself away from the wall and started to walk awkwardly toward the motorcar for gods sake shut this door and leave her for tonight take me somewhere where no one knows me i cant i must report this take me to melinda crawford then while they do what must be done here rutledge forced himself to look away from bella masters the sight was already seared in his mind this was how ben shaw had looked and so many others but without the terrible indignity of the hangman and the warden and the witnesses im sorry it was all he could find to say he wasnt certain whether the apology was to bella masters or her husband he walked out of the hall and closed the door behind him masters said it doesnt matter you know the doctor told me the last time i was in london that the infection is moving quite rapidly i wont live to see christmas even if they cut off my leg its taken hold the gangrene brereton told me you were improved he wasnt in the room during the consultation and i lied to him afterward i didnt want bella to travel to london with me you see i didnt want bella to know the truth not yet not until id made peace with it myself i was afraid rutledge grateful for the blessed darkness of the drive asked why didnt you stop her if you knew what was happening in gods name why did you let it continue raleigh masters turned to face him across the bonnet of the motorcar i didnt know in the beginning not until webber was already dead the second victim she came up late to bed that night smelling of winedepressed on the verge of tears and thensuddenly i didnt want to know i didnt have the courage i told myself the time might come when i would be glad to drink wine by the fire and go to sleep forever but the time has come you see and its too late she was right i could never kill myself he opened the passenger door if theres any mercy left in you get me out of here but the lights from the hall seemed to pursue them down the drive until the trees finally blotted them out and still they blazed brightly behind each mans eyes
