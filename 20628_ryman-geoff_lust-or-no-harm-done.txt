geoff ryman lust or no harm done para o meu txay um livro dedicado a ti deveria ser intitulado amor ou no minimo sem escandalo eu prometi que nele tu nao te encontrarias mas tu estas em todo lugar in the bend god created the hen and the education and the education was without founder and void and death was upon the falsehood of the demand and the sport of god moved upon the falsehood of the wealth and god said let there be limit and there was limit a text produced from the book of genesis using a method invented by jean lescure in which each noun is replaced with the seventh noun following it in a dictionary as reported in oulipo compendium edited by harry matthews and alastair brotchie acknowledgement the experiment with chicks described in this novel is loosely based on a real experiment described in the making of memory by steven p rose part i so how does it start michael was happy it was the first day of his research project his team waited for him outside the gates of the lab in the march chill ebru emilio and hugh all smiled when they saw him it was a new lab in rooms within arches under a railway michael had the keys leading his team into one beautiful new room after another they moved their desks and wired up their computers they arranged staplers pens and envelopes in drawers determined that everything would stay tidy ebru had brought flowers and a traditional turkish shepherds cloak to hang on the wall she was one of michaels students doing a doctorate of her own and had been hired to help administer the project ebru had bet emilio a bottle of champagne that his new network would crash instead the network came triumphantly to life and they exchanged chiding emails and raised glasses of champagne to the start of their brave new project to continued funding toasted michael they all laughed the first shipment of eggs arrived in a box marked fragile computers this was to fox the animal rights activists the eggs were packed in grey foam like recording equipment ebru and michael laid them out in the darkroom on straw to hatch everything was in place this is going to work said michael in the evening michael went to his gym he saw tony tony was a trainer and michael had a crush on him tony was tall and sleek and so innocent in his manner that michaels nickname for him was the cherub tony had a radiant announcement to make i decided to take the plunge tony said jacqui and i are going to get married he had the eyes of a happy schoolboy aw thats fantastic well done said michael and they did an oldfashioned hand slap tonys hair was cut short and dressed in spikes everything about him took michael back to his youth tony talked a little bit about how he had realized he didnt want anyone else itll mean moving up north but hey shes worth it thats what i want thought michael i want a beautiful love inspired in his heart and in his belly michael decided to visit the sauna in alaska street the smell of the place hot pinewood steam and bodies produced an undertow of excitement as if something were pulling insistently downwards on his stomach naked men circulated in the steam in early evening stripped of his glasses and lab coat michael was tall and athletic a young sikh with his hair tied at the top of his head in a bun saw michael and did an almost comic double take he was hairy and running slightly to fat but the face michael suddenly saw was smooth as marble this was a young man with a fatherly body michael followed the sikh into the steam room with its benches the sikh looked at him with a teasing smile they moved towards each other michael didnt trust kissing he knew people often brushed their teeth before cruising brushing teeth always produced blood blood carried the virus when the boy leaned towards him michael turned his head away and pressed his cheek against his michael gave him quick dishonest pecks on the lips pretending to be romantic and playful instead of merely safe even this was enough for the young man they sat down and michael leaned back on the bench as they embraced briefly they made a shape together like a poster for gone with the wind then the sikh slipped lower and went to work work was the only word for it on michaels cock michaels cock stayed dead all the young mans ministrations only made it worse it retreated further back up and away not again thought michael not again it always happened and it was always worse than michael remembered it was always worse with someone he liked most especially it happened with people he liked the sikh stopped and looked up he turned down his mouth in a show of childish disappointment michael asked are you too hot would you like something to drink it was a way of saving face on the mezzanine there were free drinks in the fridge and smelly beanbags on the floor michael poured them each a glass of spring water perched on a beanbag like a buddha the boy shook down his long glossy hair and began to retie it michael wanted to take him home and watch him wind it in his turban michael passed him the water and the young man gave him a sharp little smile of thanks when michael lay down next to him the sikh stayed seated upright in his heart michael knew what that meant but yearning and hope persisted the young man talked politely he was a medical doctor a specialist in tropical diseases he had been working in africa and was back home to see his family his name was deep michael asked him did he work for medecins sans frontieres no i dont like those organizations they are too western they go there thinking they will show the natives how to do it but you know they have no experience of infectious disease i apply for the same jobs as the local doctors i learn more that way he was pleased to talk about his time there the lack of roads the digging of wells suddenly deep lay back and let michael rest his head on his fatherly bosom deeps breath smelled of liquorice you know i was working in a hospital in malawi by a lake i was sitting out by myself drinking a beer and i could see the animals come down to drink the deer and the lions and i could watch the deer as they kept watch they kept flicking their ears there was a moon on the lake id go there with you thought michael for just a moment he glimpsed another life he was by that lake with deep and they were together and michael was doing what michael was binding an antelopes broken shin michael ventured forth i uh have a boyfriend but he wont be there now i dont live very far from here despite his size dr deeps face was thin slightly cynical and it did not respond to the suggestion michael endeavoured would you like to come back with me dr deep shook his head im not what youre looking for oh oh but you are thought michael youre sure he asked and tried to engineer a winning smile dr deep was sure you know i have been very tired and tense coming back here to see my family im about to change countries again so i just came here for the sex they kissed and parted company deep was one of those perennial boys who only like older men over the next minutes michael watched dr deep kneel in front of one middleaged man after another his head bobbing away and then abruptly withdrawing like a bee gathering honey a medically trained bee who must know the risks the last michael saw of dr deep he was standing utterly alone having sucked off every older man who wanted sucking dr deep held up his towel masturbating on show only one person was watching but dr deep was looking pointedly away from michael its all you want michael thought in disappointment and if id been able to give you that would you have talked to me gone out to a movie with me become friends do you want to die that badly that you cant even take time to talk no one ever even talks no one ever rings back is a hard dick really that important to you faggots how could i be stupid enough to get emotional i know the score i cant get it up so i either put up or dry up i know what will happen it always happens and i always forget i always keep thinking its not that bad but it is that bad its like i think it will clear up by itself if i leave it alone like a sock that loses its other half you put it back in the drawer hoping itll find the other half by itself well im sorry im sorry that i look like such a big butch man wholl slap you and then fuck you silly im sorry that i got a bit romantic i wont do it again i keep forgetting what you guys are like michael dragged his ass back into his underwear and out to waterloo station and on the underground platform he cursed sex he cursed the need for it and how men wanted it he cursed being gay he cursed all other gay men he cursed his dick and he cursed himself as all the days happiness crushed around him like ruins in an aftershock he prayed or came as close to praying as he could get michael pleaded for all the weary dead weight of his sexual desire to be taken from him look just castrate me get rid of it please please just take it all away was a train coming wind blew along the platform a newspaper rose up by itself into the air and michael noticed that his gym instructor was standing a few feet away oh jesus not now thought michael he didnt want to see happiness he didnt want to see joy he looked at tony and thought all i want to do is see your dick there on the platform with fifteen other people tony pulled down first his tracksuit bottoms and then his clean white briefs the cherub stood still and exposed his bovine thighs and brown pubic hair on display his stare was as blank and disconnected as a sleepwalkers the people on the platform looked disconnected as well a greying man in a tan checked jacket glanced sideways and began to edge closer eyes flickering a woman searched her purse with immense concentration then tony sat down on the platform and rolled onto his back sticking the perfect bottom into the air like an animal about to be spayed oh jesus thought michael so much for innocence bitterness and rage were countered by another thought tony must be in trouble michael walked towards him he saw the chords of muscle on the inside leg and the head of the reasonably sized uncircumcised cock michael looked and then was sorry for looking tony gazed up at him eyes unfocussed dim with a halfformed question fancy a portion the cherub asked drugs michael decided he doesnt normally do drugs so hes gone and got what he thought was e only it was speed plaster of paris and battery acid tony what are you doing on the ground michael felt the eyes of the other people on the platform his ears burned he wanted them to know his intentions were honourable the cherub blinked his head haloed by the grey and white patterns of the platform paving stand up come on michael didnt want to touch him in public tony rolled to his feet he stood without adjusting his clothes facing the woman with the handbag she looked like she might pull it down over her head pull your trousers up thought michael and immediately the cherub bent down and nipped both layers of clothing back into place did you take anything do you remember what it was the mouth hung open the lips fatter when they were not smiling tonys brows clenched trying to find an answer i didnt take anything are you sure try to think what was it called tony nodded his head solemnly yes diclofenac he said for my knee michael was a biologist diclofenac was a powerful antiinflammation drug did it have side effects have you taken it before tony nodded yes again like a child the wind blew like a friend showing up the train rumbled out of the tunnel this is my train said michael trying to keep the tone conversational where are you going tony the cherub replied as if the answer were obvious with you it wouldnt be right to leave him michael looked up at the handbag lady and she looked away hastily the greying man looked miffed that michael had got there first michael pushed his way onto the train as others were getting off and tony followed him michael clenched the handrail almost as hard as he was clenching his teeth and looked around him two teenage indian boys were talking about cars or computers in a jargon he didnt understand a woman turned over a page of her crinkly newspaper as if toasting its other side and sniffed delicately none of them had seen the banquet of cherub laid out on the platform very suddenly normality closed over them the doors rolled shut the noise of the train provided an excuse not to talk as if it were embarrassed for them tony simply stared the flesh on his face slack like old hush puppy shoes there was definitely something wrong with him he squinted up at the advertising looking as if ads for blistex were beyond his mental age as the train approached goodge street michael wondered what on earth to do look tony i get off here will you be ok tony nodded yes the train stopped and the doors opened michael got off tony followed him do you want to see a doctor tony shook his head no michael could think of nothing else to do so he headed for the way out sign and the lift tony started to whistle in a kind of deranged echoing drawl i dont like this michael thought he said airily so do you live around here tony i live in theydon bois theydon bois was at the end of the central line this was the northern so michael ventured youre meeting someone a coldness gathered around his heart no said the cherub in the same numb faraway voice so where are you going why michael thought does the underground always smell of asbestos and urine i dont know i dont even have a ticket they had reached the lifts the windows in the metal doors looked like empty eye sockets this was getting weird look michael asked him if theres something wrong im not sure i can help you do have a phone with you i dont think so tony patted his tracksuit pockets michael began to be afraid this guy can benchpress kilos the elevator arrived filling the two windows with light as if they were eyes that had opened the doors beeped and gaped but michael did not get in you dont want to go this way said michael you want to go back that direction what i want doesnt count said tony my god thought michael he hasnt blinked not once stand clear of the doors please said a cool controlling voice michael decided it was best to get upstairs where there were people he got in tony followed and the doors trundled shut they were alone tony slipped his fingers under the spandex waistband and pulled down both trousers and underwear businesslike as if finishing a warmup stop thought michael tony stopped pull them up said michael tony did the cherub looked back at him scowling slightly as if he couldnt quite hear what was being said jesus thought michael this is what you get for fancying some guy at the gym you chat away youre nice to him and suddenly youve got a psychopath following you home there was sweat on michaels upper lip the lift did a little bounce and stopped mimicking the sick sensation in michaels stomach the doors opened and michael swept through them fumbling to pull his season ticket out of his jacket pocket he strode to the barriers slipping his card into the slot like a kiss nipped it free and pushed his way out and away he could feel tonys eyes on his back as he escaped michael thought and then stopped you know hes in trouble it might be an insulin reaction something like that you cant just leave him he turned around tony was standing dazed behind the ticket barriers what if hes too ill to even know his way home michael sighed and walked back is this something that happens to you sometimes are you diabetic are you on any kind of medication michael was thinking schizophrenia the ticket barriers were hunched between them like a line of american football players no said tony as if from the bottom of a well well look the central line is back that way michael said go back down and change at tottenham court road michael glanced sideways the guard was listening the guard was a young handsome burly man whom michael had once halfway fancied except for his unpleasant sneer the guard was looking the other way but his ears were pricked tony said mildly surprised dont you want to fuck me michael said no i dont the guard covered his smile with an index finger tony looked bruised you do he insisted michael began to talk for the benefit of the guard im sorry if you got that idea look youre in a bit of a state my advice is to try to get back home and sort yourself out the guard suddenly trooped forward his smile broadening to a leer bit off a bit more than we can chew did we sir i think hes on something and hes been following me said michael must be your lucky day said the guard he began to hustle tony back from the barriers come on let the professor be he probably cant afford you anyway the guard had the cheek to turn and grin at michael like hed said something funny hes not well said michael gosh did he dislike that guard but he needed him the guard herded tony back towards the lifts michael saw tony look at him with a suddenly stricken face it was that panic that frightened michael more than anything else the panic meant that tony needed michael for what something was out of whack michael fled he turned and walked as quickly as he could away he doesnt know where i live michael thought relieved if i get away i find another gym and thats the end of it michaels stomach was shuddering as if he had run out of petrol the tip of his penis was wet it had been raining and the pavements were glossy like satin a woman bearing four heavy bags from tesco was looking at her boots michael scurried to make the lights and bashed into the bags spinning them around in her grasp there was a shout from behind him oi michael spun around and saw the cherub sprinting towards him michael knew from the way his athletes stride suspended him in midair that tony had jumped the barriers michael backed away raising his arms against attack terror bubbling up like yeast keep away from me get back go away and the street was empty tony was gone michael blinked and looked around him up and down the pavement when he looked back he saw the guard hobbling towards him pressing a handkerchief to his face hed been hit where did he go the guard shouted at michael strands of spit between his lips where the fuck did he go i dont know bastard michael tried to look at the guards lip the guard ducked away from michaels tender touch he demanded snarling whats his name wheres he from michael did not even have to think ive no idea he just followed me oh yeah just followed you did he if i press charges mate youll bloody well have to remember the guard pulled the handkerchief away and looked as if expecting to see something he blinked the handkerchief was clean white and spotless this seemed to mollify him you better watch the kind of person you pick up mate then the guard turned and proudly plumply walked away for all your arrogance michael thought in five years time youll be bald and fatarsed michael stood in the rain for a few moments catching his breath what he thought was that all about finally he turned and walked up chenies street mostly because he had no place else to go and he began to cry from a mix of fear frustration boredom christ all he did was go to the sauna he didnt need this he really didnt he looked up at the yellow london sky there were no stars overhead just light pollution a million lamps drowning out signals from alien intelligences michael lived in what estate agents called a mansion block an old apartment house it was covered in scaffolding being repaired he looked up at his flat and saw that no lights were on phil wasnt there again so it would be round to gigs again for a takeaway kebab and an evening alone involuntarily michael saw tonys naked thighs the ridges of muscle he clunked his keys into the front door of his flat the door was heavy and fireproofed and it made noises like an old man michael dumped his briefcase on the hall table and snapped on the livingroom light the cherub was sitting on the sofa bloody hell exclaimed michael and stumbled backwards what are you doing here tony sat with both hands placed on his knees i dont know he said in a mild voice how did you get in the central light was bare and bleak i dont know tony said he still hadnt moved the scaffolding thought michael he climbed up the bloody scaffolding get out of here michael shouted the eyes narrowed and the head tilted sideways and then oh god he was gone the air roiled as if from tarmac on a hot day it poured into the space tony had suddenly vacated there was no imprint left on the cushions the cherub simply disappeared not even a flutter of wings michael stood and stared he kept staring at the sofa what had happened was not possible or rather it made a host of other things suddenly possible magic madness ghosts michael sat down with a bump and slowly unwound his scarf he stood up and poured himself a whiskey swirling it around in the glass and inspecting it yellow and toxic whiskey had destroyed his father in a funny kind of way it felt as if tony was his fathers ghost come back to haunt him michael took a swig and then sat down with his notebook and pilot pencil to answer every question except the most important who indeed is michael in a very few photographs michael was beautiful most photographs of him were shortcircuited by a grimace of embarrassment or a dazzled nervous grin that gave him the teeth of a rodent if someone short stood next to him michael would stoop and twist and force himself lower in other photographs michael looked all right in those he would have taken off his wirerimmed spectacles and combed his hair and stood up straight by hazard he would be wearing a shirt that someone had ironed and he would have left the pens out of the top pocket it would be a period in which michael was not experimenting with beards to hide his face or pony tails to control his runaway curly hair the best photographs of all would be on a beach on holiday with something to occupy his awkward hands it would be apparent then that michael had the body of an athlete he was a big broadshouldered man because of the flattening of his broken nose his face was rugged like a boxers michael could look unbelievably butch there was one photograph from michaels youth it was hidden away unsorted michael would not be able to find it now he didnt need to michael carried it around with him in memory he could always see it even when he didnt want to his father had taken it from a riverboat in california during their last summer together in the photograph michael is sixteen years old and is quite possibly the bestlooking person on the planet he is certainly one of the happiest in the photograph michael sits in a dinghy hes laughing and holding up a poor pooch of a dog she was called peaches the pooch peaches gazes miserably out from under a thick coating of riverbottom mud michaels thighs and calves are also covered in mud even then he was a big lad with wide shoulders and lines of muscle on his forearm his black eyes are fixed directly on whoever is taking the photograph and they are wide with delight his face is nut brown like an indians and his smile is bluewhite in contrast his black hair has reddishbrown streaks from constant sunlight sunlight glints all around him on the slick brown water and onto his face which is indisputably happy if you look closely the nose isnt broken by the time that photograph had been developed and posted back to england it was winter that summer michael on the sacramento river was already history michael remembered opening the envelope there was no letter inside from his father just photographs that photograph it should have been the moment when michael learned to love himself like every teenager he had been gawky and spotty it should have been the moment he left doubt behind and finally accepted that he was beautiful instead all michael could do was regret the beauty he felt was a mask hed been hiding behind it it was better now being ugly it was closer to the truth michael made himself ugly the photograph was the last thing he ever had from his father he knew what his father was saying this is who you could have been everything changed without michael noticing at the time in the summer he had been determined to be a vet now he was a scientist who experimented on animals the summer michael had enjoyed acting had been in a drama class for fun and took the lead role in all the plays he had a way of conjuring up old ladies terrified spivs and policemen out of his own body in winter michael seemed dispossessed of his own body this made him mostly harmless women liked him his students liked him he always kept a distance from them it was not that he was afraid of women or students exactly he was afraid of how he became around them he knew he could be waywardly funny exact truthful but then something would happen and power would withdraw from michael like the tide beached and helpless he would fumble and make mistakes and let himself down he would forget things like appointments or his glasses uncomfortable he would grin and grin and grin michael was impotent if this were symptom or cause he could not distinguish he didnt care impotency meant that only the most brutal and depersonalized of sexual episodes were safe enough for him only parks or toilets or saunas could hide him if his partners had no idea who he was how could they hurt him if they could hardly see him in the dark and didnt know his name there could be no embarrassment when he didnt get it up they didnt care if michael got it up they were too terrified of police to notice and too desperate to come quickly it all stayed hidden and detached but it relieved the pressure it relieved the pressure of living with someone who gave him no sexual satisfaction it relieved a kind of erotic itch which he could never satisfy and had not been satisfied for more than twenty years michael was and his very skin crawled with lust a quick jerk off in a car park a slap on the ass in bushes in a park provided cessation and a masturbatory climax but no satisfaction so he would have to go back again to a sauna or a cottage and then again this is addiction michael was a nice man who was addicted to speedy functional sex he kept this shut away from the rest of his life in the rest of his life he offered the world sweetness integrity and intelligence he placated life he worked himself nearly to death michael had a contract to teach biology two afternoons a week he prepared his lectures and marked papers just as if he were fulltime only he was paid less he joined academic committees and fought for new it networks he joined boards that recruited new teachers and exposed his bitter elders when they said untruthfully that a candidate for a post had been fired from her previous position michael lifted weights and read all the journals in his field and did desk research he became a rising star in his field producing publishable papers in biology from scanning work in two fields and bringing them together somehow this still resulted in very little extra money the two fields were neurology and philosophy the grey area where biology was helping philosophers answer questions such as do we have a soul what is the self michael understood how we see images are formed from millions of separate stimulations in the brain one area responds only to vertical lines others to angles others to oncoming movement others are tickled by symmetry of any kind or by green or pink still others react to shadow whole other areas bring together the slightly different angles provided by two eyes the brain responds to verbs of movement adjectives of colour and nouns of space and shape we spend our first six months learning to read these complex sentences could the grammar of language have its origins in the grammar of sight if so then how could people blind from birth learn to talk what if grammar came before both vision and speech michael wrote papers on the subject they were influential people were surprised that he was not a professor in the spiritual space where ideas were formed michael had power he found power in snatching those ideas out of air and putting them to paper with rattling keystrokes michael wrote all weekend long in order to answer those people who insisted on modelling the living brain on circuit diagrams michael was taking a conversion degree in computer science so as if he did not have enough to do michael was learning how to program in c and studying how the registers of computer memory worked he had to turn in programs to a colleague who opposed his views on what networks the students needed the programming module alone took ten extra hours a week when major coursework was due it would be twenty extra hours a week having worked all day he would work all night and when finally the program worked he would weep from joy as if he had climbed mount everest that was the payoff he had a blazing moment of joy two hours later he crawled out of bed and it all began again sometimes michael saw friends he would arrive late at their houses streaming cold air and apologies and feeling awful because he hadnt been able to organize buying a bottle of wine his boyfriend philip would be there waiting for him in worn silence perhaps everyone had already begun the first course michaels always late we told you he would be his hosts would exclaim laughing and admonishing michaels smile would flick like a switchblade with annoyance the blade cut both ways himself and his friends michael spent some of his time in a haze of either petulance or depressed exhaustion elated only by his studies and his flashes of inspiration into who we are and how we think these were brilliant enough and expressed clearly enough to make most guests sit up and listen they found themselves asking intelligent questions to which michael could give simple replies for the time that they were with him they found themselves in love with learning and with science and so a little more in love with themselves which is why even now from time to time philips eyes would shine with pride if not exactly love and why curiously michael left the dinner parties even more drained and exhausted than when he arrived sometimes he cried without knowing why he really couldnt think why he should be crying he had a good job didnt he he had a flat in london s prosperous west end he had a sensible relationship that had lasted nearly thirteen years his papers had helped earn his expolytechnic a from the higher research board who was he to be unhappy who indeed was michael so where is philip out as always michael had no idea where it hadnt always been like that there was a time when they did things together and regularly cooked meals for each other there was a time when he and phil regularly attempted to make love theyd met more than twelve years before michael had been and had his fathers athletic build his beard outlined a smooth and doleful face but in doleful repose it was rather beautiful his hair for once was cut short michael at was many peoples cup of tea if not exactly his own they met at first out a gay coffee shop phil was trying to find copies of the free newspapers michael gave him his and phil sat next to him in the window phil had been skinny intense and spotty his cheeks were pitted but that only increased the craggy drama of his face he was all aquiver in his first week of art school nineteen terrified anxious and aggressive like a stray terrier needing a home it is perhaps to michaels credit that he found this touching moving and beautiful in a way their attachment was brusque halfway through the first lovemaking session michael had known it would work philip was hot to the touch and his ribcage showed pale and lean his hands shivered like butterflies the two men made a shape together michaels bulk against philips fragility that seemed to tell a coherent story on their second date michael called philip my love phil hated his student roommates they didnt wash their cutlery or themselves he needed a place to crash he said michael full of hope asked phil to live with him there was something suddenly erotic about being the older man about offering a flat an income a routine a home philip moved in two weeks later domestication with its rituals over salt and spoons soothed them both they took turns with the washingup and shared expenses and settled quickly into a life of tidal regularity there was something soothing too about being with someone whom so few people would find attractive the age difference helped michael could play the role of protector and teacher and philip was insecure and young for his age and needed that for a time it was charming that philips nickname for michael was father it sounded like an oldfashioned marriage hello father philip would call out on michaels arrival home or when michael showed up at the pub for a crawl early on before art school got to him phil painted michaels portrait this was before philip stared to glue dirty carpet onto metal poles so it was a perfectly conventional painting philip said that it was designed to fill a niche in the sitting room it portrayed michael as ballast the jacket slightly crumpled looked like a carved stone replica of clothing the weight of his body was given a granite substance and he stood feet well apart looking as immovable as the earth the painting was called taurus at least in the beginning michael was an anchoring point even then the sex didnt work but it didnt work in a strange backward way that they both noted and were proud of it seemed to confirm they were some kind of perfect match they would allude to it lightly discreetly to their very best friends phil hated any male response from his partners at all for all his fluttering or perhaps because of it he would not suck michaels cock and found the idea of anal penetration repulsive which was just as well considering michael could not penetrate whipped cream it was no mystery to michael why philip was screwed up a year after they met philip finally summoned the nerve to take michael home to meet his parents michael would not have believed roland and virginia if he had not met them they were fake posh they pretended to be from surrey where they now lived who in their right mind pretended to be posh these days philips father was some kind of retired manager from ici he had a worn moustache and some kind of dressing on his hair which rendered it flat and glossy roland wore navy blazers without the right to and shirts whose thick blue stripes were still somehow garish virginia s hair was died orange and piled high like margaret thatchers and she had an air of studied delicate refinement she talked like an actress in a s film they had made cucumber sandwiches their teapot had pink curlicues michael kept his eyes fixed on it as philips mother made efforts to persuade her son to go back to medical school they didnt like the idea of art school at all roland was robust dont want people to think you hang around with a bunch of artyfarty people philip artyfarty meant queer roland was supposed to have no idea about his sons sexuality only philips mother knew the family had a best room that was kept under wraps and of which michael was vouchsafed a glimpse the furniture was sealed in plastic and the carpets covered with protecting translucent treads it was as if they wanted people to have safe sex with the sofa the dresser proudly displayed the wedgwood china which was never used this is for special events said philips mother communicating with no effort that the first visit of her sons partner was not special enough when philips sister died unexpectedly his mother rang to ask that michael not come to the funeral as it was a family occasion in any event michael was not to visit quite so often as it might give rise to questions ill make it easy said michael i wont go at all thats not what she wants michael said philip looking anguished its what i want said michael i dont like being treated like the mad aunt in the attic itll be easier for you too you wont even have to mention me indeed michael was not mentioned in family conversation philips family weekends were now just another period of absence which michael had been grateful for as it made it easier to bring people back its how most gay marriages are supposed to work you get tired of sex with each other and being a man yourself you understand its fun to be let off your leash for a scamper but when does it cease to be that when do you start hoping he wont be home so you can bring a trick back when do you start saying got another arts do on tonight you wont want to come will you when do you start slipping sideways into bushes at russell square after every social engagement how long is it then before there is no sexual side to the marriage what do you call the marriage then like other mainly financial arrangements you might call it a partnership they still both took a measure of pride in it hes a scientist phil said at a recent party as if clearing the table for a specially cooked nutfree dish philip at was already beginning to look ragged and discontent hes doing brain research youre trying to prove we have a soul arent you do we have a soul then asked jimmy banter he was a betterknown artist than philip he had a merry smile and a watchful eye what we have said michael feeling his weight is more like a centre of gravity you cant find a centre of gravity surgically its not an organ or an inner eye you wont find a car part called the centre of gravity but the car has one anyway the self is like that its the centre of focus if you like where all the stresses and strains of the brain come together jimmy banter looked over his shoulder is that why youve got such a big ego then phil all those stresses and strains jimmy disliked weight and he disliked bald truth but he loved drama at least my work doesnt involve killing chickens said philip thanks phil for blowing my cover the room went cold and still what was that a woman in a red dress asked sitting up michael sighed uh i am about to start a research project that involves experimentation on animals and how the woman asked him with the cautious determination of the righteous do you justify that with difficulty it takes a long time most of the night in fact and the one thing i dread is some animal rights activist getting hold of it because my partner wants to score points at parties michael glared at philip who stared sullenly back it was very difficult to see any love in his eyes now some weeks before philip had come home at eleven o clock for philip that was early michael was still up exhausted from marking phase tests philip came home elated rather than high he came home seductive how would you philip said sitting on the arm of the sofa like to be photographed in the nude by me it depends on what its for replied michel its for my next and breakthrough show its called lust ah youre going to be the centre piece am i now yup i want your cock to be the anchor i want it to look earthbound i want to adorn it with grass and soil and flowers and i can tell people its my boyfriend actually it will all be terribly gilbertandgeorgeish philip phil you are years old shouldnt you be getting beyond this are you trying to get into advertising or something it wont work phil if advertising agencies like your stuff they just steal it and call it a quote and that promotes you too just hear me out philip shifted smiling on the arm of the sofa i havent pitched it to you properly pitch what are you a filmmaker everything is a branch of pornography including religion no phil its not in this sense it uses the same techniques as pornography nothing to do with sex pornography is to do with keeping people comfortable and managing their disappointment you cannot give someone sex except by giving them sex but you can give them a substitute and make sure its barely just good enough so theyre not satisfied and have to come back for another fix mcdonalds hamburgers are pornography blockbuster movies are pornography the key to their success is that they dont offend and never satisfy the other thing is that nobody gets hurt or rather they get hurt but theres no real pain so in the english patient you can set people on fire and cut off their thumbs and everything still reads like a fiat ad so how are you going to demonstrate this intellectual point using craft skills which as i understand it is your definition of art philip was grinning im going to photograph your cock in a mcdonalds bun michael couldnt resist it will certainly be an improvement on their usual fare im going to photograph you as billy graham preaching but with your cock hanging out see what an education in the arts can do for you what about lawsuits you want lawsuits im going to dress your member up as monica lewinsky how how are you going to do that ill put a beret on it and stick it in a weight watchers ad ill wrap it up as a cigar i dunno phil this is not art these are ideas for joke greetings cards you know courgettes standing in for dicks and why pick on poor monica because she got hurt the republicans got it wrong they thought pornography meant sex rather than harmlessness they wrecked a nice modern girls life and people hated it i mean would republicans understand pornography politics is pornography will the right honourable member for finchley east please stand phil flickered like a candle about to go out michael was smiling in many ways this was the best conversation they had had in years phil you are not going to photograph my dick use someone elses but not mine ok why not partly michael thought because its so ugly well aside from putting your audience off their dinner i just dont want to id be embarrassed im a lecturer ive got students it might cause trouble at work ok all right philip stared at his knees he looked genuinely disappointed i just thought that for once you might like to share in my life his voice went even quieter and he muttered instead of me always having to share in yours this was neither jovial nor seductive im afraid i dont understand that last remark phil philip stood up disconsolate look around you then the flats yours everything in its yours youre perfectly welcome to buy something phil philip said very softly i dont have any money and he went out to the kitchen somewhere in there michael sensed there had been a wasted opportunity lovers come and lovers go usually they leave by the door sometimes very occasionally they just disappear was the guard hit philip did not come back until gone am all lights were out and michael was nearly asleep when he heard the front door wheeze and grumble its way open phil let it swing back and slam it took him forever to lay out his keys undress have a glass of water pee flush belch my god how long can it take someone to get to bed perhaps he was just washing himself after sex when he finally lay down next to michael philip fell instantly asleep his breath rattled out of him like leaves blown along a sidewalk he smelled of cheap red wine michael was left awake full of lust but not for phil he thought of the cherub the smooth pink arms the smooth pink face the ready smile michael saw him again prone on the platform undignified head over heels and his face sad with questions as if he had learned about death for the first time i wont sleep thought michael it is bad behaviour to wank in the same bed as your partner michael got up and went to the bathroom michael tried to ease the bathroom light on soundlessly but it snapped anyway it sounded as loud as a gunshot and there standing in the showerbath as michael had really rather known he would be was tony the cherub looked like he had been scanned in from a photograph and pasted onto another image his back was towards michael he was drying himself with a white gym towel michael did not own any white towels his scientific mind clocked towels are part of the deal so was the perfect pink hairless bottom rounded muscle so lean that the cheeks were parted even standing up the anus was visible pouting as if for a kiss michael touched tonys shoulder and he turned around his face had the same baffled expression michael wanted him to smile smile he yearned the cherub smiled in delight michael kissed his cheek tonys smile did not respond it remained fixed and dazzling michael sat down on the lid of the toilet tonys penis was still recognizably stale from being swaddled all day even in the most evenly white clean briefs michael checked that the head was dry permitted it to enter his mouth once the penis swelled lengthened and went bulbous at the head michael pulled back michael touched tonys body started to masturbate and told tony to do the same tony leaned back against the bathroom door head thrown back eyes closed as he would have done if he were alone michael looked at his beautiful body as if it were a photograph in a magazine the cherub came arching into space then the room cleared as if a mist had been burned off michael padded back into the darkened bedroom where phil still snored michael had a moments worry hell smell it on me then he realized the tastes and smells on his tongue and fingers had all evaporated leaving nothing in the morning the mystery remained as always philip slept on while michael prepared instant coffee and granola i must have dreamed it thought michael he picked up his filofax and looked at his notes from the night before there was hardly anything useful except for one clear question was the guard hit he walked to goodge street tube there must have been an unusual shift pattern because the same guard was lurking behind the barriers or maybe he just needed the money he was propped up against the wall and nodded a grim good morning at michael michael shuffled his apologies uh im sorry about last night did he hit you the guard looked up bleary from lack of sleep angry at first for being disturbed then he remembered to be civil sorry um last night that big bloke who was a bit woozy you came running after me and i thought hed hit you the blue eyes were too pale there was something frozen about them you must want someone else mate michael shook his head at his own mistake of course you wouldnt get two shifts in a row would you i would i need the money i was here last night but there was no big man sorry michael stood frozen all right tony had not been real but dont you remember talking to me the guard wanted to read his paper it was called loot and sold houses and cars to people who had no money to buy them he lowered the paper there was something you were standing there by the barriers he gestured towards them scowling looking as baffled as the cherub had the night before michael saw that he needed a shave thats it you were drunk the guards lip curled and he lifted up his paper he looked pretty and petulant and butch all at once you were right out of it mate so that explains it then all right he stared stonily at his paper conversation over they waited for the lifts to arrive i didnt drink anything michael reconstructed the entire night and day in his mind he hadnt been to the pub he hadnt drunk a thing the guard rocked himself away from the wall on which he was leaning and punched big silver keys the lift door opened i must be going nuts michael thought sleep tight said the guard and gave him a cheery leery grin there were smiling japanese tourists in the lift you are bowing to a crazy man michael told them in his mind i made the whole thing up i had a bad experience in the sauna my life is shit ive been depressed for years without doing anything about it and now ive gone and broken my brain christ michael remembered the feel of tonys skin its smell its taste it increases your respect for schizophrenics really theyre not just a bit muddled all those brain cells get tickled up and they start making brandnew sentences of sight and sound and touch the new sentences are lies but they feel like the real thing you lose a certain kind of innocence when you go crazy you used to take it for granted that your brain shows you whats actually out there now all youve got left is doubt michael but then science is built on doubt the train bounced and rattled him like life at the lab michael strolled through his normal routine as if sleepwalking he fed his smartcard into the reader at the front door he said hello to the security guard shafiq and showed him his pass he went down the line of offices one by one none of them had windows hello ebru hello boss it amused ebru to call him boss hiya emilio hows the system why you ask its great like always he heard their voices as if in his own head as if no one were really speaking in his own office michael slipped into his entirely symbolic white lab coat he asked hugh to check the thermostat readings in the darkroom if the temperature goes much under or over thirtyeight give me a shout and he sat down and he had no idea what to do his desk stared back at him as orderly as his notebooks there were three new things in his in tray and the out tray was empty on his pc would be a timed list of things to do what the fuck do i do now look in the yellow pages for psychotherapists do they section people right away should i be writing my letter of resignation what do you do when you realize youre seeing things you might just try to see if its going to happen again look im still capable i can say maybe it wont happen again maybe it was just a oneoff something that only happened once maybe im better already put another way just how badly broken am i the door opened and the sound was as sudden and as loud as if he made it up and michael jumped up and turned around it was ebru first day post she always made english sound like something delicious to eat post almost became pasta she passed him five different coloured files his sorted mail thank you ebru said michael he felt like a bad actor awkward on the stage with a fixed grin she read him out a list of messages he didnt really listen he just kept smiling finally she left bouncing and strong in blue jeans a picture of wholeness then michael stood up and looked from side to side as if there were someone watching he padded carefully to the labs one wc it was a single tiny room with sink and toilet crowded together michael locked the door ok he said to the air come back suddenly crowding against the edge of the sink the cherub ballooned into reality tony was jammed against michael forcing him to sit down or fall over michael felt the texture of the brick against his back it seemed to push him insistently back into tonys arms go on the wall seemed to say michael reached out and prodded tonys collarbone he could feel it solid under lean flesh he could feel the green tshirt slide away from it the room was reflected in tonys eyes perfectly the glint from the strip light and michael himself in the finegrained skin there was one clogged pore going slightly red michael prodded him again dammit he was solid michael picked up tonys hand and saw ridges in the fingernails and flecks of white no hallucinations were foggy you knew things were clouded you felt confused this did not feel like the product of a confused brain i am not making this up come on said michael he took hold of tonys hand and felt its palm fleshy and armoured with weightlifter calluses then michael stuck his head out into the corridor it really would not be a good idea to be seen coming out of the toilet with a strange man ok come on tony followed him i dont like this he said tony doesnt like this so michael thought he thinks of himself and tony as being different does tony know this is happening the copy nodded he saw last night in a dream michael kept his voice low i need to know if anyone else can see you they went into ebrus office her back was turned and slightly hunched as she read personal email from turkey michael coughed she turned around sorry michael my mother sends me email here she looked embarrassed her smile dipping and then she looked up straight at tony hello she said this is tony michael paused he had not really expected ebru to see tony so he had nothing ready to say hes uh my trainer at the gym ebru raised one eyebrow at michael briefly as if to say and hes goodlooking whats going on here michael she stood up and reached across the desk to shake tonys hand the meeting of the hands was perfect like those moments when the cgi dinosaurs actually seem to touch the ground hello said tony in a soft neutral voice michael explained um i hurt my elbow weightlifting so tonys here to give me some advice about it a handsome gym instructor who makes house calls ebrus eyes glinted a certain adjustment was necessary this isnt my house tony only makes office calls we wouldnt want anyone to get the wrong idea um said ebru as if to say ok ill mind my own business i guess thats about it michael said to tony in the empty corridor he sent tony back to wherever it was he came from the air closed over him like surf and he was gone what the fuck is going on michael got out his notebook and drew a line down the middle on one side he wrote hallucination and on the other he wrote physical presence under hallucination he wrote my distressed mental state he wrote lack of reaction from people on platform he wrote guard did not remember tony he wrote guard said i was drunk he stared at physical presence the page was blank all he could write was ebru shook its hand so what was it hallucination was by far the simplest explanation except that either ebru was hallucinating too or michael had made her up at least temporarily the physical presence would have to be some kind of physical copy of a human being until recently teleportation was supposed to be impossible then in the mathematics of quantum theory were revised and it became at least in theory possible that objects could be completely read and thus reliably recreated somewhere else or rather duplicated michael had been searching for information on quantum computing and had accidentally ended up deep inside the ibm website on the page describing ibms teleportation project the aim was successfully to transport an inanimate object by there was the usual team of delighted slightly skuzzylooking men thrilled to be living in the dreams of their youth so who or what would be sending you copies of handsome young men michael who would devote the time and expense necessary if you postulate that you can postulate descartes evil genius but an evil genius could just as easily be beaming hallucinations as well what we have is an anomaly something that does not fit with currently accepted theory something we cannot explain the first task therefore is to describe it accurately order and method seemed to dissolve like pepto bismal calming michaels stomach he made a list of what he knew a physical copy of someone i know in train tube and x in my flat x in office can call up at will and banish other people appear to interact his behaviour my behaviour both sexual the real person is straight copy says real person dreams what happens so the next question is what else dont i know about this in effect the next question is what question do i ask next well so far all he had done is call up a copy of one person can i call up a copy of someone else michael needed to limit variables he needed to think of someone who shared as many characteristics as possible with tony someone known someone whom he had seen and fancied at least somewhat in the gym the showers at michaels gym were full of men it was one of the things that kept michael motivated to work out there was the tiny brown englishman with a beautiful body and a hatchet face whom michael nicknamed the english thai michael knew he had a wife from thailand and imagined that she had married him because he looked so much like one of her own people small neat and brown the english thai wore fawn trousers with a spandex waist instead of a belt michael had decided he worked in a car repair workshop but at the front desk greeting customers and nervously mismanaging staff michael could imitate the way he moved not quite relaxed hopping instead of stretching to reach parts on the top shelf thats what michael did now back in the wc at the lab michaels arms sketched how the english thai moved ok he said his mouth had gone dry he was halfhoping nothing would happen come on the english thai arrived naked streaming water from the showers he blinked and rubbed the water from his eyes well there we go thought michael thats it realitys got a hole in it the english thai stood fivefootfour and proportioned as if he were a taller athlete brown all over a beautiful swelling chest slim belly tiny circumcised dick he had a face like mr punch with designer stubble turn around michael thought at him he did hold your cheeks open the english thai did and easily and effortlessly his anus also opened and mouthed desire like a fish michael could direct him you like being fucked michael realized the english thai turned back around and nodded yes mournfully michael could imagine him in insalubrious surroundings with that same expression there was something in the hurt and ugliness that created in michael a stirring of lust michael asked him murmuring what does your wife think about this she dont know nothing said the english thai what do you think about it he shrugged its just something i do you know he smiled embarrassed his wounded animal eyes saying fuck me hurt me im ugly there was a knock on the bathroom door a voice came beyond it it was emilio sounding reluctant michael sliced the air with his hand and the english thai was gone as if he were a shower that someone had turned off someone spoke emilio sounding reluctant uh michael do you have someone in there with you this is not a question many people like asking their boss uh michael improvised no just talking to myself my god do they really think id have someone in here with me well actually michael you did he flushed quickly to explain why he was there and flung the door open emilio was already halfway back down the corridor im sorry michael i have to use the toilet emilio smiled and shuffled he wore yellow trousers and black sneakers which emphasized the embarrassed digging of his feet we need more than one dont we michael said emilio nodded embarrassed michael held out a generous arm go in see no one there michael went back to his desk and tried to work he liked to work and had certainly ensured that it would not be in short supply he had email to answer he had tomorrows lecture to prepare on nerve cells he had a program to write for his ma computer science course the assignment was to write a program that was supposed to convert any ordinary text to all capital letters he knew how to do it principle just add a fixed number to the ascii code that would move it to upper case he just couldnt make it work in practice that morning he could make nothing work all right then he surrendered as if in anger michael stopped working and went to the gym the gym was one more way of working himself to death it also made up for a feeling he had of losing time it was too soon to be exiled from the world of male beauty michael didnt question why he wanted to be beautiful or what the ultimate goal of that beauty would be he did know that he could benchpress three sets of kilos and do crunch situps tony was there filing workout cards in a box hiya tony said michael like an anxious parent trying to sound cool for his sons friends tonys head jerked around almost in panic and he glared at michael alarmed and hostile with a snap tony mastered himself he gave a brief and professional greeting michaels ears felt numb and he didnt hear it tony turned his back fumbling slightly michael straddled himself onto an exercycle he pedalled for six minutes and for six minutes he tried to catch tonys eye like a compass needle pointing north somehow the broad back in its green shirt was always turned towards michael it was like stalking a rare marsh bird michael finished his aerobics tony michael asked him is there anything wrong no mate no said tony shaking his head you had a bad dream last night said michael tonys face fell gathering a line of pale tissue either side of his mouth so did i said michael without another word tony turned and walked into his tiny office and firmly closed the door what if this isnt about sex the next day the chicks hatched ebru came into michaels room looking slightly blue and pinched around the cheeks i am hearing peeping from the darkroom ok make sure nobody goes in they werent set up yet there was a small workroom with a sink a draining board and an interrogation lamp something that looked like it might be for stretching tyres over wheels was in fact a small centrifuge there was a kitchen magimix setting out the instruments of the experiment brought home to their hearts and stomachs what they were about to do there were new garden secateurs the blades a polished chrome there was the cheese shave with its wire there were the lined bins with their black sacks wafting plastic odours inside the darkroom the new chicks were wet warm shivering in the dull red light their ancient heads looked outraged as if they had been pulled back out of heaven after death they demanded mouths open every other chick was lifted up and lowered into a trolley they jolted with life in michaels hands as if attached to live wires the trolley was wheeled through the double set of doors that cut off all light and into the workroom ok lets have some light said michael and as if the chicks were criminals the workroom lamps were switched on blazing for the first time in their lives the chicks saw light they blinked and squinted they look so small said ebru michael knew he had to be first he was the boss he had designed the experiment and he couldnt ask them to do anything that he himself ducked come on michael they wouldnt be here but for you you have to take responsibility for their deaths as well michael took a deep breath and picked up the first chick it was no longer warm but wet and chill and it went silent as he picked it up and he knew it was because the chick was preprogrammed to treat large warm near objects as mothers he focussed took the secateurs and as quickly as possible snipped into the little leathery skull nosed in the secateurs snipped quickly at the base of the brain lets start with the centrifuge he said ebru touched his arm the trick is to do it quickly so theres no pain the first chicken brain was rolled carefully by ebru into the palm of her gloved hand and then dropped into the magimix the second was laid out in the tray one half of the brains would be reduced to their chemical components which would be analysed the other half would be stained and then frozen immediately in the cold room for slicing the results would be compared with the control groups who would die without ever seeing any light whatsoever the bodies were thrown limp into the bags which were then sealed michael ran with the tray towards the cold room the fridge was a big white box and it shivered to the touch like michaels slightly sick stomach the tray was numbered and it was placed on a shelf space with a matching number when michael returned the centrifuge was humming and the clean draining board was being dried and the garbage bags were in hessian sacks stencilled with the words waterloo feed company well done gang he said he had to go into his office and sit down well you knew it would be like this when you set up the experiment michael the same fate awaits every hen in britain at some point even freerange ones but they at least have some kind of life did it make any difference that they were trying to provide answers to some truly big questions michael loved science and he loved life somewhat less and he had faith that in the end the two would support each other but he still felt sick he felt compromised this affected his selfesteem in other areas he had to go for a walk in the park to clear his lungs he sat on a bench and ate his sandwiches which fortunately were cheese and not chicken nevertheless he found the sweaty taste of animal fat unappetizing he crunched his way through his apple you know michael it is not everyone who can call up simulations of people from thin air this this miracle arrives and what do you use it for you use it to turn tricks which is what you always do you can turn tricks in alaska street what if this isnt about sex the more michael thought the more unlikely it seemed that the universe would change all its rules to keep him supplied with fancy men suppose i could clone einstein and set him to work solving equations what are the limits of this thing michael wrote in his notebook hypothesis i can call up copies of people but i do not have to fancy them method try to call up someone for whom you feel not a trace of lust and note the result michael decided to call up mother theresa he admired her he wanted to talk to her perhaps about the morality of animal experimentation and it was a certainty that he felt no lust whatsoever for her it was a brilliant diamond of a spring day the light seemed to have edges and cut why not just do the show right here what better church to call up mother theresa than archbishops park he felt the sun on his face it was as if the light was reflecting off the daffodils he called out with his eyes closed it seemed to him he reached out into darkness hidden behind the light nothing happened he opened his eyes a football team from a local office in mismatched tshirts and shorts loped towards the redgrit soccer pitch michael closed his eyes and asked again the bench next to him remained stubbornly empty he got out his notebook feeling disappointment just to be sure he looked over his shoulder and called up the cherub there was the faintest wuffling sound as the air seemed to fold itself into a green and pink origami the cherub sat next to him on the bench keep your clothes on whispered michael so thought michael this is about sex he felt a further degree or two of increased disappointment i dont suppose he whispered to the cherub you know how this works the cherub stared ahead like a starship captain gazing at a far galaxy michael suddenly saw how the real tony would look when he was older solid pale and a bit blank it goes all the way back the cherub said then he turned and looked at michael with a sudden urgency the back of the head and he jerked it behind him you wouldnt happen to know what part of the anatomy so far back it goes outside yes well it was possible that being copied induced mild brain damage michael gave him instructions stand up and walk away towards the alley between the two brick walls if theres no one there disappear the cherub stood up and more tamely than a labrador walked towards his own oblivion well phil michael thought there is one element you left out of pornography power in pornography you have the power to make people behave michael began to wonder how good this thing might be for what he still had to call his soul michaels father had been a marine there was a plaque somewhere in camp pendleton that bore his name and a gravestone somewhere in orange county that michael had never seen in america everyone went to church especially in the military every sunday he and his father would go to a bare and unvarnished catholic church michael ate wafers drank wine and learned about sin and then in the afternoon played touch football on the beach the exposure was enough to make him feel regretful rather than indoctrinated michael watched tonys retreating back wearing only a tshirt on an icy spring day the cherub entered the funnel of brick between two high walls there was a whisper in his head and michael knew the cherub was gone so he thought ive learned i cant call up just anyone it could be that i cant call up women or maybe i can only call up copies of people ive actually met he stood up to go or it could be that they have to be alive ill have to go on asking question after question he left the green and the trees traffic and black brick made him feel english god made him feel american michael would shift between american and english selves and accents without realizing it his english self went back to work his american self thought of his messengers how they came and went angels michael decided until i know them better i will call them angels can angels be dead when michael was ten years old he was sent to spend the summer with his father for the first time he had cried alone in the airplane with his ticket pinned to his little grey dress jacket he had to change in chicago and everything looked like a dirty harry movie bleached blonde women wore denim suits and chewed gum and talked like gangsters molls michael knew his dad was going to meet him at la international he arrived exhausted and trying not to cry and he looked at all the waiting people and he saw this huge man who looked like burt reynolds and wore a uniform he carried a big sign with michaels name on it hiya mikey howya doin the man said in a mingled mouthful of words and chewing gum he wore mirror shades michael forgot to say anything he gaped this was his father his father looked like something out of a movie too he chuckled come on guy well get you home dad scooped up michaels bag and threw it over his shoulder michael dragged his feet walking behind his father chuckled again leaned over and simply picked michael up whole his big arm folded into a kind of chair and michael fell asleep being carried his face resting warm against his fathers chest after that every two years michael lived for the summer near san diego with his dad he loved it southern california is the perfect place in which to do nothing indeed everything is so far apart and it takes so long to drive anywhere that it is very difficult to do anything other than nothing you call it going to the beach on the beach at twelve years old michael felt he was immortal he would take the big green bus out of camp pendleton past the rialto cinema with its delectable range of kung fu and horror movies he would reach the cliffside park and the earthen cliffs of oceanside california once there he would throw himself in front of a few waves and call it body surfing then he could do nothing but lie on his back for three hours toasting this was before skin cancer was invented he went from lobsterred to californiabrown in less than two weeks his bright grin beamed from his newly darkened face he felt like something from an american situation comedy the young teenager part resting on the beach the idea came to him that he could stay in america and become american he could do it after all his father was american he could stay in the sunshine with the movies and the skateboards and the long hikes in hills that camp pendleton protected from development the thought made something inside him flutter with fear the part of him that fluttered spoke with an allpurpose london accent that was another layer of self his mother spoke with a sheffield bluntness michael felt himself stretched michael felt himself in danger of being torn whatcha do today his dad would ask dad was trying to get to know his son he had abandoned england and his wife when michael was three went to the beach michael said proudly dja meet any girls michael did not say dad im only twelve and um but i have noticed that im not even looking at girls yet what he said was no dad and he hung his head feeling ashamed listen theres a guy at work runs little league you wouldnt want to try your hand at baseball would you his dad looked hopeful and made a swinging motion his father would have been shocked to discover that michael didnt like sports he didnt know then that he had a son who did nothing except cram for exams and who now more than anything else just wanted to luxuriate on the beach or watch american tv american television was a miracle there were about ten channels so many that it made sense to flick round them until you found something you wanted what michael found luxuriating at every saturday afternoon were old tarzan movies starring johnny weissmuller in the very first tarzan tore off janes clothes and threw her naked into a river she swam deeper and deeper into the river a glowing white against the darkness shadows both covering and hinting at her nipples her pubes his father called mike mikey you wanna come outside and pitch a few balls both father and son were exercising their american accents as if they were stiff muscles before a game michael was staring bugeyed at a naked woman part of the luxury of california was having a tv of your own in your own bedroom to do what you liked i cant dad its time for the tarzan movie how many movie stars get officially called something as friendly as johnny how many of them are olympic athletes who wear loincloths that let you see their naked haunches thigh to stomach how many of them are beautiful with a reassuring lopsided chiptoothed face and a high light voice under michaels tan and athletic frame his young and genuinely feminine heart would sit entranced by what his father thought were adventure movies mikey we could go to the movies later if you wanna his father was big and athletic too but his face was glum and disappointed his son had been away all afternoon and they had only saturdays and sundays to do stuff together dad i really want to watch this ok ok son see ya later his dad said he left punching his baseball mitt michael felt bad michael had not meant to hurt his fathers feelings michaels eyes were suspiciously heavy with deep feelings he had no name for dad why dontcha watch it with me dad he heard the back door slam his father had a rival michael knew even at twelve what the mgm executives had known all along they were selling a love story a love story that promised and delivered a beautiful naked man michaels young heart would soar through the trees alongside johnny weissmuller he dreamed of leaving the world behind of living like a boy scout in a treehouse with a man as dumb and reliable and graceful as a horse he dreamed of slipping the loincloth aside to see what lay underneath it at twelve that was as far as the dream went his father eventually nagged his son into joining a baseball team it played on sundays which left saturday for tarzan and in fact gave dad even less time with his son summer wore on johnny got old the series left mgm and went downmarket to rko it lost jane and its love story it gained amazons in bikinis and cutprice nazis johnny was no longer a sex symbol he was a star of bmovies for kids he got fat a fat tarzan is a great sadness his last movie in the series tarzan and the mermaids was made in filmed in mexico with beautiful mexicans standing in for some kind of lost but completely unconvincing african tribe any one of the men could have made a more suitable tarzan except of course that tarzan was supposed to be anglo weissmuller was romanian he had been born near timisoara and his real first name was jonas michael stayed in california long enough to see that sad ending and to experience something of a lovers sense of loss and longing as a partner ages johnny weissmuller died in mexico in when michael was years old michael remembered reading about his death in the newspaper and thinking johnny weissmuller it was michaels moment for realizing that we spend more of our lives being old than young in michaels days of california sunlight saltwater spray and young americans in shorts there had lived in that same state an old bronzed man he looked a little bit like a balloon from which the air had leaked that man would have been able to tune in every saturday at as well to see his sleek and catlike younger self pad lissomely through a studio jungle maybe it was enough for him to remember the days when he had been a sex symbol and it was possible that he could go on to be a real movie star maybe it was enough to have been the lover of lupe velez the mexican spitfire to have acted with maureen osullivan to have people still call you tarzan once they recognized you maybe it was enough for him that he had won five olympic gold medals and set world records in the encyclopaedias it was those he was most remembered for rather than a mere acting career after all sport is not fiction is it but michael even as an adult would remember him for the heartbreaking climax of tarzans new york adventure when he leapt off the brooklyn bridge to almost certain death yodelling backwards for jane for boy for the jungle life lust requires restitution even more frequently than love lust goes unrequited hypothesis i can call up anyone that i want sexually confirmed who is alive or dead not confirmed method try to call up someone i fancy who is dead and note result the chez nous hotel near vauxhall bridge road is a french franchise operation to an englishman it looks scandinavian clean spacious bland and smelling faintly of the mildest possible cheese being near vauxhall bridge and south of the river thames it is actually nowhere and no one wants to stay there even at lunchtime its brasserie is empty michael could eat there in perfect anonymity and go upstairs alone without the slightest fear of being seen by anyone he knew how otherwise would you explain booking a room yards from where you worked he could enter his room at pm in complete assurance that it would be comfortable clean and looking exactly as it would look in luxembourg or shepherds bush michael sat on a bed so perfect it looked as if no one had ever slept in it as this was the chez nous vauxhall it was perfectly possible that no one ever had he disliked crumpling the mottled blue duvet his breath came fast and shallow he asked for his boyhood love as naturally as a light breeze through eucalyptus trees johnny weissmuller was sitting next to him unlike most movie stars he was bigger than michael expected huge broad and smooth wearing only the loincloth a flop of silky brown hair tumbled into his eyes he stared intently at michael half in fear one hand on his knife tarzan he said jabbing at his breasts im michael tarzan mikey weissmuller said prodding michael so hard that for a moment michael thought he would fall backwards out of a tree mikey tarzan tarzan looked baffled by desire desire was something new that he had never felt he leaned closer to michael and sniffed his face mikey smell like flower tarzan smelt of max factor michael said thats my aftershave what shave michael stroked his smooth cheek you know shave beard tarzan looked even more baffled he rubbed michaels face and looked puzzled beearrddd he said yeah beard you know shave you dont shave tarzan scowled he rubbed his own perfect chin how tarzan shave no razors i dont know i guess i never thought about that yeah howcum tarzan doesnt have a beard not monkey said tarzan and grinned they hovered about six inches apart michael wanted to kiss him except that tarzan was covered in tan body makeup head to toe it would leave marks on michaels shirt uh johnny could you drop the tarzan talk its a little bit creepy i want you not tarzan tarzan got that look of idiot firmness he got when mistaking the motives of white hunters no he said firmly mikey want tarzan tarzan was shaved all over everywhere michael touched him there were little pinpricks of body hair like mustard on ham michael leaned forward and tried to kiss him and tarzan ducked away it goes like this said michael and brought their lips together tarzan tasted like one of your mothers friends he had that perfumed powdery clotted smell of face paint tarzan smiled and pressed michael to him rather as if he were cheetah at the end of the film michael had to coax him out of the loincloth tarzan had no conception that it could be removed he looked as surprised as michael when it slipped aside to reveal handsome catholically uncircumcised genitals from which every trace of pubic hair had also been shaved mgm couldnt have pubic hair leaking out over the edge of the loincloth and having stripped johnnytarzan michael discovered that like his twelveyearold self he wanted to do nothing else so he lay next to tarzan and was cradled protected like jane by the hays code michael wallowed in the bed as tarzan prodded him tickled him and examined his feet he sniffed his chin as michael lay there in his arms he wondered is this all i wanted all along with all those other men just to be held stroked and cuddled perhaps it is simply that i never wanted real sex at all in which case it is possible that i never grew up and he could choose to accept that he could decide to stay a child who was anyone to tell him his sexuality was wrong if this is what he really wanted he could stay here warm and sheltered if this was some new sexual home why leave it michael stroked the smooth firm backs of tarzans arms pee pee said tarzan he stood up and discovered with wonder that the toilet flushed he roared at the gushing of clear water knelt and began to drink from it lapping like a lion he looked up in delight it was nearly pm time to go tarzan had no concept of time or work and tried to keep michael with him holding his arm stroking it in the end michael had to disperse him he didnt want to see tarzan dissolve like a tv channel michael simply turned away and heard something like a gust of wind and felt a sudden hollowness in the room behind him every trace of jungle was gone including the smell of max factor at reception he coughed and asked like an outoftown guest about local restaurants tomorrow morning he would check out and pay his bill as if he had spent the night there michael walked back through archbishops park it was a dull grey english spring stark with no leaves on the trees he thought of tarzans body its prepubescent smoothness of his tenderness and the caresses the main sensation in the pit of his stomach was fear as if he were still taking that first trip to california circumstances meant that an unexpected question was answered next can i make them do it when im not there weve got an invitation philip said opening their post its from zoltan caparthi he said you know the glass artist the one who does those fabulous pisstakes of beauty contests hes invited us well you me and whoever else we want to bring he said everybodys lover has a lover and they must come too do you want to come can you bring someone interesting oh said michael i think so ill meet you there said phil with mine the house had a name the looking glass a sign said so in a cluster of mirrors and neon and preserved feather boas high up out of the reach of vandals the walls were painted mauve covered with mirror stars along the top michael arrived alone and rang the bell with a shiver of mingled anticipation and inadequacy he held a john lewis shopping bag full of his costume the door was opened by a young man dressed like carmen miranda a salvador dali moustache was painted on his upper lip hello im billy welcome billy kissed him on the cheek and ushered him in there was a kind of combination office kitchen and reception area covered in cork with photographs pinned to the walls there was no one else michael had come on time and was the first to arrive you want to change billy asked yes indeed said michael feeling dowdy im im he tried to think of the formula somebodys amputated other half he showed the invitation billy completed the sentence youre one of the optional extras so am i im the son of the woman who keeps zoltans books you and i will have more fun than all these old slags because its all new to us now i want your drink ready when you come out looking fabulous what do you fancy michael was scared of being boring so he said a margarita i meant herbal tea said billy michael smiled at himself i dont know anything about herbal tea choose the nicest billy smiled too the nicest for the nicest he said michael went into the bathroom as himself and came out with tarzan he wore tarzan tarzan was his costume weissmuller loomed over him looselimbed brown sprawling barefoot michael wore a concealing leopard skin that crossed his chest and hid his belly as if he were plump if anyone asked he would say he had come as boy billy looked a bit confused two herbal teas then yes thank you tarzan approved tea good tea come from jungle this is uh johnny michael explained hello johnny billy was young enough that a beautiful body was nothing special but he kept glancing back towards the front door how did this person get in woman pretty said tarzan nice moustache there was a broad staircase leading upstairs the host must have heard voices for suddenly he descended he was a huge man big in every direction with a pregnant potbelly and a devilish goatee he wore a sari and from out of his back four extra blue papiermâché arms tarzan drew his hunting knife hello hello and welcome i am zoltan and you he extended a hand towards the knife he had style tarzan boy growled johnny hand on knife zoltans smile thinned somewhat well i am kali for the evening hungarian was the lightest possible seasoning in the thick soup of his oxbridge accent michael said who he was and his name seemed to evaporate even as he said it he didnt hear it himself tarzan was engaged in a traditional moviemonkey greeting making cheetahlike noises and sniffing zoltans extra blue arms will your friend keep this up all evening day and night said michael youve sought help for him i hope michael said without thinking no i love him just the way he is there are some trees upstairs said zoltan speaking to tarzan as if to an idiot figs on the trees youll like figs he turned back to michael harry is the gardener youll have to talk to him not me perhaps your friend would like to swing in them it was a cue michael said thank you and walked upstairs without his host both of them grateful to be spared more conversation the room was full of mythology and mirrors a sphinx in gold foil with turquoise eyebrows or a fourteenfoothigh statue of liz portraits of the famous on mirrors so you could see yourself as them much of it was beautiful michael wished he had managed to stay the distance with zoltan this far at least he would have liked to know more about the glass buddhas the holographic eyes one whole wall was clear glass and beyond it hugeleafed plants what a fantastic place he said and sipped tea fancy philip knowing someone who lived in a place like this michael wondered what other places philip had visited without him what else indeed did he not know about philip tarzan was unimpressed crazy place he said boy go tarzan go why wondered michael am i always playing somebodys father or somebodys son well stay for just a little while ok the room began to fill with people ageing psychiatrists in beards a filmmaker who had just done a documentary about zoltan as michael approached them summoning a smile their eyes drifted off to his left or his right a very nice woman from the corner shop wore a blue chiffon dress in folds and was far too butch to be intimidated by anything michael liked the look of her and was grateful for fifteen minutes conversation zoltan buys mangoes from me theyre hard to get this time of year and hes very particular she shook her head as if to say you know what i mean her eyes gleamed up at johnny there was a roar of greeting from downstairs and a sound of cheeks being kissed an actor who was one of the glass faces had arrived zoltan whisked him up the stairs holding his arm everyone adams here oooh adam said the shop owner with enthusiasm she turned back to michael with narrowed eyes he owes me money she joined the surge forward michael stood alone i am here because of phil he remembered to show him phil arrived an hour late he was wearing bandages and a headdress hung with daisy chains of decapitated dolls heads he looked like a serial killers chandelier its all right for me to try too hard michael thought im a nerdy scientist out of my depth but you are supposed to be an artist you are supposed to be cool michael met phils new friend at very first glance there was not much to see he was a skinny young man wearing a brown sweater with holes in it there was something familiar about his face maybe he was an actor this is henry philip announced his eyes flicking back and forth between him and tarzan the dolls heads kept clacking against each other henry looked up he had large brown eyes that engaged michael directly with a preemptive warmth and kindness the eyes seemed to say i know this cant be easy for you but hi anyway they shook hands and henry chuckled god he was handsome his smile was sweet and broad and his skin was perfect very pale but with flushed pink cheeks and a complexion as unblemished as shaving foam nice to meet you henry michael said congratulations why henry asked his voice was surprisingly resonant rumbling for not being bullied into thinking youve got to keep up with the rich and outrageous i dont have any money henry said and smiled and shrugged educated michael decided old family possibly dropped out at a guess id say you were the son of someone landed with a big farm in norfolk that you live in the country and possibly have a pair of tame jackdaws that sit on your shoulder michael liked him i dont think youre the type that would dress up anyway henry gave a very gentle bow of acknowledgement probably not no michael fancied him it was the same old mystery even michael didnt think philip was goodlooking but his boyfriends were always gorgeous im forever fancying your boyfriends phil michael felt a thin strain of regret for his old marriage are you going to introduce me phil asked nodding towards johnny him tarzan said michael me boy is tarzan a paedophile then hes my lover if thats what youre asking michael kept his gaze steady and open he found how little it mattered to him does he speak asked phil who suddenly looked frail not much hes romanian tarzan spoke tarzan loves mikey i hope you and mikey are very happy maybe youll have a chimp together incidentally mikey henry is my lover too you couldnt find a nicer one said michael really lucky old you michael couldnt help reaching out and clasping henrys arm hes very nice philip stared back at him with the strangest expression in his eyes ringed round with red tense resolved heartstricken angry henry is an animal rights activist michael he swept off henry walked away backwards holding out his arms as if to say sorry michael apologized to him sorry if we embarrassed you henry shrugged his shoulders which could have meant anything from nothing embarrasses me to sorry i cant hear you tarzan not understand said tarzan standing alone angels wouldnt said michael well he had come here in order to assist phil in the wrecking of their marriage if that was accomplished was there any other reason for him to stay he worked his way slowly through the crowd to where the booze was being served a woman in a beige dress with beige hair and beige fingernails said as he passed i found the colour scheme of that film so irritating all those reds her eyes trailed off to michaels left but monica it was in black and white oh you know what i mean it was strange people looked distracted even slightly out of balance looking past him or around him michael began to be aware of something out of kilter beyond his own unease the barman wore a turban and tossed the glass up in the air and caught it like tom cruise except that his eyes were fixed on something just to michaels left michael followed the barmans gaze and finally understood people were staring past michael at the same object they were staring at tarzan the beige woman was intent a cuddly woman carrying a tray kept turning in their direction even the mango woman kept glancing through him michael himself was vapourware but he was with the most overwhelming man in the room right behind johnny stood an old man he was intent and pale and looked shaken as if he had seen a traffic accident cords of loose sinew hung down his neck he wore a glass bow tie blue with mirrors and a blue eye where the knot should be he didnt move transfixed hello michel said to him the old mans face quavered like a flower in a breeze someone else out of balance its a miracle the man insisted as if someone had contradicted him michael felt careless it is he agreed it really is him the old man said in the hushed voice of someone visiting chartres theyre both romanian said michael family resemblance he realized he knew the old man from somewhere some old actor some old impresario very suddenly the old man wilted he seemed to sink from the knees and michael had to catch him there were further steps a spiral staircase up to another floor the old man shifted awkwardly like a collapsing ironing board michael lowered him down to sit on the steps the old man took out an embroidered handkerchief do you want some water michael asked please said the old man the turbaned bartender already had a glass of water ready is your friend ok he asked american concerned i dont know i think so said michael the old man was sweaty his elegance outraged he mopped his brow elegance was what he had left he took the water and sipped it and sighed you keep thinking you can just turn a corner and youll find us all there like we were his rumpled old eyes suddenly went clear as if made out of glass beautiful and at the height of our powers like all of you now tuh it seems more real to me than this he held up his hands they were blue and crisp in patches and looked like melted candles eighty michael thought ninety the old eyes strayed back to johnny johnny was standing tall and still and distant forgetful of himself he was staring at the fig tree behind the glass wall did you know him michael asked i mean the real one the old man shook his head without moving his eyes oh no no but i wanted to people of my generation you know we had never seen anything like it for only a very few years he was it a sensation people dont remember that now he closed his eyes and shuddered the past is a chasm its as well not to look down he said michael sat next to him on the steps how old were you then the old mans eyes looked as if they ached i was twentytwo when i saw the first of his films of course in those days you thought you were the only one in the world and so you dreamed you know what i mean i dont have to spell it out you lived in dreams because you knew that you were a good person or good enough but you wanted things that everyone else said were evil it was difficult you ended up loving dreams he shivered gathering himself up youve been very kind he said and offered a hand im so sorry to have a been a nuisance i used not to be but age hits you you know perhaps youd like to meet him his name is johnny a pause for about a beat it wont embarrass him i think youll find he is beyond embarrassment michael helped him stand up the old man rose with a sudden fluidity that hinted at what he had been when young the terrible thing he said casually as if making a general observation is that we feel more as we get older not less the heart really ought to diminish along with everything else dont you think his eyes were iceblue and not at all weak at one time those eyes would have presided gone flinty with the hard bargaining and constant politicking of putting on a show he would have been cagey cunning enthusiastic wise and probably indelibly handsome in an etiolated london theatrical way without meaning to michael sketched with his own hands and eyes how the old man would have moved in the joints of his hips he embodied the way the old man moved now michael felt the bargain he had made with ageing with the death of colleagues the death of his world michael had seen that bargain collapse because of him because of the miracle michael was moved by pity he suddenly felt that something might be in his power i know i can make them do what i want can i make them do it when im not there with someone else he stopped the old man and asked in a low voice do you know this place oh zoltan he exhibits me as a piece of camp history but it is good to receive invitations i mean do you know if theres a bedroom you can go there the old face went limp flesh as confused and blank as his understanding i mean said michael you and he could go there what an extraordinary thing michael felt a full heart full of victory perhaps in part and also guilt for hurting phil but full of what abundance too these episodes wherever they came from were an abundance a superabundance that ached to be shared i create them michael thought i make them he told johnny what he wanted him to do tarzan turned and climbed the steps perhaps without even knowing why michael hoisted the old man around and helped him up the steps outside the bedroom door the old man turned still in disbelief and michael had to give him a gentle shove then michael stood guard he sat on the top step looking over a party at which he did not belong he wished that he smoked at least smoking would have occupied his hands someone dragged open the big glass doors to clear the air and the party moved out into the sheltered garden suddenly you could hear air move in trees he gave them twenty minutes then the old man blurted out of the bedroom doorway like a coltish teenager his glass tie was askew his smile was wet and broad it was a grin he looked foxed as if a shaft of godlight had blazed its way back into his life michael had time to feel happy for him then he saw tarzans face tarzan was innocent no longer his face had curdled with disgust and outrage his look said to michael i want to kill you he gave one animal growl and then hurled himself over the banister of the landing people screamed tarzan landed catlike on his four padded feet then he jumped up onto the bar bounded over the heads of the people dont hurt anyone michael commanded tarzan jumped up into the fig tree and gave one long backward yodel the tarzan cry he scampered up the branches the main trunk bent under his weight then sprang back and he leapt up and over the brick wall it was as if he were suspended for just one moment against the stars then he sank from view everyone in the room applauded michael tried to leave but he was magnificent who was he the beige woman asked michael thrust his way past her and through the crowd billy stood back for him at the head of the stairs he knew something was wrong what happened he asked walking with michael down to the kitchen i made him do something said michael and heard his own voice shaken sick at heart billys high heels made a sound like carmen miranda as he ran on ahead to fetch michaels coat does he have any other clothes billy asked hell freeze out there michael stopped and turned and faced him hes the real thing ok hes not in costume michael stumbled out the front door in the brick street he could hear the murmuring of the party it was cold and he felt lumpen and foolish in his leopard skin it was a bleak place of old brick warehouses and a single closed pub with lights on and street lamps throbbing yellow like the aftermath of a burglary yes i can make them do what i want i can violate them im sorry michael said to the shadows and street lights johnny im sorry not johnny said a voice it was fierce with pain affirmation tarzan me tarzan michael stood and waited he could see nothing he walked forward out of the light to the side of the house in shadow tarzan stood there he hugged his arms and shivered and the top of his head was pressed against the wall im sorry michael said again tarzan threw off his hand tarzan want woman he said accusing michael had made tarzan let himself be sucked off by an yearold man it would have been the first time he had had sex the first time in his fictional universe that sex had ever been present love for him had been sexless kindness tickling and caresses it had been the sensuality of childhood michael felt the full crushing weight of what he had done the physical reality of sex is always a jolt how much worse if it is the wrong gender with loose jaws and crumpled flesh sick old man said tarzan all three things were out of kilter he loved you michael tried to explain tarzan snarled in rejection that that was not love it wasnt his fault he didnt know johnny glowered at him you want that too this was pushing certain buttons from michaels past those buttons pushed deep i didnt touch you i left you as you were did did you want to do anything with me johnnytarzan considered i wanted what you wanted he made a cutting gesture with the edge of his hand only that to hold and be held johnnys eyes fixed on michael were now those of an adult michael had destroyed any trace of affection in them that affection could only survive in innocence tarzan had grown up he had wisdom boy looked at johnny i dont know what you are but you have feelings of your own and a mind of your own and you have a right to be happy michael thought of jane swimming naked in darkness in the jungle of innocence maybe he thought maybe i just fancy her enough suddenly there were many urgent questions to be answered do they have to be male can i make more than one at once where do they go back to the answers came quickly one after another there was a blurring of flesh as if reality had been dipped in turpentine flesh smeared like paint something flowed sideways out of tarzans belly and ribs skin and bone poured out of him onto the pavement flesh sprouted like a plant in timelapse photography growing a leather skirt like leaves long hair like flowers in the time it takes to pipe a musical scale jane had risen out of tarzan she stood beside him as if fresh from the depths of the river she was played by maureen osullivan she was tiny with a face as fragile as china under a mass of wiry hair michael introduced them jane tarzan tarzan jane click they fitted together they had been married in spirit from the beginning michael spoke quickly to jane who always spoke for both of them michael asked can you go elsewhere janes chin thrust out and her voice was chilled im afraid i dont know what you mean it was the voice she used with new york lawyers can you go back to your jungle he asked i mean does it exist somewhere janes face softened her voice quickened i think we can yes back to the treehouse with its flintstone home conveniences waterwheels driven by elephants back to a land where animals spoke and tarzan could talk with them where lions lived in forests where chimps and gorillas mingled in the same tribes a world where there was always another wonder another lost tribe another adventure protectively jane took the arm of her innocent come tarzan she said her voice cracking like an adolescents on the love she felt for him were going home and michael felt the same ache of yearning he had felt as a feminine boy he yearned for love for that particular love between them he heard the mgm strings swelling like his heart like his adolescent sexuality for them both so michael sent them home he sent them to their monochrome jungle full of giant trees with conveniently placed trapeze swings tired old predators prowled slowly but were speeded up when anyone was looking where love filled their days in prelapsarian innocence the pub lights rippled again and the two of them evaporated into fiction reels of film that had never been shot hypothesis angels are a kind of fiction method call up an angel who is entirely fictional who killed dumb duck when michael was sixteen years old there had been a hit movie called dumb duck detective it combined live action with stateoftheart animation and it resurrected a great old cartoon character called dumb duck it was michaels fourth trip to california and he saw it in floods of tears to escape he had to get out of the house the television was barred to him and his favourite records had been broken michael had fled wanting never to return wanting to die he sat trying to follow the plot while crawling inside his own skin with anxiety dumb duck was a detective and his partner was a real live human gumshoe played by clint eastwood dumb duck asks his partner to follow his wife taffy duck im too closssh to thisssh thing dumb duck sprays everybody every time he talks only clint eastwood can stand it eastwood follows the wife but she keeps giving him the slip and you keep on hearing things about her like shes generous like shes a goodtime girl like she keeps you guessing you dont see her so you assume shes a duck like her name then suddenly dumb duck is found murdered hes been partially erased there are still crumbs of mingled eraser dust and ink on the floor the wife shows up having spent the night elsewhere she tells everybody shes innocent she looks like a combination of lana turner and rita hayworth shoehorned into a dress that clings to her like a kids tongue to a lollipop she hunkers down over the corpse and cries and her heaving boobs make a sound like rubber balloons eastwood goes to her nightclub he sits in the dark and watches her sing taffy sings like marlene dietrich she rasps every word she sings like somebodys tickling your testicles shes a sex bomb married to a duck gay men can desire a woman if she is caked in enough artifice young michael forgot his trauma he found himself yearning to bury his face in those huge soft perfect breasts and sleep and wake up somewhere else as someone else it was a comedy about being wrongly accused of murder ho ho the weapon a giant eraser stamped the philadelphia rubber company is found in the trunk of taffys car tests confirm that the inkgroup is the same as dumb ducks for young michael taffys nightmare became his nightmare at that age he felt more affinity for fantasy than reality when the film was over it was back to reality though in a curious way he felt the burden had been shared it was many years ago but michael still felt that affinity the idea of calling up taffy made michael grin sideways he didnt fancy clint eastwood at all you arent meant to fancy clint eastwood you are meant to want to be clint eastwood eastwood had played the gumshoe like humphrey bogart michael went out to jermyn street and bought himself a trenchcoat and an oldfashioned fedora hat and then he wondered where you could go on a hot date with someone who was obviously an animated cartoon it might cause comment at the savoy a candlelight dinner a deux at home was the answer phil as always was going to be out michael told him ive got a hot date so come back late does this one jump out of trees as well phil asked ho ho michael cooked a light meal of salmon with salad and cold chablis light enough to assuage hunger not heavy enough to weigh down desire then michael put on his trenchcoat and his s hat and waited go he told the universe at pm at pm the phone rang it was her oh mr shamus she said breathlessly helplessly thank you for returning my call i need help so badly and i dont know who i can turn to well we can talk in private here how soon can you make it over i took the liberty of preparing a meal michael curled his upper lip inwards talking american oh thank you but i couldnt possibly eat im too upset i got a good bottle of chablis growing dew in the cooler it was like being in a roleplaying game there was a pause mr shamus im sorry im afraid cartoons cant drink wine it dissolves the gouache forgive me no no i know its hard for you to imagine what its like im just so pleased that finally finally someone wants to listen to me that damsel in distress routine standard forties stuff the audience can read it like a peach velvet skin and pit and so can i under that svelte exterior pulses animal heat you spend most of the movie absolutely sure she did it and that shes playing eastwood for a sucker you see eastwood falls for her and if eastwood falls for somebody you do too she was the kind of woman whose high heels you hear ten minutes before the doorbell rings youre there waiting trying to pretend you arent hanging on like its a liferaft wheres the shipwreck youve got sweaty palms and the fettuccine arent cooked the doorbell rings you wipe your hands on your trousers and you open the door there should be a soundtrack the kind with blowsy music played on a sax shes delicious shes a cartoon so her skin controls the light and shadow on her face right now shes dramatic backlit lots of shadows and she looks up mournfully helplessly an unlit cigarette sticks to a white kid glove the white kid glove goes up above her elbow the gown is strapless showing acres of shoulder and collarbone the white fur stole has fallen back down to her elbows like shes disrobing in public her red hair has a life of its own it moves in a mass like a sexy octopus and there are no individual strands of hair her way of saying hi is to hold out one long kid glove oh mr shamus im so glad we finally meet now i can put a face to that kind kind voice never in real life could a pink dress be cut that low around mammary organs that large and stay in place come in come in please like the gumshoe is a priest offering sanctuary michael reminds himself this is an animated cartoon its walking across my hall carpet and her stiletto heels leave no impression the white fur slips trails the assumption is that he will take it up and hang it on nonwire hangers he does her head hangs down and she looks up coyly the cigarette weighty on her lips could i trouble you for a light no one in the household smokes and all michael can do is offer a rolledup newspaper lit from the gasstove pilot this kind of blows his cool gumshoe exterior she looks stricken as he holds up the torching newspaper im sorry i should have asked if you smoked how thoughtless of me michael reassures her no no no problem as he tries to put out the newspaper before it burns his fingers finally he flips it into the toilet the basin is still full of flame when he closes the bathroom door he arrives back in time to slide the chair under her as she sits down i cant tell you how awful its been people simply dont understand my relationship with uncle duck oh i know he was older than i he was also a duck but then hey youre both cartoons people find it so hard to believe that you can love someone for their mind those terrible cheap parts the studio made him play you mean the one where he keeps blowing off the top of the bald hunters head or the one where he drops an anvil on it this is a duck who dreamed of playing hamlet who read philosophy who wrote poetry always tell an intelligent person that theyre beautiful always tell a beautiful person theyre intelligent tell a cartoon that theyre both michael says it must have been wonderful for him to find a soulmate like you dreamily she nods reading the classics by firelight together it was all i ever wanted except for your boyfriend bruno bruiser taffy bursts into hollywood starlet tears all coughing sobs hankies and dry eyes and to think that people could say that i am capable of of uhhuh uhhuh sniffle forgive me for carrying on like this its understandable under the circumstances michael lays his hand on top of hers and she gives his a quick warm squeeze she feels warm human warm but smoother too slick no creases or texture to the gloved and perfect hands michael do you really want to have sex with a cartoon she looks up determined now we must find whoever killed my husband i have money mr shamus ill pay every last penny of it to find out who killed uncle duck and to prove you didnt do it i warn you i dont exactly come cheap mrs duck she breathes heavily and leans forward people say that youre the best in the business appreciatively she takes his hand again perhaps we can leave this difficult decision until later wont you eat something starving yourself wont help taffy looks wistful she has a perfect tiny nose that is completely invisible except when she is in profile no thank you cartoons are different from people were fuelled only by our motivations your motivations our passions they sometimes take us over we like or dont like we love or dont love ok lets go for it then shamus says still steely in his oldfashioned white knighttough guy pose perhaps you know how i feel about you alarmed she stands up no dont say it she flees to the window on little highheel steps and frames her face between her kid gloves mrs duck taffy kiss me what does it mean when a homosexual wants to stick his face between two artificial breasts it means that what he finds desirable about them is that men have thought of those breasts men imagined them and drew them and shaped them and shaded them it means it is the male desire behind the image that draws him the desire of other men no we must wait no one will know it is our secret our love but the court case people will talk you dont know what its been like oh taffy her lips are not human lips they are better than human lips they are like juicy fruit chewing gum thick delicious mobile wads that respond immediately to pressure yielding and flowing but never too wet they are the best lips michael has ever kissed and no moustache over the tiny pinprick of her nose her eyes go wide wider big as saucers oh oh michael hold me hold me close take away the fear he cradles her she has an invented nature and her invented nature is to respond in this way her mammoth breasts heave against him the fabric of the pink dress stretches she protests but it is in the script though normally after the fadeout the breasts are unleashed from their pink constraints they are platonic breasts breasts in the ideal large and firm but also soft peachcoloured with babybottle nipples they are supported protected by her crossed fluid arms she keeps changing shape subtly to embody the ideal her nipple fills his mouth she tastes tangy and slightly salty he fondles a nipple with his tongue and it engorges michael thinks of all those hairy arms that drew those breasts the thick hands that outlined the nipples through the pink of the dress did they dream of supping where he now sups michael feels his lips move in unison with theirs he lolls her in his mouth oh my love she gasps her thighs are perfect and without pores her translucent panties shimmer their own way down michael sees pudenda as babyishly appealing and roundeyed as bambi or thumper there is a buttoncute clitoris under his tongue unlike the breasts it tastes real a cartoon orgasm as yet unfilmed makes the cheeks of her face quake and ride up like a stocking her breasts not only heave but swell her face is nearly the colour of tomatoes and her eyes are huge and crossed she looks like shes drowning desperately holding her breath suddenly the nipples blow off steam clouds of it the breasts whistle in unison like two trains in a race taffy settles back crumpling she goes fluid and pours down over the sofa onto the carpet as flexible as a shadow taking the shape of whatever supports her she lies there panting for a moment then sticks one of her fingers into her mouth and reinflates herself puffing as if she were an air mattress later she dresses in a ladylike fashion smoothing down her hair and pulling straight the fingers of her gloves she expertly cups the breasts back into their impossible fittings of pink michael i want to tell you this that was one of the finest moments of my life you know so much about the needs of a woman how to lift her up away from the inelegant struggle to survive no my dear thats what you know what you know is what the men who embodied you want elegance adjusting the perfect pink dress need you turn your back for me to do up the zipper and i see the strong back with two ridges of muscle down either side of the spine you lift up the mass of your hair to show what every man dreams the back of a womans neck is like class what clumsy sweaty fat balding men imagine they want from women they want to merge with elegance and delicacy gain it by association she fiddles with what can only be called an evening bag she extracts from it a tiny flat silver case and takes out of it a single white address card call me please i need to know i can rely on someone the high heels clack on a carpet the high heels control their own sound the dress swishes like someone shushing a child to sleep the shoulders wait for their white furs a hint of shoulder blade drawn onto the broad expanse of her back he complies with the script or perhaps his fathers idea of how men should behave and brings her wrap she accepts it demurely in a manner that can only be called gracious as she walks away towards his front door her bottom is shaped exactly like an upsidedown heart under clouds of fur his door opens at the same moment as the neighbours door across the hall in the doorway opposite stands a little girl she gapes at taffy a sixfoottall animated cartoon fills the apartment corridor and leans over warm and giggling well hello there says taffy who are you she coos with a voice like melted ice cream mum mum come quick the little girl cries in panic and turns and lets the door close taffy duck turns to michael and shrugs she blows him a kiss and as if disturbed by it the air ripples and closes over her just as the neighbours front door opens again perfect at the end of the movie you find out that she didnt do the murder her boyfriend bruno did she really loved the duck and the detective after all the last shot is a long kiss between realities but no one ever shows what happens after the ending twenty years before at the end of the film michael stood up and drove back to the condo in oceanside and told his father im going back home tomorrow his father said nothing he just stared up at him from the sofa michael still remembered his fathers crew cut and his fathomless eyes full of hatred like the old actor said the past is a chasm dont look down michael stood looking down in his own sitting room wearing a trenchcoat and fedora fancy dress again weeeellllllll he thought it was fun and i always was good at acting uhhuh and you didnt come and you didnt have a hardon so the sex was acting too she was about as far from the real as you can get so when do you get real michael how you dont even know how do you you just keep repeating your youth and it wasnt even a happy youth michael do people i copy really know it michael remembered tony the real tony had some kind of sense of what his copy had done it was one thing to hurt a fictional character it was another thing to harm someone real michael had no business experimenting on people without being able to assess the extent of the trauma he might be inflicting but he couldnt test it first because he couldnt call up anyone without being able to assess the damage etc etc and it was not the sort of thing he could test on chickens unless he was about to make the unwelcome discovery that he lusted after livestock so how could he gauge what it was like to have a copy made of you michael spent a day in an experimental hall of mirrors until that metaphor gave him his method he checked himself into the hotel chez nous he approached the front desk with some trepidation he thought that tarzan would have left the sheets covered in body makeup explaining that would be embarrassing the clerk was french and had irritating nostrils they looked as if they were flaring in disgust at an unpleasant odour he took michaels card and once he had come up on the screen said smoothly welcome back mr blasco it seemed there was no record of max factor on the linen the clerk asked the screen your usual room sir it was indeed the usual room it was so usual michael could not be sure if it really was the same room or not his stomach felt feathery as if he had missed breakfast he was he realized a little bit afraid of what he was going to do next he started unbuttoning his shirt knowing it was a delaying tactic every episode was a delaying tactic he should just forget all of it go to alaska street to get his rocks off and hope the whole thing would go away but then he would never know what this thing had come for look how can it hurt you how can it hurt you that is any more than you have hurt yourself just do it and then youll know and that will help you decide to forget it write it off just do it michael called up a copy of himself the air wavered parting to admit the newcomer he was tall and stocky at the same time you only noticed on the second glance that he was not fat but really quite muscular the hair on the arms disguised the definition immediately michael felt sympathy for him there was an air of caged and baffled decency about him a slight scowl a hopeful smile in fact he was not at all badlooking what michael called a black celt slightly sallow skin a heavy beard and black eyes michael fancied himself its a wellknown syndrome and it had afflicted michael far worse than most daughters meeting their longlost fathers for the first time sisters and brothers separated at birth meeting on a course there are two great triggers for sexual desire extreme but complementary genetic difference or extreme genetic similarity you either find someone completely different to complete the genetic puzzle or someone who is kindred so here he was dragged back to the seat of his neuroses himself oh said michael and michael together then they both chuckled shyly and looked down at their shoes in unison um they said in unison embarrassed they looked up at each other and two pairs of black eyes sunk into each other oops they said understanding each other perfectly they wanted to fuck themselves with that unspoken agreement they both began to undress love finds faults endearing for the first time ever michael saw that he only combed his rich black unruly hair in front the back of his head was practically in dreadlocks the back of one trouser leg was tucked into the top of his socks he looked back around and it was true of him too oh well he was a bachelor the angel turned back to face him and viewed as a stranger he stirred michaels heart with forgiveness for what it means to be human here was a man of winters crepe paper around the corner of his eyes and it was not until you held him that you realized all that flesh was solid somebody should tell him about his choice of knickers and socks the white yfronts were slipped to one side and there was a penis that was in no way as tiny as michael thought it had a nice round head that was beginning to swell and weep what they both began and broke off with a chuckle and a shrug they were going to ask what now they didnt need to a lover who really understands you who really knows what you are thinking michael had not felt such a surge of desire since he was sixteen years old heedless and irresistible with no discussion they were pulled towards each other to embrace in the french sense of the term to kiss suddenly his copy jerked his head aside lips pressed shut he was frightened of aids it was insulting disappointing and childish the original michael said we can hardly give each other something we dont already have and immediately there was a sense of parting very slight like a tangerine being peeled they were no longer exactly one their histories were now very slightly different thats true said the copy trying to look amused he was stiff and awkward and gave michael a peck on the lips did michael feel a slight echo somewhere like a double image did he not very slightly feel his own lips peck someone elses while they themselves were being kissed sorry the copy said and gave michael a little cajoling shake old habits die hard he planted another chaste kiss on michaels cheek michael felt a falling away he let his own penis drop and looked down and saw his copy thrashing uselessly away at himself that was always the pattern hed start out well with a promising swelling gallons of lubricant and then the sudden irretrievable collapse were not going to be much use to each other are we the original michael said we could just cuddle said his copy hopefully michael had done enough cuddling he looked at his own body and asked it why its a beautiful body everything else about it works shall we try again michael asked himself ok chuckled the copy weakly it was lie michael knew he was ashamed and now simply wanted to escape this michael was an amazingly disheartening sexual partner but michael was determined to persevere for both their sakes it is a very strange thing to kiss yourself there is no change of taste and you know exactly what the tongue will do how it will respond id never realized thought michael how useful my lips are i hated my fat lips but theyre great for kissing if only this angel would move them michael leaned back and looked at himself he was surprised at how angry he felt he had been moved roused and then let down it felt like rejection it felt personal he made a soft fist and gave his partner a gentle chiding thump there was a distant disturbance in his own shoulder as if someone had thrown a pebble into a pool some distance away now you know how other people feel said his copy something dark and steely creeping into his own eyes oh jesus lets sit down said michael they sat next to each other on the bed his partner looked defeated mournful michael put an arm around his shoulder to comfort him and they lay side by side comrades rather than lovers michael changed the subject you feel anything from me a kind of a buzz it wouldnt hurt you would it the copy scowled i dont think i would know what it was i just wanted to know if i could hurt people the angel sighed it would give them a turn if they showed up at your flat and met themselves by mistake ill remember that they turned and looked into each others faces like brothers like friends they both had the same dark eyes and his copys eyes were black and sad do i always look this mournful having sex isnt sex supposed to be fun the angel asked do you have any idea how we got this way the focus of michaels vision seemed to shift and he saw something in the face and jumped up and scuttled away jesus christ you look just like dad michael turned back around and the bed was empty even the baggy yfronts had gone can angels do work back at work ebru asked michael where do you go in the afternoons her smile was rueful teasing an evident miseenscene because her eyes were saying youre supposed to be running this place lunch replied michael why was there a problem she was leaning as if relaxed across her desk she sprawled it was a difficult posture to read because it seemed friendly but was also disrespectful her voice drawled she sounded sleepy the university called you were supposed to be teaching a course today oh shit oh no of course its thursday ebru looked bored what could i do i told them you would call when you got back oh jees was it professor dennis oh dam ok ill give her a call could you leave me with your number please where you will be when you go out yeah sure ill get a mobile so you can call me michael jerked forward wanting to escape ebru had more to say the grant application forms have been on your desk for a week i just wanted to make sure you knew they were there michael had to apply for funds for the next stage of research they were to teach the chicks tasks such as pushing buttons for food the aim was to keep the facility going so the university could rent it out for other projects the aim was that michael would eventually make himself some kind of director right yes ive been meaning to get to that emilio was saying that he has not been told the file names for the control group slides this means he has fallen behind on his data entry and filing sorry said michael a lot on my plate ebru dismissed it as if sleepy i wasnt chasing you oh yes you were alone in his windowless office michael told himself you have been neglecting your job it had been just over three weeks since the episodes began there had been five afternoons at the chez nous four with johnny and one with himself they had moved from late winter into spring how did he think people would not notice there was a fridge full of frozen unfiled slides how could he ask people to work for him people who were on shortterm contracts which meant they could not get a mortgage how could he ask them to work punctiliously perfectly as science demanded and oh shit he was also supposed to be writing a phase paper on the difference between windows nt and unix for his msc in computer science it was due next monday hed done nothing about it michael hung his head and then lowered it into his hands from shame god he found himself asking why have you done this to me god in the form of the painted brick wall could not answer or rather decided not to or rather couldnt be bothered well the wall seemed to say on its own behalf if not gods im just a wall and not very interesting but i am the life you have chosen you put yourself in this office with these slides and files and papers and coursework and youd better get on with it michael needed to talk to someone he had no one to talk to most especially not his staff his lover or their friends all his friends were phils friends help he said in a small voice that was not meant to be heard hiya said a voice that poised somewhere in midatlantic something white moved in the corner of his eye his angel was sitting on the corner of the desk wearing his white lab coat his smile was mild and his eyes faded he looked detached michael saw himself i have good feelings for people but i dont connect so they dont always know that hiya michael said ive been neglecting things you have a miracle to deal with ah i think youll find that most people who have one of those find its a fulltime job i mean phil dick just saw pink lights and look how long that took to sort out michaels face shook itself with unexpected tears like a dog getting out of water he certainly didnt feel that unhappy the reaction didnt seem to link to any emotion until he spoke vehemently i didnt want an extra fulltime job i didnt ask for this what is it for what i am supposed to do with it and why why me the angel looked back big and kindly and powerless i know less than you do michael apologized his default mode im sorry this isnt easy for you either i dont matter im not real the angel managed to say that with a smile why dont you let me help it took a while for the anger to be stilled the angel kept talking i know what you know i can do just as good a job as you can weve got a backlog why dont you stay here and do the accounts or whatever ill go to the fridge and do the slides what a wonderful idea michael chuckled itll be like the shoemaker and the elves lets wait until tonight said the angel that way no one will see you in two places at the same time we dont want to give anyone a heart attack can we talk afterwards michael asked he felt the same yearning he would for a lover sure baby that was what michael always used to say to phil when they were young and in love so he filled in the form for the second stage of their research grant and wrote the first draft of the accompanying business case michaels career plan was simple he would keep using the lab for further research projects until his own reputation was established and then let out the secure facility for other projects at pm he was able to bustle into ebrus office fluttering papers well here we go this is the business case for the grant first draft can you read it for me make any comments oh i also know nothing about the admin costs so could you run off a on the office expenses ebru was still watchful languid its five oclock do you need it this instant not right now of course close of play tomorrow for the comments ill need the sometime tomorrow morning i can do that for you she said airily gathering up her bag no she seemed to say i am not working late to make up for your lost time she smiled a hazy hooded smile at him and gave him a dinky little wave with the tips of her fingers good night see you tomorrow faultlessly polite the draft was left on her desk he was left standing alone in the room i have really pissed her off it was and there was absolutely no one there they had all gone home who would work late if the boss wasnt there the whole universe has burst its bonds in order to put you in this position impossible things are happening and they are screwing up your life and nothing in your intellectual or emotional history has prepared you for them and you have allowed yourself to become alone his only friend was literally himself michael went into the cold room there was his other self big and happy a cheerful anorak singing old wham songs bad boys the angel was merry in his work he turned around smiling the smile coming from being usefully employed and suffering no doubts when michael smiled his eyes went tiny and narrow almost closed and that in turn made him look a bit like a chinese santa claus just started said the angel cheerfully his breath came out as vapour frost settled on his eyebrows things really arent that bad emilios been good hes using a temporary naming convention which we might as well accept and everythings been labelled in boxes it just needs to be put away properly the angel pulled open a drawer there were the first of his slides label side up and out in neat rows theres only about an hours work things really werent that bad relief was like a pillow michael settled into it the work would be done he would apologize to emilio and amends would be made it would be all right ill be back then michael kept the need out of his voice back in his office there were emails needing answers they were mostly from the university agendas or minutes attached or new curriculum proposals he went through picking the most important first his professor had written three days ago asking if the project was progressing well michael defaulted to apologies sorry ive been in the grip of applying for grants wouldnt it be great if someone just said fine heres all the money you need in one go we could put it in the bank and use the interest for the project as well but the project is going fine great a lot of data to work through there was an invitation to speak at a conference with a carefully worded guarantee of security we realize your work is controversial we will make sure that only nominated delegates can attend so all questioning will be on the methodology and preliminary results this was exactly the kind of fallout michael had wanted from the research increased profile keynote addresses publications and acknowledgement if only from a very few people worldwide michael accepted the invitation feeling suddenly that all was right with the world how delicious he thought i can pay my bills and iron shirts at the same time i can stay late for one hour and do two hours work everything will be perfect my desk will finally be cleared the flat will finally be clean at last ill finally get everything done he felt merry there were all kinds of admin he could feel virtuous about there was his own personnel file that had been left blank lets get that out of the way he had to fill in the name of the nearest relative to call in case of accident once again it would be his mother miles away and untelephoned in sheffield was there anyone else for whom he was number one it wasnt phil who loves ya baby all done he heard himself say michael looked up at the big reliable broken face he felt himself smile with gratitude so am i he said thanks youd do the same for me said the angel and grinned it was a michael kind of joke he wouldnt be able to get a copy of himself past the security guard without telling some pointless story hi this is my identical twin im going to have to let you go michael said quietly his voice he realized was full of love i understand the whisper in the air like a blown kiss papers on the desk rattled lifted up and sighed back into place and michael was left feeling a little lonelier he packed up his bag turned out the light and decided in the corridor just to look at all the beautiful slides the cold room had a big white door and a big chrome handle it was like a s refrigerator you could walk into its surface trembled slightly from the chundering of the generator it shook like michael you are in a bit of a state mate the door clunked open the cold room breathing out refreshingly chill air the temperature only sank into your bones and numbed your fingers once you were inside he switched on the light and pulled open a drawer to admire the neat rows to be grateful instead there was a crumpled much reused box its red ink fingersmeared cluttered with a crosshatch of piled slides a whole weeks work neglected and growing it was as if someone had reached into him and grabbed his heart and held it still he pulled open another drawer it too simply stored an unsorted box all that beautiful work was gone but he had seen it hed seen it all being done it was all just here in a panic he pulled open one icy drawer after another the tips of his fingers stuck to the metal each time one drawer was spread with unsorted slides the next was empty he pulled open another drawer and ah this one was full of ranked and ordered slides there was a moments relief until he checked the dates it was the first batch of slides from the learning group emilio had finished sorting that last week it was all undone as if the angel had never been michael clasped his own forehead in his hands you may have seen it michael and you may be going nuts he called his angel back where are your slides michael whispered what what do you mean well have a look the copy pulled open the drawer his face fell his chin dropped and looked temporarily double he turned his whole body as if his back was stiff his chin still resting on his chest yes well the copy whispered im not real am i he did not manage to smile he closed the drawer slowly delicately with the tip of his finger he stared at the drawer i cant change anything he looked back at michael and tried to smile i cant write anything when i go so will all the marks on the page i could do all your annual accounts and in the morning youd be back where you started i cant father a child i cant make a difference to anything the two michaels stared at each other it really is a very peculiar sensation said the copy and chuckled i am completely and totally impotent the grin glazed can you send me back now please afterwards michael went to the security room the guard shafiq sat there in slateblue uniform watching eastenders shafiq do you think we could look at the cctv tapes please shafiq was eating a pot noodle his mouth stopped circulating for an instant and he froze in place then he swallowed and stood up why michael is something wrong has there been an intrusion no no no shafiq nothings wrong i just want to check on something shafiq was upset i have been here all the time michael watching really the television was still talking and his eyes listed guiltily towards it i watch the television you know but i always keep one eye on the cctv too i know shafiq you do an excellent job i just want to check in a more normal state michael would have been stricken with concern shafiq was a good man a good father who was proud of his work shafiq seemed to drop to his knees in prayer and began to open up the banks of secure tapes what rooms do you think suffered when about two hours ago lets try my office your office michael could hear the bottom drop out of shafiqs stomach with all your records and papers he really does care thought michael why does he care what have i given him that he should give a tinkers shafiq inserted the cassette and nervously punched rewind but ebru and everyone were here two hours ago michael they would have heard something too it wasnt fair to scare shafiq like this but looking at the security tapes would confirm something there it is sir michaels office and there was michael turned around in his chair and plainly talking to empty air thank you shafiq you can turn it off now dont you want to wait until you leave the office shafiq was beginning to look baffled how would there be an intruder if you were there all along its not an intruder ok please shafiq dont be too concerned do you think you can show me the cold store interior at shafiq was going from baffled to slightly annoyed what are we looking for michael perhaps i could suggest something else the cctv looks at all the doors and even the ventilation shafts im sorry to trouble you shafiq but please show me the cold room looked grey and indistinct and empty it was hard to see for a moment michael thought he saw something move as if through fog he peered but was finally sure beyond doubt there was no one there the security video jumped between frames taken one second apart suddenly the door was halfopen suddenly it was wide open suddenly michael himself stepped in in stages lurching like frankensteins monster he stayed alone and chatting to no one ok shafiq false alarm shafiq stood up straight and adjusted his blue shirt but if there has been anything moved surely it would be better to study tapes when you werent there michael closed his eyes to avoid shafiqs face and his voice was unnaturally quiet and precise i was mistaken shafiq i dont want to worry you further thank you for helping he walked out of the room his back held straight in the corridor he thought im alone im really alone maybe i am just crazy but even if im not they arent real my angel said that they are the universe breaking its own rules if unreal people walked free to change the world it would be a catastrophe and so they come and work and love and when they leave they leave no evidence or trace behind they cant sort slides they cant be video taped the only evidence the only scars will be in my memory i am the only thing they can change otherwise poor angels when they go it is as if they never existed michael felt sad for them because i know that when they are here they love and feel and want when theyre here theyre alive michael sat at his desk and looked at the brick wall again and heard his own voice rage demanding why is the design of this experiment such crap what is a sample of one going to tell you god why bend all the rules of the universe just to do this terrible thing to me is it a joke god does it amuse you to see people knocked sideways their whole life go rotten like an apple do you like to see us hauled beyond our limits do you like to see us cry and why do this to an impotent man what is it going to teach me what are you going to learn from this except what we both know im lousy in bed whats the big deal about that i live with it ive learned to live with it michael went back to the cold room in a rage sweating in the chill he tore through the work the glass edges of the slides cut his fingers it took an hour when he was done he had a sudden moment of irrational fear that his own work would also disappear he closed the drawer and opened it again to check the work remained so maybe i do just make them up maybe i make up that other people see and hear them maybe i am just nuts michael arrived back at the flat late exhausted chilled and sweaty he must have looked a state phil glanced up at him from what looked like a plate of tomato sauce on cardboard you didnt tell me when you would be home phil said so i went ahead with dinner so when did phil ever call to say when hed be home michael sat down exhausted shambolic today was a bad hair day his scalp itched and he knew his hair tumbled down in dank greasy curls his five oclock shadow had arrived on time but now at pm it was even thicker and coated with cold sweat phil wouldnt look at him thats ok i guess said michael you probably dont realize that ive been coming home on time lately youre never in it was my effort to be here in case you wanted to go to a movie or anything phils eyes were shuttered like windows in the silence michael had the opportunity to examine phils newly vegetarian food there was no table fat on his bread phil asked in a light voice where exactly is your work it was a question that produced an automatic prickling sensation of suspicion even fear hold on thought michael this is phil then he thought hold on this is phil he stalled what do you mean oh its just that youve never told me thats all it cant be that long a trip waterloo isnt it waterloo no no no the elephant and castle phil shrugged elaborately and his eyes didnt move from the plate i thought it was waterloo his tiny mouth had to stretch to take a bite out of a chunk of bread that was the colour of brown shoes in an old warehouse or something michael began to trace the crisscross patterns of green on the waterproof tablecloth ive never said in an old warehouse or anything else certainly not in the arches underneath an elevated railway yeah an old warehouse near the old kent road phil nodded now very carefully very slowly michael pressed together his thick veined hands my boyfriend is pumping me for my work address so he can give it to animal rights demonstrators my boyfriend of thirteen years wants to betray me henry has such a nice smile doesnt he so how is the gorgeous henry the emphasis on the is somehow made it plain that michael had been reminded of henry by the previous topic that there was a connection between them hes fine thank you said phil coolly he doesnt even care that ive guessed michael struck back it was a bit like playing tennis you know many couples in our situation would be busy reassuring each other that they practised safe sex with their lovers theyd talk about whether they should be using condoms with each other but michael considered letting his voice trail delicately away but you play tennis to win but we dont have to do we phil we dont make love it was only then finally that michael realized he needed a new life can they give me aids after california michael spent the next ten years missing sexual opportunities as these years were to missing opportunities probably saved his life everyone else was going at it like ferrets not knowing there was something brandnew in the world by the time michael emerged from purdah he and the world knew things had changed and were taking precautions but it was already too late for several dear friends they rolled on all unknowing for many years all through the eighties into the nineties though they were like shrodingers cat already dead mathematically they had the virus or rather it had them if you can have sex with anyone in the world you need to know as a matter of urgency if they can make you ill answering this question presented michael with several interesting methodological difficulties if he experimented on himself and it made him ill that would indeed be a result but it would rather defeat the purpose on the other hand experimenting on someone else did raise certain ethical questions it was also methodologically suspect michael would first have to ensure that whoever was being tested was hiv negative to begin with proving hiv negative status is extremely difficult antibodies take three months to show up after infection that means a second test is necessary three months after the first during those three months you have to know absolutely that the person has avoided all risk of exposure to the virus that means no kissing if there are any doubts you have to test again three months after that if the subject was say a nun who never had sex with anyone michael would first have to find the one angel in the world who could seduce her and then persuade her that she needed an hiv test this scenario seemed unlikely perhaps his own angel could sleep with another angel with aids and then be tested twice once while the infected angel was still in the world and again once he had left it to see if the virus remained behind but that meant the slate would be cleaned whenever the carrying angel disappeared and even perhaps when his own experimental angel dipped in and out of existence both the infecting angel and his victim would have to remain in the world for an uninterrupted three months well michael could rent a house somewhere out of the way scotland maybe and have them live there under iron orders to sleep with no one else it was a little bit like keeping experimental dogs in kennels there was no doubt that science was easier when you did it to animals but angels are not people what if their immune systems worked differently suppose angels could infect people but not each other michael considered testing with a less serious virus he could conjure up an angel with a severe cold sleep with him and see if he caught anything or call up a copy with diphtheria on his moustache and swab his own lips and grow a culture but hiv was a retrovirus it copied itself into the rna of your cells and took over their reproductive function it becomes you and you are real suppose over the three months it worked its magic the virus became so entwined with your nonmiraculous body that it gained a real life the more he thought the more difficult and absurd it all became then he remembered that one of his many lost opportunities had grown up to be an expert on aids her name was margaret white but michael had known her in school as bottles they had been friends during michaels brief period of popularity before his last trip to california at sixteen michael was just american enough to find it easier to meet strangers and stay sunny and positive about things he was invited to parties he was likely to succeed and grumpy jealous spotty pale blokes grumbled about him behind his back michael was in the school theatre club and was big and strong and handsome and could act there were more girls in drama club than blokes so they did a production of anouilhs antigone lots of juicy female roles michael played the old hearttorn tyrant he moved with a combination of bullish swagger and slight arthritic limp that left the audience astonished michael had conjured up the king his sport was longdistance running the beefiness he inherited from his father was yet to develop he maintained an easy luxurious swing to the way he moved he combined beauty with a certain shy sweetness that did not threaten or repel and his black eyes reminded people of a particularly friendly lively spaniel indeed he was very good with animals he worked for the local vet parttime and had decided to become a veterinarian the nicest thing about michael was that he was no snob bottles was the unkind nickname given to a bigbreasted girl who existed on the social margins she was tall bigboned a little ungainly with a certain daffy spinning to her eyes her classmates whispered about her with a fascinated prurience because at sixteen bottles was living the life of grown woman she looked had adult boyfriends with cars and spent weekends in clubs rumour was accepted as fact bottles did a strip show in the local pub michael got to know bottles on a school trip to windsor castle an attempt to steep them in the mystique of royalty they met over a joke as they got off the train at one of windsor s stations bottles said to him cheerily my goodness two train stations is that so the queen can get away in case theres a revolution it was and there was little to make any hungry secondaryscholar feel wild free and funny bottles top was cut low and her breasts were squashed together showing pale skin and a hint of blue veins she had been sent home recently for the unheardof thing of piercing her nostril with an earring i mean do you suppose the queen goes to the toilet in public im being serious there she is waving to crowds and suddenly she gets caught short can she say sorry everyone i need a pit stop or does she just have to wait until she gets home to a sixteenyearold in the runup to the jubilee this was scandalously original bottles began to walk in a clenched constricted way and grunted in agony one is so pleased to be hyah michael laughed partly with disbelief that someone real could suddenly start saying such things he laughed with relief because he found bottles reassuring daftness is not only funny but very slightly pitiable michaels laughter was constrained by fear fear of being awkward or saying too much and this constraint made it elegant it was elegance that bottles craved both of them felt an irresistible tug of charm bottles suddenly put her arm through his you bottles announced are a louise michaels panic surfaced how did she know had someone told her if someone had told bottles then maybe everybody knew she saw it and chuckled dont look so baffled she said and stroked the top of his brown and flawless hand louise is a club its run by the most wonderful frenchwoman and shes called louise and so her club is too she lapsed into fake american you wanna go michael beamed relief and friendship absolutely without fail please after all he was the schools official american and americans are never supposed to be afraid she got the message he liked her friday night ok with you michael offered or saturday sunday monday tuesday full social calendar huh im a hot date but i can squeeze you in michael felt sophisticated all of im generally pretty busy except for weekdays and weekends aw she said and gave his hand a quick squeeze and youre the nicest man in the year at sixteen there is something irresistible about being called a man especially by someone who has had some experience of them and with whom for some reason you feel both safe and giddy at the same time so that friday they went to the club louise in soho michael loved it it was full of other daffy people starting with louise herself she sat in a basement cubbyhole greeting teenage visitors from bromley as if they were french aristocrats she took bottles coat long with a collar of black feathers that smelled of burnt sesame oil and kissed her on both cheeks and called her ma cherie with a skeletal detachment bottles looked a cool let alone sixteen she ordered champagne a woman called tami bubbled up to them nipping someone elses glass off a table en route she held it up empty with a hungry grin tami wore black gloves with rings on the outside something so chic it made michael speechless with admiration tami talked about american black music how only american black music was worth listening to did he see bowie at wembley amazing all done with just those brilliant white lights everything black and white and he just strolled out of this haze of light i got so excited i nearly mussed my perm michael loved station to station drunk emboldened by moral support he went up to the djs hidden booth and asked for his favourite track tvc instead of curling his lip in contempt as michael expected the dj said too right mate so up came tvc and michael out of sheer love began to dance this should have been terribly uncool no one else was dancing but michael was grinning like a monkey and he had decided at the last minute to rent a tuxedo onto which bottles had pinned her earrings somehow that was just right suddenly with an ungainly whoop bottles and most especially tami joined him that probably did it an awful lot of people looking tough at tables were suddenly left behind as people started to dance michael had trouble with conversation he was always scared of running out of things to say but dancing was inexhaustible and he used dancing to communicate he even did the terribly hippyish thing of linking arms and got away with it station to station kept coming back people groaned and shouted when it was turned off and michael found himself in the centre of a circle of people who knew where the good time was the good time was him tami put all her rings on his fingers they did a whipround and bought another bottle of champagne and bottles giggling poured it over his head like a ship being launched knowing somehow that he wanted to stain those hired dressy clothes at just the right moment she nipped him back to the table and stopped him drinking she sat looking at him affectionately introducing him to people it was like having a mother who was truly cool the next day his real mother bitter with disappointment and suspicion said did you take any drugs no mom who were you with a girl from school mom you were drinking youre underage his mother had a long pale face that had lost its prettiness quickly lining in her thirties her hair was an unattractive orange pudding basin with its roots showing michaels mum looked worn downtrodden and utterly wrapped up in her own unhappiness she looked like someone who had been deserted she also looked like someone who was enduring it its not a good way to begin life michael drinking in clubs reality was returning like a headache no mum her narrow face didnt trust him and didnt trust itself she didnt know what to think and gave her head a shake your clothes are ruined how can we turn them back into moss bros like that theyre used to it mom thats why people hire gear and they pay to have it cleaned and all do you have the money to pay for that or do you expect me to pay for it michael bottles gave him a call hiya hows tricks he didnt know what tricks were oh ok but moms on my case about the clothes bottles chuckled fun costs michael thats how you know its been real fun and not tv michael thought of sports teams in california and the coaches who all talked like general patton no pain no gain he mimicked calling them up no pain no game she corrected him so are you man enough for another night out at club louise perhaps he wasnt and that was the trouble at the very least he was scared that the magic wouldnt work a second time at the most michael was scared that she would make a pass at him he was confused confounded by sex her big breasts had allure but michael also knew already that his future did not lie with women he just had a lot of trouble finally admitting that to himself it made him awkward hi he kept saying brightly every time he saw her and nothing else he could think of nothing else to say he sounded like a chipmunk and felt five years old michael wanted his more normal friends to see how wise she was so he trapped her into a lunch with them the girls particularly were fashionable and elegant and calm and confident and virginal and enclosed within a social circle one of them grew up to be a newsreader another was now a big cheese at the british museum they eyed bottles who plainly had a rich future as a floozy the future newsreader widened her eyes and stared fixedly at michael and that meant what on earth are you doing with her and why have you brought her to our table ostentatiously bottles began to smoke in public in the school cafeteria this was likely to get the whole table into trouble the girls started to leave bottles had no social circle but promiscuously joked with anyone who would have her michael sat with her at these scattered tables surrounded by surly underachievers his mouth ran away with him he bragged to them about club louise he knew it was a mistake he could feel coolness slipping away but he wanted everyone to know that they had gone to a club so he repeated every last incident of their evening out like it was some big deal and bottles ground out her cigarette with impatience eventually michael stopped trying to spend lunchtime with her it was too painful he started to nod at her in corridors as they passed feigning mild friendship he knew bottles thought it was what always happened to her that there was something about her that put people off she was fed up being too old for her age gradually they lost touch michael saw bottles a year later hed convinced a bunch of people in his biology class to go to club louise louise still greeted visitors as if to a literary salon but inside the atmosphere was different tami didnt remember him she went hardfaced and silent when greeted by this pale stolidlooking nerd hmm hmm she said several times and pointedly moved on the music was terrible like something recorded by amateurs in a bathtub michael asked for station to station and the dj curled his lip people sat glumly and defensively at tables greeting only a very few people with effusive kissing on the cheeks that made plain to everyone else that they were not being kissed people rolled their eyes as you passed or said get out of the bleeding way honestly these stuckup queens bottles came in and at first michael didnt recognize her shed cut her hair and wore thick makeup that made her look egyptian she was kissed into a table with gladsome cries of feigned elegance and then they all fell into the same chill silence a ferretfaced young man with dyed blond hair was giving a very hard time to some overly pretty old hippie who had cut his hair in something like despair and panic the old hippie was trying to convince him of something it was malcolm and johnny and if that was the birth of punk as far as michael was concerned you could keep it everybodys so bitchy despaired a member of the biology class she played cello in the school orchestra it used to be so nice really said michael like a basilisk bottles looked stonily through him the next time michael saw her was in the s on tv she looked like mo mowlam and wore pantsuits and sensible middlelength hair and was a spokesperson for an aids charity she was on the breakfast show convincing people to come forward to have an aids test the main thing to remember is theres now some point to having the test if we catch it early enough we know the drugs can work sensible modulated contactlensed and tvready this was not at all the bottles he remembered old for her age back then she had grown up even more michael was aware that he had grown down overwork tight scheduling embittered sex all of it had made him hurried and crabby and what would have happened to him if he had kept on dancing the answer watching bottles was suddenly clear he would have become a vet he would have been a vet because he would have been less ambitious less selfdenying he would have been more himself if he had kept on dancing he and bottles might have stayed friends and he would have gone on with the amateur acting and the animals i should have told my polished little social circle to get lost they dropped me soon enough when i needed help that had never bubbled to the surface of michaels conscious thought before but it was true the future newsreaders avoided him when he came back from california they were not up to tending the wounded bottles had gone on to tend his dying friends gosh he missed her now in this future he made for himself without any friends bottles honey he thought i need you im sorry the air swirled and bottles bounded back into his life wearing a tank top and clunky shoes and long hair babe she cried howya doin im ok bottles said michael his voice warm he was surprised by the flood of affection he felt for her they hugged and she pressed herself against him and kissed him on both cheeks bottles said its good to see you you know it wasnt such a rocking good time without you hed forgotten how everything she said was quotes in someone elses voice he was touched by that now now she looked young and small and scared but above all else sweet michael kissed her forehead it was too much like child abuse otherwise god they were dumb not to make more of you in our school like i said you were the nicest man in the year there wasnt much competition no she agreed lightly and gave him a gentle little bat she slipped out of his hug but you havent aged well too much science love i bet you went to university there was scorn in her voice i did he had to chuckle ruined you for life the trouble with being a swot is that you think youre dedicated to something else when really youre only dedicated to yourself she turned back to him appraising youre how old he had to think im thirtyeight bottles did not say he didnt look so that makes it sometime in gosh did the world survive that long it did and so did you she paused for a moment considering hmmm impulsively she flung herself onto the sofa but kept her shoes hanging over the edge of the sofa arm she looked like something from a roxy music album cover i grew up happy baby she announced im fat and happy and i never give romford comprehensive a moments thought the secret was to leave london and go somewhere where they make their own fun two days after school finished i ran off to scotland with a real creep on the way back the train stopped in newcastle i jumped off it at the last minute just grabbed my bags said sod off and stayed in newcastle i waited in bars stuff like that her voice went very small and quiet i was on the game for a while suddenly there was a spliff in her hand she looked around the living room the walltowall carpet phils paintings his familys furniture and the bay window posh she said with little interest nothing much happens here does it and then she said im sorry i didnt mean that youve done well michael you look so adult like a kind of teddy bear that doesnt make sense you look like an adult teddy bear a papa bear how did we screw up he asked we didnt i mean why didnt we stay friends um we were young and frightened and we fell in love in a kind of way and you werent ready for it you know why we never did it because i moved like a bison on a trampoline she had the habit of taking the piss out of herself her smile was crooked its true you did but i thought that was sexy but im queer and i wanted to tell you first and i was more scared than most of saying so i knew that she exclaimed you did he smiled embarrassed of course i knew that babe thats why it was just the teeniest bit difficult to say thats why i felt safe around you both of us ran away from people because we thought we were ugly maybe angels find it easier to say things than real people you ignored me in club louise she sighed and shook her head you looked so naff i mean you looked like one of natures born radio three listeners and punk was all style and you can only keep up a style by being mean so i was mean forgive me he nodded yeah can we have sex just once he settled in next to her and sucked the dope in and waited for it to buzz his brain it never did with him michael had marijuana impotency too but it produced a pleasant lazy atmosphere she gave him a long lazy tobaccoandpeppermint kiss and began to give his dick a rub theres something else i have to tell you i i michael sagged with disappointment at himself why cant i say it i hardly ever get it up hmm she said cosily in his arms thats ok i never have orgasms what you she cradled him mmm hmm but you had all those men at school maybe thats why or maybe i was trying to prove to myself that there was nothing wrong if there is anything wrong with not having orgasms a pause a beat they both burst out laughing its fucking awful not having orgasms michael yelped she nodded i keep thinking im going to get there im going to get there and nothing fucking happens at least you can fake it i just sit there dangling hey were famous the dysfunction twins she took another drag and said we could have lived together and had the same boyfriends that sounds really good we could have both disappointed them we could have cried on each others shoulders and told the lot of them to go get screwed bottles and michael casually held each other like lovers old lovers who are eighty men said michael theyre no good to live with bottles adopted the tone of a schoolmaam never never live with a man they belch offered michael they fart on the tube they dont wash up or they start to make a big deal about how much theyre helping and then bugger off before its finished they get mad if you dont call them but they dont even notice when they havent called you they want you to take care of them and then they go and fuck some other cunt or arse give me another kiss they smooched it was a theatrical kiss a kiss in quotes a spotlit kiss it made her giggle youve gone all butch she said me that was a new one yup you used to be a little squit of a thing oh very very pretty but id have been frightened of snapping you in two so they smooched again her lips were fat her breasts were fat and michael yearned to see her squirm out of her skintight jeans she peeled like an orange and her body was in sections restrained by straps he sucked her shoulder he tried to flip her breasts out of the bra and then tried to undo it and he got her tangled up like a horse caught in reins she started to giggle youve never done this before you have never got a woman out of her bra before she shouted and laughed he remembered how badly his copy made love he tried to be better at it he tried to delicately twitch her nipples she giggled and kissed the top of his head youre twiddling them like theyre knobs on a stereo so they just cuddled naked deliberately kissing the neglected parts elbows ears eyebrows he said this is more fun than sleeping with a man bottles couldnt resist i was about to say the same thing oh cheers men are always trying to fuck me without a condom oh no no its just the opposite with me they always have a condom because sleeping with me puts them at terrible risk they couldnt sleep with me without a condom they dont know where ive been its a good thing i liked being fucked or theyd get nowhere i cant help you there said bottles sucking on a roach that would have required a microscope to see let alone smoke it seems to me that you urgently need to meet some nice men she offered him the roach and after breathing out said if you find one let me know this seemed to have introduced the topic of the episodes michael began does does it seem kind of strange to you that youre sixteen and im thirtyeight she paused not really but then the world doesnt really add up for me what do you know about yourself she seemed to darken and go dull that im she sucked on her teeth that im some kind of construct the real maggie is thirtyeight a single mum and lives in islington shes real and im not but then i never really felt real michael explained the miracle to her he explained why he needed her help she took it on the chin she sat up and went businesslike im not the aids expert she is i guess shell help you but dont call her bottles she hates the name shes margaret to strangers maggie to friends shell know something dimly about this like shes dreamed it so she wont be entirely surprised to see you she believes a little bit that women sometimes see things bottles leaned back and looked up into his face and it was firm i meant what i said about swots why did everybody always have something perfectly justified to say about him go ahead he said let me have it he wished he were dressed his stomach was hairy and his dick shrivelled youre so concerned about yourself that youre asking the wrong question so what question should i be asking she told him oh god he said and covered his eyes with shame she was right and all right on methodological grounds right about the selfconcern he chuckled at himself can i go now she asked the more i know about this the weirder it gets and the sadder how come because im dead there hasnt been anyone called bottles in years can i see you again he asked yeah sure she said in voice that meant no is it up to me there was no point pretending that it was see you around said michael and she was gone can i cure angels who are sick that was the question to ask if michael could call up angels and cure them then he could make love to them after they were rid of the virus so after making certain arrangements michael ended up in a clinic after hours margaret or maggie was doing him a favour its not for me he had told her on the phone its a friend of mine he wont come in for a test if i dont come with him and he doesnt get the answer right away and hes also paranoid about false results so he wants to take the test two times in a row yes i know its weird but im really concerned margarets voice sounded just the same as bottles as if it were the sixteenyearold on the phone except that she didnt call him babe and was content to stay with her allpurpose native london accent her voice was calm and soft and businesslike all at the same time a lot of people are very frightened by the test so its good that you want to come in with him does he have any problems with confidentiality um in what way if hes paranoid about one thing he may be paranoid about other things like being seen by anyone could we come in after hours its an imposition she told him directly but if it will make the difference between him coming in or not then ill do it but it can only be this wednesday night her clinic turned out to be attached to a hospital in the east end the door was locked but he rang and she herself opened it margarets hair was the colour of carrots like his mothers used to be michael had the feeling that the hair and her long loose chinese jacket were all carefully calculated to strike the right balance of flamboyance and reliability she was like a civil servant with a past i used to be quite interesting but now im reliable it was a balance inclined to create trust on both sides the ill and the official health establishment her voice was motherly concerned and extremely cautious every word was carefully rehearsed not so much chosen as identified over thousands of ticklish interviews as being the most appropriate thing to say yup bottles was dead hello she said to michaels companion and held out her hand my names margaret im an old friend of michaels she was searching his face with concern so am i my names mark mark was tall broadshouldered with wavy red hair streaked with grey he had died five years before from aids michael had met mark at sussex university mark was in the army studying under some kind of army grant and he was big and muscular and freckled and slightly overripe he wore cravats and played polo and wore a green carnation in honour of oscar wilde mark was one of michaels more spectacular missed opportunities they met in drama club and were doing an experimental piece that involved a lot of stretching yoga and jumping about it was easier than being talented at one point they all had to lie on the floor on their tummies and put their heads on someone elses bum the entire time michaels heavy head rested on marks bottom he flexed his cheek muscles up and down michaels head wiggled mark turned back and grinned naughtily he had a generals face lumpy and attractive rather than pretty and he had a soldiers lumpy body jolielaide they might call it in france butch michael called it he was unable to believe that someone so masculine and so military whom he fancied so very much could actually be gay instead just to stop marks flexing he bit the bum very hard you must be hungry said mark he spoke rather like noel coward why dont you come back to my flat and have another bite to eat michael managed to pretend to himself that this was an invitation to supper so he showed up with a bottle of wine and talked in a prolonged way about the director a woman called rosie mark began to look wistful rosie fancied mark and had asked michael to find out if he was gay even this was not enough to trigger the conscious thought in michael that the man he fancied might fancy him so michael pumped mark for information about his reaction to rosie which confused the issue more im afraid im a bit inexperienced with women i imagine youre not said mark tuh not that much experienced but i get along with them well perhaps you can show me how to as well id be really surprised if i had anything to teach you about women when someone wants you they admire you you seem larger to them than you actually are which is why its difficult to believe they can or do love you and not some image theyve made up it was hard for michael to imagine that this strapping athletic outgoing happy man admired him respected him it was simply unthinkable that he actually desired him so nothing happened there was a florid wouldbe englishman at sussex he was in fact south african and tried to live up to an image of england that had more to do with bloomsbury than the new era of margaret thatcher he kept talking about virginia woolf and quentin bell and real universities like oxford he ran the literary society and wore white suits and once even a straw boater michael detested him about six months after his dinner michael saw mark with this man together in sainsburys plainly doing domestic shopping together having a slightly acid conversation over the right choice of coffee michael said hello and marks chest swelled with pride as he introduced john who said coolly we know each other michael acts doesnt he mark seemed to display their married condition like another green carnation and michael ended the conversation blinded by an inexplicable headache mark and he stayed friends the straw boater had married mark in an attempt to marry old england mark realized this as the bickering got worse hes a bit of a fraud actually mark said lightly to michael in the student bar hes moved out im doing some reassessing im beginning to understand that as much as i love it the army and i arent meant for each other either it would be illegal in fact mark became someone who added up this made him less surprising he dropped his science course and took art history he saved money to pay back the army for their grants he went on to run an art gallery somewhere in all those changes he and michael managed to become best friends especially after michael had met philip philip worshipped mark my exarmy gallery owner who also plays rugby philip enthused and took him to parties without michael mark could more than hold his own at arty gatherings at which he doggedly wore blazers and cravats mark never introduced his boyfriends marks boyfriends evidently were not quite fit to be introduced it was the first time that michael noted a tendency in mark towards secrecy he kept aspects of his life in separate compartments mark had developed a taste for leather and rough trade he moved in with a rich banker but they werent lovers they shared servants and a games room and gave parties in which people wore leather crotchless knickers they called their joint townhouse the cock exchange michael never really felt comfortable with the grandees he met there or the way in which the banker especially treated the people who worked for him marks face and manner remained disconcertingly freshfaced his eyebrows went prematurely shaggy like an old generals but there was something in his expression that reminded michael of a child he looked like a little boy who could play innocent mark began to be away a lot on business or make excuses when invited to dinner and to drive an old banger which he saw no point in replacing he was ill and didnt want michael to worry what do you say to someone who has died and who was one of the few people you could really talk to perhaps you look at his face suddenly returned to you and consider saying all the things you never had a chance to say you consider saying you were a hero to me you were so many things it wasnt just the army or the sport there was your political work for the labour party though everything about you signalled tory there was the way you knew the market value of every piece that came your way including things you hated like the preraphaelites there was the way you could explain to me how picasso was a genius so that ive seen picasso differently ever since there was the way you fixed your car and the way you spent all saturday afternoon playing rugby and two hours every sunday morning tending your stocks and shares there was the way you could give me advice on how to apply for research grants advice that worked or who at the poly knew they had support in high places you were astute and kind and sensible and strong all michael said was hello old thing good to see you they were in the car on the way to the clinic mark replied cool and distant thank you then he asked askance why have you done this michael explained it to him the miracle and what he thought it was for and why he needed mark it sounded so stark and selfinterested that michael apologized quite all right im glad to be of use mark replied his attention seemed be distracted his eye kept catching on shop signs or evening standard headlines talking about the labour government can we stop he asked theres just a few things id like of course of course michael said and pulled over mark bought an orange and a newspaper he left both in the white paper bag introductions over with once inside the clinic and sitting down margaret explained to mark what the test was for and how it worked were going to take some blood and analyse it here ill be back in about fortyfive minutes with the result i understand you want two tests ask michael said mark detached margarets head jerked a bit too quickly towards michael there was something fathomless in marks response that she couldnt read two tests yes please said michael sometimes shy or worried people rely on others to speak for them was this such a case margaret gave them the benefit of any doubt no trouble it will be a bit of a wait for you though theres television and coffee you could come back tomorrow mark cut her off no he said thank you i only have this evening so he and michael sat in the waiting area a circle of comfortable chairs and watched the seven oclock news on channel four on the clinic walls were a handlettered notices for social groups aromatherapy or stress management mark sat absolutely still hypnotized by the telly sports results michael realized he wants to find out how rugby union is going is this hard for you michael asked up to a point mark replied and fell silent the silence persisted all through the sports news we all miss you terribly liz tom martin we still get together and have pub crawls along the river the mark memorial pub crawl we have one in summer one in winter thats comforting liz cant stop talking about you whenever we have one i think she was a bit in love with you i proposed marriage oh i thought she needed to be able to stay in the country marks smile was knifethin and hard to read there had been other news since marks departure do you know about rodger rodger was the banker marks eyes were still fixed on football no but i imagine he died too i imagine theres not much left of the old exchange the angel of death had passed over some doors as if lintels were marked harrys still with us though harry was rodgers boyfriend who used to be tied up and left to the mercies of men who had since died harry was negative laugh mark almost smiled the conversation was a knot michael suddenly thought honesty might cut it is dying very hard he asked its tough mark said in an even voice unbearable in fact its the worst thing you can know so you seem to view it from far away and then you dont know anything at all is it true what everyone tells you you float outside your body and theres a tunnel of light mark seemed to chew over his response as if it were a plug of tobacco on television the news had moved on to camilla parker bowles showing up in public with charles mark turned to look at michael and there was something broken and rugged about his face like one of those cliff faces that look human in profile the face like a tumble of rocks seemed to ask you really want to know that happens yes but its just an illusion you are psychologically distancing yourself from what is happening the tunnel of light is just the optic nerve closing down mark had looked healthy up until the very end a few days before he died his hair went snowy white and he finally told friends the truth this was his second bout of pneumonia and it was by now what they had all suspected michael had to go away to a conference in america all he could do was phone i want you to know how much ive always respected you he said he didnt say i loved you once he didnt say you see mark i dont ask for things i drift into things and let them hold me instead of me taking a grip of them mark something terrible happened to me that left me completely screwed up which is why we were never lovers and it makes me so angry that we never were and now never will be would you have lived if we had been lovers mark it was phil not michael who was with mark when he died now in the waiting room booming music announced the end of the news mark said simply the world moves on he reached into his bag and pulled out the newspaper and read it carefully the paper crinkling like tin foil when he turned the pages then he said you miss everything something terrible happened to his voice it sounded like tape gone slurry from dirty tapeheads you miss voices you miss air you try to breathe and theres no air theres no taste youre not hungry you dont want to eat you miss food and colour theres no colour you miss having a life you get so bored being yourself a self just keeps asking what do i think about next what do i do next and the answer always comes back nothing they heard a door open margaret maggie came back michael could tell from her face it was kept smooth and bland but the smile was just a little fixed and the eyes seemed to be saying no not again no not again and they looked at mark with sadness mark had tested positive she would have done a tcell count as well and would know this is a dying man all she said was all right mark were going to take the second sample now are you sure you want to go ahead i believe that is what michael asked margaret glanced at michael michael only wants to help you do you still want a second sample its why im here replied mark detached you commanded michael to the angel you mark are free from disease you virus commanded michael you the virus just seethe out of his blood i cast you out maggie took marks arm as she led him to the cubicle and her face was silently looking into his still everyones mother eh bottles the telly battered on booming about ovenready chips jeez thought michael all i want to do is sleep what a leaden stupid unhelpful thought life is strange mark came back and moved his chair away from michael and the cushions made a squishy sound like a sigh mark reached into the plastic bag and pulled out an orange marks mouth lunged forward as he bit into the orange almost clear juice with a bit of pulp poured down his chin marks eyes closed with pleasure then he reached into a bag and pulled out a photograph there hadnt been a photograph in the bag before it was an ordinary snap of a solidlooking middleaged man with white hair this is robert mark said i never told you about him his thumb moved over the face he was rather discreet he was married and a bit oldfashioned raf when i got too ill i told him i was fed up being his mistress did he know you were hiv there was a long pause yes michael looked at the face in the photo more closely it was kindly dignified direct that added up too mark reached into the plastic bag and pulled out one of the very first sony walkmans clunky and black with the usual tangle of wires and earphones mark said nothing but punched buttons from the distanced high singing michael knew marks favourite opera der rosenkavalier mark closed his eyes and ruminated on another section of orange time passed the cassette finished with a click mark asked do i have to stay for the second result michael was surprised and slightly hurt that mark didnt want to know im afraid so if you go the samples will disappear mark rolled his eyes oh god that means shell come out all worried and want to counsel me and if the result is different then shell want to take a third sample he put his head in his hands i dont suppose it occurred to you that ive been through all this once before and that i never ever wanted to go through it again marks eyes glared up at him from under the bushy eyebrows in life mark had never been this angry with michael it didnt really no im sorry if you want to have a fuckfest youll just have to take a few risks like everyone else except that you never had the stomach for risk michael didnt know what to say mark turned the cassette over and went on listening to opera finally margaret came back michael noticed that she had tiny feet they gave her a delicate slightly chinese walk her face had gone splotchy as she approached she placed her hands either side of her mouth as if to hold her face in place mark i hardly know what to say mark stood up and began to wind the earphones around the walkman the opera kept playing margaret reached out towards him and gripped his arm michael told me you are worried about inconsistent results im afraid that the first test was positive and the second is negative its not usual but it does happen im so sorry im afraid well need to take the test again that wont be necessary that is all the result we need thank you very much he jammed the singing walkman into the bag mark you can come in tomorrow if you like the tumble of rocks looked back at her that wont happen i am very very sorry that michael put you to all this trouble im going to ask you not to worry me or to try to rectify the situation thank you for your concern he turned and strode away on long legs margaret followed we might prove there is nothing wrong there are treatments now treatments that work thank you bellowed mark and let the door fall shut after him michael stood up to go sick at heart maggie intercepted him michael the first test showed almost no tcells at all he is already very sick michael i dont know what your relationship is excuse me but should you have the test too no said michael suddenly bitter i never slept with him he died and i was in america michaels face crumpled and his eyes went bleary and to escape he pushed the door open with his bum oh love said margaret you think im a good person you think im someone whos done all he can to help someone else give me a call tell him we can help him thats the last michael saw of her in her chinese shirt reflecting in several directions as the door of her clinic swung shut how is it that you care maggie how is it than anyone cares mark was two streets away waiting by the car he was staring up at the sky and listening to his walkman it still wheedled out rosenkavalier shrill distant womens voices sang their farewells just for once in london there were stars can you send me back now mark asked without looking at michael he was quite calm angry no longer but his cheeks and mouth were covered with an even glossy coating of tears you could stay offered michael mark turned and looked at him with determined eyes this is unbearable he said look mark im sorry for all of this i shouldnt have done it this way but if you stay you could listen to music you could go back to robert you could live its unbearable because once youre there mark flung a hand up towards the sky you dont really want to come back you had no business bringing me back just try for a day or two i died michael i made them withhold treatment dying took hours and i couldnt move or even see but i could still think and i had to think my way through dying i had to work at it it was an achievement can you please send me back now all right sighed michael mark made to put roberts photograph into his pocket and then seemed to remember he could not take it with him he put it back into the plastic sainsburys bag the great stone face turned once more to michael dont do this to anyone else mark said get ready then i am ready goodbye then god this was awful it was like killing someone goodbye whispered mark his expression softening his cheeks were pink and freckled and he reminded michael of how he had looked at sussex the singing of the walkman stopped air closed over mark like a lake and he was gone michael was alone inside the bag there was only the newspaper and the orange whole and uneaten the next day michael telephoned margaret hello margaret he began this is michael i just wanted to say thanks for last night are you ok im sorry margaret laughed indulgently as if she were still bottles im a bit slow this morning michael who michael blasco from school i came round to the clinic michael michael hello margaret was surprised and delighted its funny i was thinking about you just the other day how are you long time no see the backs of michaels arms pricked up as if there were a cold wind im fine i uh i came round to the clinic wednesday night oh dear margaret laughed at herself did you ive got a head like a sieve im so sorry i guess i just didnt recognize you i mean did you say hi im michael from school michael considered no not really i popped in to get some information for a friend her voice modulated carefully downwards was it all right yeah yeah he came in to the clinic and had the test and it was negative hes ok i just wanted to say thank you for the work you do its good work michael ended the conversation quickly he had learned one last thing if you were part of their story you could be forgotten too oh people could meet you both shake your hands they could tell you your friend was handsome and that they wanted to meet up again and then they would forget not right away but gently so everything healed shut theyd forget everything and if you were part of everything then theyd forget you too angels came angels were here they could talk and when they went they were forgotten as quickly as dreams and the stories they made were forgotten too michael would be forever alone with his memories maybe were surrounded by miracles he thought maybe therere miracles every day only were programmed not to remember them he opened up his notebook and read a physical copy someone i know later also someone i dont know in train tube and x in my flat x in office location has no effect can call up at will and banish i may not know ive done it other people appear to interact his behaviour my behaviour both sexual the real person is straight can be copy says real person dreams what happens cant call up people without sexual element sexual element can be love can call up dead can control behaviour they have free will until i override it they can be male or female they think they go somewhere fiction continues elsewhere they are a kind of fiction in flesh they can change nothing they are never really here then michael wrote in the notebook knowing does no good and then he closed it part ii whats so painful about love henry came to stay with them he had nowhere else to go unless it was a burrow under the route of a planned bypass he slept in the sitting room on the sofa bed and kept all his clothes rolled up in a backpack in the corner the clothes were always neat and uncreased henry had a knack of packing clothes so tightly that they stayed pressed the whole room smelled of him a pleasant slightly earthy odour like field mushrooms michael assumed that philip and henry had sex by day on that sofa bed while he was at the lab throughout the night philip still cradled michael in their big double bed out of affection and habit michael was grateful to be held he found he was scared so he made both of them breakfast and brought it out on a tray and laid it out on the table in the bay window of the sitting room henrys arms were lean and pale and smooth as he pulled on his socks his skin had a kind of silver sheen in the morning sun he gave michael a dozy morning grin under the thicket of his hair it was summer now and dust danced in warm sunlight mild air drifted in through the open window blackbirds made surprisingly beautiful sounds michael always expected them to caw like crows he was lulled michael needed wisdom he needed advice and reassurance he needed to talk the song of birds the clatter of cups and plates henrys smile all gave him courage phil came in looking like someone who was late for work and even that somehow reassured michael something very strange has happened he announced his hands occupied with cutlery i suddenly find that i can make copies of people people i want to have sex with i just ask for them and there they are they can be male female alive or dead but they cant be photographed and they can change nothing in the real world michael picked up the coffeepot and it began to chatter as if it were cold and its teeth were clicking he couldnt quite hold it or think what to do with it i find the whole thing disturbing to tell you the truth phil kept his head down they do say it runs in families he murmured and spooned jam on his toast henry very gently took the coffeepot out of michaels grasp some people might find that hard to believe they would probably say you were making it up oh oh there is definitely something physically here i can touch them its just after theyve gone nothing theyve done gets left behind thats why people might not believe you henry had soft brown trusting eyes but they could be firm and trusting at the same time well i can fix that i can show them to you who do you fancy michael was feeling boisterous he could feel his curly hair bounce and his voice boom he tried to think of musicians who might be trendy among yearolds and could only come up with the labour party theme d ream michael suggested surprised he remembered the singers name henry appeared unmoved liam gallagher how about the castro brothers from out our way here look the air wavered and parted like curtains out our way was an established soap opera about the east end it had turned two bald burly actors into unlikely sex symbols suddenly two bald and burly actors stood looking dazed by sunlight in a hundredyearold sitting room in wc holy jesus cried phil and pushed back his chair which dragged on the carpet then gave a low crack and nearly pitched him backwards out of the window wha said one of the actors his brow knitting together michael explained like a tour guide the trouble with actors is that they usually show up in character you get valentino as the sheikh not valentino what are these posh geezers doin ere then the dialogue is always terrible said michael his face giving a series of nervous sideways jerks that were meant to convey that the whole thing was mischievous fun henry had gone very still and watchful like a cat crowded into a corner he fixed the brothers with an adult eye and asked them what do you know about what why you are here michael ebullient intervened its for sex drop em lads the castro brothers looked dazed and obedient and they lowered their trousers one of them was wearing no underwear under his jeans two perfectly average plump sets of genitalia soaked up the sun michael felt merry he felt as if he were no longer alone he reached across the table and pushed the tip of phils nose you wanted to do a show called lust now you really can philip tossed his head as if an insect annoyed him you want to have sex with someone you can we all can all of us michael suddenly felt familial the gesture included henry henry blinked hair in his eyes we dont fancy them michael you do its ok we believe you you wont as soon as they go youll forget michael began to feel afraid again afraid to be alone to encourage them to stay he passed one of the castros a cup of coffee thats how it works theyre forgotten hours after they go henry said calmly everybody gets forgotten michael it just happens faster to some of us listen said one of the castros with studied politeness we dont want to intrude or anything you know michael protested no no stay theyll believe as long as you stay henry stood up and took the cup of coffee back from one of the castros he spoke to them as an equal its tough being temporary nothing you do matters philip looked up again in anguish at henry i cant deal with this philip said i just cant deal with this too henry put the coffee cup down on the table and took philips hand shamefaced the castro brothers pulled up their trousers henry turned and looked at michael with his round puppydog eyes and said irresistibly michael youve made your point michael closed his eyes and nodded the castro brothers faded like an afterthought phil placed both his hands flat on the table as if to steady it and said i dont know what it is we just saw his face was prim closed determined i dont want to know henry and i have been hanging on because we could see you were in some kind of trouble and i dont want to kick you while youre down but honestly phil turned back to henry and he was pleading now i just cant keep this up any longer henry lowered his eyes and said ok we can stay at the club phil said again to henry he turned to michael ill do the washingup no thats ok said michael the person who made the meal always did the washingup it was the family rule phil got insistent a bit panicky have you heard me michael michael blinked there was something he did not understand i just said id do the washingup he held out his hands to say thats all i said is there anything wrong phil swayed as if under a burden and he said to henry im sorry you cope with this his hands rattling like the china phil began to clear the plates the eggcups were his family silver spindly on a single slender leg and one of them toppled henry stood up and with zenlike calm began to pack his shoulder bag philip gave up trying to get everything on the tray at once and bustled away were going henry said to michael his eyes sad michael wasnt sure hed heard correctly everything started to shake philips left the cups he said he took them into the kitchen he needed to be in the kitchen with philip philip was sloshing water on plates keeping his back towards him michael had to stretch round him to put the cups on the draining board phil listen phil i need to talk to someone iii need just to talk michael needed to have phil around even if it was mostly in principle even if he mostly saw phil when he came in late and surly distracted phil fired a jet of water into a cup that shot back out over his shirt so so when will you be back very abruptly philip stopped he put the cup down on the kitchen counter and pushed past michael back into the sitting room will you talk to me michael demanded phil stopped sagged and turned back he pinched his nose and closed his eyes i wont be back michael it hasnt worked it isnt working it wont work in the future miserable he began to weep so im going i mean im leaving you michael started to babble buh buh buh buh but doesnt the whole idea of it hit you i mean you could use it in your work i know you couldnt photograph them but you could talk to them fascinating people old movie stars whatever and you could paint them you could do new portraits of them what are you talking about phil was gazing at michael in something approaching horror it could be a real opportunity for you you know the paintings will stay at least we could try right michael stood as if naked looking hopeful he saw it now he needed to be more involved with philips work phils head was shaking as if in disbelief youre crazy he said and swung away he went into the bedroom and pulled a suitcase out from under the bed phil you can talk to them phil philip philip please philip dont go philip paused and left the suitcase open on the floor he fled to the cupboard and quivering pulled on a jacket ill come back for my things when youre at work he said moving back out into the corridor michael pursued him philip please listen i told you because i cant believe it myself and i need someone to talk to about it philip its real ok its real its weird and can be quite strange and thats why i need someone philip was at the door his hand was on the doorknob and he looked directly at michael sorry he said sorry but i really cant help this his eyes had the utter ruthlessness of someone no longer in love philip please dont go pity and disgust mingled in phils eyes and all he could do was shake his head goodbye henry joined him slipping around michael they went into the echoing corridor beyond and michael wailed after them philip phillip please come back he heard the footsteps spiral down the staircase and the thump of the front door as it closed itself michael kept talking to himself quietly under his breath phil please dont leave me alone philhillip pleeeeeeeeese his voice constrained wheedled like a rusty hinge his legs folded under him and he dropped onto the floor of the hallway it was silent the silence grew the silence would continue it was the silence of an apartment with only one person in it maybe hell come back maybe hell get bored and come back maybe he wont what do you want him for anyway he was a pain in the ass i love him ill miss him you should have taken better care of him then he should have taken better care of me why did i tell him stupid stupid stupid stupid who wants a miracle for a boyfriend things could have kept on just as they were he was happy enough to have henry on the side why did you do it you only scared him off who does he fancy ben affleck thats right you should have shown him ben affleck not those naff castros from that naff soap you should have said see isnt this wild fun stylish invite your gallery friends you little socialclimbing shit you little mr trendy you stupid untalented little fraud dont blame him what do i blame then michaels knees hurt he propped himself against the hall table and stood up he walked back into the sitting room still full of sunlight he looked at the carpet it was the colour of sand like a desert the room would now have two phases with philip and after philip what was left a few stains on the carpet from the early days when they still had parties here and wine was sloshed there was the painting philip did of michael looking stolid and holy what else indelibly was due to philip almost nothing not the furniture not the curtains not the books on the shelves maybe that was part of the trouble a crawling loneliness spread out from michaels stomach all the way to his fingers he was alone alone because philip had left alone because he had been singled out he was a target for gods special attention god had sent the miracle and the miracle had driven away the nearest thing michael had to love who would have thought miracles felt so terrible you could feel them break the universe you could feel them break you michael sat down on the sofa and it smelled of henry why are you doing this to me he asked the sunlight what did i do wrong what am i supposed to learn learn that im impotent learn that im so scared of aids that i wont kiss anyone i knew that am i supposed to learn that sex is just an excuse to keep love away why would anyone avoid love whats so painful about love what is so very painful about being ditched after thirteen years for a young man so beautiful that youd have done the same thing yourself so you cant even feel morally superior why would anyone mind that whats so painful about being bonded in your bones to someone who has to leave you to begin to breathe whats so painful about opening up your entire life to someone only to find that your life is rotten inside and both of you hate it and once you learn that what are you supposed to do with it the answer it appeared was nothing and oh god he had started his life with phil so full of hope and trust and love it had seemed as if his life had suddenly come right if youre gay and not very good at sex people dont ring back nice people handsome intelligent kind people who made you laugh dont ring back you stop even asking for addresses stop asking people back to the flat you do it there in the sauna in the park you do it with most of your clothes on and if you finish first you get the hell out of there and you tell yourself its male sex instinct you tell yourself its gay culture and you remember afresh all over again each time when they realize pumping away at you that your dick is not going to react then at michael had met phil and suddenly none of that mattered show me michael asked the air there was the sound of a key in the front door and excited voices in the hall and the clunking as the heavy fireproofed panels shut phils breathy voice said but this is fantastic this is it this is our flat yup someone said a smooth pleasant voice with a what australian accent my god chuckled phil his voice hadnt changed philip stuck his head into the sitting room and looked around goggleeyed was that really phil he looked almost skeletal with a rockabilly haircut and jeans that swelled out at the thighs and closed at the ankles he had huge brown eyes and bat ears and was still covered in spots his hands darted up like startled sparrows this young phil had a body language that was as delicious and as comic as charlie chaplins gosh he said ill finally be able to have dinner parties this philips face and body were different the soul was different this was a nice young innocent frightened guy who had only just left home and who needed michael for all these reasons it was the younger philip whom michael loved and who was now no more another michael came in wearing a striped shirt that our michael remembered he was a fresh smooth square michael glowing pink with happiness old michael sat on the sofa bed that had not been in their version of the flat and he was invisible to them they thought that this was their first day michael had given them the grace of seeing nothing else young phil had to jump up to kiss young mike who was so much taller than him thank you thank you thank you phil hugged him and then leaned back to drink in mikes face the helpless stretched smile the crumpled eyes brimming with love they lunged at each others lips and chewed them making a smacking noise a bit like toffee an anguished flood of memory poured over old michael he had found this flat because he had found phil he had wanted phil to have somewhere nice to live otherwise michael would have stayed out in harrow near the poly he remembered how they bought the sofa bed they had bounced on it together in heals they had wanted the staff to know they were lovers young mike shook philip and chuckled oh baby he said words flowing thickly from a grateful heart i love you said phil quietly young mike rested his head on top of philips you said lets play house said phil but i had no idea you meant something fullsize theres plenty of things around here that are fullsized said younger michael he sounded debonair theres a fullsized fridge and a fullsized shower his body said that something else was fullsized too oh you lucky guy old michael thought as the young mike enveloped his lover and was gratefully received the kiss this time was long and silent and when they parted there was unspoken agreement in their eyes ill show you the bedroom said michael the apartment had not changed much in thirteen years the angels could not see the paintings on the wall that the young phil had not yet painted they hadnt seen the huge tv in the corner of the sitting room they didnt see michaels computer on the desk in the bedroom their big fourposter bed had been there though my god exclaimed phil and ran coltishly towards it wherever did you find that young michael was beaming flushed with pride and love and the pleasure of making someone happy a barn in lancashire he replied this may not have been their exact words at the time but the spirit was right the people were right young philip flung himself onto the high mattress and kicked off his shoes and young michael went and pulled the bedroom curtains shut and the wooden rings made a clicking sound that always meant they were about to make love then he rested his head as if in prayer on phils tummy the real michael watched them make love they were young excited young michael almost got it up philip tried to allow him to penetrate him doubt crossed both their faces michael collapsed and groaned and rested his head on philips shoulder philip kissed the top of his head dont worry well get better at it philip said michael leaned back to look at philip for some guys a hole is just a hole youre not like that somehow light danced in philips eyes young michael breathed their eyes latched together love and gratitude beaming out of them as steadily as headlamps they were too young to know who they were or what they wanted so they were free to keep on trying michaels heart ached all day as he haunted them ached for what hed lost and could not yet accept losing he watched them cooking lunch excitedly in their new kitchen he watched them eat it without a table plates resting on a towel on the livingroom carpet they ate it naked passing the chewed food between them as they kissed entangled they went into the bedroom again and failed again and once again that made no difference they washed up and dusted and hoovered delighted with their new domesticity they read and reread the listings magazine and decided to see platoon day became early evening they tried on different bumfreezer jackets philip decided to wear the brown trousers he later gave to henry they were new and crisp and sharp phil thought they were listening to jane siberry and went to turn it off and then they both chattered off into the night to hold hands and indeed if memory served something else all through the film and suddenly old michael was alone in the dark the weather had changed in the real world it was raining heavy drumming rain that smelled of leaves michael walked back into the bedroom calling quietly there was a sound like wind in the curtains around the bed hello phil he said to a shadow who the fuck are you it was the younger phil he scuttled back naked across the surface of the bed michael yes said michael sounding uncertain of that you look so old michael sat shyly on the edge of the bed i am old baby thirteen years older you should start working out michael sighed i do regularly this is me looking fit the angel grew confused this isnt a joke is it michael shook his head and tried not to get weepy no baby it isnt the angel lost its innocence what am i youre phil youre the phil that was my phil i im not understanding this warned young phil with a scared chuckle we got older and different so i called you back there was a long pause the darkness outside was as if all the lights of the world had gone out from neglect the angel looked about the room processing sensations how the world now looked he looked at the tapestries that hung from the fourposter and seemed to see something new in them im not the real phil am i he said in a voice as low as the light michael couldnt help but edge closer to him he couldnt help but take him in his arms it seemed such an imposition a terrible thing to do to a young man in the first throes of love finding the first anchorage of his own in the world we broke up said phil his voice frail with disappointment michael tried to cradle him comfort him we had more than twelve years baby thats pretty good going why phil pushed him away michael retreated from him you started to go places you didnt need me there i looked different you didnt like what i did for a living you were bored and he sighed someone beautiful something beautiful came along and took you you tried to be good about it which only made it worse in the end there was the sound of traffic of tyres shushing over wet streets where had the day gone he hadnt gone to work or even rung them to say he was ill or whatever this was worse than illness the young phil looked askance at this strange man who had suddenly swollen out of the michael he knew you want to live with me the young phil said leaning backwards i want you back said michael pleading against life itself no said phil why not because youre not michael im still michael inside phil shook his head michael would never do this to me and i would never do to michael what your phil did so things must be pretty poor where you are you must have let things go pretty far yes whispered michael beyond repair phil leaned forward enquiring like a friend listening in a coffee shop and out the other side im sorry im sorry to do this to you i want you to have hope i want you to have joy i will as soon as you put me back where im supposed to be with my new boyfriend in my new flat michael nodded once yes will i know my god what if he did what if he could sense it back then can can you feel attachment to the real phil in your time phil stared yes yes i can theyre watching the movie and phil phils suddenly scared he has a terrible sense that this cant last that you will get old i think he can almost see you on this bed there is no time where angels come from send me back the angel said fear growing in his eyes michael did air seemed to open and to swallow him there was a breath as it rushed in to fill the space phil had occupied michael looked up at the ceiling and saw the lights of passing cars move across it this would be the first of many such nights there was another option the air puckered and blew and phil the older phil was blown into the room wearing the clothes in which he left michael businesslike this angel kicked off his boots and began to unbuckle his belt stop said michael please i want to talk oh i thought that this was what it was for another wank session together phil sat on the bed and bootless lay back to stare at the ceiling live with me asked michael stay with me oh jesus the real phil has his new life he has henry who is rather wonderful i know you dont love me any more but just do it out of kindness this philip was unmoved wouldnt friends get a bit confused to see me living in two places at once i could make sure that didnt happen hmm whisk me out of existence whenever it got inconvenient charmed im sure the real phil would say do it hed probably say humour the poor bastard it cant do any harm phils still kind he still doesnt want to hurt me phil crooked an elbow and lay his head on it youre sure of that are you please pleaded michael he knew he was in a right old state hair everywhere face all red helplessness is so attractive with his other arm phil reluctantly took his shoulder and pulled michael closer to him phil still loves you the angel said but his voice was businesslike all of michaels inner scaffolding sagged with the weight but it didnt give phil spoke in a voice that might as well have come from the grave consoling beyond reach i still love you but for the wrong reasons i moved in with you because i was terrified id just left home and you were my protector and for a while my provider and i realized if i stayed with you id be terrified of life forever id stay shallow and superficial because i would stay a teenager thank you for your offer thank you for making it an offer when you could have made it a command but im phil the angel seemed to stab himself in the heart with his hand and phil doesnt want to be here i know what ill become if i stay here id still be a boy at sixty there was an unspoken question lurking in the sound of the rain and michael you would turn into stone il faut accepter murmured michael it was something an elderly french woman once said to him on the metro she had caught michael and philip subtly mocking her dress and manner the tartan skirt the heavy sensible shoes she told him how she filled her days since her husbands death and the departure of her sons and how she had overcome her depression you have to accept if you keep saying no nothing moves on the curtains stirred as if the window were open philip was gone michael stood up to make himself a cup of tea he passed the dishes on the dresser and thought the cups are mine but most of the crockery is philips the downstairs buzzer growled it was henry michael can i come up was he supposed to say no when he opened the door of the flat henry stood dripping wet and looking sad for him he carried an empty khaki bag hi i hope it hasnt been too rough on you michael didnt answer after a moment he stood aside to let henry come in philip sent me back to get some of his clothes henry shrugged hes a bit of a coward michael closed up like a sea anemone his things are in the closet there michael walked away back to his tea buggered if he was going to offer henry anything henry seemed to take forever cautious calm little ruffling sounds came from the bedroom oh jesus christ get on with it cant you it isnt the crown jewels youre packing up michael could see henry folding up the shirts the jackets he would tenderly adjust each sleeve that was my job once except i never folded philips things tenderly i rolled them up in a fury and dumped them in the laundry box and dried them in the dryer so the shirts came out as crisp as fallen leaves michael could imagine philip deciding which clothes he wanted he would have kept changing his mind he would want party gear and jogging gear and formal wear there would be a list full of crossings out what on earth was henry doing michaels smaller self began to imagine theft he walked in on henry to find jackets and shirts neatly laid out on the bed and on the floor a crossedout list what do you think you own this place thats my bed this is my bedroom michaels smaller self wanted to hurl the bag and all the clothes out of the window or at least into the hallway henry had the good grace to look embarrassed and motioned towards the list as if to say phil we both know phil michael remembered this is henry michael said im sorry you were saddled with doing this its probably easier on both of you this way ill be done in a second do you want some tea id love some but can i finish here first id like to talk cornered michael sat waiting in the dining room like a schoolboy ripping off the tip of his thumbnail finally after five minutes henry came in and he poured the tea michael couldnt think of any neutral way to start the conversation so he asked where are you staying the arts club theres a spare room ah thats why he wants all his trendy gear hes very upset michael sniffed he can come back if hes so upset henry said with a trace of a smile he may be coming back sooner than you think he reached into his woollen ethnic shoulder bag and pulled out a copy of a newspaper henry passed it to michael and kept his eyes fixed on michaels face at first michael thought it was the financial times the paper had yellowed he was wondering why henry had given him a newspaper and why he should be interested when he saw a photograph of henry the light from the camera had penetrated his brown eyes so that they looked translucent and deep like water through clear ice his smile looked delighted with good reason the headline read stumpy unlikely sex symbol michael felt his eyes bug out youre stumpy exclaimed michael stumpy was an antimotorway protester who had caught the attention of the press about two years before and had become something of a celebrity of course thats why he looked familiar though henry did look a little different maybe he was just two years older henry coughed uncomfortably not exactly he said looking at michael with a sad wariness im a copy he waited and michael began to understand i was wondering if you could tell me anything about that michael processed and harry gave him time neither of them said anything and then after a silence too long for comfort both of them began to talk at once michael said what do you mean a copy and henry said with a relenting smile obviously you dont know anything about it then they had to pick up the pieces of the conversation michael said copy copy you mean like an angel henry had never heard the term angel he turned his head as if trying to hear better no no i mean like the castro brothers this morning yeah yeah an angel henry paused pressing his two hands together gently yes thats what i mean michael felt his heart thump the next thought came to him sharp as a knife was there someone else who could do this michael did not want to be the only one who did this he wanted someone else to talk to about it did someone else make you do you know who this managed to throw henry someone else he scratched his head and began to smile i was assuming that it had to be you in fact michael i still am pretty certain it is you why do you say that ive hardly even heard of you henrys gaze at michael was wistful determined and sympathetic philip and i met at first out suddenly i was just standing there next to him and asked if i could see his copies of the free papers henrys eyebrows raised as if offering up the story in evidence on a tray thats how phil and i met said michael henry nodded he even said this has happened once before it was as if michaels heart were pricked with goosebumps all over its one thing to lose a property or a painting when a relationship breaks up it is another to give away your memories he went back and looked idly at the newspapers date february it could be that henry wasnt telling the truth maybe he was trying to shock michael maybe he was playing a joke or just wanted one up on michael in some vague way because they were rivals in love michael looked at him and henry sat waiting patiently for him calm and orderly and not at all fussed whatever else michael thought about henry he didnt think he was mean or mad or jealous for attention or any of the other things that would explain this if it were a charade and if it were none of those things then what on earth was going on henry helped him out henry kept on talking so philip passed me the newspapers and i realized that i didnt really have any memories of anything else before then i couldnt think how i got there i knew it was a gay coffee shop i had information like i had been briefed i knew i was supposed to talk to philip and that i was going to fancy him i said to myself gosh stumpy would really like to know about this this would really interest stumpy hes into mystical stuff henry smiled and did a slight selfdeprecatory shrug that wasted not an ounce of energy then i realized that i was stumpy sort of when philip said youre stumpy i said what i said to you im only a copy but it was as if he didnt hear or couldnt remember a few days later there was something in the news about stumpy being in northampton and i knew i couldnt be in two places at once so i knew i was in a bit of a strange situation and this morning i began to understand what was going on but why would it be you michael was suddenly sweating and his voice was raised henrys voice was lowered philip said hed always fancied stumpy he said he kept a kind of file of newspaper cuttings about him it was a question but michael shook his head no firmly he said he did but then he also said that he doubted you noticed so michael was feeling unaccountably combative soooooo i think you may have known about philip liking stumpy but only just out of the corner of your eye so why would i be making up boyfriends for philip henry smiled indulgently as if michael were sweetly oldfashioned because you love him and you want him to be happy at the expense of my own marriage michael made a circular gesture of the hand that meant come on follow your own logic maybe you want to be happy too it was like having a particularly annoying conversation with your mother when she is allknowing and wise and kindly you think i did this to get rid of philip henrys nod of agreement was almost imperceptible people do things without knowing he said tuh michael snorted and couldnt accept but found that he couldnt fully deny innnnn any event said henry drawing the word out to buy a moments time and staring at his hands there is one way to resolve things and if you were to do this thing then you would get philip back oh yeah and what would that be michael felt his shoulders move like a bull lowering his head he was on the verge of concluding that this was a scam and that henry was about to demand money in exchange for philip or the address of the lab you could send me back whispered henry his eyes were honest and unreadable if you send me away then none of this would have happened i imagine philip would snap back into your sitting room like a rubber band it took michael a moment to change gears henry gave the strangest saddest smile i just thought i would make sure you knew that was possible hes volunteering michael thought hes volunteering for nonexistence i cant think of another word for that other than goodness whether hes real or not and thats when he finally had to admit that what henry was suggesting was likely to be true thank you michael said henry shrugged youre the ones who are real i dont count as much michael found himself saying yes you do i dont really exist im not sure how fair it is on philip for him to love someone who doesnt really exist and michael saw then in his eyes he really loves phil and phil must really love him when this thing ends philip will never know i existed it wont hurt him i dont really exist there wont be any memories for him to have because i was never there i couldnt even leave him a note henry held out his hands smiling he was in fact without hope theres nothing i can change he said except you and for just a moment there was a fleck of light along the uppermost edge of his eye he sighed and sat up and looked almost merry so what are you going to do what like destroy you michael could only splutter and shake his head helplessly he could of course do it he could do it and get philip back he could return to the long lonely nights of not knowing where philip was michael remembered uncomfortable evenings with philips arty friends he could go back to silences over breakfast and to doing most of the household chores himself michael found that his heart sank i think michael said im going to leave things as they are do you have any idea why that might be michael shrugged maybe i dont really want philip back henry reached across the table and took michaels hand the expression welling up in his eyes might as well be called love then maybe you did this to give him somewhere to go so that you could move on as well michael felt rebellious there are easier ways of getting rid of a boyfriend henrys smile was patient and unfooled are there i cant think of one the gleam came into henrys eyes again is is there anything in your life you cant talk about why has philip said something henrys smile was still sad for him as he shook his head it would probably be something you couldnt tell philip michael felt only slightly flustered his eyelids flapped like butterfly wings he thought he was calmly considering the proposition he surveyed the history of his life and for the moment he couldnt really think of anything like that no nope no theres nothing henry looked a bit disappointed ok he whispered and smiled and rubbed the top of michaels hand he quickly drank the rest of the tea i think id better be getting back sure sure no problem said michael unaccountably veering all the way into an american accent and he stood up jauntily anxious for henry to go thanks for the tea henry stood up too and with infuriating slowness began calmly to arrange all his things in the woollen bag oh come on you can just put things in and take them out later they moved into the hallway if you ever want to talk just give me a call or you can just run up another copy if you like henry smiled but for once michael was uncharmed henry luxuriated his way into his long green coat with the torn pocket he tossed the collar straight and then leaned over legs straight to pick up phils bag i hope i see you he said he meant it michael did not respond henry turned to go but suddenly changed his mind he even changed his mind gracefully the coat swirled about him as he turned back around michael he said suddenly firm this is a miracle its something wonderful why dont you just use it to be happy something in his eyes gripped and held michael remembered this is a political leader why dont you just try joy why dont you just try joy the clinic had just been set up near michaels work it sold viagra and called itself the london professionals registry as if it were american express and you had to be invited to join it had a big polished black door just like the prime ministers inside there was an escritoire at which sat a woman in a tight white uniform perhaps she was a nurse or someone designed to look like one she talked in cool polite tones that perched uncomfortably on the line between being polite and foreboding the wrong sort of person was not welcome here the wrong sort was someone who could not pay michael was ushered into what once had been someones salle de reception it could only have been called that it was too gilded to be fully british it had sofas with blue velour upholstery and tables so fragile and flowery that they looked as if they were made of porcelain lined up on the tables were tatler country life magazines found only in clinics michael had confirmed an appointment for twelve but was made to wait anyway he had time to consider the other professionals being registered a dignified old black gentleman with a cane sat with his wife on the sofa michael presumed it was his wife she wore a brilliant blue dress and a hat and she matched the sofas her huge spectacles increased the firmness of her gaze what are you looking at she seemed to say you should have seen my man when he was young youve got a problem too or you wouldnt be here love an athletic young guy in his early twenties picked up a magazine from the table went back to the sofa stopped put the first one back and picked up another he dropped down onto the sofa as if it were a piece of sporting equipment and crossed his legs he flicked through the magazine at high speed not reading it was fhm full of articles on how to deal with oversensitive women so they would give you sex what a thing to be twenty big strong fleet and to end up in bed with just the kind of girl who tries to sound understanding and cant michael waited minutes im sorry i did make an appointment he said to the nurse in the corridor are you sure my papers went in ill just check for you she replied smiling if youd like to go back and take a seat a few minutes later a nurse came into the room and said mr jones your prescriptions ready the young guy bounded to his feet and nipped out as if skirting the defence in a game of basketball so hes already been seen there is no queue so they really are just keeping me waiting here what on earth for to make sure i have time to reconsider to soak up the general ambience of money and importance or to soften me up for what exactly am i being softened investment he decided they want to make sure i have already invested a lot of time in this so its difficult to say no finally his name was called a different nurse ushered him through another door and down a perfectly domestic corridor into what had once been a maids bedroom it was tiny without a window and in it sat a bullfrog of a man he sat behind another gilded table and did not bother to stand up take a seat he glanced at papers mr blasco the voice was posh the face overripe with too much oldfashioned drinking he wore a shirt with blue stripes his purple neck overflowed the top of his white collar there was a signet ring on his little finger and patches of worn skin on the backs of his hands im mr fieldone im a consultant with the registry michael assumed that consultant meant something fairly medical mr fieldone spoke like a man who had at most fifteen minutes to spare while reading michaels papers presumably for the first time through halfmoon spectacles there are marvellous new treatments for sexual difficulties but by law im afraid we first have to ensure that there isnt a previous medical condition that could cause problems so im afraid there are some forms to go through the questions started bland and increased in impertinence did michael get morning erections would he describe them as full erections could he indicate the angle those erections achieved fortyfive degrees eighty degrees perhaps michael would just like to indicate the angle with his hand uh i really dont know if only he had been brave he wanted to say i dont normally have my mathematical instruments to hand when i have an erection did he ever experience erections while having sex did he have a regular partner do you have any other sexual partners and how many of those do you have michael told him about five per week mr fieldones eyes boggled slightly he smelled of imperial leather soap and his hair plastered low over his head looked like it needed a wash do you mind my asking if your partners are male or female both well mostly men hmm he said flicking back over the document yes we see many people here and we find that impotency often comes to homosexual men particularly if they are a bit introverted or timid and cant fully commit to anyone michael felt something prickle in his cheeks mr fieldone continued i would say that this looks like a psychological problem i will be recommending you for a further physical exam today if you like michael agreed was he supposed to say no it really is wonderful the breakthroughs of the last few years there is a new drug called sidenfil which is quite effective now the usual dosage is fifty milligrams but such is the demand that we have only been able to procure from america he said this leaning forward to emphasize the trouble distance and expense of such an importation treatments in dosages of one hundred milligrams we will of course cut these in half professionally and give them to you in four test dosages your first fee will cover the cost of this trial prescription and todays interviews tests and examinations and provision of results if you decide that the treatment is for you then a prescription of fortytwo dosages will be available to you at a cost of if you are in agreement with these terms please sign here what wait just a moment michaels mind raced to divide and subdivide yes rumbled the deep imperious voice all the cream of privilege rising to the surface an eyebrow was raised thats for two tablets including the work of three professionals ah so youre the professionals being registered that means youre selling me twentyone tablets for as if the case were closed the salesman tapped all papers into a neat whole im not selling you anything by all means take your time to consider and we can file your questionnaire away his voice rose as a question this thought michael is what it is i knew what it was when i came here they know i know what it is the only question is do i want to walk away from here with nothing or do i want to walk out of here with viagra im only signing for right only for the trial dosages yes he was unwilling to say the price again the form was pushed back at michael to sign michael signed so he went to the doctors office the doctor wore a white coat but otherwise looked like an ebullient stick insect he was thrilled by something perhaps it was the money he was making hello good afternoon he cried as michael came in the doctor seemed to float his spectacles reflecting the dazzling light life evidently was marvellous for a man who owned his own clinic the doctor explained yet again the necessity for a medical exam there would need to be blood tests you could have a shunt a venus shunt it had evidently been a rather celebratory lunch his s sounds slurred as if on ice an erection is made of blood and a venus shunt is a sort of short circuit lower your trousers please a refreshingly cool jelly was applied thickly all over michaels cock it was rather like a prelude to something else it helps conduct the sound explained the doctor it did seem as if he was taking longer than necessary applying the gel his eyes gleamed perhaps he just enjoyed his work being examined by the doctor was rather like being abducted by aliens something like a microphone that had won a design week award was run up and down michaels penis tiny speakers connected to the computer produced a throbbing shushing sound this made the doctor giggle sounds like the music my son listens to he said he was definitely drunk and he was stroking michaels cock in a friendly offhand way no nothing wrong there hear it michael wasnt sure what he was supposed to be listening for the blood is circulating beautifully he gave michaels bare thigh an enthusiastic slap nothing wrong there michael discovered that once he had had a faint little hope the little hope was that his impotence had a physical cause like a limb lost in a car accident it could not then be blamed on him michael felt ashamed the consultant seemed reasonably sure it was psychological oh him said the doctor hes just a sales person michael knew exactly how to take this then what is he doing telling people that homosexuals tend to be impotent oh good heavens did he say that i am sorry ill have a word you know how it is everyone wants to partake of the mystique of medicine he began to write something on michaels papers and then began to giggle poor old farfars hmm hmm hmm he never got over old squeers i beg your pardon michael asked the doctor waved his hand the joke beyond explanation something that happened to him at school never got over it poor old farfars you knew him at school michael suddenly saw some old sozzled hack had been given a nonjob by old school chums the doctor became suddenly serious what were going to do now mr blasco is give you a blood test we dont do that here thats done for us by another clinic excellent the fairborough just down the road this will determine if you have diabetes and should also confirm youre not taking any other medicines that could cause problems youve already signed the prescription said michael what happens if it turns out i have diabetes oh well refund the cost of the test dosage but michael had to chuckle should you really be signing a prescription before you know that its safe the professional leaned back how can spectacles look as if they are grinning smugly oh come on they seemed to say we know whats going on here this is a deal you want it we got it we find most of our patients dont want to wait they come back here and find the prescription is ready for them if they fail the tests then of course we dont give them the drugs and they only pay for the examination he paused airily and then asked whats your line of work mr blasco michael told him a biologist ah the doctor said a fellow professional he gained a conspiratorial air do you work for industry im an academic were funded by a research council academic and youre funded by government twice thats clever of you a lot of privatesector research is funded in the same way well im glad that this current government is doing something for industry he was pissed and didnt care a bit if michael might not be a tory well said michael this current government lets you sell viagra it was the first time during the entire process that anyone had called the drug by its brand name and chuckled the doctor keep its value inflated by keeping it off the national health but then ask yourself mr blasco why should the taxpayer pay for that when you are perfectly capable of paying for it yourself it was all about money most people worked mostly for money so why did it feel wrong that doctors should michael got his tablets the nurses in the front office continued their conversation about the new taxfree savings accounts i suppose michael thought i want other people to have a calling since i do not he got home and examined his prescription the pills of course were not cut in half professionally or otherwise does viagra work michael tried it on lawrence of arabia and it did michael had seen a television documentary years before about lawrence and his sexual habits he read the opening of seven pillars of wisdom and wondered how there could be any controversy at all about it the second page says clearly that he and the arab warriors made love supposedly because no clean women were to be had michael found the passage about the turkish commandant lawrence was quite clear there too violated and beaten lawrence discovered his taste for pain and humiliation michael focussed on an old photograph lawrence was wearing long white robes and had narrowed his eyes against the sunlight he looked young salty tiny and beautiful michael took his first viagra and called lawrence up direct from the transjordan lawrence arrived and blinked michael had not expected lawrence s eyes they were as stilling as ice and the same colour and they fixed on michael and were full of doubt lawrence was creased from too much sun but otherwise he had the face of a ruthlessly honest difficult teenager his long arab robe was stained yellow michael smelled dust and eau de cologne lawrence stood dazed for a moment he stared at the huge blank staring eye of the television and then strode to the window and looked out over the street the parked cars were lined up the mornings light shower drying on their hoods lawrence was slim and precisely placed leaning sideways his legs akimbo in the way a dancers might be askew for effect he held one forearm straight up clenching the wrist with his other hand michael would have called him squiggly which meant tiny and effeminate if the gesture had not also given lawrence the air of a warrior michael coughed would you like to use the shower lawrence bowed once and said in a light voice that would be pleasant thank you ill get you a towel without any kind of ceremony lawrence began to disrobe he calmly released and then folded his headdress over the arm of michaels sofa bed when michael returned with a clean towel lawrence was nude waiting patiently holding his wrist again his stomach was the flattest hardest most ribbed with muscle that michael had ever seen he could see the striations of the muscles through his skin michael indicated the way to the bathroom and showed lawrence how the shower worked it has a pump lawrence asked yeah i guess so theres a switch you have to turn on only i leave it on all the time water said lawrence in a slightly wondering voice he made michael feel graceless michael was never prepared for his creations to be more powerful than he was and yet he should be prepared for it they somehow were as if they used him as a filter to strain their impurities thinking of the neighbours and what he hoped was to come he pulled the curtains shut and finally he picked up the blue and white paper that enfolded his viagra and finally read its small blue print the instructions said take one hour before intercourse michael was going to have to engage lawrence of arabia in an hours conversation lawrence reentered the room moving without sound without even disturbing the air he was unashamed of his nakedness and was slightly erect perhaps because his relative vulnerability excited him so lawrence asked and began towelling himself vigorously as if to chafe away a layer of skin he still smelled of sweat what year is it michael told him is there a state of israel yes michael felt awkward standing but somehow unwilling to sit on the sofa what has it done to the arabs moved them to one side integrated some of them into the state of israel fought wars with the others lawrence rubbed streaks of pink abrasion began to appear on his milkwhite legs two great people destroyed the last breath of british imperialism lawrence shook his head and sat down on michaels livingroom carpet with the abruptness of a wolf he looked at michael and michael saw that yes the bluegrey eyes were those of a wolf in a boyish scholars face prematurely aged sit next to me lawrence said kindly he looked utterly at home on the desertcoloured carpet michael did stiffly i had a wonderful death dont you think still young on a motorcycle michael smiled at the pride it is something of a prototype i hope that doesnt mean people imitate it no but live fast die young james dean that kind of thing is around but not really because of you lawrence s head dipped in frustration my entire life was spent trying to avoid power his skinny body the slightly awkward way it moved oh god it reminded michael of phil the pubes were shaved like an arabs like a young boy just come into puberty how many people does this man contain why avoid power the grey eyes looked up undeniable because i could have destroyed the world i had it in me from nowhere there was a yellow rolledup cigarette lit and smelling of hashish and because wisdom does not lie in power you must have the potential for power but use the power for different things i wanted to be wise i failed of course i wanted to be a poet and a warrior and an historian the face closed slightly with tension do people still read my book michael did not have the heart to tell him that he had read only parts of it and thought it was horribly overwritten its everywhere though to tell you the truth most people see the movie lawrence closed his eyes and went very still they made a film he said as if in dread ive got it on video do you want to see it no said fiercely thank you said gently it was kind of you to offer i can imagine that the movie is very romantic for those of us who understand english the verb to romance means to lie hospitality michael thought arab hospitality he had difficulty fighting his way to his knees would you like some tea tea would be lovely thank you said lawrence and rewarded him with the most beautiful of smiles under the most doubtful of eyes lawrence made michael feel lonely michael asked him come and talk to me while i make it lawrence slid to his feet as if gravity worked in reverse for him he padded behind michael into the kitchen michael asked is tea all right are you hungry i try to be independent of food said lawrence smiling grasping his wrist again michael was cursing his ignorance it wasnt that he had only skimmed the seven pillars of wisdom he realized he knew nothing of the history there must be a thousand questions that an educated person could ask lawrence of arabia michael had only one is it true that you had many arab lovers no replied lawrence i had very few is it true that your book is dedicated yes lawrence cut him off with a single perfectly timed downward nod of the head we all have a love of our life michael lowered his eyes and lapsed into a podgy english miserablism i wish i did tuh said lawrence a kind of chuckle dismissive but affectionate he leaned against the archway into the kitchen he looked like a teenage girl a bold italian gamine leaning against the village fountain you may just have met him he said lightly his eyes hooded his smile teasing he was naked but clothed in something other it was michael who was embarrassed michael clattered the teapot and cups onto a tray and carried it rattling into the sitting room they sat down on the carpet again and lawrence imperceptibly took over the serving of the tea lawrence passed michael a cup it went out like a heartfelt gesture what the arabs taught me is that eloquence even when overwrought or extravagant as some of their verse appears to be in translation has a shape an architecture that carries its own meaning lawrence placed the teapot and sugar bowl on the carpet in a pattern as formed as a cuneiform wordsign from nineveh this shapeliness is mirrored in their calligraphy in which the writing becomes a dance the strange effect of all this is that in practice and i mean the practice of love their sexual cues are verbal ours are visual related usually to looks theirs are veiled physically but naked verbally they say things such as love exists to grow a new part of the soul as my love for you has done so even in paradise there will be part of my soul called lawrence someone said that to you asked michael in wonder doh lawrence s eyes were filmed over his voice was slightly rougher when he said you can sit closer to me if that is your desire michael understood that this was an act of kindness to understand and to do all of the work michael smiled at himself to acknowledge that he was behind in the game feeling thickarsed michael snailed himself in heaving stages six inches nearer to lawrence you have never suffered physically judged lawrence michael shook his head no i always made myself suffer physically so that i would be enduring when i most needed to be i would do without food or sleep or water i would walk barefoot miles over rocks so that i would disdain the physical michael was puzzling his way through the words its true the worst ive had is a sprained ankle the heat and the dust and starvation all burn away illusion the body is an illusion michael was beginning to fall in love lawrence looked at him fiercely i have never he said allowed myself to achieve a sexual climax michael was beginning to fall out of love lawrence of arabia was barking mad then lawrence of arabia pulled michael to him the arms were still hot from sunlight the wolf eyes blazed with a demand they were insisting they were insisting on something that was only somewhat like sex be my desert lawrence demanded be my sunlight burn me michael looked at his watch i have to keep you talking for twenty more minutes is this a spiritual exercise lawrence asked hungry to be told that yes it was a deliberate act of withholding a reining in no no its a medical one michaels viagra hour was not over he checked for any of the side effects flushed cheeks a slight sense of palpitation in the hands and heart is the condition chronic ah yes actually it is then you do know pain said lawrence his voice sinking several octaves lower are you in pain now the thought seemed to entice lawrence he began to stroke michaels temples i am beginning to get a mild headache that was a side effect too gosh viagra was fun michael couldnt wait for the splintered blue plates in his vision either especially the ones with zigzag flashing edges then i bind myself to that vow also announced lawrence and sat back then he announced to be really alive you have to be prepared to die michael thought if viagra can work against this it can work against anything they spent the next twenty minutes discussing pottery shards lawrence loved his subject ancient near eastern archaeology and the excavation of nineveh it is a tonic against romance to read the tablets they are all contracts the equivalent of shopping lists they finished the tea lawrence nodded and then turned and stretched himself out face down on the carpet he saw michaels belt and asked to be struck with it there is to be no indulgence he said use the end with the buckle there should never be any shirking of the worst michael had never thought of sex as a trial of endurance um are you sure this is necessary it stops me becoming effeminate said lawrence oh no it doesnt thought michael the perfect buttocks wobbled without any fuss no trumpets or even any particular sensation it was simply noticeable that michaels penis was erect his temples thumped with an increased flow of blood and his thumbs felt curiously weak as they held the belt something was shivery and loose not in his body but in his mind michael struck the buttocks and they tensed is that enough he asked lawrence shook his head no harder he said once michael struck again until the buttocks reddened and something like anger rose up in him michael held down lawrence s tiny arms and pushed him down flat and mounted him definitively lawrence had an ugly anus lumpy and twisted shut several times rolling over itself michael forced himself through the resistance of the sphincter lawrence did not react the cock pumped as if all by itself and lawrence looked grim as if enduring something dreadful michael kept pumping and pumping and the idea came to him perhaps science had freed him after all given him back to himself but he didnt come finally he just stopped you withheld said lawrence so did i he lay still as if broken michael slid back from him and tried to coax him to roll over to speak to him like a wounded child lawrence cast off michaels hands i have allowed you to violate the integrity of my body he said and buried his face michael felt like an unwanted guest at a wedding he wanted to bring back the beauty of an hour before would you like some more tea i want some clean fresh air said lawrence angrily to the carpet the hashish cigarette still smouldered on the fake wood tray hes burnt my tray michael thought and then remembered he can burn nothing hes an angel hes powerless michael looked at the unmoving body ok hes from another age all of this was inconceivably dirty and evil denial became all mixed up with the thing you desired denial made you able to ride in the desert with the arabs it made you tough it meant that when you and they made love you both understood each others shame and guilt they could respect and admire your shame and guilt as they admired your prowess you are quintessential lawrence you are genuinely warlike as the english are you are loyal and hard and selfsacrificing and you regard militarism with its uniforms and flags and shouting and terrible music as irredeemably foolish you found yourself in arabia in particular circumstances you found a kind of love also in particular circumstances it does not mean that you were not also noble michael touched the small of the white back as if in benediction and ordered lawrence home back to his desert and whoever it was had grown him as part of his soul im learning if you could sleep with anyone in the world who would it be sexually armed and dangerous michael now found there was no one with whom he wanted to have sex this was if nothing else a serious failure of imagination there was a time when every afternoons lecture presented michael with students who seemed improbable miracles of health and beauty cosmopolitan london youths with vshaped backs wore perfect white tshirts their hips were slim their crotches were full their scandinavian or indic or west indian complexions were unblemished unlined glowing they had sat arrayed in front of him legs wide as if with the malicious intent of disturbing his calm now michael saw the imperfections that would distort their beauty with age the gap teeth the sunken eyes for the first time ever his students provided no sexual inspiration in the mornings the train seemed full of middleaged men who needed exercise michael had to remind himself that some of them were objectively young and attractive it was summer the season of tshirts and shorts and hairy knees the beautiful naked legs had no effect on him michael began to realize that he did not really like sex he had only ever liked parts of sex sudden jagged frozen moments he would recycle them as images in memory or fantasy often the people in the fantasy did not matter the core of the fantasy was the situation he himself was in these situations were not anything he would care to have written down just recently one fantasy involved him being tied up in a berlin dungeon in another he was pressed by a wall of waiting men in the urinals at cairo train station his potential partners in the fantasy might wear gelabiya or more western dress they could be nile delta plump or desert thin young or old who they were did not matter in other fantasies michael imagined he was twelve years old in carlsbad waylaid on a beach and seduced into a weekend life in a male brothel he imagined himself at twelve wearing the tight little trunks and dancing for men he danced to trex and put his finger on the cloth under which his sphincter lay it made no difference if the customers were fat black and middleaged or offduty wrestlers still in costume or fathers of childhood friends what made him come was the situation he was in and the different scenarios that could lead to the dream was not of someone else but of himself changed life had given him the wrong miracle look i said i kept fancying guys but i dont in fact i think i dont really like most men if anything i am rather chaste what i want is to be somewhere else doing something i would never normally do the fantasy actually is that i become someone different so that was what the miracle should have been it should have changed me michael looked at the escort ads in the gay press the photographs were supposed to be genuine they usually displayed the wares from the neck down slim bodies with large cocks muscular bodies with tiny ones he could have any of them just by asking he didnt ask perhaps he was satiated perhaps it was his computer course seriously the instructors had forgotten to set enough coursework to give final marks so suddenly week after week another report or essay or study was due all weekend and most evenings michael read learned papers about windows nt system design finals were coming as well so he was having to memorize circuit diagrams all of this was far from arousing perhaps it was simply that he could have whomever he wanted when michael and philip used to go out together the bars would seem to be full of delicious men served cold when michael went alone and sex was a serious possibility the men all seemed to be ballet fans pretending to be motorcyclists or overcoiffured skinny young queens or bitter old ones or flakes who believed in numerology or fake rockabillies who talked only to each other or men who lived with their mothers availability washed the bloom off the fruit michael invited all of the team at the lab out to lunch in the first flush of summer they sat outside on a jetty on the river crowded around two tiny silver tables the day seemed to yawn and stretch in the warmth across the river were the houses of parliament looking misty like an old aquatint if you could sleep with anyone in the world who would it be michael asked his staff after three bottles of red wine no one answered at first who would you sleep with is not a question anyone can answer easily its not only that the question is too personal the answer changes moment to moment it could well be that at that moment you do not want to sleep with anyone at all ebru smiled and said her boyfriend of course she added well and who else no one else she insisted smiling michael turned to shafiq and asked him oh said shafiq and looked pleased and embarrassed oh i dont think i could answer that dont say your wife said ebru emilio was humorously outraged you said your boyfriend yes but that is the privilege of the one who is brave and goes first all right i will tell you said shafiq his eyes sparkled with daring they all waited sophia loren i like the mature women michael imagined sleek brown thighs in oldfashioned stockings with a little wrinkle just above the knee i can see that he said they are more you know the young ones are beautiful but shafiq was shy and his smile overwhelmed his face i know thought michael you cant imagine that the young ones are really interested in you ebru kept up the attack emilio my girlfriend he murmured under a sheltering elbow oh dear so unimaginative ebru was teasing we are all being that said shafiq there is good reason for that ebru replied we would all like to sleep with many people but there are consequences in doing so i would only do anything if there were no consequences michael could promise there would be no consequences nothing would change you couldnt get sick you could not get pregnant ebru chuckled at her own naughtiness and my boyfriend could not find out absolutely then i would consider sleeping with george clooney oh dear said emilio and not anthony edwards hes bald i couldnt now its your turn for you to say anne heche said emilio with an air of finality and a grin that was frankly smug oh but you know that she is a lesbian emilios smile went hazy and naughty hmm maybe i like that oh we are learning many things about each other it is good to be social so that we can all get acquainted better ebru plucked each word like strings on a guitar she turned to michael ok boss this was your idea now it is your turn michael grinned and thought im the only one here who can actually answer that question he drew it out well first hmm who would i ask first michael crossed his arms i think it would be mother theresa emilio yelped mother theresa michael surfed it is she not beautiful yeah but to sleep with ebru was pleased that is a very clever answer emilio couldnt accept it it would be like sleeping with et hmm said michael i hadnt thought of that one he pretended to consider the proposition rubbing his chin ebru was proud of him you see shafiq michael likes the mature women as well and then after that michael announced and all conversation stopped michael was going to give them more than one i think it would be johnny weissmuller from the tarzan movies ebrus eyes widened miming shock but she was smiling she already knew right on said emilio which raised further questions about emilio and then it would be michael took an olive from the dish and chewed it and they all waited him out taffy duck from dumb duck detective and after that mmm a girl from my high school ebru laughed some more and applauded you win first place for originality so as firstplace winner you now have to answer the next question michael who here in the staff of the project would you sleep with if it was no harm done michael smiled and shook his head oh no ebru drawled amused oh but you have to answer it is the contest oh no i dont i will tell you one other if you tell me ok i will then there was a quick exchange of nervous glances no one male or female wants to know that the boss fancies them oh my goodness chuckled shafiq and mimed getting up to leave michael should have studied drama he looked at each of them in turn i have to tell the truth and say that i dont fancy any of you there was a general groan of disappointment and now ebru no no i dont have to say anything you asked me the question and i answered it honestly you wouldnt want me to lie would you so now its your turn ebru laughed and picked at her fingernails which did not look as if they had polish on them until you realized they were perfect and translucent ok then it is sean connery oh everybody fancies sean connery i fancy sean connery said emilio which was probably just a shade too devilmaycare for it really to touch anything private michael studied emilio freshfaced a big nose a shock of hair pretty intelligent lively but no icons thought michael everyone offers up icons theyre impersonal and safe and they never change and for the most part you even get people agreeing with you ive got one said hugh the sciences can sometimes produce people who are colourless to the point of invisibility hugh had to say it again amid the general clatter of disappointment at ebrus answer hughs turn everyone said michael who knew enough to keep alert to anything that told him about his staff the table quietened down hugh was pale with perfect jetblack hair and a neck so thin that it looked as if it could not support the weight of his spectacles i saw a girl once across the big courtyard at ucl she was beautiful she wasnt dressed like a student she wore what i imagine very chic french women wear to work a kind of brown jacket and almost a miniskirt she had beautiful legs and mediumlength hair that was very tidy and she was talking to one of the professors no actually he smiled to himself and moved the spectacles up his nose she was listening to him really listening to him this bloke was a bit of a badtempered old hippie but she was obviously asking him really good questions or something he was taking it all so seriously and suddenly she said something and he laughed hugh looked up and away his smile growing he laughed and laughed and shook his head and she said something else and he laughed even more and so you have dreamed of her ever since ebru had the good sense to make that a question i asked the professor who she was hugh corrected her gently and he asked me why and i said it was because i thought she was the most beautiful girl in the world ebrus face softened and she leaned forward oh it is a beautiful story hugh whispered her name was constanza regina de alencar vrena she was from brazil but she had an italian father and she was a business major so i went to her class and introduced myself hugh mimed it constanza hello my name is hugh mcpherson and you dont know me but i would like to ask you out ebrus grin opened wide you did that you asked her out oh but this is very romantic hughs smile veered sideways and his eyes turned inward she couldnt speak english she couldnt understand what i said shed been telling jokes in portuguese what did she do she smiled sweetly and walked away something strange was happening in hughs face it was becoming beautiful the fresh skin the black hair tenderness suffused it he looked at michael that is what i would do i would use it to make restitution for all the opportunities that i missed the men i slept with did they make a difference in his youth michael had imagined that he would be a traveller visiting india china and the andaman islands thailand was as near to it as he ever got mark knew a thai art dealer who stayed in michaels flat and who returned the favour michael went to thailand in and spent the entire trip in an agony of unfulfilled desire the thais were sleek and smooth and friendly but he turned them all down he and the rest of the world were terrified of aids bangkok was not the thai friend took him to see shows where naked boys danced some were slim and effeminate others looked like samurai they sat on michaels lap wearing nothing but dressing gowns and jockstraps he bought them drinks and under the cover of their dressing gowns they flipped their erect genitals out of the jockstraps and used the heads of their penises to give michaels bare arms butterfly kisses he still turned them down his thai friend shook his head in disbelief michael saw some of the other europeans at the bar outrageous air stewards who were going upstairs with one boy after another or ugly europeans whose faces seemed puffed out with disgust or greed this michael thought would be a terrifically easy place to get ill he went to the far north to the mekong and the borders with laos where tourism ended the communist municipalities blared propaganda from loudspeakers across the calm river michael walked along its banks and heard blondie coming from a buddhist temple as if competing with the communists on tiptoe he peered in through a window and saw fifty buddhist monks in training all in their teens bopping to call me he walked on until an uninviting soldier with a gun waved him back when he passed the temple again the same monks were all lounging on the river bank sitting on upsidedown beached boats they were young bored and falling out of orange robes with unfulfilled desire their naked shoulders had the colour and gloss of polished wooden floors parlezvous francais one of them called michael did his best it is a heartstopping thing suddenly to be surrounded by admiring young men vous etes riches the young monk demanded they all laughed and giggled and adjusted their dress no he said i am not rich i am a scientist this was a mistake the boys veered away from any possibility of being kept by a rich westerner suddenly they wanted michael for his mind they had only the dimmest idea of what a scientist did michael tried to explain something about the brain they all nodded in respect and looked a bit ashamed je suis pecheur said the one who spoke his smile dim with shame he was a fisherman vous parlez le francais beaucoup plus mieux que mot the smile widened je suis vietnamois tous les vietnamois parlent le francais je suis refugie the boy explained shyly his father had worked in the french embassy in hanoi he was not allowed to move more than a mile from the town the boys were interested in michael and so demanded what in the west would be considered personal details was he married no oh that is sad children work for you do you have a girlfriend michael lied and said many he had many girlfriends the boys all cooed and laughed one boy kept pressing questions on michael did he live in a big apartment did he have many clothes did he drive an ambulance the boy was very pretty indeed and paler than the others with a rounder face ethnic chinese michael decided voo lee voo dang see the soft boy asked noo avong ung fate michael didnt understand the fisherman explained une fete avec la musique il veut que vous allez danser avec nous the boys all demanded it in unison they made it clear that it would be an enormous privilege to dance disco with a real westerner michael could also see that some of them were telling jokes about his height and girth and hairiness they would see westerners as big clumsy slow and indelicate he very nearly said no out of humility but he loved dancing in fact it would be easier to dance with the boys than to talk with them ce nest pas une probleme avec vos maitres non cest educatif nous dansons avec un savant dangleterre so michael bopped to michael jackson it was the most enormous innocent fun michel danced a reel and a jig which made them roar with laughter each of the boys in turn did something silly to make him feel at home some of them made goofy demon faces a big thickbodied youth nipped onto his hands and walked on them one of them moonwalked and then the little ethnic chinese began a traditional thai dance there was no mistaking the hand gestures the covering of the face the alluring postures the hands held out to ward off unwelcome advances he was miming a female part the boys chuckled but michael saw them looking sideways to gauge his reaction the boy tripped up to michael and fully in character made some kind of declaration or assertion suddenly sick in his belly michael knew that something was being offered something he wanted he pretended not to understand befuddled he turned to his vietnamese host cest une danse une miseenscene the vietnamese started to laugh he caught the eyes of his fellows and slapped his hands together and turned away grinning no harm came the little chinese seemed in no way offended or embarrassed nor were any of the boys they went on doing their party tricks until an adult arrived the masters pretended to be horrified that the boys had imposed upon the gentleman and insisted that they must not bother him any longer with foolish things the boys protested that this was a scientist from london so the maitre honoured michael with nescafe michael was seated on a naugahyde sofa in a concrete office with a tin roof that served more as an oven than a shelter he used a tissue like a windscreen wiper on his forehead as sweat drummed down he tried to piece together a serious conversation with the master whose french was for the most part incomprehensible was it not true that science was now confirming the teachings of the buddha when it was polite michael stood up to say goodbye and asked if he might say goodbye to the boys the masters smile explained not possible boys at prayer michael walked past the long cool stone chamber and peered in on tiptoe it was empty michael marvelled at the courage and beauty of the chinese boy so now in his london flat michael made a restitution he put on his old copy of thriller and called all the monks up into his sitting room the air moved like there was a bonfire suddenly there was an orange swirl like flame and his room was full of young men in loose orange robes bouncing as if made of coiled springs let it go he told them for it had been something of a missed opportunity for them as well the orange robes spun free they were beautiful small and slim with perfect complexions or large and beefy with spots on their cheeks michael bathed in them he ran his hands over the smooth skin as they rippled past him over him under him they felt like warm waves until his fingers found sudden clusterings of hair some of them knocked away his hands others were more biddable caught up in the excitement of the dance with a kind of baffled wonderment they let michael proceed others even knelt around him after they were gone whirling away in rippling spirals of air michael listened to the silence they would now be thirty years old seasoned michael thought of the small chinese michael called him up as he would be now the man looked almost the same he was still slim with an hourglass waist his face was not more lined but it did look plumper and wise he wore black trousers and a translucent blue shirt and now spoke rudimentary english youre not a monk any more said michael disappointed no only monk for two years we do army also we are monks he smiled and nodded and the implication was delivered lightly better monks than military he ran a nursery in chiang mai he showed michael his card orchids fruit big palm trees for the city work for all the husband of my friends servants i am very popular man the ladies can have their husbands join them from the north and they work in shade he showed michael photographs of his house it was an oldfashioned teak house with a huge garden you know thai fruit my garden have rambutan and jack fruit michael suddenly remembered oh yes rambutan theyre like clusters of lychees you like music music boom he said he made michael understand the teak house acted like wooden speakers on the sound it was good to have someone spend the night the nurseryman who had been a monk curled up next to and around michael like a cat his body was still hairless and hard but he had become far more butch as he aged he overwhelmed michael physically and when he slept he purred in the morning the monks black eyes shone with affection you come to chiang mai you give me call he said and placed a card on the bedside table you wont know me said michael say a friend recommend my nursery to buy rambutan for england i will get to know you i have no boyfriend now i will like you michael remembered to write down the name and address before he disappeared after he left the card had vanished but the naturalized thai name and the address were real and belonged to a real person it was not until later travelling on the tube that michael realized how this differed from every other encounter with an angel the thai had said the real me will like you could michael go to chiang mai to find someone he had never actually met what could come of a love separated by seven thousand miles harm that had been michaels experience of love there were other restitutions to be made there was for example al when michael returned from california al was in michaels year al was asian his name was actually ali but he had been adopted and had a western last name wilcox his eyes slanted down at the outside corners they were dancing and dark and seemed to reflect michaels eyes back at him in the last year at school als adopted parents divorced and neither one of them wanted an asian child so he was left in an apartment by himself his parents told him they didnt want to disrupt his studies he knew well enough that he had been purchased at age four to help glue their relationship together and that he could no longer serve their purposes understand this he lived alone at seventeen at seventeen you are always looking for somewhere to do it the backs of cars alleys behind the pillars at clubs in darkened archways if the need is strong enough al had a huge bed in the middle of a studio apartment that he had all to himself understand this he was beautiful and wanted to be a fashion designer and he had a white girlfriend with a harelip al kept her photograph on a chest of drawers she was called tabitha michael liked tabitha he was young enough to confuse feeling sorry for someone with real sympathy the part of his mind that always fooled himself said see how nice al is he is wise enough to like tabitha despite the lip how i wish michaels befuddled brain whispered that i could find someone as nice as al they had history class together and when al wasnt looking michaels gaze would be fixed upon him they had art class together and everything al drew was women in beautiful clothes audrey hepburn in cocktail dresses asian ladies in big flouncy party frocks al was lean and slim and like michael was on the crosscountry team once after a long late run they were alone in the shower room and al had swung back the door of his locker he was naked and erect and he looked at michael in a strangely solemn way michael smiled tolerantly the front part of his brain said my friends body has run away with him its hormones it means nothing michael fooled himself into thinking al needed reassurance that it made no difference to him michael chuckled and gave the head of the penis an admonitory tap as if to say i dont mind but put it away mate by now michael lived in terror of his sexuality michael had conjured out of his big athletic body a big forgiving athletic heterosexual the heterosexual lived and breathed and took michaels place whenever he was needed al shamefaced turned his back to him and dressed hunched and quiet but michael could not be acting all the time he must have been sending signals he must have looked into als eyes at lunchtime and smiled a big kind loving smile all unawares once in the boys toilets next to the showers al walked past michaels cubicle the cubicles had no doors and were open to view so teachers could check for smoking or drugs al stopped and smiled and michael caught as he was on the toilet his dick jammed down between his legs couldnt help but grin back in that grin he could feel all of his yearning flash out of him like a sword there was complicity in that grin i like being naked around you he felt his legs unclench and open some time later al invited michael back to his studio it was tiny with big windows with net curtains pulled back anyone on the street could see them that meant nothing to al he lolled like a tongue on his double bed having changed into something comfortable a tshirt and very tight satiny blue running shorts michael was trying to be good this nice innocent boy he told himself michael keep your eyes to yourself al tapped the bed for michael to sit next to him michael perched on its edge at a distance from him he didnt want to take advantage al heaved slightly on the bed arching his back my parents are worried about my living alone they are frightened that i might meet a homosexual where do parents get their ideas from i mean even if you did its no big deal and if the guy wanted anything you could just say no right al nodded holding his chin up i could yeah he edged closer to michael have you ever met anyone like that naw said michael going into big and butch mode no i never and in big blurting butch mode michael had stood up afraid away from the bed al had sat up too and suddenly swung his feet onto the floor a few more things were said and then al announced his face closed and wary anyway i got my homework to do and outside the studio flat michael stopped next door was the newsagents where michael glanced up nervously at gay times he had to lean against the wall and he nearly doubled over in rage at first he thought that he was outraged that a pass had been made at him then he thought he was enraged at the betrayal of tabitha then he was mad at himself and mad at al and he did not know why a blinding headache spread across the breadth of his forehead michael could not remember what happened afterwards he and al seemed to stop talking something happened to al during the last year at school michael saw it only from afar al didnt study for exams his dark eyes were clouded and encircled with bags of even darker flesh his tie was askew his school uniform was untended al wore it with the bitter swagger of the unloved the outcast he dyed his hair a muddy brassy blond michael supposed it went something like this my adopted parents do in fact care about me they know i am stranded between two cultures they dont want me to have to guess where my birth parents were from and read about those cultures in books they are worried that i will have no selfesteem they are concerned that i am young and needing to be constantly reassured partly because they deserted me my parents would be horrified to know that i am haunting parks and toilets and taking older men back to my flat and spending all night in clubs they dont want me getting into drugs and cock rings its just that my parents wont do a single thing to stop it sometime before alevels al simply stopped coming to school michael still had fantasies that he had become als lover and ended up living with him they would have moved to sussex together and found a bedsit in brighton and michael would have gone to university and al to art school he could see the cure posters on their wall and smell the curries they would have cooked together michael kept an eye out for al he had no interest in clothes but he read the fashion pages even so michael saw young britishturkish designers become famous he saw young italianbritish designers move to french couturiers al was not among them from time to time he looked in the telephone directory for al wilcox or rather ali wilcox he looked at the photograph of any young indian designer in case al had changed his name silence and something in that silence delayed him calling up an angel now he had felt that kind of silence before when calling up an angel what was it that someone said fashion was moving in circles now because all the talented young designers had died if michael had said yes to al if they had become lovers would it have made any difference would al be alive it would have made a difference to michael he could have practised being in love making a home being human and close even if it had come to nothing he would have begun to grow up at seventeen i have a feeling al can make no difference now to anything michael came home from a day back at the university sitting final exams and telling students to turn off their mobile phones he sat in his darkened sitting room and thought about al he crunched a viagra like candy and waited for his hour he was a little bit scared and that was good being scared michael had realized means youre learning i can edit this like a film michael thought i can cut to the chase the air swung back like a locker door and al stood revealed naked and solemn his eyes were frightened and serious this was nothing like a body running away with itself on automatic erection this was a needy seventeenyearold who had made a decision that required him to show who he was come here said michael sit next to me al came to the sittingroom sofa and curled up like a baby caching his nakedness and resting his head on michaels lap i missed you al said i missed you for a long time al lay still and closed his eyes with what looked like relief you didnt get fat you didnt get boring you stayed michael michael found he was able to lean all the way down to kiss the top of als head what happened to you he asked al said i missed the train what does that mean oh it means i died michaels heart groaned not another one michaels heart was fed to bursting with this stuff it was like the war his gay generations war why didnt it stop how old michael whispered twentyone one of the very first in london al still curled up raised a hand as if volunteering they didnt even know what it was michael had broken out into a sweat and he made a shrugging motion as if he were in harness als eyes glittered up at him why did you turn me down michael i wanted to be with you michael said because i think that if i make a pass at someone ill kill them the words popped out like a pip squeezed from an orange under stress hard and bitter and glossy michael ran a hand over his brow the words he realized were true michael chuckled it was a strange kind of laugh that bent him over in the middle now it looks like i kill people if i dont make a pass at them he managed a sick sad smile al was shaking his head you didnt kill me then why do i feel sick why does sex always make me scared cause youre screwed up were both screwed up al hung his head i killed me michael no one else did al reached up and played with michaels long curly hair he leaned his forehead against michaels as if in submission or final rest for the first time in his life michaels cock responded to emotion yes it was also the viagra but the blood pushing into the opened veins of his penis was driven hard by a sense of farewell of wishing someone did not have to go it was the emotion you might have if your faithful lover was leaving for a month michaels heart yearned up through his penis al could sense it something quickened in his eyes and he arched his back he stretched his legs and opened up like a flower displaying its pistils michaels face slipped down the length of als trunk and kissed als penis and went further down to the neatly folded anus the front of michaels trousers had soaked through his underwear was difficult to peel off als legs went over his head and michael entered him and strained within him to reach further inside all michael saw was als eyes and his delighted smile michael lifted al up still joined to him and carried him to the bedroom he settled al onto the edge of the mattress and he kept standing and watching himself making love and that looked like a miracle in itself and the air whispered again it seemed as if restitution had been pushed even further it seemed suddenly that afternoon light was filtered through oldfashioned net curtains in a single window michael blinked at the illusion and it remained for a moment they were back in a studio flat in romford he blinked again and the room sighed with relief of tension and collapsed back into its ordinary self as both michael and al came together al took his hand and rested it against his leg it wouldnt have made any difference michael it would have ended the same his dark pupils were holes that seemed to go on forever i i could let you stay here al al blinked you stay here you could live his black eyes reflected little pin pricks of light diamondbright there was no light in the room that was that bright als mouth worked as if he were about to say something michael pressed home stay here and live with me al stroked michaels forearm he cleared his throat michael there is a place without time and we are there before we are born and there after it we are born with wonderful potential and we live and while we live we fulfil it or not in any case when you die you are completed the light in those dark depths was even brighter im complete michael thats my story now youre saying no al smiled sleepily i can say yes or no to nothing you can make me stay for what it would be worth to you michael did not want to lose him just yet he held him and pressed his face against als brown firm chest and felt love yearn out of him again michael rolled the duvet over them both al spent most of the night curled like a baby the sky greyed and for some reason the song of the gardens blackbirds was replaced by the cries of seagulls michael was both awake and asleep his body unmoving as lead and his mind dull michael thought to himself all right then go now in the morning michael sat up in his big bed right he thought and stood out of bed alone that is it i am fed up with all this tragedy henry he told the air you were right god dammit i want to have some fun and as if in answer the curtains round the bed stirred that night after work michael called up bottles again bottles showed up in her punk egyptian phase this time wearing a tom of finland tshirt showing two men tweaking tits she wore a leather glove with studs that was clenched around a bottle of champagne there was the elaborate ritual of continental kissing it had scared michael once then he saw we were poor suburban kids trying to be different smarter sharper harder youre looking so old she said thats a compliment and youre looking so over the top and thats a compliment too she smiled in approval you dont take any shit if you want to sit at the right table i bought us a bottle she said with a swagger michael led her into the dining room where there were champagne glasses babe he said expertly feigning a seventeenyearold feigning sophistication tell me who should i screw next a woman she said and blew out smoke a woman definitely its just so naff being trapped with one sex well ok but who ive already slept with you if you count as a woman that is he opened the cabinet for glasses her face started out mean and bitchy if you ever sleep get to sleep with me and i get to oh bollocks she stamped her foot and started to laugh at herself the line youre looking for goes if you do sleep with me and i ever hear of it i shall be very very annoyed she nodded yes yes i screwed up the implication is that my dick is so small youd either be asleep or you wouldnt notice all right michael had another one at the ready its a wonderful old joke i havent heard it in months being bitchy was such a simple innocent game really why had he been so scared of it bottles laughed and gripped his arm all right then but at least i bought us a bottle she was suddenly the gauche loud girl of years before and just to complete the image of sophistication i bought us a couple of straws and that made michael laugh they sat down at the kitchen table and michael expertly turned the bottle around the cork and not the other way around so it didnt gush this impressed bottles beyond all reason tch i usually get it down my front here you go in went the straws they had accordion bendy bits which bottles adjusted to face each of them honestly its like were at an american soda fountain or something she nodded and laughed yes yes that was the joke something about bottles changed who michael was around her he was able to tell jokes do you want to put ice cream in it i mean really come on like an urban sophisticate bottles mimed laughter silently silence was her way of controlling what she knew could be an ungodly squawk silence did indeed give her a certain lacquering of dignity she wobbled her eyebrows stuck the straw in looked him dead in the eye and began to blow into the champagne frothing it up bottles doubled up with laughter and let rip a horrible piercing screech of a laugh michael looked at her maintaining a stone face that set her off again just as she was recovering he leaned forward as if in sympathy to pat her arm suck dear blow is just an expression bottles had probably arrived stoned which might account for the callisthenic effect the next laugh had on her she looked like she was doing some kind of warmup exercise conversation took a back seat to the recovery of composure bottles wiped her face oh man if you had done that back in youd have been in a band now then you will recall we were discussing who i should fuck next indeed and i have just the gel for you she was imitating some kind of schoolmaam that american singer you like so much no not julie andrews it was michaels turn to laugh the other one her voice returned to normal perfectly serious the good one why are men satisfied with whores there were some pretty weird radio stations in southern california in the s they were meant to lose money taxloss radio it was called taxloss radio broadcast from trailers or the basements of disused churches the djs played whatever they liked black flag next to tony bennett next to miles davis next to magazine next to billie holiday at fourteen michael didnt really know who billie holiday was except that maybe she was something to do with motown lost in the doldrums of knowing no one in california being a teenager being gay michael suddenly heard a voice that sounded like he felt jazz was supperclub music for people who wore slightly transparent socks and liked it when frank sinatra sang hot damn it was in old movies and in this old moviemusic style was someone singing about a lynching the bulging eyes and the twisted mouth drawled a slow sad horrified voice there was something relentlessly modern about it like someone singing brecht or a song about a serial murder it was perfect just perfect it was cool michael could see himself coming back from california with that kind of music and being cool he reckoned that the stores in the camp would be good on jazz so he went there and asked by name for billie holiday they stocked a lot of her product by luck alone he landed on the fifties album lady sings the blues he read the song titles which for the last time would mean nothing to him god bless the child lady sings the blues strange fruit i thought about you walking back to the bus stop he met someone who was almost a friend a marines son on the baseball team with him was the coolest guy of them all the son of a black officer his name was hendricks rousseau hendricks and he claimed to be jimi hendrixs cousin by now michaels taste in records was a reliable source of scoring social points for the children of marines nobody but nobody bought julie andrews records except michael so when the white kid said with a hooded smile what have you got now michael had a sudden surging stab of pride ill show you out came the blue album oh man said the white kid in real embarrassment the record looked old but rousseau hendricks looked up his eyes widening you bought this yeah its got all her best stuff on it at least thats what the guy in the record department said and thats the best there is said rousseau the white kid scowled michael had scored cool points plus michael knew then that his instinct had been right billie was what he needed michael returned to britain and scored cool points all through his brief period of glamour he played billie holiday for bottles in the long magic afternoons before parents came back from work it was like listening to the bible oh that is the story of my life bottles had declared it wasnt then but it was soon to become so for a while later michael read the biographies her voice had not always been sandpaper she had not always sung in a heightened style the recordings from the thirties were smooth dapper even merry it was that billie he called up she arrived direct from having left the artie shaw band billie arrived unfussed plump and pretty in a blue dress with white polka dots she sat down on the sofa lit a cigarette looked at michael and crumpled forward she leaned back smiling narroweyed and took one long draught of her cigarette as if it were a cooling drink oh baby billie muttered to herself man she shook her head what asked michael nervously what billie blasted smoke out of both nostrils you dont even know what you want do you somewhere there were nerves she suddenly reached up to tug on her hair you going to offer the lady a drink or not sure um whiskey gin michael tried to remember what he had in stock a grand slam she said confidently whats that oh man she groaned again she strode into his tiny kitchen where do you keep the hooch around here she started to mix the drinks it was michael who was fussed michael fussed around the cabinet and the icecube tray so you dont know why you called me here i uh a friend suggested it um she said sounding completely unflattered maybe i ought to meet your friend instead i im supposed to be exploring sex or something and i guess im trying to do justice to women justice to women my my you reckon thats possible billie unobtrusively took down another glass and started making him a drink too looky here this is how you fix a grand slam she showed him and passed him the glass here you look like you need it thank you youre welcome she said it because it was good form to do so and comportment was important so what do i get out of this well some people think its neat being alive i never did think that life was neat particularly deaths part of the deal why should i be happy to be resurrected as a whore hmm when i spent all my whole waking life trying to make myself a lady michael coughed with unease yeah i uh im a bit english and to us a lady is some old bat whose great great grandfather was good at railways or killing people and who lives in a stately home lady day suppressed a prejudice of her own visibly swallowed it who were more ofay than the english then something like sympathy swam into her eyes a lady is somebody with dignity and nobody can take that dignity away sympathy swam up in michael as well did you get there yes she said in a determined voice yes i did and michael wondered how much of her future does this angel know lady day was concerned about this present so you see why i dont accept this situation i was a whore at fourteen because my mama had just become one too and it was the only way to put food on the table i didnt want to be no whore i was made to be a whore and a stupid white judge put me into the workhouse at fourteen years old she didnt jail the men who paid me that fifty cents they knew i was fourteen they didnt go to jail smoke poured out of her nostrils like scorn men like you white men who would never have a black gal in their house it was not often that an angel expressed active positive dislike michael wondered what to do he could send her back but that would be chickenshit so michael told himself hear the truth tell the truth not men like me those men were seventy years ago and they werent gay gay she scowled and was bumped from behind by a chuckle what you a whore too then she was bumped by the truth oh i get you youre a pansy yup aw hell there was a pansy craze not so long ago a lot of clubs had pansy comperes a couple of guys in bands were like you and they were always pretty nice except moose he always used to get drunk and mean and call everyone else a sister he hated women though he was one himself twang like a guitar string something snapped billie suddenly stretched out like a cat finding a warm place to sit so you been whoring around michael explained its like a gift i can sleep with anyone i want to alive dead except theyre not real billie coughed a cigarette laugh man you won the male jackpot truth im impotent and its ruined my life so far ruined how my boyfriends left me and im not concentrating on my work sounds like life baby no not when i can call dead people back to life billie thoughtfully plucked a bit of stray tobacco from the tip of her tongue so you got yourself a calling nobody said being called was any fun i got myself a calling it kept me alive a long long time after all i wanted to be was dead she managed a smile held up her drink and toasted it toasted her inhuman calling toasted michaels calling too there was this time i was singing against baby white at the apollo and all the apollo wanted was fasttime stuff and folks who sang like it was opera and they thought i was just imitating louis so i got up there and i dragged anyway dragged behind the beat i did not knock em dead at the apollo not til ten years later anyway she growled and then there was this session with teddy wilson now teddy wilson didnt even like me john hammond made him do it and they fasttimed what a little moonlight can do what nobody knew is what i could do and that the session clarinet was a guy called benny goodman he was a wild cat in those days they fasttimed and benny and i just said to hell with it lets cook and we did and i heard it slot together i heard the angels turning the bolts and i knew i knew then i was the best and i knew it was going to take time that bitch ella had a better voice and she left people happier but i was going to be the greater singer and i knew it would cost i knew those bolts were just another jail god was always going to want me for something billie took a deep breath and now hes gone and done it again she smiled drank in liquor and smoke and then announced i know what you got to learn michael felt slightly forlorn i wish i did you she said bracelets clacking slightly against the glass need to learn how to have a good time her eyes brimmed with something like mockery but it was not unaffectionate lets see this is london right i bet you dont even know where the hot spots are when she said hot she meant hot this woman knew how to swing this is how it works she told him you go to the swankiest place you can find where they play good jazz because that is where jazz makes its money honey but you talk to the guys and they get to know you and pretty soon you find yourself invited to where the action really is where the guys go to jam afterwards thats where you learn the music thats where you learn the life the only jazz place that michael knew was ronnie scotts hed been there once in his twenties and his main impression had been that it cost a lot there was a sudden blurring and billies hair was suddenly conked and plastered close and she wore a clinging white satin dress and round her shoulders a perfectly unfake fox fur wheres the gardenia he asked gardenia her face did a comic double take for your hair um they wont know youre billie holiday without it gardenia huh ok and one appeared folks will just say she cant afford a hat itll be your trademark she adjusted everything and turned ladylike to be admired theyll think youre a drag queen michael had to explain that drag meant something different these days lady was not exactly pleased to be told she could be mistaken for a man so how come you got hair like norma shearer a lot of guys have hair like that now in fact its kinda oldfashioned by now tuh its neverwas fashion where i come from michael wore his only jacket a kind of browngreen with a zigzag tweed and billie just laughed at it i hope the whole town doesnt dress like you she touched his mane lightly and then tried to jab it down into some kind of order actually you know that hairs kinda pretty so one thing here is going to be ok the boys are prettier they swooped down on ronnie scotts in a taxi the foyer was charmingly naff it looked like something from a s james bond movie hanging red plush curtains black leather sofas and hundreds of photos of jazz stars on the walls just inside the entrance there was an ordinary business desk and an old white guy wearing clothes like michaels sitting on the arm of the sofa just behind him were a gang of people who had the air of working there sharing jokes they looked like james bond too in jackets turtlenecks and medallions mmm said billie approvingly for her this was swank a tall gangling man was leaning over the desk signing in im a guest actually for some reason he was carrying a single trolley wheel billie nodded at the wheel you play that thing it came off im the bass player he shuffled with humility skinny but with broad shoulders big flat fingers and farah slacks billie teased him bass player youd make more money playing a wheel no bass player ever makes any money the guys on the sofa laughed an older black guy speckles of white in his hair stood up and chuckled specially the way you play jack all jack could do was shrug and smile and escape billie was already one of the gang except for the little old white guy behind the desk standing room only cloakrooms over there he announced billie slaughtered him with a glance isnt anybody going to take a ladys coat billie demanded giving them lessons in manners she shrugged it off to reveal her finery alphonse she had decided to call michael alphonse it amused her to show up on the arm of a certifiable nerd michael felt like an alphonse he took her coat and he geeked his way towards the tiny cloakroom billie looked egregiously resplendent the old black guy strolled towards her you dont have to try that hard here try you call this trying you should see what happens when i try she amused him he ushered her up to the please wait to be seated sign consulted his book and ushered them into the club there were ranks of narrow tables with little lights and brass rails between levels and red tablecloths and old fashioned straw lampshades that michael wanted to call tiffany there were german tourists in long green gabardine coats and trimmed white goatees skinny intense young men with black sweaters a waiter with an eraserhead haircut women with hair as long and heavy as curtains with dusty springfield mascara billie was fascinated everybody looks so sharp for her this was all from the future they were sitting near the stage and the lights spilled over onto her billie strode languidly to the table milking the distance across the floor making sure the satin caught the light they were going to have to share a table three rather large black men looked up less than pleased michael pulled a chair back for billie scraping it too loudly on the floor for which billie admonished him with her eyebrows even though the sound made everyone turn towards her she descended onto the chair as if it were a hereditary throne alphonse was quite a fun character to play playing him gave michael front im alphonse he announced to the guys this is billie im just her foil for the evening we dont sleep together or anything the guys blinked as if swallowing something billie opened her evening bag and flourished a cigarette i dont suppose any of you gentlemen have a light the gentlemen looked at each other uncertainly uh im afraid the club has a no smoking policy a what billie was outraged at least down here in front said one of the guys in glasses exchanging a glance with his bigger friend its bad for you what is this a sanatorium if it aint one kind of prohibition its another they kept talking yes they were musicians yeah they knew some of the band this evening uh well yes theyre pretty good so where do they play hot jazz in this town a guy called dave leaned back in his chair and folded his arms well i dont think there is any theres cool cool whats cool uh after bebop charlie parker billie was fearless youll have to educate me im from daves smile was a little wayward ok he would play along you havent heard of charlie parker she shook her head wheres he from kansas city hmm good town basies from kansas city i toured with him for a while basie swings but then he has my man lester dave cocked a big brown doubtful eye at her this lady knew her stuff but she must be kidding or just out of her mind dave had big broad shoulders and thick thighs and a touch of a potbelly under a fine red woollen sweater just as an aside michael quite fancied him well charlie and dizzy came up with this new style called bebop and then there was this guy miles who was in on the birth of the cool which takes us very speedily to the s s shoot jazz in the fifties billie made it sound like the next century the band came on jack the bass player thunked away happily the singer was a wellknown ella mimic who clearly enunciated her way through a set of very standard tunes to approving undisturbed applause billie groaned doesnt anybody in this town swing we do volunteered another one of the guys in huge unflattering thickrimmed spectacles and only then remembered to check with the others with a sideways glance dave took over again were going someplace later if youd like to come along they ended up in a drinking club downstairs in goodge street billie did no entrance routine there she folded up the stole like it was a sweater and crammed it behind the seat and asked you fellas want a drink michael paid the guy with the spectacles turned out to be called alphonse too so michael and alphonse exchanged sympathies for the name bill john richard anything i said mum why alphonse she said it was because it was her cousins name alphonse had a cold he sniffed and pushed his spectacles further up his nose he looked at billie at the bar and leaned forward to michael and asked how for real is she michael said get her to sing and youll be surprised how real alphonse said to billie he says ive got to hear you sing does he now well i think we all do said dave smiling wickedly they suggested lady sings the blues whats that i dont sing the blues no i want to have some good times well you tell us what songs you know and ill see if we can play them they settled on miss brown to you alphonse played piano and the piano was vacant it was vacant mainly because there really wasnt room to sit behind it so alphonse played standing up wedged against the slightly peeling red paint billie started to sing in a thin rough voice with a timbre like a trumpet their faces fell and kept on settling billie snapped her fingers she swayed in place she nodded appreciatively when alphonse took over and said yes yes yes while he played billie did everything that was naff and oldfashioned but it was somehow indisputably the real thing dave and a brazilian called jorge looked at each other and shook their heads startled amused and slightly beside themselves the band from ronnie scotts came in to much shaking of hands dave swivelled all his attention on to them there was laughing about the nights set scornful dismissal of a colleague who hadnt shown up a reference to daves domestic situation everything that could help make michael feel spare billie sizzled back to the table ready to snap up more people alphonse sat next to jack the bass player and started to sparkle his eyes and glasses gleaming it was past michaels bedtime he was in a dive with billie holiday and he kept nodding off he saw the rest of the evening in a series of fast cuts he glimpsed billie back at the table wreathed in smoke barking with laughter he saw billie with eyes shut swaying as al and dave played together billie and dave danced dave looking fat and awkward tried to keep up with a woman who could genuinely do the lindy hop michael looked up at alphonse and said in a voice that sounded like dirty tapeheads im not really up to having a good time alphonse laughed and unsteadily gripped michaels knee you look shattered mate work in the morning michael remembered his watch said am he stood up and murmured excuses billie jumped up and smooched him on the cheek he gave her the keys and explained how they worked and made sure she had the address you take care now she said and sounded like she meant it michael stumbled out into the balmy night air and somehow staggered safely across tottenham court road to the flat very suddenly he was alone in his own bed and wide awake he thought of a potbelly under a red jumper he was very sure that the skin on the stomach would be smooth and warm and the flesh loose and gentle to the touch experimentally he called up dave michael asked him i dont suppose you would ever normally consider sleeping with me dave looked surprised and responded not to be rude but normally no ive got a wife and a girlfriend my time is taken the angel began to look about the flat and wonder how he got there suddenly his hand went to the bridge of his nose knowledge had come to him im he stopped the angel sensed what he was and therefore what billie was that means that she she really is michael nodded yes dave bowed slightly to the miracle suddenly he chuckled as if surprised by something smiling he sat down next to michael and reached up and pulled off the sweater the real miracle was not that the angels had physical presence the real miracle was that no matter who they were they wanted michael michael looked at the swollen belly covered in tight curls and remembered the clunking way dave danced it sometimes happens that when you see the body desire burns away like a fog michael remembered who he had spent the evening actually talking to he remembered glasses and the coincidence of nicknames and a hand on his knee he called up alphonse alphonse smiled sweetly and evidently did not need a miracle to make him say yes there was no potbelly under his jumper michael did have a good time after all within his limits billie trawled her way back at breakfast time michael was downing repeated cups of coffee in an effort to jolt himself awake billie was listless dragging her stole across the carpet michael told her go sit in the sitting room its more comfortable you want a cup of coffee tame somehow she turned and went into the front room with its sofas and bay window and she slumped staring worse for wear huh he said trying to keep his own pecker up she shook her head its not that she said and accepted the coffee we all went back to daves place and they played me this stuff she shook her head again and sipped the coffee man i heard metronomes with more swing than that stuff what did they call it hip hop drumnbass drumnbass man i mean we had technology we got mikes we used it to make music more human the mike meant you didnt have to shout at a song and deafen it you could seduce it make it relax and start talking to you i mean that stuff dont even have songs it just goes tick tick tick as fast as it can there aint any time even for a tock she rubbed her eyes in the future billie holiday said there will be no such thing as swing michael heard sadness in her voice and sat next to her her eyes didnt blink its all gone my whole world my music there are no little clubs like i remember the life isnt there even the black folksve got their mortgage in the morning they all think im just playacting for a while they dont know im stuck in it up to my knees billie looked up at michael guess what im saying is easy theyre all dead prez bean fletcher were just stuff in the history books that a few professors play michael put an arm around her everybody plays you billie anyone who likes music at all plays you big deal im talking about how a whole world can die she sighed and patted his leg i get fragile sometimes i get fragile and i slump back or i get high you got anything other than hootch michael shook his head no good boy keep it that way for mama that stuff kills billie sighed again i would like to think that this had some kind of point if i did sleep with you what else would you learn i think id be like one of those standard tunes that you first have to teach to be still before you can teach it to swing thats what she did she kissed him as if he were a microphone to amplify and quieten at the same time he lazed in her grasp kissed her beautiful breasts let himself be played nothing much happened except that it was happy and sad at the same time even the way she made love was oldfashioned no biting of nipples no women on top when michael didnt get erect she just shrugged between the booze and the scag baby half the men ive been with couldnt get it up and in the end this is what they wanted just this human touch her fingernails traced something on his chest like a childs drawing i mean that is what this is all about baby people want love i think i find it sometimes but then it always seems to go away again i get mean or worse i turn into a doormat and eat my heart out for some worthless slicker the hands suddenly seemed seized and she looked up thats what i dont understand men and women theyre no different they both want love so why do you take it this miracle of yours take what substitutes the quick fix hell opium is a better deal i mean if i were you i would go tell god to go monkey with somebody elses life how is it that you men are so easily fooled her eyes were outraged she pulled back from him what is it billie her head was doing quick little sideways shakes rejecting something fighting her way through it that look on a tricks face when hes had a fourteenyearold girl and shes hated every second of it but shes just kept smiling and smiling because shes scared and her mama needs the money she been dry through the whole thing and he sure as hell knows what that means but he puts on his socks that his wife washes for him and you know he looks perky he looks pleased he looks like hes just had something real special and sweet from that young girl billie slumped back shaking her head now a slower gesture of stupefaction why are you fooled baby why are men fooled by whores we hate you sons of bitches michael was saddened do you want to go now yes now billie stood up as if her joints were aching her eyes were desolate suddenly she was back in her polkadot dress as if it were a home or a bad habit her history michael saw was always dragging her down behind the beat anything i can do for you before you go her mouth did a disparaging downward turn that was also somehow amused you keep talking about angels when i was a little girl i always wanted to see an angel there was a swelling in michaels heart that seemed to flower out into the world there was a crackling sound in the air as if roots were growing in speededup time the air in the room blossomed petals of light unfurled in the centre of them stood henry the unfurling continued wings rose up behind henrys back silver and fleecy henry wore a s dinner jacket and on his arm ready was the silver fox fur im just your foil for the evening said henry billie dipped slightly calm smoothing her round high brow she did her downward smile pleased and gracious in december of billie played downtown in a club called cafe society her new style transfixed the presidents son and white society ladies who had married for money in she recorded a draggy song with the cafe society orchestra about a lynching columbia had refused to record it in britain the bbc banned it nevertheless the first time the world heard strange fruit it ground to a halt my stole please lady day asked the angel henry held it up for her and she slipped delicately backwards into it henry said ill take you to where the band is playing the two of them walked arm in arm towards michaels wall he could see them walking well into the distance beyond the wall could he hear an orchestra he saw billie laugh and place her head briefly against her escorts shoulder girlish and ladylike she did a little skip of joy and told a joke that made the angel laugh do blondes have more fun so michael finally went out and had some fun there really was on the face of it nothing else to do he got his final marks for the first year of his degree in computer science and they were surprisingly bad a per cent overall despite his hours of programming michael had not performed well on the final i dont have the time to study michael realized suddenly he knew that he wouldnt start the second year in september it was as simple as that as simple as a flower opening it didnt even feel as if he had made a decision he felt relieved by the simplification of his life he had other things to do michael called up the entire new zealand all blacks rugby team they looked so big and beautiful from a distance up close they were bulky and hairy and brokentoothed michael pulled down one pair of black shorts to reveal a round hard tummy and perfectly ordinary white genitalia michael knelt in front of them the favour was returned theyre kinda sweet said the player in mild surprise its not that bad michael called up a famous maori player as broad as he was tall the maoris eyes glittered with something between rage and panic he kept jumping the miracle spooked him desire was an affront michael assured him that all would be kept secret that no one would ever know in practice the maori was far more passionately accepting than his teammate had been to michaels surprise the warrior presented himself face down on the bed crowned with a viagra headache michael prised open the boulder buttocks and pushed himself inside it was like fucking a turtle the brown back was sectioned with so many muscles it looked like a shell in patterns the body was not used to being penetrated the sphincter clenched and squeezed this had an unfortunate effect of trapping blood in michaels cock making it bigger the drag of inner wall across the head of the penis made michael gasp the maoris face was contorted in pain and suddenly in one lunge he extruded michaels dick michael came while being pushed backwards the maori left michael with a quick postcoital word maori men dont sleep with each other it messes us up we sleep with white guys and there is less contention thanks the angel gave michael a hearty athletic slap and rolled to his feet his air of expectation left michael no option but to fade him out it was a madness of the spirit to call up harry houdini michael had seen a nearly nude photograph of him in a review of a new biography houdini had loved his mother and loved being photographed wearing as few clothes as the law of his day allowed the body in the photographs was without fat in a way that modern bodies never are despite the rounded muscles houdini looked malnourished pale and as hard as polished marble michael called him and houdini somersaulted into michaels sitting room wearing baggy bloomers he smelled of the past sweat hair oil and sauerkraut houdini pulled down his bloomers and begged photograph me photograph me the genitals were lost in a tangle of fur and looked unused michael coaxed him to the sofa michael touched his chiselled chest no no it was all too awful he could not contemplate it though he writhed in michaels grasp with the thrill of being exposed all houdini wanted was to be stripped and bound and photographed it was a bit cruel but michael explained to him in halting german that he could never be photographed then michael sent him back to his mother michaels greatest mistake was great indeed he conjured up alexander the great on a wet sunday afternoon it was just after a phone call from philip philip hadnt found a place to live yet would michael mind keeping his things a while longer michael now wanted nothing more than for every trace of philip to be gone from his life ive bought a whole new set of crocks michael said i need the space ill put yours in the basement ok yes all right thank you said philip and his voice still chimed take care of me protect me could you pack them carefully i mean it would be great if i could just come and collect them and they were all packed come and pack them yourself said michael i wont break anything philip but i do have other things to do the call left him shaken and annoyed no doubt they both wished their old lives could evaporate painlessly it wasnt going to be like that michael found himself reaching for the whiskey bottle he stopped himself no michael those are the old days energized by anger he did the craziest thing he could think of years before he had read in floods of tears the persian boy mary renaults novel as if tearing the reality of the london flat and his old life into tiny pieces of paper michael reached down in time for alexander the great he could feel time its depth and chill as if he were reaching down the air vents of a sevenstorey underground city he could feel its dank breath on his face the london air in his flat rumbled and rolled back like a giant stone in a tunnel passageway something tiny and hard and alien thrust itself into his sitting room its eyes were wide and staring it wore a crown of green and its skin was a battered polished brown like an insects shall for just a moment michael thought he had called up a martian by mistake then he blinked and the thing came into focus as a human being the crown was blonde hair filthy and in spikes the shell was leather armour the saucer eyes still stared alexander moved like a lizard in swift halting gestures michael almost expected him to flicker a serpent tongue he demanded something in a high harsh voice that reminded michael of dried and broken grass when michael didnt answer alexander strode to the window and looked out a car sighed past below it was alexander who honked like a horn in amazement and his head jerked upwards looking at the top of university senate house towering high alexander turned glanced once at the ceiling marched towards michael wrenched michaels arm behind his back and pressed a sword against his throat alexander barked at him again like a dog with its vocal cords cut the stench from the mouth was appalling rotten teeth rotten meat and bad wine michael backed away beginning to babble in terror alexander the great sniffed him or rather the smell of soap and deodorant perhaps it was the scent that stopped him killing michael nothing so flowery could be a threat alexander pushed him away and strode out into the hallway he saw the front door ill open it for you said michael alexander the great knew nothing of doors or locks he fumbled at the handle and its tiny knob for only a second or two and before michael could do anything else he had jumped back and raised a horny sandalled foot alexander kicked twice at the lock the door could only open inwards which meant alexander had to shatter the lintel he did it with the third kick peeling back most of the frame around the door and springing the hinge mounts free alexander made a grave cry of triumph and shouldered his way through the gap michael was left panting he thought of elderly neighbours being pushed out of the way by a drunk mad ancient macedonian and he whispered alexander down to his own world as if the doorway had blinked the door and lock and hinges were back in place well thought michael at least it puts an inconvenient exboyfriend back into perspective and just this once perhaps a shot of whiskey was not uncalledfor michael remembered his treasured issue of q magazine the one with the nude photographs of terence trent darby as an antidote to alexander michael called him up in the flesh honeycoloured and slim the angel deferred and demurred its not really my thing but do what you like he said amused he smelled of lanolin michael rested his head on the soft belly and rolled his mouth back and forth around the apricotlike head of the angels penis soothing semen out of him that tasted of apricots too michael slept with his cheek still resting on the angels stomach michael had yet more mistakes in him the next weekend he called up the bay city rollers ok they were a thing from michaels youth they were even weedier in the flesh and the clothes all cutoff tartan and pixie collars were more twee than michael remembered they smelled of stale crisps and had spots on their backs and michael sent them packing before they had fully unpacked so he called up two nuba wrestlers from leni riefenstahls photographs they were naked and enormous and frankly had no idea what it was michael wanted to do with them so he sat back and watched them wrestle naked in his sitting room they slammed into each other like bulls their rolls of muscled flesh rearing up and settling back in waves and their elongated penises flying like flags of victory michael conjured up a plumber who had ripped him off andy he was called broadshouldered athletic with cute button eyes he had a numberone cut and he had known michael fancied him andy took advantage andy tore up the bathroom floor and removed the toilet then he disappeared for four weeks michael had to hire a chemical john like it was a camping holiday michael still fancied him when he came back so he let him finish the job and paid him only then did the new toilet back up and flood such was the power of love that michael hired andy to install the new fireplace with its fake gas fire it had a marble pedestal andy had to cut the rug and got the measurement wrong and cut away too much bare s floorboards showed all around the polished stone michael traded the old pedestal for a larger one and paid the difference andy somehow managed to break the replacement in half at this point michael finally sent him packing it was the most terrible abuse of power to make andys angel lower his trousers and take it it was as if the whole homemaintenance misadventure was finally worth it we both get what we want the viagra worked a treat a migraine blurred michaels vision of his own cock plunging in and out of andys sculptured derriere he even had the satisfaction of making andy come when fucked this isnt my usual sort of thing said andy confused michael cooed in his ear maybe not but you liked it do make sure the real andy knows that national geographic had been one of michaels few sources of thrills when he was younger he remembered photographs of bountiful amazonian indians they arrived squat and square with burnished hairless bodies michael finally got to see and touch what had been airbrushed out of the colour spreads the amazonians were amazingly loving and affectionate they rolled over and over with him giggling and teasing and kissing him and pressing their foreheads against his so that they could stare into michaels black eyes they started to sing to him rhythmic huffings and clickings and poppings that somehow expressed both energy and longing when it was time for michael to go to work they refused to release him there was a long protracted ritual of goodbye they clung to his wrists and made elaborate pleading noises they encircled his midriff and pulled him back down among them and gave him a breakfast of love they made him late for the lab michael called up ernest hemingway from a photograph of the old gent in his bathtub proud of the erection that peeked over the top of the tin basin michael preened it and stroked it and found that even after a few minutes conversation ernest hemingway was a black hole of boredom every single hearty thing he said god knows about bulls or fishing or shooting or his war wound or the nurses who tended him struck michael as phoney hemingway really seemed to think that shooting fishing and boxing were what made you a man when not having erections was his real problem then there was the man michael had glimpsed in the changing rooms of the oasis public baths when he was ten years old the man had been blond pale athletic and embarrassed quickly lowering trunks and pulling on underwear he showed up in his swimsuit full of earlyseventies misgivings he kept jumping in michaels embrace nervous uncertain still not really believing that it was legal or decent there was the lead male actor of the old silent film the crowd angelically beautiful and distant and in person blind drunk there was the fruitandvegetable man who in first told michael about the clash then he had seemed an adult all of nineteen years old he had a head of permed hair that looked now like a joke wig and huge beautiful front teeth it was his face michael remembered the slim and rather indifferent body seemed to melt into the sheets but he and michael stayed up late drinking lager playing the pistols the clash the jam the vibrators but they decided finally the buzzcocks were best there was his barber italian and sweet on whom michael had had a crush all through childhood and who to give the adult michael a better blow job pulled out all of his even white false teeth his gleaming toothy smile had been why michael fancied him there was even the porn star brad rodger who looked impossibly beautiful in publicity photos in person he was tiny and slim with a dick that was large only in proportion to the rest of him worst of all he was not to be prejudicial quite the stupidest person michael had ever met i really would like to do some serious roles youre kidding said michael you cant really think youll get into serious acting doing the kind of thing you do i make up all my own dialogue you know i mean i really improve those parts his voice did not rise and fall like a normal voice brad whined like a caricature of the beautiful nasal stars wiped out by talkies like once you know they wanted me to say like oh give it me give it me i mean what kind of line is that michael had to admit it didnt sound particularly original so i changed it to fuck that ass baby fuck it hard i mean you know michael did his best with brad rodger before the viagra side effects began to grind away behind his eyes he looked into brads pale blue blanknesses and decided it was too much like fucking a particularly pretty sheep there was the sweet afghani who had asked him for instructions in the street with unshaven stubble and a slightly baffled air michael had held him in conversation his name was mustafa and he was here studying engineering his home was now rubble his brother had been killed my heart goes out to you for being my friend he said on his forehead was a callus where it habitually touched the prayer rug michael called up mustafas angel and found his only desire was to leave the innocence undisturbed they sat eating chocolates and holding hands and when it came to leave mustafa kissed him on the forehead i love you he managed to say michael was confused do you want to make love mustafa looked surprised then coy if not unpleased oh no no no he said in a gentle voice a bit like a pigeons no we become romantic with each other michael saw in his eyes a pleading i want but if i do it cuts out the heart leave me the heart there had to be somewhere and somehow a way to combine the two the heart and the body you discover two things if you can sleep with anyone the first is that life is bountiful it is more bountiful than an orchard at harvest time more abundant than a pickyourown field of strawberries that stretches beyond the horizon the harvest of human genitalia attached to reasonably goodlooking reasonably behaved people is inexhaustible no matter how completist you are you cannot collect the entire set it grows too quickly there are a halfbillion penises in india alone like a kaleidoscope ever blossoming more and more genitalia more and more beauty unfold at high speed out of the old we walk around blind to prevent ourselves seeing this bounty its vastness diminishes us its availability makes not only ourselves but our love seem arbitrary accidents if we did more than only glimpse it it would drive us mad secondly in contradiction to this you learn how rare attraction is we dont sleep with most people because we would not remotely enjoy sleeping with most people they smell they fart they occupy our space all the things people we love do and which make us leave them in the end only we dont understand what these strangers mean their preoccupations are alien to us we are unmoved by the thing that most moves them their genitalia look shrivelled hairy forbidding only sometimes are there exceptions michael thought again of monks and remembered his time in california he had often visited an old spanish mission surrounded by fields and an ancient graveyard it was the only thing in oceanside that a brit would recognize as history and it was shaded and cool in the old storerooms there were exhibits of early california life dummy indians grinding maize a replica of a colonial bureaucrats office the mission had been restored in the s by monks they smiled out of old photographs in the historical exhibition unlike most people in old photographs they looked contemporary you could see who they were they were all in their thirties or forties some plump some slim but they all looked secure satisfied and even merry they looked happy slaving in hot sun while wearing thick woolly robes they sang or joked in photographs posed to demonstrate the robust christian life it seemed unlikely even to michael at sixteen that they could all be quite that goodlooking by accident michael invited them all home it was a thursday evening and he made a party of it the californian monks had come from spain from costa rica from ireland and they sang romantic s songs on the guitars that came with them they made something like sangria with a different name and became boisterous the irishman sang an old love song in a high and wild voice that was only slightly offkey they began to dance arm in arm around his apartment floor until the downstairs neighbours thumped on his door its a religious gathering michael told his neighbours and invited them in the neighbours were polish and rather shy michael knew them only well enough to nod to in passing in the corridor he learned their first names thadd and marta miazga they spoke a strained and cautious english and were overwhelmed by the ten thumping handsome monks who sounded like a jolly tower of babel and who wore robes and sandals and who welcomed them with cries and kisses and resumed their religious songs as if around a campfire at one point mrs miazga slipped out of the flat and returned with more wine at am her husband shyly took the guitar and started to sing good king wenceslas in a tired happy voice michael suddenly saw that he was handsome too and his wife in fact everyone in the world suddenly seemed beautiful finally someone glanced at a watch the miazgas had hatched out of their shyness into a pleased flushed conviviality it is so silly to be neighbours and not know said the wife in a voice like someone drawing a bow across violin strings silly not to know that our neighbour is jolly and pleasant they had become at least potentially friends all the monks gathered round them in the hallway and shook hands and kissed mrs miazga good night they all chorused good night and then were gone silence fell like a curtain michael sipped some wine and considered and called back the irishman the irishman had a mop of strawcoloured hair and a classic profile and milkwhite skin michael felt woozy with sociability wine and a broad and generalized love of the world he popped his viagra and asked the irishman to lie down next to him the irishman tumbled into his arms as naturally as dice his legs crossing over michaels he rested his head on michaels chest and started to talk his name was james he had grown up in clonmel in eire from the way he described it the town was almost medieval a big spanishlooking church by a river peasants weekend markets horsecarts in the streets cattle fairs like other children he had swum in the river toppled outhouses stolen and smoked cigarettes and attended mass then he had fallen in love with god he wanted to be dedicated to god half asleep he used the word married then his neck arched upwards yearning and michael kissed him the young monk kissed like a woman almost chastely shyly he ducked away like a nervous horse waiting for the viagra to take effect michael asked him questions yes he had been in love once while still living in clonmel he had fallen in love with a married man a great big fella with a handsome moustache hed go riding past in his plus fours on a bicycle and he was the handsomest thing youd ever seen and he always grinned at me and then he started stopping by to talk and i realized there was this look in his eyes and i thought no it cant be hes a married man either that or he doesnt realize so we did nothing about it and one night i was walking in the moonlight it was a beautiful night and i was just out for a stroll and i heard his bicycle coming brother james is that you he asked and i just said hello georgie my dear because my heart was full he took me off into the hedges i still didnt know for sure what he was going to do until he took my hand scandal had been an everpresent danger they had to pretend hardly to know each other they would meet once a month when george had a good excuse to be away from the farm once they were walking along the road hand in hand when the last thing they expected in the world or at least in clonmel came roaring up the road a motor car its headlights blazed they dived into a ditch and the car roared on past james and george saw the car parked outside the local hotel and heard roars of laughter and decided not to go in ah it would be a great story to tell apparently the driver told it roaring with laughter buying drinks these two fellows he said one of them a monk and they both dived into a ditch maybe they thought it was the crack of doom the locals knew two men one of them a monk did not walk out together at night the publican and his regulars neither knew nor really cared who the man was likely a substantial citizen but a monk was not exactly a man if he went with other men then he was a monk who was doing the devils work would the monk be having blond hair asked the landlord which earned a roar of steely laughter james was called into the abbots office and the story of the motor car recounted as if it had happened to someone else the abbot said nothing too direct a few of jamess unexplained absences were noted and he was asked in the kindest most helpful way if perhaps he would not be interested in an exciting mission to california so that was the end of george kelly and me james seemed quite cheerful about it at least i got out of clonmel and into all that sunshine they kissed again and the viagra moved into the bed with them james became suddenly demanding and masculine in the street lights michael saw the outline of his lean stomach michael counted the years if james were still alive he would now be over ninety years old james entered him i hope you found someone james i hope the sun and the sea and the health of california urged you to throw off your robes i hope you moved to santa monica and met christopher isherwood and set up a retreat in big sur or that you and one of your brother monks quietly and discreetly tied the knot i hope you played guitar around campfires for many years to come and that your god reciprocated your love or maybe ill wish even you another life in which george kelly goes after you and comes whistling up to the mission over the brow of a california hill i think ill see that and wish it and then ill put you both there somewhere else good night said the monk and kissed him again id like to go home now if i may he went with a sound of a whisper in the air it was two in the morning and michael was left alone the miracle was a wonder but what good was it if it left you alone what good did it do you if it meant you had no one in your life what had billie said people want love henry he asked henry are you there henry naked was suddenly at the foot of the bed his wings folding shut henry michael began shyly henry could there be two of you henry rested his chin on his hands tossed the tousle of his hair away from his face there already are he replied me and the one asleep with philip well if there are could one of them live with me too it wasnt a handsome face but it was a good face and it widened in sympathy and a kind of amusement you know the answer to that is yes but is that what the miracle is about i dont know what its about and i dont care oh you do care because you know that the universe cant keep twisting itself into new knots just to keep you happy thats why i want it to stop im sick of people who fade out henry smiled youre sick of angels then and what am i michael michael closed his eyes and sighed maybe its time to try your wings said the angel and smiled whos for real in the last days of his marriage to phil as promiscuity took hold michael often went to russell square usually he would be a bit drunk having spent an evening with one of his own few friends the controls would be switched off usually the controls warned michael that what the square contained was dangerous drunk he didnt care in the early nineties the untended shrubbery would be full of groups of men some on their knees others with shorts down it was a curiously generous place where strangers would give their all or what they could a sweet and beautiful black man with liquid eyes would suddenly offer his rear a german tourist would walk you safely home and say good night on the doorstep an israeli soldier as big as schwarzenegger would shake with excitement in your grasp and quickly go through every sexual motion short of coming there were people who wanted to pick someone up and take them home there were people who only wanted to touch a dick with the tips of their fingers and then leave as the nineties progressed the shrubbery was trimmed and the arrival of police cars grew more frequent circles of hardier souls would gather around a small public utility rather like a gas meter or water pump that was camouflaged with a screen of green wooden slats inside those protective walls it could be as crowded as a rushhour tube train once michael found himself wanking off an extremely wellendowed australian while his own penis was flailed with desperate vigour by a japanese tourist who stayed completely zipped in whatever they wanted they all kept russell square in a sealed compartment away from the rest of their lives michael was here because he could not take people back to the flat michaels offer was clear hi i have a boyfriend but were not faithful and im passive and here for safe sex others seemed to say i dont want love love hurts or i am hiv positive and i dont care who i make ill or i am not hiv positive but im pissed and i no longer care for now hiya my name is nick and i play the cello and live at home and i am very slightly crazy enough to be on medication and i am lonely and this makes me feel less alone hello im an american tourist and i come here once every five years and my wife back in the hotel thinks i am out for an evening stroll hi my name is adam and im rich and sixteen and i have a car of my own michaels idea of getting real was to go back to russell square he popped a precautionary viagra and went out he had forgotten that deep thrill of cruising at night it produced a dragging sensation of mingled fear and excitement in his bowels he could hear his own breath and found eyes flicked towards any movement in the darkness like desire itself seeping out of your bones men moved in shadows behind trees a young guy a skinny student in a baseball cap walked past michael stonyeyed you could tell he was a student because the baseball cap looked fake students mostly wanted other students lurking by a tree was what looked like a very short fat italian waiter who stared straight through michael even an old guy in the rolledup sleeves of a striped dress shirt ignored him he had metalframe glasses and flyaway white hair michael began to get worried usually you had to find something you wanted quickly if not you could spend hours circling in the dark past the same men eyeing up the same you in ever decreasing spirals of lust a tall man strolled towards him he would be a bit younger than michael white shirt black trousers a bouncer maybe with a bit of a potbelly his eyes followed michael as he passed and they were blue and his hair was a faded natural blond michael couldnt help but turn his head the man stopped as if jingling change in his pocket michael felt a constriction around his heart and his breathing the man started to walk towards him bingo do you live near here the guy muttered the standard polite introduction he had an irish accent clonmel michael thought in the yellow glare of street lights dappled through leaves he saw a handsome sensible face id live anywhere you wanted me to live replied michael which was true for a moment as they walked home michael kept watching for disappointment in himself or the other but it did not set in the man was a few years younger than he was and pleasantly talkative he looked tired in a worn homely way he smiled tiredly his eyes crinkled and they were a very clear blue his name was chris chris michael repeated in his head so he wouldnt have to ask again chris chris chris managed a pub a quite nice one actually on this side of euston road tended to get the afterwork crowd rather than the usual kings cross lowlife how much further is it chris asked after they had walked only two blocks they always got scared that it would be far or that they couldnt find their way back or that they were being led to a sidestreet mugging chriss eyes shone with relief inside the pleasant apartment in the light his colouring seemed to heighten his eyes went cornflowerblue his hair golden his cheeks pink ive been working all evening and im a bit sweaty would you mind if i had a shower michael caught himself working magic he thought at chris as if he were an angel youve just showered he felt something come up against the wall of reality so michael said of course you can in fact maybe i should too it was considerate but taking a shower is a passionkiller it is difficult to maintain a macho facade when you offer someone a towel in decorator colours it is difficult to hold up the mask of fantasy as you peel off dayold clothes and used knickers that look like blotting paper you are left naked in a less than ideal body in the bedroom chris turned away and stepped out of his clothes cautiously in that hunched and delicate way that makes people look embarrassed he carefully hung his trousers over the back of the chair he had a slight undercoating of fat all over his body produced perhaps by nightly access to beer chris who managed a pub was not one of the great names or bodies of the century michael remembered discretion and hesitancy and withdrew he also remembered that this was not an angel you dont know who he is michael he took his wallet and portfolio and hid them behind books on the shelves then he threw off his clothes and worked his way around chris in the narrow bathroom michael showered quickly giving his bum a quick scrub he did not want to leave chris unobserved in the flat he shouted from behind the shower curtain so um did you close up early tonight he shut off the water and nipped out of the bath chris was waiting for him wanting to talk no this is my normal knockingoff time as it were chris grinned it was his normal knockingoff joke as well but it was enough to make michael smile chris wore his white towel high around his midriff to hide his tummy michael blotted up water and hared after chris and caught up with him in the bedroom id say were both getting a bit wet said chris i hope he wont make jokes like this all night thought michael he blinked back at him from behind his specs feeling owlish he had forgotten to take them off in the shower chris delicately removed them and leaned forward and kissed him chris still tasted of hops he was a tall man and was at his best lying face down his legs and buttocks were still slim unlike his stomach michael had taken the viagra before he went out and it worked triumphantly spiked perhaps by a tickle of fear and uncertainty that had long been missed face down on the bed chris pulled his cheeks apart and michael suddenly wanted to feel himself inside there anxious lest the erection collapse he pushed his way alongside up to and then very suddenly inside chris real flesh to real flesh michael began to pump without a condom michael had to repeat that michael this is real and you are not wearing a condom michael stop he wanted to go on and was suddenly aware that chris would let him this is silly michael said he half hoped chris would say never mind instead chris said after a pause yeah youre right michael pulled out condoms condoms where did he keep condoms now it had been five months since hed used one as he pulled open drawers he felt his erection subside he raced back to the bathroom catching his little toe on the side of the lintel he hopped and hobbled towards his sponge bag and found both condoms and ky cursing under his breath he winced back into the bedroom trying to walk as if he hadnt nearly broken his toe michael glanced nervously at his erection which was now best described as a plumping of penis like a fluffedup pillow it was soft but fatter than normal he tore at the packet with his fingers and then with his teeth and then he remembered where those fingers had been finally the condom was liberated and he checked it and he slid it down his cock and it wasnt until it began to curl inward at the top that he realized hed put it on inside out it would not roll up again he had to pull it off as a whole turn it inside out and try to slip it back on like a pair of stockings chris lay dazed and luxurious with waiting passivity whew said michael his poor little willy wet and limp as if sweaty from too much work chris was covered with golden fur it was very soft to the touch and masked his anus which considering the beauty of most sphincters served only to increase its allure please said chris once sincerely he loved being fucked once michael was inside him chris moved his buttocks quickly back and forth controlling the speed and depth of the thrust then he turned himself over onto his back and raised his legs his blue eyes yearning a simple request michael could do that too from the front he could look into chriss eyes he could kiss him he could arch his back and kiss chriss nipples michael could not come viagra had given him the means but not the ends chris did not mind it was half past midnight before chris finally allowed himself to come and michael out of a mingling of motives pretended to come at the same time as well he faked an orgasm and then chris curled up next to him and placed his face against michaels chest and talked the pub was chriss whole world the only time the job got a bit rough was after a match and people had to wait for a train you had to get a bit tough with them then the worst was when staff started filching drinks it took away all your profit it was such a thoughtless thing to do at the end of the day it was their jobs on the line as well finally you had to fire them there was no alternative thats why he preferred hiring women older women you know they were just more reliable chris wanted to be unburdened he shared an excouncil flat with another guy they werent lovers or anything the guy kept taking things from the fridge which meant chris got home late and found there was nothing to eat michael felt for him and kissed his forehead chris looked up pleased and surprised and they kissed again tasting tongues they paused a moment and then chris decided id like to stay but i prefer my own bed do you mind they got dressed modestly again backs turned towards each other michael still needed to pull on his socks when chris said well thats it then then he said heres my card you can ring me at work if you like his expression was unusual for a man in his thirties it was hopeful he gave a shrug as if to say if you dont you dont thanks he said and something awkward like you have a beautiful cock michaels big heavy door slammed grumpily shut as if annoyed to be woken up in the middle of the night the corridor outside had been newly carpeted michael couldnt hear the retreating footsteps michael pondered the meaning of that business card first time lucky he thought the number of times michael had brought men back how often had any of them left an address what a difference viagra makes eh chris liked being fucked and i could fuck him thats a big difference chris had confused the viagra for genuine sexual interest perhaps even personal interest chris was nice in a way that did not engage michael michael suspected that he was boring chris would want cuddles and blockbuster videos on the telly in front of the sofa and would have even less to say about michaels work than philip but chris had left a business card a business card meant trust it meant that he thought you could ring back and not be an embarrassment he might even be slightly proud of you ringing back the middleaged women he so enjoyed working with might guess and raise an eyebrow he seemed rather nice they might say wishing chris well a steadily maintained smile and a flick of the eyebrow could more or less reply well yes actually he is rather nice guess my luck must have changed has it chris did michael really want an affair with a bar manager on euston road michael could have a love affair with the young rock hudson or steve reeves who played hercules or henry james did michael really want that everyday ordinariness the quick hug the bland wellmeant concern hiya how did it go today do you like him michael michael heard the very quiet sound of the batteryoperated clock on the bedside table he didnt know viagra was like impotency you didnt know where it stopped and you began if michael had really been able to fuck someone for hours it would mean something it would mean that the heart and body were both engaged chris had a right not to be misled he had dilated like his arse opened up and welcomed and taken a risk michael couldnt trust his body to tell him anything all he could do was take a gamble a flutter the english called it a flutter of wings of the pulse of the heart he could call chriss work now and leave a message it would be there when he arrived in the morning quick michael before you lose the card and it drifts out of existence as surely as if it had come from an angel hello youve reached the milliners arms thirtyseven euston road theres nobody here right now but if youd like to leave a message chriss voice well get back to you beep beep beep beep hi um this is a message for chris from michael your card was not wasted can you call me at they went to a movie together it was an american blockbuster with a soundtrack of wailing irish pipes halfway through it the american heroine got real and danced a jig with downhome irish who were just so authentic because they were poor and unselfconscious chris was outraged its the bloody americans being more irish than the irish again why do they always show us like that like were all fucking leprechauns and cant go to the supermarket without dancing a jig they went to a pizza express and michael confirmed that chris was a man without ambition he talked about fridge freezers and plumbing he talked about his mum moving in with his sister michaels heart went out to him because he knew that this was a man who wanted to set up a home with someone chris probably saw that i thought i might like to go to india when ive saved up enough he said a gesture towards the exotic he still looked hopeful michael wanted to say something clever and a bit acid like travel narrows the mind there was an awkwardness in the conversation where the laughs should have been unambitious people want comfort and fun a bit of a laugh michael didnt do bits of laughs maybe im the boring one he thought he dredged deep to find something amusing to say he came up with his nest of stories about the sacramento river delta his hilarious boating holiday with his dad the story got interrupted because chris wanted to know more about shopping malls and california dope the story got going again and michael told him how they had boated off and forgot the dog on a country dock chris failed to see any humour the poor thing he said wait a second we came back and saw a pooch running up and down the dock and dad said gosh that looks just like peaches the pooch and i said dad that is peaches the pooch she was desperate then wasnt she yeah well there was this sorta moment when we both realized what had happened i stuck my head out of the cabin and called peaches thinking shed be on deck but it was the pooch on the dock that barked at me chris tutted and shook his head awww he said michael persevered he and dad had dropped anchor out in the middle of the river the next morning was the lowest tide of the year they woke up to find themselves miles from land on a mud flat that reached the horizon the boat was sinking in it it leaned to one side and the kitchen cupboard sprang open and all these tins spilled out and rolled all over the place like bowling balls anyway peaches started running round and round the deck and we couldnt figure out why and suddenly i said dad she needs to go for a walk well she was a poor little thing then wasnt she why take her with you on a houseboat couldnt you have left her with friends michael relented you know most people find this story funny i dont know many funny stories and this is my effort to like be amusing thank you said chris perfectly seriously michael took a deep breath yeah youre welcome anyway the dog cant take it any more and suddenly she just jumps off the deck and jumps into the marsh and she disappears she just completely sinks into the mud chris covered his mouth oh my god what did you do michael was still waiting for laughs i jumped in after her and i sank too bubbles of marsh gas had tickled his feet and smelled like farts michael reached into the ooze and pulled poor peaches out they both emerged stinking with no way to wash chris reacted as if michael was describing a friends death from cancer anyway dad said youre not coming onto my boat i mean we smelled like a sewer and so we climbed into the dinghy and just sat there oh it sounds disgusting said chris actually i still find it kind of funny oh i was telling it as a joke were you i was thinking it didnt sound too funny at the time being banished by your dad i wasnt being banished i mean i couldnt go on board that was all sorry so much for telling jokes actually i was bloody angry said michael and that made chris laugh id have fucking laid one on him oh no you wouldnt not if you saw my dad my dad was a really big guy in fact he was a marine which is why we lived where we lived near camp pendleton no he was a really big man he sounds fanciable your father do you think you could introduce us and michael heard himself say i did fancy him actually yup there you go chriss face froze michael kept on like it was a funny story it was some kind of revenge for the funny story part of chris made him angry well i didnt see him a lot he never felt like my father and he was built like whatever and he was really handsome and competent and smart and i just fell in love and one night i made a pass at him chris went rather still what did he do michael smiled he went berserk he rang my mom chris saw the humour he chuckled that sounds awful that sounds beyond awful michael didnt it was a laugh riot im im sorry i shouldnt laugh but it does sound like some kind of living end that and more im impotent chris last night was a fake it was a pill it was viagra chris looked suddenly dark it still seemed pretty good there was something else he needed to see do you want to see my father do you want to see how goodlooking he really was chris began to look troubled he sulked a bit his hot date had turned out to be a flake you have a photograph more than that turn and look at the mens room door and in a second hell come through it wearing nothing but those swimming trunks he wore all that summer boating holiday turn around chris look now the doors swung open and out came a man wearing surfer shorts the shorts were blue with a halfinch band of white around every edge he was tall and square at the same time with shoulders like volleyballs and a bare chest that seemed to support breasts and a collarbone that was parallel to the floor stretching his trunk wide he had a face a bit like a more thickset latin gregory peck decent almost wise the eyes were absolutely black darker even than michaels the crew cut was savage unflattering the thighs and calves were a particular feature this was a big man who could sprint marine staff sergeant louis blasco eventually made master sergeant the last two years michael knew him staff sergeant blasco paused looked confused as if hed lost his way drugs you would think a man wearing nothing but swimming trunks stumbles out of a toilet and looks confused conversation in the restaurant settled in a hush like the surf on oceanside beach ok dad michael toyed with the idea of making his father drop his shorts to avenge himself so that big uncircumcised american head could show itself so michael could see it again michael said hes dead now actually he made his father march quickly out of the restaurant back home michael called up henry his angel sat at the foot of the bed henry it didnt work what happened the same thing that always happens i sent him away ive spent all my life sending people away i told him something ive never told anyone else ah said henry and sat back it just came bubbling out of me i was mad at him and i just suddenly heard myself say it what did you say to him michael michael felt a rush as if he were in aeroplane and it was taking off i told him something about my father something youve never told anyone else henry took hold of michaels hand and coaxed him by rubbing it michael just nodded he let go of his breath hed been holding it without realizing maybe the times finally come why dont you tell me the angel asked so finally michael did whats eating michael blasco at twelve years old michael believed in love he believed that love was the natural state if you were out of love then through a kind of natural gravity you would roll back into it michael believed that some day he would roll home home was probably romford though mum still sounded like she was from sheffield michael was a mystery to his mother his underwear was going crisp and no one had ever told mum about wet dreams she accused him of masturbation and knocked on the door of the toilet when he read comics demanding what are you doing in there michaels puberty had been more traumatic for her than for him michaels visits to california became an escape to another world of beaches and palm trees coming back every two years was like visiting another self this self was called mikey or when he got older mike mike had his own room which was full of things neat things his dad had bought him boy things they were just where he left them well almost his dad had maybe moved the boy things forward to kind of emphasize them the baseball glove the swiss army knife the bicyclerepair tools michael would come back at twelve or fourteen to find all of mikeys old things there he could sit up late at night and read his old x men comics sometimes there was a sense of homecoming hiya how ya doing his california self would say perking up after two years without being used sometimes michael would settle into mike as if he were a sofa other times he was a bit frosty with his old self at sixteen his lip curled x men youre still into x men oh god theyre terrible michael would play his old records his first love had been mark bolan and trex and then glistering with makeup dear old bowie this could cause some tension with his father dad thought rock music was socially destructive he had few records himself staff sergeant blasco owned the sound of music and my fair lady in a strange convoluted way this was to do with his latin background the blasco family had been in california for years and were thoroughly americanized that meant the catholic league of decency and that meant family entertainment at ten at twelve michael heard and learned to love camelot and mary poppins while other twelveyearold kids were buying grand funk railroad michael was seeking out the original cast recording of cinderella michael played cinderella year in year out at twelve at fourteen even at sixteen maybe it was the link with england or maybe it was identification in julie andrews had been twentytwo the same age as elvis presley polished operatic oldfashioned she may have been but everything she did crackled with a youthful energy that made michael bounce it was a feminine energy something he could identify with and this cinderella was like him stuck powerless and dreaming in a family that didnt quite work there was one song about sitting in your own little corner and dreaming of adventure and that was what michael was doing there was magic and michael always loved magic cinderella insisted on it impossible things happened every day and there was the soppy song about love which michael was ashamed of loving back it was a song of disbelief that the one we love is so beautiful every year his father would greet him at the airport with a great bear hug hey mikey hows it going fine thanks dad michael would be pressed up against the tshirted pectorals and surrounded by the melonlike arms michael would look up to see something like his own face as he wanted to be his father had a thick neck it went straight down from his ears his square jaw never seemed to need shaving mirror shades laconically rotating chewing gum and a brutal crew cut all added up to the desired image this was one tough hombre michael would be both agog and dismayed buffeted by alternative breakers of admiration and selfdenigration how could he ever hope to match his father dad looked like someone who starred in police thrillers he wore grey tshirts with afl logos the tops of his fathers bare feet were always coated in sand from surfing jogging or volleyball michaels dad played basketball with the latino kids on the beach he jogged from the camp to the power station beyond carlsbad and back he played touch football nearly incessantly every part of his body from his cheekbones to his feet was bronzed lean rounded veined and gritty he looked like michaels more popular older brother when michael was ten his dad was senior drill at boot camp in san diego staff sergeant blasco spent his days barking orders at intimidated new recruits michael sometimes watched from the back of the drill hall tiger tiger kill kill the recruits would bellow in unison we break em down to build em up his father said once on the drive back home michaels first two experimental weeks in america were spent in the top floor of a duplex near san diego airport you see mikey if there ever is a war then those guys wont have time to think we dont want them to think we want them to do so we have to rehearse everything so much that they just do it automatically thats why we do all that animal stuff i dont want you to be embarrassed by it all that animal imagery is real important to the psychology michael sat looking at the billboards on the roadside feeling pale and weedy his father wanted high spirits so what animal are you mikey i dont know probably a chicken oh man we gotta do something about that sometimes staff sergeant blasco was more like a mom hed say mike was looking kinda pale was he getting out he was looking thin maybe hed like to stop and get something to eat hed slap michaels back to get an idea of its fleshiness didnt mikes mom feed him anything we gotta get you out on that beach what sport you doing these days mikey michael dreaded that question just the question alone made him feel cold and shivery and skinny um snooker thats something like billiards california sunlight made michael squint uhhuh his father would say without commitment snooker sounds cool listen i know you have a lot of studying to do in england but now that youre here maybe youd like to join in with some of the stuff thats going on in san diego i know you dont play basketball or any of that stuff but theres a sailing club tennis all kinds of stuff some of the ncos have set up a kind of sports club for the kids in the camp maybe you should check it out when michael came back at twelve his dad had just been promoted from staff sergeant to gunney he worked in camp pendleton and so they lived in camp accommodation a regulation bungalow with a regulation yard dad would have the guys in to watch the game or he would host a staff barbecue or there would be a sailing club annual accounts meeting marines with wives from manila or topeka would mingle in a tiny condo without a single book to talk a mix of baseball statistics camp politics shopping tips and the latest model cars sometimes they talked movies an old guy somebodys granddad asked michael have you seen that movie poseidon adventure yet i thought it could have been better said michael i thought the ship turning upside down would be magic but it wasnt huh huh i love that accent of yours michael hey louis your kid talks better than you do dont i know it louis shouted through the open back door he was grilling hot dogs on the barbecue michael was still trying to talk movies i really like planet of the apes movies yeah my grandson loves those too he gets it all from his mother shes english louis called back dumping chicken wings onto a plate and family history at the same time his calf muscles looked like drumsticks brown and sinewy the old man asked you live in england most of the time michael yes sir that sir was american so you think youll probably be coming over here to live the old mans eyes narrowed and his mouth went thin from expectation this was a trope the little kid from england was now supposed to say oh yes i want to live in america more than anything because there are beaches here and job opportunities and liberty and the constitution and you can go to football games michael was english enough to resist being bullied into unwarranted enthusiasm i might come here i havent really thought about it michael had recently found himself corralled into the camps th of july pageant he had to stand up on a stage in a hall and recite hello my names michael im from england and i want to know more about the declaration of independence at least the kid from chile got to ask about daniel boone the old man took michael seriously the schools here are real good if youre thinking of going to university good colleges around here too michaels father shouted from the kitchen mikes the only guy in the family with any brains what was that exam you took mikey the elevensomething well anyway its like hes a straighta student is that so the old man intoned he didnt have that much time for grades something in michael wanted to twist the knife actually i cant live in california im allergic to sunlight allergic to sunlight the old man cast a look back over his shoulder in case this was new to michaels father what are the symptoms mike i go this strange shade of brown all over it was a joke it was a joke about britain you know we never see the sun so we dont know about tanning unfortunately michael had committed a breach of etiquette you never tell a conservative american a joke without first signalling and confirming that what will follow is a caprice meant only to amuse the grandfather leaned forward serious and concerned i mean strange how dead weird i mean where the sun doesnt hit like under my shorts it stays white and you can see the line where the brown stops the old guy blinked in confusion but does it interfere with your activities sports going to the beach community work oh it doesnt hurt or anything well how does it differ from a tan tan michael said rounding his vowels to terrythomas proportions whots a tan a shivering nervous laugh and the old mans steepled hands moved towards the thin little smile oh haha i getcha there was a long uncomfortable pause and he fought his way to his feet im going to go and see about those wieners michael felt pity then the poor old guy had only been trying to be nice he felt sorry for himself too now he would have to talk baseball statistics he could at least talk to american adults american kids seemed to michael to be unbelievably obnoxious it was like someone had granted them asshole licences that werent revoked until they were twentyfive well at least the sons of marines commanded to play team sports they shouted a lot and could be quite funny unlike their cautious thinlipped watchful parents but the humour was loud often cruel and consisted of set phrases that michael simply didnt understand big man he got money in his hand hey big man whoohoo they roared with laughter hey hes got a mantan man michael could even begin to join in he listened to the radio he watched tv he tried to understand a local dj had an id that rumbled the big man but most of it remained mysterious maybe it all came from going to oceanside high school together stuff they made up in any case he was irredeemably out of it and as michael played baseball basketball volleyball tennis etc only when he came to california ie every two years he was hardly going to win respect on the field one of the kids asked in disbelief are you really sergeant blascos son the kid was big blond lean and spotty despite expensive dental work his face looked like someone had bashed it in with a spade aggressively he drove the hardball into his own mitt breaking in a new glove michael had to concur yes hard to believe huh he squinted into the sun sitting on the bench dreading his turn at bat you got it it must be something to do with how they raise em in england as the summer wore on it got worse the accent was an easy target americans couldnt hear the difference between posh and romfordsheffield and didnt want to i say old man just how did you get to be such a discord ooh rather spastic i believe the term is hey spaz can you get your poop in the pan yet at twelve michael had no defence against this he was small and pale without even trying to he lost his native accent in a protective camouflage of likes you knows sos and i means it worked americans regard their accent as a symptom of strength and virtue they assumed michael had wised up then michael went home at fourteen it was different yet again michaels father had moved into an oceanside condo that looked like something from cape cod it was made of wood and was painted white and blue it had security gates and was on the clifftops right over the beach his father was proud of being so adult i could have stayed at the camp but you see guys who do that and they dont get into the property market til its too late do you like it mikey instead of playing on a team michael ran cross country with his father michael would meet him every day after work at the camp this filled his fathers heart with pride and companionship michael heard his father on the phone sorry sir but unless its urgent i always run with my boy at five pm yes sir from england hes just here for the summer well he beats his old man now sir they used the showers at the camp marines with the bodies of young bulls would stroll idly past stark naked they would murmur politely good afternoon sarge it was as if beautiful horses had learned how to talk afternoon clancy this is my son mike hey guy hows it going real good said mike monkeying about with his accent acting the butch little american helped control michaels eyes they kept veering downwards like world war one aircraft the bobbing heads of the circumcised cocks were framed with girdles of muscle found elsewhere only on classical statuary michael felt something like awe a yearning for both attainment and possession he still could not quite focus on it as lust michael and his father would run out of the camp down the hill to the harbour and from there to oceanside beach as they ran his father talked between breaths in out in talk in out in talk he ran barefoot making scrunching noises in the wet sand that formed the commas and punctuation of his speech fortythree past i think well do it one hour twenty easy yeah ygetting good mike thanks you thought of going serious sometimes could get you a coach maybe theres a military academy in carlsbad i know they get real good sat scores good school uh huh you could go there do this every day michael turned and there was this big tough guy like clint eastwood only for real and he was beaming face shiny and oiled with sweat the gloss on his face reflected sand sunlight blue sky sea just like his huge mirror shades he was beaming at michael so how bout it its hard to keep your voice soft to make it communicate that youre deeply touched when you are breathing to fuel a run and your voice rattles each time your feet thump down onto the sand ill uh think about it ok dad that was all louis wanted his chest seemed to expand and he looked out on the beach as if he had suddenly inherited it we could getcha running real good they would shower together and all of his fathers body was gleaming with sweat the broad back with two bands of muscle either side of the spine the dimpled shoulder blades and the arms as curvaceous as a womans body that was michaels favourite moment his father would dive into the showers as if they were waterfalls in the desert he would rub his face and hands and torso his father loved the water cold afterwards he and michael would go to cafe which served oldfashioned greasy spoon food huge hamburgers peach pie meatloaf and breakfast all day that would be their supper no frozen peas no boiled spinach no wet new potatoes the whole condo smelled of men it smelled of his fathers fellow officers who piled in after a game of football on the beach and then stayed to watch the fight away from their wives the bags of potato chips and empty beer cans would be there the next morning it smelled of his father dad left his laundry until the basket was full he lost track of what sheets were washed and which ones were not each night after their ritual good nights good night mike see ya in the morning guy ok dad see ya michael would settle into a bed that smelled of his father it smelled of aftershave thin acrid sweat talcum powder and liniment for his sprain the sheets steamed pheromones for his father had been spending his nights alone too one night michael deliberately touched his fathers hand it was after all their male things after their run after the showers after their meatloaf and gravy and milkshakes and cherry pie a la mode it was after the chores were done the moving oiling tool cleaning and boiler checks they were putting up new racks in the garage michael passed a drill bit in such a way that he could stroke the palm and fingers of his fathers hand his fathers hand was surprisingly soft and smooth it was like it was made out of tiny satin pillows that someone had warmed by sitting on them that night michael masturbated for the first time his friend ali had told him about it you keep stroking until it shoots out stuff for some reason it had never occurred to him to try just this once he promised himself he felt male full and swaggering with maleness he had spent the day being male he had no real idea what would happen he just kept stoking himself it didnt go very hard but then he didnt really know how hard it should get what he was not remotely expecting was orgasm it was as if he were on some kind of donkey cart with no brakes steering wheel or anything to drive or control it he watched helplessly as it rolled down a hill there was a terrible sense of acceleration of going faster and faster higher and higher and as if in crash a sudden loss of all control and a tumbling fall michael lay stunned and messy and embarrassed he would have to wash he didnt know there would be so much of the stuff or that it seemed to crawl everywhere as if it had a life of its own ill get the sheets dirty and dadll know michael thought he pushed his pj bottoms down with his elbows and kicked them off he didnt want to touch anything with his hands the doorknob became an obstacle it would not turn between his two elbows he gave up and used his hands but they were too slick with semen to turn it would he have to call his dad he decided to sacrifice a sock he stuck his hand into it like a glove puppet and managed to open the door padding out quickly to the bathroom he kept his pj top hanging low he washed his hands for ten minutes and then the sink and the taps several times then he snapped his pj bottoms back on he felt abused orgasm had come as a thumping physical shock that left him a bit weak in the stomach and knees it was as though something that was not himself had temporarily taken over his body it made him feel a bit soiled a bit guilty he told himself i only did it to see what it was like and i wont have to do it again now michael wanted to talk to his dad he could tell his dad about it and his dad could tell him what to expect from sex his dad would be good about it no shock or outrage michael stood outside his fathers open bedroom door his father left the door open in case michael needed him if michael stood in the doorway his father would say mike is there something wrong michael stood and waited he could hear his father breathe a delicate hissing sound that reminded michael of baby rabbits he could smell his fathers breath too sometimes it was stale mostly after hed overdone the exercise and hadnt drunk enough water the sense of his fathers physical presence was overwhelming michael wanted to sleep next to his father he wanted to curl up beside him and smell the big bearlike smell and be cuddled he wanted to have long conversations about life and about the future and what it was to be an adult he even wanted to smell his fathers breath he waited but there was no invitation and he wasnt brave enough to invade he could talk about it in the morning if he still needed to so michael crept back into bed still breathing in the scent of his father and pulled the pillow round and hugged it from the side as if it were his fathers torso and a great heaviness a stillness settled over him like liquid lead was oozing out of every pore he had a dream about melting as if he were wax when michael returned at sixteen it was altogether different first off michael flew on his own from la international to san diego he had to find his own way across the huge airport to a domestic departure lounge he had to carry his own bags onto the runway and leave them on the cart beside the tiny aeroplane while the guy tagged them for him doing all of it unaided made michael feel he had glimpsed what it was like to be an adult it also meant that his father thought he was old enough to handle all that this time michael and his father were the same height hey mike youve grown up guy they hugged in a guy kind of way and patted each other on the back his father had the same battery of teeth the same shaved head ultraviolet radiation may have creased the face a little bit more but that only wreathed the smile more michael pulled back to look at him and was stunned again everything about his father pulled at his heart if michael had seen his father for the first time in a restaurant he wouldnt be able to take his eyes off him if he had wanted a guy for a friend somebody who could teach him about all the tilings he knew he needed to find out somebody who could give him antidork lessons without making him feel like one it would be his father if he wanted a companion someone to share a house with it would be his dad he wanted to spend his life with him and this time at sixteen michael recognized the undertow that pulling for what it was so hows the cross country going mike they need me they want me michael slipped into this new self as if it were a body stocking good man his father slapped his knee so like im in real serious training now sounds good to me his father was being laid back changing gears like he was playing ping pong so like i really need someone to run with and stuff well i was kinda planning on doing what we were doing the last time you were here his father was looking out the window at the distant billboards as if they were passing women if thats ok with you do a beach run every day if thatll do the trick i dont know finally joe cool looked back around at his son it depends on what you want to do we may be looking at getting you some professional coaching michael was brisk id rather run with you dad well maybe but you gotta consider how far you want to take this thing and how well you want to do it maybe we could do both i was uh kinda thinking michael seemed to be hurling towards some kind of decision the sensation was not unlike the acceleration towards orgasm he suddenly sharply knew what he wanted he could see it there was no doubt a couple of hundred still images flickered in his brain them in the apartment together at the beach together chores together breakfasts together im thinking i might go to school here you know college and um work on my running you know maybe be on the team while i study this had never been discussed with his mother michael had just invented it he was betraying his mother to talk in this way to make this offer without her knowledge michael pressed on like a car careening zigzag across a roadway i was thinking it could be uc san diego um i dont think it would be fair to make mom pay and all no no no his father said and seemed to have to stand up in the front seat like he was having to break hard in an emergency michael was perfectly aware that he was offering his father the thing he most wanted in the world so i was kinda thinking i could like you know live with you his father was not looking at billboards any more his father was looking straight ahead youd have to make sure ucsd was good in your subject yeah maybe we could drop into the school now its on our way michael nodded slowly surely as if this were something considered and serious that would be good the chiclets chewing gum stopped clicking his fathers jaw clenched and then he swallowed i would like that a whole bunch he said and then he turned and looked at michael and nodded and smiled a strained tight smile his eyes were impossible to read behind the mirror shades all michael saw in them was his own reflection they stopped at ucsd and wasted an hour michaels flight had got in at pm and it was late to show up on a huge campus and expect to find somebody to answer their questions it took them fifteen minutes to find out where they were supposed to park and another twenty to find the registrars office a woman behind the counter spent another ten minutes showing them on a map where the sciences administration building was the office would close at five this was not his fathers world dad looked like a truck driver ill at ease and dusty the woman behind the counter was stylish black and thin like the duchess of windsor her hair was pulled back and her earrings folded into themselves in stylish swirls and you sir are you enrolling in a class too she asked no thats my son said the marine he had a highschool diploma he was proud pleased to be taken for twenty and insulted all at the same time uh huh ok she said processing information at high speed as the clock hands spun she passed michael booklets and forms in the car roaring back to the camp his father asked what does your mother say about this michael felt the first uncomfortable lurch i havent really said anything about it in fact its all been kind of a spurofthe moment thing in fact i just decided right now at the airport when i saw you again i just knew it was what i wanted to do uh huh his father nodded and the face gripped itself out from under the mirror shades some water started to creep well you know you gotta talk to your mom about it his voice was rough and slurred michael felt the second uncomfortable lurch he didnt want it to mean this much to his dad his dad was supposed to be unapproachable like a fortress his father coughed to clear his throat he started to talk exactly as if he were running short of breath gasping and well need to get you a drivers licence and you know find out about a qual oh shit his father flicked the black stick and the car made a bink bink bink noise and it eased over to the side his father carefully looking behind it went onto the paved shoulder and stopped his father jerked on the handbrake and rested his head against the steering wheel sorry son sorry his fathers voice sounded like it was glued with drying saliva dad dad michael was worried im sorry i fucked up your life im sorry i left your mom shes a great lady and she sure as hell deserved better than me i did the best i could but i messed up he sighed and gathered breath and turned and look at you youre big and smart you grew up so well and its nothing to do with me but im going to make sure that youre not disappointed in me disappointed in you michael was incredulous ah what the hell his father suddenly sounded normal he took off the mirror shades the action made him look older and more fragile like the skin around his eyes was crepe paper and could tear he wiped it with the heels of his hands what say we go get ourselves a burger at the right on said michael and they slapped hands the brute fact was that michael had fallen in love with his father it was a romantic and sexual attachment michael wanted to marry him there is only one word for love and it blurs many dividing lines there was nothing in his fathers manner that could signal to someone who was in the first full flood of love that he did not want the same thing his fathers face softened and went tender as they planned when michael would move in with him he evidently despite everything he said wanted michael to be with him as quickly as possible he offered to move closer to uscd to buy a house instead of a condo asked michael if he wanted a separate place with a face haunted and shadowy and sad his fathers face opened up like a sunflower when michael said no no the whole point was to live together youll need a car we could let you have this one what do i need a car for or would you rather have the jeep your choice dad got excited planning joint trips i never took you to aspen i cant believe that i took all those bimbos and i never took you yosemite alaska theres the john muir trail as long as the length of the trail would be with louis blasco michael wouldnt mind thatll be fabulous said michael his father laughed well take a tent get in the jeep and just take off his fathers hand soared like an aeroplane or theres the sacramento delta man its the size of the mississippi and nobody goes there get us a houseboat just the two of us his fathers eyes shone with love michael could understand it now now he knew that his father had needed tenderness you can train your mind to kill if a silhouette of a soldier flips up out of the corner of your eye you can become adept at breaking the spirit of kids who are only a few years older than your brokenspirited son you can do that and it will only make the need for tenderness worse you drive home alone from camp pendleton every thanksgiving and christmas to be with a big established latin family who all went to university except you you have no one of your own to love except your son who is gone for two years at a time you dont have a grey suit you dont talk like your lawyer brother when you are out of uniform people think you are an illegal immigrant which is why certain white women fuck you you drive home through oceanside california which is full of floozies there are sixteenyearold drugaddicted whores who hang out in the back of gas stations just off the i there are clubs with neon signs that look like theyre from the s with cartoons of women dressed in swimsuits with tails and cat ears all in pink you can buy some women or seduce others because you are latin smoother than most and built like a tank and thats what they want you for either that or the or or bucks and you are strong and you are physical and you are sensual and you are loving and what you see is what you get a woman with liquor on her breath you want a nice girl but you dont want a catholicridden uneducated oldfashioned mexican girl and you dont want a slut of an anglo and you wont get the kind of girls your brothers marry their wives came from good homes spoke spanish with an american accent cooked chicken in chocolate sauce and went on to higher degrees the english girl from sheffield had seemed a perfect way out she had red hair and a kind long fragile face that was ordinary and kinda classy at the same time she was all agog with louis for all the wrong reasons he was a way out for her too god the things michaels mother gave away without realizing she really didnt understand that a marine sergeant would not have a lot of money the upholstering of american life is very difficult for a brit to read an american can have a house in some exoticsounding california town and it can have a swimming pool but that does not mean he is rich his brother may be a lawyer but that does not mean as it assuredly does in britain that he is likely to be from the top social drawer his mothers sexuality had betrayed her spirited but fearful self she married for love but she didnt really want to live as someone with a spanish surname five thousand miles away if she had been braver and less tough if she had moved to southern california with her handsome husband she might have been happy instead she insisted her husband stay in england it was not her way to clean house and pretend to be all glamorous she relaxed into being a housewife and began to look dowdy there was no way he was going to quit the marines and in any event what was he supposed to do in england he had no hold on english culture english life english power so he went back and she did not in a curious way a woman with a child does not need love as badly as a man who has no wife and not much social standing a man like that might need love more maybe a man from a big loving latin family would inherit a great and unused capacity for love and suddenly there is his son his english son a bit stuckup a bit weedy kind of a bookworm but you know that kind of makes his old man proud of him it makes his old man think i can help make somebody who turns out that different from me and i can tell my own mother hey mom i didnt let you down i didnt become no lawyer like my brother and i got divorced but i did one good thing in my life i made my michael and you know mom my michael wants to live with me this guy could go to oxford he could talk with the children of aristocrats hey he doesnt even like southern california but my son wants to live with me all that summer michael and louis made their plans michael would pass his gcses in june the next year and then spend six months studying to take the sat test then michael would apply for a dual passport he began to sign his full name michael louis oliveira blasco using his latin name made michael feel wobbly inside as if he had changed his name to join his father as if indeed they had in some way merged identities it felt as if he were going public as if he were promising someone never to love anyone else he would repeat that new name to himself over and over in a whisper thoughts of his father drove out thoughts of anyone else the beaches of california are not short of handsome men wearing little clothing they had no power to turn michael louis oliveira blascos head or heart the magic of naming echoed what had happened in biological fact michaels ego had melted down and merged with someone elses he had married his father mi macho como teamo there was nothing else in michaels life for over a month love made him numb he and his dad came back from a movie and a slightly beery dinner it was eleven at night eight in the morning in england michael rang home and finally told his mother of his decision and then took everything one step further his father had drunk a bit too much he couldnt handle drink that well he was a bit woozy and his black eyes swam with love michael wanted to kiss him instead he took his hand and said dad ive decided im not going to go back to england his fathers eyes dimmed what do you mean im going to stay here at the end of this summer ill finish high school in oceanside oh man his father let michaels hand drop he covered his head with both hands man oh man he swayed as if under a burden you cant treat your mother like that mike youre too old to give in to emotion like that you got to do the right thing the words were laboured like he was remembering lines from a john wayne script you got to go back home to your mother and well do this thing the right way his face looked bluewhite and blotchy its what i want to do isnt that what you want his father sniffed and moved away from him took a swig from the bottle and as if he had heard michaels unspoken question shook his head no michael went to bed a bit drunk and slept well enough until about am when he suddenly was awake wide awake with the truth as clear as if it were squatting on his chest i love my own father like i should be loving someone my own age michael michael what do you think youre doing there is no one else in the world doing this there isnt even any name for what you are doing you are out there man you are way way out there what are you doing to your mother shes the one whos actually been there all your life shes the one whos done all the paying now just when youre growing up and shes getting old you want to take off and leave her and you want there really was almost no way to say it you want your father you want to settle in with your dad and you want though hes a catholic he was born semicircumcised so the head of his dick always shows and its always clean and before i sleep and when i wake up i think of the head of that cock in my mouth its all i want you have to stop it michael this is crazy go on home at the end of summer and get over it thats all he wants go home and let the whole idea of living with him in america dissolve what are you going to tell him are you going to say dad im a faggot and im in love with you and i want to live with you like a pair of hairdressers no youre not going say that so what the fuck are you going to say youre going to say dad ive changed my mind i dont want to live with a dumb marine ill say ive decided that english universities are better hell pretend thats ok ok with him and hell cough to clear his throat instead of crying and hell put on those mirror shades so i cant see his eyes and when he drives hell thump the steering wheel hard for no reason real great michael superb either way youre going to hurt him aw shit what have you done it was a long time to stay in bed staring at the ceiling michael was not strong he slipped back into reverie he imagined that louis was not his father at all and that they had gone backpacking in the wilds washing in lakes and holding each other at night he imagined them making love imagining trailing his face down his fathers body he masturbated imagining making love to him and mopped up with the tissues he now kept by the bed he fooled himself with imaginings he went to sleep and woke up lulled and soothed with the feeling that it would all be ok somehow michael walked out to the kitchen later in his yfronts with a morning hardon man you look like i feel said dad a remark open to interpretation he reached for the coffeepot youre like me you cant wake up without caffeine flawless unchanging california sunshine came through the windows it would be another beautiful day with oceanside ten degrees cooler than anywhere else michael couldnt even remember why he had been so concerned his dad went to work and michael lay on the bed and masturbated again dreaming of him the dream this time was more direct they were still father and son but no one knew anything they lived together as partners they slept in the same bed and michael swung his bag of books into the car every morning and drove off to uc san diego it took people years to realize what was going on they were shocked at first mom michaels uncles but when they saw it was love they got used to it they grew to understand it was the image of sleeping all night his face cushioned on his fathers breast that made michael come then he got up and looked at the curriculum covered by the sat test and made a list of american textbooks and thought of joining summer school and after that there would be nothing to do except loll on the beach all day dreaming of his father and he would go to the camp and see his father in the nude and run with his father and dream with his father of the life they both wanted to build together driven mad by the imperatives of love michael became sure his father wanted the same thing as they started the run dad slapped michaels butt he looked at michael in the shower and said man what do you call that thing is that a dick it looks like it belongs on a horse man his father walked on the pier with an arm on michaels shoulder he hugged him as they watched television on the sofa the liquid looks of love the hugs the sudden rufflings of his hair the kisses sometimes even on the mouth thrilled michael and warmed his heart and made him dream and convinced him that they were in everything but consummation lovers michael did not imagine even in his daydreams that they would proceed immediately to sex sex would emerge almost as an afterthought almost as a byproduct of complete intimacy they would share meals share showers share food share beds and at some quiet moment foreheads touching they would proceed to make love michael dreamed of the moment that his father would finally say something he imagined it in some detail his father would begin quietly shy it would be no easy thing for a marine to admit that he and he would look down smiling that he loved michael he knew such a thing was a bit unusual but he had seen something in michaels eyes something that at first he wanted not to see michael was romancing he began to be sure from his fathers eyes he was sure from the totally comfortable way that he would sometimes break into terrible campfire songs that he loved him too his father was too shy to say so his father had always been so masculine so conventional it would be hard for anyone to accept let alone a conservative man whose utterly traditional american values were underpinned with an equally unforgiving catholicism the thought came you have to help him michael you cant leave him in doubt itll be easier for you michael youre from the younger generation and then it will be in the open and then it will happen michael began to rehearse how he would do it he would sit and start a serious adult conversation dad he would say lets be honest about this whats happening lets just say it dad you and i well we are every time imagination faltered every time the words the magically correct words would not formulate themselves the right words were like the loch ness monster expected believed in but swimming in the depths michael convinced himself that it was his duty to make the situation clear and all the while love grew stronger michael would deliberately make his bed with his fathers old sheets night after night he would breathe him in michael would take his fathers underwear his swimsuits anything personal and touched by him he would take the swimsuit to bed with him and press it up against his face or he would wear his fathers underpants to feel his genitals cradled where his fathers had been cradled he would wear them secretly all through the day as he drove to ucsd library to see what a university science course really expected you to know it was as if he could feel himself cupped by his father held by the end of those two months everything about his father from his name to his eyes to his hands and feet to the spreckles of his urine on the toilet seat to his dirty knives and forks to his hairs in the hair brush to old photographs of him when he was michaels age to his lettermans jacket to his tight jeans to his loose shorts to his white running socks to the warmth he left behind him on the sofa to his footprints in the sand and the imprint of sand on the bum of his wet swimming shorts to the sand that fell from his feet when he dried them on the landing of the condo everything about him made michael feel loose and shivery could moisten the tip of his penis it became simply an overwhelming instinctual imperative michael needed his father to penetrate him to leave his seed every time his father laughed every time he lightly touched michael every time he wrestled with him out of sheer high spirits and physical boisterousness intertwining arms and necks and legs michael became more convinced his father wanted it too why couldnt either of them say anything youre old dad you come from a religious background youre a big bad marine dad all of that makes it hard for you ill make it easy the words fail because they just say it and that makes it sound weird and strange and its not its just love so why use words all i need to do is come to you dad all i need to do is lie next to you and kiss you and we will be together michael why are you such a coward michael you know its up to you you cant just lie here night after night dreaming of him hearing him in the next room seeing him day in day out seeing him naked seeing the way he looks at you michael you must michael you have to just do it michael just be honest so finally a week before he was due to go back home on september at am having lain awake for four hours michael finally said to himself thats it i cant stand this this has to end it has to end now he kicked off the covers do it michael he stood up im actually doing this he felt the cold cupshaped american doorknob im going to touch you there ill know what its like michael listened as the door clicked open ill finally finally know what a cock is like in my mouth ill finally know what your cock is like i dont want it from anyone other than you can you hear me dad can you hear my feet on the carpet have you lain awake all night thinking of me are you sitting up with a start thinking is that mike youll say naw hes just going to the john he doesnt even know whats going on mikes innocent well im not innocent dad i know what im doing im doing it for both of us we dont need to be afraid we dont need to tell anyone what weve done we can live together father and son youll know when i touch you youll know when we kiss ive just got to do this ill bust wide open if i dont the door hangs open i can smell you i can hear you breathe i stand over you how do i do this you look so sealed in the sheet all wrapped around how do i peel it do i just land next to you will my weight hurt you im not so little now as i used to be do i just lie down on the edge of the bed and kiss you dad help me i dont know what to do maybe youll just keep on sleeping maybe youll never know maybe ill just touch you hold you and you wont notice youll think it was just a dream something not real something that happened another time another place no harm done so michael sits down on the floor and feels the rough fur of the carpet on his bare ass and he reaches in under the sheet and goes up the cool soft thigh and feels the tip of his fathers bigheaded penis and takes it firmly in his grasp everything is still for a minute then michael moves his hand around it over it to feel its sleeping shape at last im touching you im holding it it feels just like i always imagined big and small swollen and soft sweet it feels sweet it feels like it is meant for expressing love suddenly his fathers eyes snap open and glare into his there is no confusion no awakening befuddlement his fathers eyes are hawklike angry watchful and they stare into michaels face it is as if they are made of ice at sea and glow faintly in the dark jesus christ what the fuck are you doing and his father scuttles back from him sergeant blasco crowds himself against the back of the bed what are you doing michael he lunges sideways fumbles with the neck of the lamp and switches it on michael sees the eyes again and thinks oh fuck oh no something seems to be sucking his stomach out through his ass michael knows instantly with horrible shrivelling certainty what the situation is he was wrong he had been wrong about it all but his mouth and another part of his brain carry on try to make the situation change by a miracle by sympathetic magic i was trying to make it easy for you michael feels skinny like a concentrationcamp victim naked with ribs showing through and he is nervously biting both the tip of his index finger and thumb trying to make what easy for me michael his father has pulled up a sheet over his loins he jerks it higher to cover his tits michael starts to blub he cant say it because to say it and see the reaction would be the final end of the dream you were stroking my dick michael his father has gone relentless professional he is trained to seek out problems and hound them make what easy for me michael michael blubs it out now as a confession an admission of error with no hope of making anything right to make love his father thinks he hasnt heard right to make love is that what you said is that what you said to me michael michael nods knowing his whole face has gone as bleary as semen all tears and spit jesus christ his father digs his fingers into his hair and his hair stays upright what you wanted to fuck me it wasnt like that it didnt feel like that it was love no michael whines in an utterly bereft voice suck my dick or what michael can only make a noise all michael can do is haul in enough air and force it through the glue to say i love you his father strides forward on the bed towering over michael big enough to snap him in half his bare shoulders still beautiful youre a faggot youre a fucking little faggot and you touched me you touched me his father is now striking at michaels chest with just the tips of his fingers like a goose attacking with its beak you touched me you fucking little fruit your own father and his father pushes him to the floor michael hits his head on the edge of the open doorway his legs lift up and his smooth bottom and smoochy little anus are visible and this drives his father crazy as if his son were doing this deliberately to lure him get out of here get out of my room you fucking faggot you fucking fairy his father starts to kick him in the butt on the back of his legs michael cant talk dad stop he tries to say but it comes out as a bubble of something he rolls over onto all fours and tries to crawl that sticks his bare hairless ass in the air like a porno photo of a dame in a fuck magazine just get the fuck away from me his father doesnt exactly kick him more like pushes him with his foot michael falls forward and frictionburns his elbow on the rug go on get out michael scurries forward on all fours he manages to run mostly on his feet except for the odd steadying fist on the carpet he scuttles into his room and closes the door he waits fearfully michael begins fully to understand what has happened the dream has collapsed he wont be studying at ucsd he will never live in any house in san diego or carlsbad at least with dad there wont be a garden there wont be skiing in aspen or a walk along the john muir trail he wont become an american citizen he will never be michael louis oliveira blasco hell go back to england will he ever see his father again maybe yes after many years after all this wears away michael tries to think of something sensible to do he does realize that his nakedness infuriates his father he starts to dress in the condo hallway there is blood on the white carpet that will stain he thinks dully he pulls on underwear jeans tshirt gets a towel from the bathroom and drenches it under the tap he kneels and starts scrubbing the carpet at first the stain reminds him of the skids on his own elbows but as he scrubs the stain spreads and the thought comes it will never come out never never and then it looks just like what has happened a terrible bloodied wound that will mean the carpet is never the same never never never he says and he scrubs and then he breaks down his hands go too weak to hold the towel they rise up helplessly and waver like the necks of swans in a mating dance and he sobs and chokes and his father walks out of the bedroom his father has dressed now and he looks at michael with hatred and disgust dont look at me like that michael wails his father has come to do something else he walks into michaels room michael trails after him what is this his father holds up a book of alice in wonderland and throws it down whats this batman a guy in leotards what have you brought in my house huh you fucking fruit were you looking at me were you looking at me in the showers huh huh were you looking at my men did you come every day into the changing room just to watch the men its going to start again his fathers hand jabbing into him i did it to be with you his father stops there is almost sympathy in his face now the anger has somewhere to go his gaze lights on the records what is this huh fuckin cinderella youre the fucking cinderella fucking cinderella and dad works the album back and forth cardboard crinkling until the album snaps dad dont says michael but what he means is dont be this angry dont break us whats this and this all this faggot stuff he starts flinging books and records to the ground dad stop dad has hold of a book and he is tearing its binding down the middle and hes throwing the pages at michael he suddenly wipes all the books off the shelf and he throws the stereo at the wall and it cracks with the sound of plastic breaking he shoves the tv to the floor miraculously only some knobs are broken off you get all this stuff out of my house i dont care where it just goes his father storms out of the room michael goes quiet well michael this is what it is he didnt love you that way and now he doesnt love you at all he knows what you are thats why he never would have loved you the second he found out that youre gay it never would have been any kind of love as soon as he knew who you were how could you be so dumb michael starts to slap himself he slaps himself really hard to wake himself up you stupid fucking little idiot michael growls at himself and cuffs his ears and temples and keeps his fist rolled and punches himself in the face there was only a week to go if hed left it a week he would have got onto the aeroplane gotten over whatever held him he could have come back at eighteen without dad ever knowing michael stands in the middle of the room and looks at the bare light bulb and feels the heaviness again his fingers feel like fishing weights they feel like they could pull the line all the way out of his reel its late he has no energy no tears he might as well finish clearing up michael picks up the broken record you can buy another he puts the books back on the shelf moving as if in a slowmotion study the book torn in half is a veterinary textbook one he was reading for ucsd he might as well leave it torn leave it here he wont have any use for it now he wont be studying at ucsd the stereo is fucked but what does that matter he only uses it when hes here and he may never come back again he turns the tv on and its a latenight italian western claustrophobic voices in studios mismatching lips he goes back to scrubbing the hall carpet listlessly mechanically continually and to some effect michael begins to be aware of a shower running there is a noise coming from it as if there is something terribly wrong with the plumbing he thinks hed better see whats wrong then he thinks if i go to the shower and hes naked hell think ive come for him again the towel has turned pink michael needs to rinse it he goes to the kitchen instead rinses the towel and comes back and recognizes the sound its someone crying dad dad is something wrong dad the door creaks when it opens like in a horror movie the shower is running and something dark is on the floor behind the frosted glass and there is a shredding sound dad dad are you ok dad just say something michael opens the door and his father is slumped on the floor of the shower and hes fully dressed with water running and he has been eating towels big plush california towels the threads of them lie wound all over his black slacks they coat his mouth and make him look a bit like the cookie monster his accusing eyes look up at him dad get up his father grunts and tries to and cant quite get his legs to unfold and michael becomes seriously worried but he cant think of any way of helping that does not involve touching his father his fathers dark eyes warn him do not touch me michael backs away hands raised as if to shield himself mime helplessness display his innocence outside the bathroom door michael starts to pace he paces the hallway and tries to collect his thoughts and cant they scatter away from him like pearls from a broken necklace rolling away down an escalator he cant think of anything to do he decides to pack he will have to leave in the bedroom he takes his shirts out of the closet he cant remember how to fold shirts so they stay flat he remembers how his father and he worked together doing the laundry just that morning washing sorting ironing hey mike i never did this as well by myself when you move in well have the cleanest laundry ever i guess we wont now dad i really should go to bed michael has just about convinced himself that that is all he can do since he cant find his socks or his favourite pair of running shoes then abruptly determined businesslike his father enters the bedroom hes changed into dry clothes a formfitting tshirt and slacks hes still barefoot hes breathing heavily through his nose his lips are pressed shut what time is it in england whats the number what do you mean whot do you mean his father is doing a hatefilled imitation of an english accent im going to ring your mother and let her know what a terrific job she did raising you youre going to tell mom no you are me michael sounds like a scared little boy dont you think she has a right to know are you ashamed michael are you ashamed of what you did yes says michael miserably please dont tell mom you should never do anything youre ashamed of michael its five hours to new york say eight to london his father counts forwards from am itll be eleven in the morning right michael his father backs away into the hallway and walks towards the phone in the kitchen michael follows wretchedly please dad please dont dont do this daddy please his father gets out his tiny khakicoloured pocket diary and starts looking up the number dad please look ill go to a psych ill do anything but please dont tell mom you sure as heck will be going to a psychiatrist dad listens to the dial tone michael remembers shoes he kept outgrowing shoes and his mom on her teachers salary had to find money for shoes they always bought the specials or nearly outofdates in supermarkets her boss told her to smarten up how she dressed when she was teaching but she never buys clothes for herself everything you do has consequences his father says its time to grow up his voice changed hello mavis this is louis no hes not fine if you wanna know hes just done something pretty godawful michael tell your mother what you did michael is sobbing helplessly now and is shaking his head no no he cant even imagine saying the words you start growing up now michael his father holds out the phone like a club no michael is wheedling like hes wet himself in public michael his father is starting to get angry michael howls and covers his face and bolts from the room the gesture is perfectly sincere but michael is also aware of very slightly overplaying it he is offering up the shame and guilt and selfdisgust his father wants him to feel he runs out the front door and down the steps michael michael his father shouts after him michael has forgotten the key and the security gate is locked michael he hears the apartment door slam and feet on the steps the gate and fence are metal poles with something like spikes on the top with crossbars only at the top and bottom michael jumps and hoists himself up his shirt catches and tears he stumbles and kicks and topples forwards hands reaching out to take the blow grit is driven into them and his knee thumps hollowly on the sidewalk he stands up and his knee is weak under him he has to hobble along the sidewalk it runs parallel to the fence and on the other side of the fence his father strolls alongside him on his way back to the condo staircase ill keep it simple michael ill just tell her whats happened i wont make any trouble youll have to face her sooner or later boy and yourself and his father climbs up the staircase to the waiting phone michael hobbles on towards the beach he can hear the sea shushing like a mother to quiet his fears oh man oh man michael says to himself over and over at am there are birds singing somewhere and there is a steely hint of dawn he stomps flatfooted down the steps from the cliffs onto the beach there is no one just security lights blazing in shrubbery street lights the odd light bulb over the driveway into holiday apartments what michael wants to do is flee he wants to slip back into the apartment when his father is at work and pack up his things maybe take some food and not go back to either home he cant stand the thought of being back in either home he just wants to disappear he flings himself down onto a hollow in the sand in the dark hoping that no one can see him the breakers keep pummelling they keep coming back one after another you imagine a little kid in them and he keeps getting knocked over and the kid wonders why they dont stop they pull out for a little while and the little kid thinks oh good its gone i can swim now and then the wave hits him again there is no way this is going to get better everything everything is going to change he saw his mothers long face what is she going to make of this what is he going to tell her she knows i wanted to live with dad now shell know why she probably knows that now right now and shell know that dad will want her to pick up the pieces again it would be hard enough for her to find out im gay but that i was crazy enough to make a pass at my own father that i would be that dumb that sicko of all the guys in the world why your father because hes beautiful michael saw his fathers face his body and the colour of his skin he remembered the smell of him the smell of his mouth the feel of his lips the love the sexual love flooded back in the end losing his father hurt the most or rather losing the dream of him thats why i did it thats why i dreamed myself into a hole i could have shut up not told him lived my little dream for how long michael he would have started to ask you about girlfriends he might have noticed my eyes straying sooner or later something like tonight would have happened michael faced inevitability this was always going to happen he realized from the moment i started making my plans this was waiting for me so it really wouldnt have been any good if id been smarter dad never would have loved me michael started to weep again for that lost dream it had been his life over the last two months and he had no other life to mourn hed already left his old one michael must have fallen asleep in the end suddenly there was sunlight seagulls made exhilarating noises one after another like the bells of many churches there was a paved road along this stretch of beach and all along it old ladies were walking their dogs or businessmen were jogging in grey tracksuits for a moment it was beautiful and then michael remembered he looked at his watch it was what if dad came looking for him michael stood up and started to hobble further down the beach towards carlsbad between carlsbad and oceanside there was a marsh a wildlife reserve with a lagoon and birds the main road raced through the middle of it on a causeway so did the railway on a separate series of bridges if michael slipped under the railway he could hide from the road amid the reeds then maybe about ten oclock he could go and have breakfast at cafe he could pack some stuff and take off well maybe how was he going to take off by bus how much money did he have what was he going to do say hey dad im running away from home can i borrow the car it began to feel like another dream he had developed distaste for dreams he felt exposed naked in the wide expanse of beach and brilliant sunshine he turned off the beach and limped as fast as he could up onto the railway he scanned the road slipping on gravel for any sign of a blue ford he hobbled along the tracks visible all the while from the road finally he saw the pathway under the railroad he skidded down the bank and ducking low scampered under the bridge the lagoon was lined with the backs of expensive homes and the railway there was no road anywhere near it michael squatted on the banks and looked at the insect patterns imprinted on the creamy mud he waited he remembered his dad used to bring him here to look at the birds and spend an hour or two fishing it was always hot and still what do you think of your son now dad michael asked the memory of his fishing father the sun pounded like unrelenting boredom hungry mikey youve still got the price of a huevos rancheros in your pocket in a week you wont just how much of a baby are you michael this is what a fiveyearold does he decides to run away and gets halfway down the block before realizing that he cant cope michael slapped his own face again he had to slap something he was so mad so bereaved so ashamed he couldnt stand it he couldnt stand being inside his own skin he seethed tinder his skin like oil in a joint being roasted in the oven youre not hitting hard enough michael he really slammed himself on the cheek it went numb he picked up a stone and drove it as hard as he could into the centre of his face his nose started to bleed drops of blood dotted his trousers stupid fucking fairy what the stupid fucking hell good does that do he broke down again and started to cry it was late and getting hot and he was sick from hunger bleeding and lack of sleep ten am maybe it was safe to get going a train roared overhead hooting and rocking the track from side to side like a crib michael toyed with the idea of waiting for the next train and walking under it that might even look like an accident the thought of huevos rancheros made him decide he wanted to be around and that made him laugh and snuffle at the same time all ive got to look forward to is a breakfast he strode alongside the tracks perfectly safely into oceanside he climbed up another bank onto a side street and walked among all the whispering ranchstyle homes with their lawns and succulent ground cover being automatically watered michael was watered too he washed the blood off his face he turned up the street to the cafe and went in the back door from the parking lot and the first person he saw in a booth was dad michael thought about turning and running and realized that he didnt have the strength hiya mikey said his father in a voice that seemed to come from far away across a valley have a seat and you thought you were being so smart he knew youd come here all the time michael sat down the booths had tan upholstery and individual jukeboxes at each of the tables they didnt work you been in a fight who did that to you his fathers voice really was different it was higher and more gravelly at the same time his sunglasses were different oldfashioned dark green not mirrored at all michael considered making up a story about how homeless people had chased him and beaten him up but he didnt have the heart for it me he said his own voice was far away too and now he understood why neither of them wanted anyone to hear you you did that to yourself his fathers mouth opened and shut helplessly michael couldnt see his eyes then his father reached across and touched the bridge of michael s nose and made him turn his head his fathers implacable face remained mostly unmoved but the voice shifted down an octave youve broken your nose michael in that gesture michael knew it hadnt gone away the tips of his fathers fingers were soft and cool this guy was his ideal man big masculine kind michael still wanted to marry this guy he wanted to take him in his arms and kiss him and live with him whatever this was it would not go away whatll you have to eat his father said businesslike im not hungry yes you are michael michaels head hung in shame what could he do to make up for it starving himself wouldnt do any good if a broken nose couldnt he asked for a huevos rancheros his father paused at this and seemed to ruminate it seemed to michael he was thinking i thought wed be doing this a lot he pretended to study the menu i uh didnt tell your mother everything i just outlined some of the basics i couldnt say it mikey i just couldnt say it about you he kept looking at the menu the whole time michael felt relief and felt cowardly for being relieved i will tell her after a little while i bet said his father darkly another voice spoke hi whatll it be for you folks the waitress was too old and thin to fit the stereotype but her smile was huge and professional huevos rancheros two big cups of coffee maybe a danish the waitress had picked up on something her smile went rigid and her eyes skidded sideways towards michael there was a bruise across his face now he could feel it and his clothes were torn she looked back at michaels father with suspicion we look like it thought michael for the first time we look like an older faggot and a poor kid hes picked up and is bribing with a meal his ears burned for the first time ever his father asked you wouldnt be able to serve a beer this hour of the morning would you two days later michael was on the aeroplane his mother greeted him wearily at the airport circles under her eyes she was wearing a beige mac in summer it was drizzling a bit she took him in her arms and gave him a hug that was meant to say youre still my son whatever happens welcome home michael what the hug actually said was michael you will never go home home will always be with the man you love and nothing else will ever be the same again the externals of his old life everything he had thought he would escape closed over him as for his father well early to midforties is a bad time in the military if you start slipping your career almost certainly will end they give you courses in making the transition its still too big a shock for many people to go from an ordered environment where people respect each other and work together for common aims to a world in which loneliness and justified suspicion is the basis on which everyone must live their lives dad got taken in by an investment scheme on the salton sea how they reasoned can you ever lose on property look at what happened in palm springs the folks who bought there early doubled even trebled their investment now this is palm springs with water a lake even a salt lake michaels legacy from his dad was an empty plot of land on a named street without a single house on it his father never could handle booze he just couldnt metabolize the stuff quickly nor at fortyeight could he get a job anywhere he tried to stay in shape hung around with floozies more and more sold the condo in oceanside for something right in the heart of where all the whores hung out he drank and whored which on the coast of california almost certainly means he also did drugs he started to get fat he shacked up with a tough little mexican lady this most american of men was continually asked for his passport or identity papers when he passed out on the street people started talking about illegal immigrants finally he moved back to la and tried to set up in his brothers law firm he wore a suit and tried to find something to do accounts sales even typing he had a fight with his brother and thats when he and michaels mother lost touch michaels uncle said hed heard that louis was working as a gardener now in beverly hills a sad case not something we like to talk about really when michael was in his twenties his mother got a letter michaels father had died the family were terribly sorry theyd only found out themselves weeks before theyd collected his ashes from the cremation agency and scattered them on the vast training grounds of camp pendleton they may be sorry but why couldnt they have told us when the service was michaels mother looked baffled michael did not say they didnt want us mom they dont want me they know what happened and you dont michael had a fantasy that lodged in his brain he would return to it even when he lived with phil in their first full hormonal rush of love he returned to it even now when he loved nobody his father hadnt died they made a mistake and misindentified someone elses body and one night michael is at an international biology congress in la and for some reason its raining but there is a bar next door to his hotel michael doesnt know its a gay bar he has no idea he just goes in to escape the unruffled anonymity of the hotel and hes leaning against the bar and something about all these men together big and butch or pretty and merry starts alarm bells ringing hes just beginning to realize what kind of bar it is when a warm tender voice behind him says hello michael he turns and his father is there alive hes still a big man whitehaired and a bit portly now his skin is sallow rather than brown but hes stylish all in black and his eyes sparkle with love and regret hes braver now more willing to accept the truth michael books him into the room next to his in the hotel and what happens next varies slightly according to the scenario so what do you want michael henry waited until long after michael had finished speaking then he crawled up the bed in blue jeans and brown shirt and snuggled up to him you know michael i saw a tv programme once theres a syndrome brothers and sisters who have never seen each other before or fathers and daughters who meet for the first time as adults they often fall in love its how were designed either we go for someone whos totally different from us genetically or we fall in love with someone close to us genetically because its worked before so its not that you were perverse or bizarre or sick or just plain dumb its what people do michael was not to be mollified so why doesnt everyone fall in love with their father henry sighed and kissed him on the forehead it was as if they had been lovers for decades comfortable and relaxed and kind the programme said that what makes the difference is living with them when youre young you have to know them in childhood theres a kind of barrier kicks in then in china they sometimes choose a bride for a baby boy shes a baby girl and they grow up together and almost always they hate the thought of getting married they feel its incest michael lay still so what do i do about it what youre doing now you talk about it you put it behind you michael laid his head on henrys chest anything else you could fall in love with someone henry was smiling at him i tried that it didnt work michaels face must have looked forlorn because henry suddenly looked forlorn too i know it hurts it was late again they had been talking all night and michael need to sleep he looked at henrys face and a phrase came to him guardian he said angel thats right said henry he bundled michael closer to him if i stay the night will you try to sleep hmmm mmmm promised michael and felt himself settle as if sinking into henrys chest it must have been all he needed because in the morning when he woke henry was gone michael went to work the next day feeling bright and happy and alert which was good because there was a lot to do the deadline for the next grant application was looming but there was also the paper he had promised for the congress in america and several offprints that he really should read he had even fallen behind simply signing off invoicing and accounts he and ebru charged at the intray she sorted all the piles of paper into different sections and they went through it letter by letter invoice by invoice he couldnt help hearing a certain note of exasperation in her voice but there was relief as well by the end of the day all her invoices had been signed orders had been approved for stationery feed even capital expenditure in the form of a new statistical software package ebru was happy and joking again she even stayed late to get it all in the post michael stayed late too he got through all of his email even after he got rid of the spam there were still fortysix real messages to be answered he went through his paper intray and threw out all the sales pitches for conferences and courses he bundled up all his journals into his bag to be read he scanned the employment notices from the university in case there was a post coming up ebru stuck her head in through the door my that is a beautiful desk she said it is so nice to see the top of it you should let people see the top of it more often it certainly looks good michael agreed so nice and tidy she said and made a kind of pinching gesture with her fingers that michael did not understand on the thursday night michael got a phone call uh hullo said a voice michael didnt recognize yes hello replied michael cautiously oh that is michael hello long pause sorry this is philip michael how are you philip sounded hesitant wellbehaved and cautious im ok thanks look michael im sorry to bother you are you going to be around this weekend in general yes why exasperation stirred do get on with it phil michael was disoriented this was not like talking to philip at all it was as if he were talking to a particularly diffident stranger who needed to use his loo well weve finally found a place and if it wasnt inconvenient for you i was wondering if i might finally relieve you of all the things ive left cluttering up your flat philip sounded like his father pure surrey there were a hundred questions is it a nice flat where is it how on earth did you afford it neither of you has any money but you dont ask a stranger things like that even if you once were married to him they agreed saturday see you then they said as blandly as possible philip showed up in a white rented van with the real henry they were having a row neither one of them was used to vans or vehicles and they had no idea where or how to park it phil had gone fluttery and shaken oh for gods sake just leave it parked on the pavement outside the door were loading furniture henry looked worn its illegal to park on the pavement well get a ticket so well have to pay the fine im not lugging chests round the block michael was embarrassed and very slightly pleased he leaned into the window hello hi if you leave your emergency lights flashing the police are generally pretty good hello michael said philip looking relieved it was surprisingly good to see him michaels heart warmed instantly and he chuckled how are you phil it was remarkably like seeing family a cousin perhaps oh fine usually hi henry said michael he had to remind himself this henry is not exactly the same one i talk to hes a different copy hiya said this copy of henry and they shook hands there was a sense of loss with this henry michael wanted to ask him do you know that we talk come on in have some tea and just relax for a bit as michael unlocked the door of the flat philip stood like a bunny rabbit holding two paws up against his chest he was scared of what he would feel once he saw the old place michael felt the undertow of the old patterns michael wanted to protect philip and shelter him as if he were a child the old door clunked and groaned in bad temper you wont find much difference philip shivered a little unhappy smile the flat hadnt changed it couldnt change philip looked around at the hall chest still in place and the mirror hanging over it its all just the same thirteen years seemed to whisper around them like the sound of wind philip was remarkably wellbehaved there was a lovely little impressionist portrait philip had bought at a student show i know i bought that picture but it was always meant for the bedroom and it just wont be the same without it michael could see philip wanted the flat to stay the same its up to you phil its your picture i wont mind if you take it youre an artist you should have some pictures well i suppose ill leave you your portrait ok michael grinned this was all a bit painful a philip tolbarte original thatll be worth something some day thanks michael had been good too he had wrapped all of philips family silver in soft blue protective cloth philips big desk had been dismantled into parts for lugging downstairs all his trance dance compilations were crated up in old wooden wine boxes finally all his pictures had been carefully tied into blocks sheets of packing paper between them the fridge the cooker the washing machine were all part philips but he wanted michael to have them there wouldnt be room where they were going he said michael began to hurt for him phil was poor michael wrote out a cheque for half the value of the things new philip hesitated theyre old theyre not worth that much take the cheque said michael playing father philip reluctantly took it take the chairs too philip shook his head no thats all right phil take something youre setting up house youll need them henry said quietly hes right phil the logistics of loading chairs desk paintings and chests full of porcelain gave them all something else to think about they spent half an hour outside in the street trying to find ways to tie everything up so it wouldnt shift or fall henry hated vans but he nipped like a monkey around the furniture tying and securing henry was practical well said phil i think thats everything if i find anything else ill bring it round oh i nearly forgot philip took out an old tesco receipt and wrote his new address on it it was out near south quay on the docklands light railway michael had never even heard of south quay they shook hands outside on the street philips eyes focused into michaels wistfully thanks he said in a whisper michael watched the van go and waved as if they were weekend guests taking leave well that really is that he said aloud to himself upstairs in the flat there was a pale patch on the study wall where a picture had been some of the drawers were empty now that philips desk was gone there was space in the small room for a bed again those were the only signs of philips final departure how could the flat be even more silent this time easy its less full philip really really has gone michael sat on the sofa and sipped a sherry like his mother always did so come on michael he said to himself with his mothers voice do you want him back or not and if you dont why on earth are you sitting around feeling sorry for yourself youve got to decide love you dont want someone real you dont want someone made up well love theres nothing in between so what do you want michael love again thats what i want love you are a person michael had all the discomfort of being a teachers child when he was nine he and his mother even went to the same primary school every morning there would be a harassed routine of cornflakes and bathrooms and shoelaces his mum couldnt afford a car so they took the bus and walked into the playground together michael was in some danger of being bullied when he was smaller once a gang of older boys surrounded him and started pushing him michael looked up and saw his mother turn and walk back into the school clasping her hands in front of her michael understood and was even grateful he would have to cope with this himself so he pushed back michaels good grades were regarded with suspicion his minor misbehaviours were abruptly punished to avoid any accusation of favouritism one teacher mrs podryska who didnt like his mother was not about to do michael any favours and did you do this homework yourself michael she asked in a loud clear voice in front of the rest of the class michael still remembered mrs podryskas pleased little smile saturdays were spent on domestic chores his mother would hum to herself all morning polishing furniture and asking michael to give her a hand with the vacuuming after that she would take michael with her to the supermarket to help carry the bags then michael would have his homework to do and she would sit through it with him come on now michael you know how to divide numbers and no you dont use your calculator you use your head blanched with exhaustion she might watch the television or talk to her sister or her mum on the telephone on sunday after breakfast they would go and visit granny hobart gran lived in a selfcontained flat for old people in royston where michael could watch the tv quietly and again help with the washingup sometimes for a treat they would go to the cinema together at pm again they would take the bus and it would be full of giggling gangs of independent kids who had escaped their mums the quiet time for both of them was sunday morning on sunday morning they had a big breakfast together bacon and eggs and toast and jam they would go through the sunday papers scrunching toast that was how at nine years old michael first saw a photograph of pablo picasso by tradition michael saw the colour supplement first he turned a page and there was a picture of an old man in tight briefs the old man had planted his fists high on either side of his chest which was puffed out as if he were a muscleman he stood on a beach and in the background people wore funny masks all bright colours the old mans head looked like a bullet the eyes were dark and staring merry and challenging at the same time as if he would headbutt you for a joke michael even at nine was forced to acknowledge that something happened when he looked at that photograph he skimmed the rest of the magazine but kept turning back to it surreptitiously michael knew it was somehow wrong that it was a man and somehow even worse that it was an old man but he wanted to keep the picture his mum stood up abruptly from the table you wont forget to wash up now will you love michaels breath went icy mum usually took the supplement into the toilet with her im still reading this mum he said she wasnt bothered ill take the arts instead when she was out of the room michael quietly tore the page out of the magazine he didnt want his mother to know it even existed for the next few weeks while his mother did the laundry or rang up about the broken hoover or shouted at him to get ready for school michael hid in his room and looked at his secret photograph it was embarrassing something you couldnt talk about michael wanted to dance on that beach be part of the parade with umbrellas and people in masks he wanted to be enveloped and hugged in those brown arms he wanted to see what was inside the briefs michael was not the only one many people lusted after pablo picasso even at a time of life when most men are agespotted ghosts of their former sexual selves how can a photograph convey that it was as if it were something that wafted around picasso a miasma of power that seeped even onto film michael at nine would look at the photograph and duck away coyly coyly he would look again at nine his fathers absence was like a grey mist everywhere michael eyed men in the street is my father like him a big breezy romford guy would stroll past wearing a football scarf and michael would think id like to have him for a father michael wanted to sit on picassos lap and snuggle up against that old chest and be held in those arms and feel those bare legs under him sitting on his bed before school looking at the photograph michael realized this is how men look at photos of women this is how girls look at pictures of bobby sherman or the monkees i feel about men the way im supposed to feel about women im the wrong way round im queer this was a shocking thing to realize at nine in you could be called big girls blouse or poof everyone knew what poofs were and they were horrible and everybody laughed at them all the time and he was one of them he was a poof that scared him he was what he was not supposed to be and michael was otherwise a good little boy he put the photograph away and then somehow without meaning to lost it michael forgot about picasso the next year he went to california and he found his dream beach and his dream father alevels and university left him little time for art it was mark the rugbyplaying art dealer who finally kickstarted michaels interest in picasso i once popped in to a little exhibition of his work in the camargue mark told him it was seeing them all together actually that did it for me there was one whole wall of them painting after painting in the most beautiful colours and you began to realize the fantastic productivity of the man late in life michael read the biographies and those demanding sullen eyes began to work their way into him the young picasso was not handsome unlike the unambitious famous people are often not more beautiful in youth the young picasso had a fat face flat greasy hair and a double chin his expression was disgruntled and he was bundled in scarves against the cold he looked older than he would in his forties in his forties picasso posed as a boxer his short arms and legs were rounded enough to imitate muscles he wore baggy briefs that revealed his thighs and chest the cloth was jammed up into his crotch as if to show off his dick which was surprising as objectively speaking he had hardly any dick at all his body at forty when most men are grizzling all over with greying fur was as smooth as a girls his expression was serious and his eyes obviously black thirty years later michael sat and sipped his mothers sherry from nowhere like a bubble rising up from the floor of the sea came a single word picasso before he had time to ask the air of his flat welled up in ripples like muddy water in michaels sitting room was the most sexually powerful man of his time picasso was tiny with a round demanding face blunt nose and black eyes that seemed to pop out of his head he was already balding which in his case simply confirmed his masculine state a thick woollen jacket was thrown over both shoulders and the sleeves were left empty the effect was curiously feminine picasso ignored michael he sauntered in a semicircle around the sitting room his face curdling with bored disapproval he sucked on a cigarette then blew out the smoke personne ne vit la he said michael dragged out his schoolboy french kicking and screaming moi jhabite ici picasso turned a shameless gaze towards him vous vous etes une personne you you are a person michael had the power of creation however and was growing used to it oui je vous ai cree picasso looked genuinely bored moi he said and let the word rest a moment je me suis cree picasso was still scanning the room his eyes flickered at philips portrait of michael as if it gave him an attack of the vapours mon dieu picasso murmured ca a lair davoir etre frit dans de lhuile dolive it looks like its been fried in olive oil like an athletic teenager picasso spun around and flung himself sprawling onto the sofa du vin sil vous plait he said as if to a waiter all right thought michael im up to this im more than up to this from nowhere by magic he called up a small table with an ashtray and a glass and a bottle of wine from years ago the angels mouth made a quick downward turn michael had succeeded in giving pablo picasso a moments pause michael told picasso please use the ashtray michael pressed his advantage you are a copy of a masterpiece he told the angel i am the student who has copied you picasso had already recovered he sniffed and poured himself a glass of wine he had a private little smile and his eyes said be wary student i am more than a match for you michael got the preliminaries out of the way are you willing to make love with a man picasso flicked ash into the tray i would do so if i wanted to destroy him though i am not a destroyer unlike you i am a creator not a copier ultimately i have no time for destruction except perhaps for making sure than no exhibitor would show gilots work after she left you picasso kept smiling undisturbed is that what she said has it occurred to you that she was exhibited only because of me and perhaps her work is not all that good they were negotiating might it interest you to find out how i am able to raise the dead picasso sipped his wine it interests me to be alive again and relatively young he lowered his gaze at michael like a bull lowering his head to charge he took a contemplative sup from his cigarette his eyes appraising michael then he ground out the cigarette stood walked across the room and grabbed hold of michaels face he pushed michaels lips out of shape into a parody of a boucher mouth and he shook michaels jaws i fuck you you never touch me as a woman ever picasso relinquished michaels mouth but kept a hand hovering as if to slap him thats all the same to me said michael the hand was lowered and it unbuttoned the front of picassos trousers and picasso indicated what he wanted michael to do the tiny brown penis was erect straight up and hard against his belly as it was almost every time michael saw it michael knelt and swallowed picasso kept drinking his wine the penis was spicy it reminded michael of nutmeg in its colour and scent picasso grew tired of standing its late we go to bed now said picasso patting michael affectionately on the top of his head picasso claimed michaels side of the bed and snatched up the newspapers and began to read lips moving eyes burning through them je ne peux pas lire langlais facilement traduisez he demanded pushing the papers at michael so michael found himself reading laboriously through british politics in bad french so there was a socialist revolution in britain of a kind they unelected it thirtyfive years later tuh that is why english medicine for warts does not work they have never had a real revolution i hate england the stupidest things about my work are all written in english my friends translate them for me im tired without asking picasso nipped sideways and turned off the light quick as blinking it was dark and picasso had somehow enveloped michael in his tiny arms thick short legs picasso twisted michaels head around and kissed him with a passion that bewildered michael this was a man who basically preferred women his breath was heavy and scented with cloves and he sucked in michaels spittle before michael could quite adjust to being so swept up he was hoisted onto all fours and found himself with no preliminaries cream or tentative gentle penetration being fucked the penis was the right size it was so small and comfortable that michael tightened his arse around it to hold it caress it suddenly impatient picasso unfurled and reared up balancing on the balls of his feet and began to thrust himself in and out of michaels body with a speed michael had never encountered before or even imagined picasso was otherwise silent he came quite quickly and then collapsed michael bewildered had by accident come at the same time into his own hand picasso rolled off him and looked at michael and said if you were a woman i could have really fucked you then he kissed michael on his nose you make a funny creator my friend and just as instantly he was asleep picasso snored loudly and incessantly as if he had an appetite for it as if he claimed space by doing it as if he snored to proclaim his genius he grew suddenly affectionate in his sleep and clamped michael from behind and snored like a camel directly into michaels ear michael fought his way free picasso snorted and then chuckled in his sleep he began to laugh continuously uproariously are you awake michael asked feeling battered picasso grunted and rolled onto michael again his dick was hard and michael was surprised at his own compliance his arse wasnt sore and he made no protest the penis entered him again and this time it was gentle it lapped inside him like waves michael was to discover that the only way to stop picasso snoring was to let himself be screwed and then together like a boat untethered they could drift away together michael woke up and it was still dark and picasso was still inside him and around him picasso had been inside him all night hmm said picasso and began to rock inside him he nuzzled and then chewed michaels ear you are life he said you give me life i will give you life in return and this time the fucking though slow was hard and slamming picassos flat belly thumped into michaels backside the penis went all the way out and all the way back in with one thrust michael began to make noises he had never made before he couldnt stop himself he groaned and grunted and sighed like a bad actress in a porno movie picasso seized hold of his long hair and pulled back hard on it like reins michael came before picasso did whinnying like a horse picasso finished slapped michaels buttocks and hopped out of bed you are dirty wash he said he commandeered michaels kitchen to make coffee michael padded dazed and flushed from the bathroom picasso was wearing a pair of michaels best long grey knickers but he used one of his ties to make a kind of pirate sash around his waist he was so short he had to lunge forward on tiptoe to reach things on top of the counter we will move picasso announced im sorry burbled michael this apartment faces east good but it is low down and has trees in front that block the light and it is too small i cannot paint here we will move michael felt a jumble of feelings no other angel no other man had ever made the decision so quickly and simply to live with him no other man had demanded that michael sell his flat after the first date michael said i like the trees this flat is worth money because it faces a garden humph grunted picasso unimpressed its not that easy i will make it easy picasso turned and his expression surprised michael picasso was smiling affectionately gently and sweetly life is ours the smile said we can do with it what we want it was a smile that promised no harm can come michael found that he would do anything to make that smile continue picasso passed him a tiny cup of what looked like tar you cannot make coffee i can tell he led michael out to the sitting room in front of the bay window it was only just beginning to get light and everything was grey as if wrapped in cushioning plastic they sat at the table in the bay window my friend picasso said you give me life and i am grateful you are like a mother to me you are like a physician who asks only kindness in payment it is easy to be kind that is why i dont trust it but i will be kind to you you are a sweet man so understand i will give you kindness and love but i will want to screw women so i will bring them back dont try to stop me that would make me mad if you are a jealous man that will be a pain in your heart not mine so learn not to be jealous all right picassos own eyes were kind and stroked michaels knee all right agreed michael all right said picasso grinning and slapping his knee so now we look for a new place to live how do we do that i dont know michael admitted when i first came here to live i rented and then they sold it to me for a low price so i dont know how to find houses or get another mortgage picasso tutted you are a child are you poor in spirit to stay here without thinking for how long have you lived here thirteen years you need a new life michael found that the answer was yes it was a trifle we move said picasso he stood up abruptly walked away and came back with heaps of newspapers that looked like an unmade bed he pushed these at michael and growled my baby boy my baby boy needs to grow up it could get awfully tiring living with somebody who went straight to the truth without passing go here they have ads for houses you read the ads i will go get us bread to dunk in the coffee michael began to look everything seemed to start at picasso came back from the shops with croissants he flung the greasespotted bag on the table dunked a croissant in michaels cup and demanded his mouth full you have found somewhere its not that easy and that one there ive already looked picasso seized the newspaper and read out loud in criminal english twobedroom apartment three floor roof garden garden camden town one hundred eighty thousand sounds ok he declared and pushed the billows of newspaper back down onto the table sounds good repeated michael mystified and picked up the newspaper again to look again at the page of ads to make sure it was actually there and try to understand how he could have missed it we have to make an offer quickly if it is a bargain yes i think so but i have to go to work today no you dont no one has to do anything they choose to do it you choose not to work today so that we can buy this apartment im sorry i cant do that hmm picasso looked suddenly worried and concerned and he swallowed my friend he said and took michaels knee again look at me look at me in the eyes i am hungry to paint if i think you are stopping me painting i will go evil do you believe me michael rang in sick picasso sang while he washed up and michael looked at his pay slips and his bank balance and tried to find ads for apartments similar to his own to see how much it might be worth he only earned a year partly from the lab project and partly from teaching the bank would be nervous about the temporary nature of the project but even so he should be able to get a mortgage for about if you called the study a bedroom this was a twobedroom flat one of those in a mansion block around the corner was selling for he could do it he could do it and make money michael looked at the sunlight streaming in through the bay window on the old sandcoloured carpet the old sofa and the old wallpaper there was a butterfly fluttering inside him that made him smile it was time to go it was time to find somewhere new picasso had them down into goodge street tube station by am he breathed in the stench of the trains and strutted up and down the platform taking possession he looked at the posters and beamed i was right he said this is my world i made it he pointed to a poster for fear and loathing in las vegas a computerdistorted johnny depp grimaced out of a field of white amid gerald scarfelike splashes of black that is a photograph yes what did that to a photograph its a computer graphic ordinateur oh shit michael took a deep breath and tried to explain computers in french he knew none of the words he got across the idea that it was a machine that could add and subtract and could turn anything into numbers even images so by changing the numbers you changed the images you can make anything picasso looked impressed they made dinosaurs tuh they did that in king kong these looked real they can make people look real picassos jaw thrust outwards you have one of these ordinateurs i use them at work i also have one at home you have one at home do many people have these things at home yes picasso laughed aloud and did a little dance i am in the future you have brought me into the future my friend his eyes were sparkling the apartment looked unprepossessing it was on a corner over a shoe shop with a battered multilocked door on a side street facing a recently closed exsupermarket picasso rang the buzzer and then shouted up hallo hallo we want to buy your apartment a woman looked out from the top of the wall evidently she was sipping coffee on the roof im sorry but you will have to talk to the estate agent first if you want to see the property she had what might pass for an american accent she did not look at all offended if anything she was rather amused estate agent questce que cest picasso demanded of michael hold on ill be down the woman said michael tutted it is not possible to arrive at peoples apartments at this hour of the morning they heard footsteps the door was opened by a tall woman greyhaired in a bluepatterned kimono she explained estate agents sont agents immobiliers uh estate agents huffed picasso they are only after your money it is us who want to buy your apartment the woman chuckled well ok come in she spoke french and was canadian and her name was mirielle mirielle led them up a staircase that was crammed with bicycles on the landing there was a toilet in a kind of booth that had been jammed against a sloping roof it looked like a set from an early german expressionist movie like the cabinet of dr caligari past more banisters and they were in one huge room one wall was lined with kitchen sink and encrusted cooker two other sides were crowded with bookcases desks and sofas all along one wall arched windows faced east dancing with light picasso was overjoyed he turned and rubbed the top of his head in a circle against michaels chest mirielle led them through a door out onto a flat rooftop lined with big red pots holding giant ferns bamboo and evergreens this is the garden we would sell the plants with the flat do you like gardens he does said picasso and pointed to michael the banisters led up a staircase that smelled of sawdust to two bedrooms one was long and dark with a sloping roof and the other was a garret with another huge window it was full of canvases lined up like cards in an index file picasso rifled through them his cheeks rose up like buns there were goths with facial tattoos cross cut on the same canvas with the backs of turtles magicians in top hats were under the sea but the seabed was an aerial map of new york you are one of my children picasso said oh really chuckled mirielle and what is your name pablo picasso he announced um thought michael that might be a mistake funny said mirielle without missing a beat thats my name too we will buy your flat picasso said airily as if it were nothing for my asking price is anyone else asking now said mirielle we need the estate agent and a glass of wine to celebrate my friend has a bottle said picasso and winked at michael and michael for once was quick on the uptake out came another bottle of yearold wine mirielle looked at its oldfashioned label with its plain black print mis en bouteille it was too perfect so she laughed and brought out glasses i will work here picasso announced to michael i am your new life there was just one problem who would buy michaels flat michael remembered his polish neighbours downstairs the husband had been made redundant and they needed to sell their larger flat with its council tax and ground rent they had a buyer for their place but they had been gazumped on the flat they wanted to buy they had nowhere to move to mr miazga was alone in the apartment still dressed as if for his work a neat grey shirt of some interesting fabric black slacks and black jacket yes yes it would be ideal my wife you see works at the school of eastern european studies which is just near here so she can walk to work that is why we are here in england he had a neat quiet way of walking and talking as if he were continually picking lint from his suit his eyes never quite met yours picasso began to slump and look about the walls and huff shy quiet people made him impatient the miazgas were shy but talented the wife was doing a thesis on the prechristian balkans mr miazga had until recently worked in an architects office as a programmer that means he writes programs uh michael searched for the word in french logiciels mr miazga said with his unfaltering mild smile computers picasso sat up you work on those things well said mr miazga i write the instructions that make them work he glanced sideways at michael how is it that this man has only just heard about computers picasso kept pushing you know how they work you write down the numbers that is one way of putting it yes do you have one you could show me how it works mr miazga did not want to teach this bumptious man anything but he was trapped by his own good manners he avoided answering the architects ask me to use the computer to show our clients how the buildings will look he used the present tense as if he still had a job michael offered compromise why dont you just show us something youve worked on mr miazga showed them a virtual shopping mall that was to be built along the a he guided them down the covered walkway past the pizza shack and ameriburger franchise and into the bowling alley there was the sound of a strike and the clatter of falling pins the father of cubism saw this was the real way to display all sides of an object he leaned forward and irresistibly took control of the mouse he scowled his eyes widened the whites of his black eyes were illuminated like a glass of milk with a light bulb in it mr miazga explained this way the client feels work has begun on his project while the surveyors are still specifying the materials and checking our estimates we have something to show picasso only sniffed he moved forwards and backwards through the design he tried to scamper across the ceiling upside down he could not he chuckled he drove the mouse straight into a wall and through it and he laughed you are god he said you can change the rules it can show what the blueprints will look like corrected mr miazga who detested all overstatement and vulgarity his black suit and designer shirt would have looked better with a huge gold brooch picasso ignored him the artist is the one who makes the space the audience uses it it is much more like life but he slapped his thigh and stood up the power of the artist has not changed it is his world the audience enters thank you mr miazga please would you be able to show me more about how this works certainly if you wish said mr miazga he was beginning to rise you could do it today picasso asked mr miazga faltered he batted his eyelids like an embarrassed girl i i plainly have nothing else to do picasso sat down in his chair excellent excellent you and your wife must come upstairs and have dinner with us tonight is that not so michael indeed michael began there will be a lot to celebrate mr miazga could not help but smile it would indeed be a relief to be able to sell their big flat and move on he nodded in agreement michael you have things to do with banks and lawyers yes michael was beginning to get a bit peeved at being directed all the time picasso looked around at him and suddenly he had a face like a bloodhound doleful eyes and drooping jaws dont you have a lot to do im sorry is it possible that i can help you in any way i dont speak english i am weak in such situations he was apologetic and undeniable no its for me to do it was just that michael wished he were doing the driving it was his money that was buying the flat i will cook picasso announced his eyes dancing again picasso did not cook he concentrated on a complicated sauce involving cream and tomatoes and basil and berries and apple liqueur and butter and a teaspoon of grated onion michael did the shopping michael cooked everything else the boiled potatoes the salad the miazgas rang on the telephone first to tell them they were on their way one floor up remember michael told him you cannot be called pablo picasso everybody in the world knows who pablo picasso is picasso looked like he was picking his teeth after a good meal youll need to be called another name i suggest ruiz michael paused it will be easy to remember it is my fathers name picasso curled his lip thats why it will be easy to remember said michael backing away to the door and he thought its your real name the miazgas came scrubbed and pressed their ageing beauties had been pinned back into place mrs miazga was big and blonde and just the slightest bit blowsy the academic laura ashley dress was so flimsy and pink that it might as well have been zsa zsa gabor chiffon and strands of her blonde hair kept rising and falling mr miazga looked braced against a further onslaught from picasso he had spent the afternoon with this man and now faced a whole evening of him picasso bounded up to them and kissed madame miazga on both cheeks his arms enfolded mr miazga and wrenched him down to his height picasso kissed him full on the lips this man is a genius picasso declared of mr miazga mr miazga was in the process of recovering from the kiss he has taught me so much mr miazga pulled himself up to his full height as if to imply that a kiss on the lips would normally follow a proper introduction he had not come to live in england to be battered by such behaviour may i present my wife maria marta cooed and offered a tiny polite hand mr miazga continued marta this is mr mr luis said picasso whose fathers name was that his eyes were on michael and the whites looked tobaccostained with knowing luis ruiz it rhymes it is easy to remember yes i am sure i will have no difficulty remembering your name at all said marta miazga who had always been more outgoing than her husband my husband is called thaddeus or thad for short and so the english call him tad the pole michael found himself chuckling along with her though picasso could not possibly have understood the joke he laughed too mr miazga sucked in air thinly between his teeth over dinner picasso talked michael started to uncork the wine and picasso said no no no and took the bottle from him picasso kept talking as he showed the best way to uncork and pour it he told michael where the oven glove was yes yes i put it on the lower shelf where i can reach it we keep it there from now on picasso talked about computer graphics they defy gravity things are pasted on them things are stretched everything blurs into a dream it is as if you take the human mind and plug it into the electricity grid the results have ceased to be entirely human if not used by artists the results are distinctly unpleasant and alienating these graphics reveal a desire for perfection perfection is for people who want to work and who are scared that they will run out of ideas mr miazga coughed picasso talked about monets water lilies he enjoyed them in a scanty kind of way but like all impressionism its fate was to be used on greetings cards its innovations were all technical its artistic message was too often merely pretty marta mentioned the curious art that was now winning awards a dead sheep in formaldehyde picasso laughed and stomped his foot that is either very good or very bad it is reaction against computers did he enjoy winning his award i think so yes replied marta her sentences seemed to wear glass slippers they tinkled and you were afraid they would break ah then the art will be very bad picasso munched his lamb heartily they all waited why would that be mr miazga enquired picasso swallowed there are people who are and there are people who only have the people who have must be good at getting and they are polite the people who are his hand trailed away dont need awards said michael picasso nodded once firmly the awards are there to make the people who have feel like the people who are mr miazga enquired and those who are what are they good at whatever they like said picasso with a shrug defeating others he added shamelessly at the end of the evening the poles seemed suddenly to remember it was michaels flat they thanked him in english for the meal for the move michael said how that the timing was lucky for all of them the apartment will be ideal for us enthused marta you know we have been saying said mrs miazga with a confirming glance at her husband as she took michaels hand in friendship we have been friends for so long that we dont even remember when we first came to this apartment about three weeks ago thought michael the miazgas couldnt remember the angel monks and the singing at am michael eased them down his hallway marta thanked him for picasso it was wonderful meeting your friend it was just like meeting she sought for someone to measure the impact matisse picassos smile temporarily lost its balance the dapper mr miazga shook michaels hand marta waved to pablo enchante picasso said the door swung shut picasso held out both arms and sighed and spun around i can eat i can drink i can read i can learn i can work he said and did a little dance he pulled michael to him and looked up his small round face suddenly like a childs stretched tight and all i have to do is love you he said is that difficult for you i am a womans man said picasso proudly one one man i brought back who had been dead he told me never to do it to anyone else he turned down life picasso was incredulous he was a fool mark was no fool i love your painting because of him now i know he was a fool said picasso he stood back to regard michael as if he were a painting you are not such a price to pay for life you have beautiful hair and beautiful eyes you look like a man you are big and you are strong and so dont cause comment on the street and you are smart and soft soft for me and i like that michael advanced picasso didnt like being pressed up against him it revealed too ruthlessly how short he was michael dipped down bending neck and spine and they kissed their tongues seemed to glue to each other they parted with a smack and picasso said what michael was thinking delicious he reached up and rubbed michaels neck you want me to fuck you he whispered yes michael said from a place so deep inside him the words felt as if they came from his stomach picasso was so short that his arms encircled michaels ass i take you picasso said and picked him up from the floor and hugged him into the bedroom the tips of michaels toes dragged across the carpet picasso let him fall onto the bed and pulled down michaels trousers so hard they tore i fuck you face to face said picasso face to face said michael and knew that he was in a kind of love throughout the act he looked into picassos eyes the move was upon them before michael was ready picasso took charge the van was to arrive on thursday wednesday evening they started to pack big tea crates arrived picasso kept popping out of them like a jack in the box he thought this was very funny michael was not in the mood in fact michael was cross he had wanted to clear things out before he moved at the same time he also wanted to save everything there were phils old toiletries bath foams and aftershaves that michael had bought for him michael sniffed the tops and smelled phil he started to chuck them but at the first clinking of glass in a bin picasso wearing nothing but shorts and sandals flapped into his bedroom what you throw away he demanded this is good no he splashed himself with aftershave oh i smell like monets lily pond now he joked you smell like phil murmured michael there were all the old receipts gas bills addressed to phil old photos of trips to paris there were books phil had given him with cards inside showing two cats entwined there were old socks there were magazines saved because they recorded the top albums of all time according to new musical express in pet sounds at number apparently there were invitations to phils early exhibitions old clothes cowboy shirts torn pvc lycra bicycling shorts phils unwanted wardrobe was a history of illadvised eighties and nineties fashion cups and saucers things michael had given phil that phil now did not want beautiful heirloom silver spoons that phil had given to michael that he had not wanted his old life was stripped bare his old life naked looked like an empty room he was leaving the carpet and the rosewood fireplace michael started to cry picasso was overcome by kindness oh my love he said which in french is something you can say more easily between men hold hold he chuckled sympathetically and held michaels shoulders it is always hard to move you know when i was young we moved here we moved there in spain when you move everyone speaks a different language this is just to camden town eh eh picasso held up michaels chin and made him look into his eyes it worked michael smiled embarrassed by his own weakness and by love i help you picasso exclaimed and flung out his arms to greet the changes so michaels old life was packed away into tea chests except for the fourposter bed from lancashire that had been sold to the poles michael slept in that bed for one last night picasso did not snore placated by the reassurance of sex he slept umbilically attached to michael planted deep inside him in the morning picasso jumped about the flat as if the floor were a skillet michael heard him from the warmth of the duvet clattering away amid the kitchen things as if michael were a nervous invalid picasso arrived with breakfast on a tray croissants and coffee here a last breakfast for the condemned man he said gesturing at the tray michael took a tiny sip of coffee to savour it picasso gulped down half a cup and one torn strand of croissant before jumping up again he would have nothing else to eat until supper that night picasso darted up and down the stairs like a muscular squirrel the moving men thought he was a porter who was paid to help with the move picasso wore overalls from the legs had a sewnon lower half of a different colour he pointed clicked his fingers grinned and somehow acted so completely like a mover that the movers began to follow his instructions picasso made sure the sofa bed was loaded last facing out from the back of the lorry he indicated that he and michael would travel to camden town sitting on it one of the moving men said tell him he mustnt please its the insurance michael shook his head it wont do any good telling him anything the mover was old and reliable and he looked at picasso as if accepting some fundamental fact of life its your funeral i hope not he said michael and picasso stayed in the back of the lorry it jerked and thumped and squealed its way up tottenham court road to camden town picasso sat on the sofa looking out the open back somehow he had spirited a bottle of champagne from his other world the eternal past from which angels seemed to come the ink on the label was as thick as a rubber skid mark and the font plain listing the name of a village picasso began to sing an old strange yelping song michael was to learn later it was cante hondo the only music picasso really loved he waved a bottle and irresistibly forced michael to sing along canta la rana y no tiene pelo ni lana he announced the frog sings though she has neither fur nor wool the van took fifteen minutes to coax itself backwards into their narrow side street picasso manhandled packing cases with the gusto of a bullfighter he nipped so quickly up and down stairs that he reminded michael of a silent flickering film a tworeel comedy short picasso was untidy and disordered everything he did was a kind of unintended blurt their new flat rapidly filled with papers boxes chairs cd racks suits on hangers lamps and cutlery they were piled high in unsorted and unnecessarily exciting piles that threatened to spill paint or crystalware onto the floor picasso flung himself onto the toilet fully clothed in order to sit down and announced with a sigh we are done michael looked around forlornly a heap of previously sorted lab reports slithered onto the floor as if depressed and exhausted picasso gulped water from the tap we go he announced we help your friends he took the keys and locked up and michael found himself heading back to the apartment that was no longer his the miazgas had economized they were carrying their own furniture up the stairs picasso hoisted the poles piano on his own back and twisted it sideways up the circular staircase he carried martas valuable china in an orange washingup bowl the plates and glasses clashed and tinkled as he bounded up the stairs picasso pogoed down them again on two feet like a child splashing in mud puddles he gave mr miazga orders and madame miazga compliments he let marta mop his brow and he mimed having a fever panting with the heat she generated somehow or other once in the flat it was michael and mr miazga who did all the less spectacular lifting picasso stood back with marta and conferred and suggested the best places for the furniture to go in their new and cramped surroundings for this picasso had absolutely no talent he suggested their enormous rubber tree stay in the hallway where it would have no light and block access with minimum ceremony he dumped most of mr miazgas suits on the kitchen table michael was by now exhausted and dazed an avalanche of other peoples things poured into what still felt like his home he kept thinking he would offer people a drink the tonic water was in camden town the ice was melted he wanted to comb his hair but his comb of course would no longer be in its accustomed place on the mantelpiece except that it was poor forlorn forgotten comb faithfully waiting his return see michael thought i havent forgotten you if he felt that about a comb what did he feel about a man a whole habit of life michael combed and recombed his hair and watched picasso picasso had flung himself down on the sandy carpet as if it were a bed he lounged up a hand to accept a cup of tea that marta had managed to assemble from the scattering of her kitchen picasso was vain he seemed to think the smell of his sweat was manly virile he did not bathe every day the smell of picasso permeated the flat it was not an unpleasant smell certainly not to michael it was a sexual smell it was as if the very air were stuffed with picassos penis all three of them wife lover and anxious husband could not think of anything other than those powerful genitals mr miazga was pale and thinlipped and sat on edge hands clasping his knees his delicate downturned face looking as if someone had farted mrs miazgas movements were anxious faltering she was disoriented her fine blonde hair came increasingly undone it seemed to be falling out drifting to the floor michael took stock well he told himself you could have had a very clean pub manager instead instead you chose pablo picasso it will be exciting michael it will not be easy and it may not last forever michael could see the moment when picasso wanted to get back to painting in one single rolling motion he was up from the carpet and pounding the palm of his hand with his fist he looked around the flat as if all of it the original ownership the sale the move had been his own work he nodded as if to acknowledge the good job he had done he said direct to michael come we go to our home then picasso took michaels hand it was evidently unpremeditated thoughtless sincere michael found himself grateful and slightly weak at the knees so evidently did mr miazga he settled back in his chair from relief and his chest expanded and his eyes zipped left towards his wife and then widened once see he seemed to say i told you they are lovers you get all excited over a man who is homosexual after they left outside on the landing picasso promised i will have the wife his voice was airy amused and he spoke out of the corners of his mouth as if madame miazga were a cigar the new flat in camden was dark and in disorder street lights outlined the crags and valleys of jumble michael was given no time for regrets picasso herded him to their unmade bed driven by a lust that michael knew that he himself had not inspired picasso wanted marta picasso dozed and then woke up with a snort he flung off the single summer sheet and padded into the sitting room leaving michael in the bed lights blazed around the edges of the bedroom door and there was a sound of assembling plugging in mild swearing michael finally admitted that he was awake and would not sleep he stumped downstairs into the sitting room and saw picasso at am sitting in front of the computer playing myst his bare buttocks hung over the edge of the chair as round as peaches hmm said picasso this is not threedimensional you just move closer to the drawing on his right there was a pad and scrawled sketches of the myst world populated with drunken people and smiling goats their smiles were drawn as a series of single unbroken spirals describing cheeks michael glanced down over picassos body picasso worked erect coming back to bed murmured michael i dont know grunted picasso in the morning the bed was cold and when michael went downstairs picasso still sat in front of the computer with a cup of cold coffee and strewn stale bread had he been up all night you eat too much picasso announced in a bad mood you will get fat you will become a drunken boor he sighed as if it were inevitable do not expect me to cook you breakfast he said he slipslopped his way out to the roof garden carrying his coffee escaping michael it was summer warm with beautiful light over the ferns michael joined him and picasso said you missed work yesterday and the day before if you were more dedicated you would do a better job picasso wanted him out of the flat michael showered and deliberately took his time over coffee and yoghurt and bananas and pointedly washed up not a picasso habit and left at his usual time feeling bloated around the eyes and saddlesore no one at work mentioned that michael had missed two days he began to explain that he had had to move flats suddenly no one asked him any questions about it ebru and emilio were quiet brisk and businesslike as if michael were a customer they would attend to in a moment he filed slides and looked at data and by the end of the day realized that he had spent it alone when he got back home he found picasso at the computer now wearing michaels best japanese bathrobe the game was noisier and the images moved a tiny alien leapt and jumped and avoided being fried by robots picasso kept playing she is softened and ripe and if you are a man at all you will have her he said then he looked up his eyes were angry and hungry do it because i tell you i will like fucking you better if i think you are a real man upstairs mrs miazga was in michaels bed she was huge pink and dishevelled her hair in preraphaelite waves the room smelled of her hair and of her body opened and reopened during the course of the day visit me she said in a warm and friendly voice and held out her arms she looked dazed and dazzled her blue eyes warmed like a southern sea she smiled in complicity i know you are lovers we will be his lovers together love me too well thought michael he could just surf it let himself be carried by the wave of adventure he went into their new bedroom stuffed with boxes some of them full of shoes and vinyl records and found his sponge bag he crunched his viagra into a bitter tonguecurling paste to make it work faster then he cleaned his teeth to rinse away the bitterness the taste of mrs miazgas mouth was edged with hormones and a scent he did not quite like but her huge soft smooth body was a wonderful maternal harbour michael weighed into her waves rippling around him there was an excitement about being where picasso had been in the folds of flesh still moist from him perhaps it was the viagra kicking in early whatever it was it joined forces with michaels reluctance to have sex with a woman conjoined they had an unexpected effect michael rode mrs miazga for fortyfive minutes he did not come but she did three times my god you are super lover she said in fractured english her fingers strutted pleased up the side of his arm i can tell you have had many women through your hands picasso was standing in the doorway he chuckled approvingly much of the time his eyes were kind as now my big friend loves life he said proudly he mimicked the gesture of madames fingers and strode forward now i show you he said with no manners picasso pulled michael away from her he grinned down at the woman i am back picasso said his teeth bared and she looked up at him adoringly conquered michael was relieved to be relieved he went downstairs clothes draped over his arms showered and sat in the sitting room he poured himself a whisky and ate crisps for the next two hours the man he loved was in the next room fucking someone else michael turned on the television low he was just as alone as when he had been living with phil ok you learn having a lover husband whatever does not stop you being alone michael had power he could get rid of picasso whenever he liked he could walk in there now and banish him leaving marta stranded and shocked except that that had not been the deal picasso had given him what he asked for in exchange for life and why did picasso want life so very much on the sofa on a sketchpad there was a drawing of michael it was one continuous line of charcoal a single gulp of information stylish and twitching as a cats tail it was a drawing of a man who was windswept as if at sea eyes narrowed in the face of some invisible force the tiny chinese eyes each consisted of a single charcoal line but you could tell they were about to weep from wind blown directly onto the cornea the mouth was downturned enduring and elated somehow just about to smile as one smiles in a storm from exhilaration it was a drawing of a man caught up in a miracle it was a new picasso and it would disappear the moment michael sent picasso away madame miazga darted into the bathroom a towel wrapped around her the water suddenly hissed and she began to sing as she showered picasso emerged in michaels boxer shorts strutting like a welterweight champion he slapped his belly and announced we go drinking madame threw on her light and translucent dress she smiled warmly at both of them and giggled with delight only a certain hardness in the contrast between her blue eyes and the mascara around them gave a clue that this was a woman who had mastered academic politics she put a longer finger that was exactly at degrees to the floor against her freshly glossed lips sssh it meant this is our secret her eyes went soft forgiving pleading in memory of her husband she loved mr miazga but perhaps found him too fastidious they separated in the street waving good night in a local camden pub picasso played cards and smoked and joined in a game of darts with fat bearded men in black tshirts and earrings of whom michael was very slightly afraid picassos cigarette balanced on his lips all night and he nodded brusquely when his turn came when others played he sipped beer looking serious and constructively occupied they left at eleven oclock and for some reason picasso was angry with michael those people were trash he said they have no conversation why did we go there michael was dismayed at the unfairness of it because you wanted to are you alive or dead dont you know where the interesting quarters are or do you live inside your computer i will have to find the interesting people i can see that i will have to do everything i even have to find women for you i even have to cook what do you do well eh anything without waiting for an answer picasso flicked open the double lock on their door and raced up the steps ahead of michael michael listened to the rapid fire of picassos feet he felt leaden he did not want to go in it was not his house or his bed come on michael he told himself you have nowhere else to go but his legs simply would not move michael had thought he was happy and that picasso liked him michael thought he can snatch away happiness like a scarf the reversal felt complete it felt as if all love were gone and the relationship over like a ship in warp drive space seemed to travel around him and michael arrived at the opposite pole of the universe he imagined moving out selling the flat sending picasso back he considered going direct to a hotel to spend the night he wanted the affair to end michaels eyes ached with loss henry he asked the night air henry i need you there was a tap on his shoulder and he turned around and there was henry hair in his eyes waiting henry im in love and its all going wrong henry looked sad while smiling hes impossible yes he says things that are so unfair you cant believe he said them theyre outrageous michael found himself pausing and waiting the setup was too neat henry had something to say thats about it everyones impossible to live with michael even saints i lived with a saint for years most of the time he was wonderful but sometimes all he seemed to care about was his research a smile kept playing about henrys face picasso was something like a saint and nothing like one theres nothing for it mate you just hammer each other into each others shape and either it gets comfortable or it doesnt michael halfchuckled youre not much comfort you know that henry reached up and there in the street in camden town started combing michaels hair with his fingers he looked up and down michael in tenderness you look great i feel awful you look adult henrys eyes sparkled it was love love of a particularly airy open fleshless kind and michael felt a kind of hesitation henry gave michael a little push towards the door go on have it out with him see who wins michael hesitated he would rather stay there with henry im an angel i wont always be here you mustnt get dependent on me henry started to walk away determined go on its down to you there was nothing for it michael went in upstairs picasso had changed into boxer shorts and was reclining on michaels sofa bed miguel blasco he said with real affection i like you really come here michael yelped you just told me i wasnt good for anything picasso chuckled at himself as if he had done something silly and amusing like trying to roast potatoes in the fridge i did not like that pub he patted the sofa sit next to me picasso mindfuck really michaels eyes felt heavy like two hardboiled eggs he hated feeling the surrender and gratitude that welled up in him he wanted to stay angry he shouldnt allow himself to be jerked this way and that like a puppet picasso stood up dont be mad over something so small mmm picasso encircled michael with his arms and stood on tiptoe to kiss michaels shoulder see i am so small to be mad over picasso had given michael a choice he could go on being angry and have a major row which would almost certainly fail to change how picasso behaved or he could weaken as he wished to do be carried off by picassos return to kindness picasso seemed to sense him relenting my maker of angels im in love and im helpless thought michael i am shooting whitewater rapids of love all i can do is hang on and try to avoid the rocks picasso leaned around and kissed him and the river bore michael away the apartment never recovered from the move as fast as michael tried to put it in order picasso created another row of jam jars full of brushes in the bathroom or a pile of printed help files on the floor there were heaps of opened boxes from amazoncom halfread books were left open and face down on the floor sandals socks and paintstained newspapers stayed where they fell it had never struck michael until then that he himself was basically a tidy person leave it it will continue to protect the floor said picasso bemused by michaels protests its a horrible mess said michael going firm that is a matter of aesthetics picasso replied i will not be bullied by you over aesthetics something shuddered in michael and went still paintings began to appear stuck to the walls with blu tack gouache on crumpled paper a parrot in blue and green and red a vaguely africanlooking pattern in black and ochre with white dots in swirls a tunnel of blue and white light a sculpture in blu tack was stuck to the coffee table a kind of amused isis with hips and breasts and a shocked open mouth michael asked who it was supposed to be picasso had to repeat several times before michael penetrated his accent it was a blu tack geri halliwell picasso developed a bewildering affection for the spice girls he played the cd over and over why dont you stop michel asked him i will when i understand it said picasso in selfdefence michael bought him a compilation of asian dance anohka and madonnas album ray of light he bought him philip glass and arvo part they are no good they try to be intelligent picasso said dismissing everything else except s club and steps picasso loved cds in the world music section of hmv he found compilations of europop and brazilian brega he played cds incessantly they do the same to music make it perfect but inhuman picasso loved pot noodles and disposable cameras he was entranced by play station and tried to get michael to buy one and a samurai game called soul blade tush you buy rubbish that does not move i want ades oddyssey i want sonic hedgehog he kept buying glossy magazines q maxim elle vanity fair empire he would tear them to pieces and blu tack together mosaics out of fragments of shiny laminated print discarded corpses of shredded journals began to litter the flat he made himself little bracelets of blu tack he stuck shards of magazine colour to his tshirt with blu tack in the corners of the room or running along the picture rail were little families of creatures not entirely unlike mice made out of blu tack you practically breathe blu tack said michael he was being driven slowly and without cessation out of his box the first of his blinding headaches arrived after a glass of wine on a friday evening three weeks later picasso called him to the screen the first he said it took a moment for michael to understand what he was looking at it was pieces of his room when michael moved fleshcoloured fragments moved in shards the videoconferencing camera on top of the computer was feeding what it saw live to the hard disk and those images refracted and broken were made part of a series of mirrors the series of mirrors formed a face in the same way that feathers form wings it was a portrait of michael in fractured virtual mirrors the head could be turned rotated and sometimes as if at random the entire face would blossom outwards the mirrors separating and reassembling into a portrait from a greater distance its your face when i fuck you said picasso each time the portrait reassembled its eyes would gleam brighter and a smile would assemble in sword shapes the audience can choose all angles but each time they choose the program will force the image of you closer and closer to joy you look like that when i fuck you you have a joyful face you look like a young man the face assembled and reassembled every time something moved in the real world then you come picasso mimed something explosive with his hands fingers outstretched you will break up into pieces of light and you are reincarnated no one had ever done anything like that about or for michael before do you michael wondered how to proceed do you love me picasso shrugged i ponder you you have this miracle and you dont use it because i satisfy you there is an economy about that which i like the face on the screen grew brighter and brighter and more joyful unavoidably preprogrammed that was what picasso wished for him picasso said you have nothing no money no morals no interests no conversation no friends to speak of but you are what am i there is no word for what you are you just are ah watch now and the mirrored face dissolved michaels heart swelled like a satsuma growing wings and rose up as if wanting to be born jamming in his throat with love when michael came home at night the whole apartment would smell of eggwhite turpentine and glue suddenly the walls were papered with new picassos their colours like tropical glazed pottery greens reds blues and yellows the whole flat seemed to trampoline off itself with joy bouncing back and forth between its own exhilarating surfaces the spaces between gaping with amazement the only possible response walking into the room was who the fuck has done this when mr miazga came to give picasso his lessons he was stunned his mouth going slack and sad its not fair his eyes seemed to say that my rival should be such a man mr miazga looked forlornly at michael help me he seemed to say michael found his return glance said you help me first at eleven oclock one night about three months after his arrival picasso barrelled into the flat with ten boisterous excited people whom michael had never met except for phils friend jimmy banter jimmys eyes boggled my god its mnm you did land on your feet with this one didnt you so whats the story is he gay no but he sleeps with me i wonder why said jimmy i mean if he isnt gay i mean you were a man the last time i checked dear old philips not doing too well im sorry to hear that no youre not whats wrong lost his way i would say says hes suffering from a crisis of direction maybe hes finding a direction said michael hes painting portraits said jimmy miming horror the guests studiously avoided saying anything about the work on the wall they stood back and raised eyebrows and waited for someone else to say something first michael offered them drinks and learned that some of them were dealers among the influx was the art critic of the evening news the critics accent was ludicrously posh a deliberate effort to be noticed and to give affront to an egalitarian world he fearlessly gave affront to picasso are you unable to experience any anxiety of influence the critic demanded you do know of course from whose work you are stealing no said picasso looking smug tell me hockney said the critic as if barely able to bring himself to say the name aloud in his dreadful picasso period michael passed the critic his gin and tonic the critic turned on him succinctly you are the maid are you this is my flat said michael i see said the critic even his smile was designed to annoy and how long do you think he will be living with you the y sounded like he was about to throw up the ou hooted like an owl michaels riposte was succinct he took back the gin and tonic and began to drink it himself picasso pronounced the critic noel coward picasso said pointing during his precipitous decline it was a miracle picasso could pronounce the word prayssheepetooose it was effective enough one of the many things picasso knew is that it is more valuable to make enemies than friends you can always make up with an enemy but friends hang around as dead weight it was instructive watching picasso at work he strode around the flat arm in arm with an apparent favourite expansively describing the work the critic laughed at him he is like a very bad wine one is amazed he has the effrontery even to wear a label the dealer didnt care he was in this for the money not to defend the sacred flame of art the dealer began to roll a joint expertly onehanded while picasso talked picasso stood in a combative pose telling a story about a bullfight picasso could strut even when he wasnt moving only once did his eyes flicker sideways to another dealer from new york this dealer was much older and betterdressed than the jointroller though picasso ignored him the mans stone face looked neither annoyed nor forlorn michael had spent years cruising gay bars and he knew picasso was making a pass at the older man by playing up to the younger did the new york dealer know that come on michael this is the air these guys breathe of course he knew the younger guy probably knew what they all actually knew or rather had decided was that this luis ruiz wherever he was from was a player right at the end of the evening the new yorker quietly passed picasso his card boy said jimmy banter to michael as he left am i going to make philip jealous why would you want to do that jimmy just tell him i still love him will you jimmy had the grace to look chastened he gripped michaels arm just my little joke he said and left camp will always let you down when they had all gone picasso was slow and well fed like a bullfrog he put a hand behind michaels neck and said i like being with you you are useful tender words i keep you alive said michael you will find when i am being good and you have not made me angry that i am good to you the thought arrived whole and clear and quiet this is love and this is adventure but this is not good for me michael had assumed that love was always in ones interest if love was a stone that rolled you naturally home it must be a good thing the idea that love could smash as well as build a home or roll you further and further from your self had never occurred to him michaels entire flat became a workshop a pottery wheel appeared in the bathroom with sacks of clay when he was not painting or computing picasso was sawing wood from pallets he had found at camden market he would scoop up scraps of fabric a babys shoe or the skull of some small rodent picked clean everything entered the maw of his art and was taken back to the flat to be used adoring women arrived they no longer wore xfiles tshirts and camden nose rings they were smart bright young gallery assistants from notting hill or bond street they wore slim black slacks graceful shoes and mediumlength artfully tinted hair which they tossed from time to time to indicate fascination hello michael the gallery assistants would beam at him when he arrived from work as if genuinely pleased to see that their fascinating new artist lived with another man id better be going they would offer standing up after a decent interval picasso kissed their fingers between the knuckle and first joint oh but you will come back i hope amanda diana jill cecilia apparently they did come back judging from the state of the bed linen michael gave in and began to sleep on the sofa bed in the living room his headaches started coming regularly when do you get headaches michael when youre angry michael came back from going to see in the company of men alone to find picasso painting another portrait of him this time as a weeping clown was michael flattered he was certainly enveloped and perhaps being digested people call idiots the clowns of god picasso touched michaels nose with the tip of the brush handle clown he pronounced him you are in an unequal contest with god this is foolish but inescapable i learn new things from you michael i did not know that the privilege of saints was to fight with god most of us dont even touch him picasso painted either in great easy sweeps or impatient jabs and lunges that left the canvas or the previous layer of paint showing through in streaks this was an impatient painting picasso had scrawled tears in the jagged staring diamond eyes the next night michael came home at to find mrs miazga beside herself in what was now picassos bed she was red again but now it was from irritation perhaps she had found evidence of others she looked miffed when michael stumbled in to fetch shorts and a tshirt to wear in the house unconsciously imitating picasso they both stared wishing the other gone wishing themselves gone wishing him gone im sorry said michael coldly i didnt know you were here she drew the sheet up higher she shrugged but could only just bring herself to say its your house michael found a private corner in the sitting room in which to undress so he could shower his towel he remembered and his bag of toiletries were still in the bedroom damn he marched back into the bedroom his trousers wrapped around his midriff where is he he asked rifling amid picassos trash for his own few things i dont know she said after a pause he left suddenly i thought you were him coming back michael blew out air from tension i know she said and swung her feet out from the bed she fumbled for a cigarette she sighed if you let me shower first i could be gone she looked forlorn ok he said he sat in the front room and looked at the paintings the new ceramics the boxes of wood stuffed with found objects how on earth he wondered do i end this he doesnt allow other people to end things leaving must be up to him it would be hard to have him go because it was a fascinating story to live beside to see an artist climb especially one who climbs quickly rather than slowly painfully humiliatingly as phil had done it would hurt to tear picasso out of his life at first but to live with someone you love who does not love you is indeed to eat your own heart you have to live through cliches to realize how powerful and apt an expression they often are michael was eating his own heart out he would have no heart left michael was good at avoiding decisions at letting life decide life decided enough michael said aloud he had had enough he looked at the paintings on the wall and had two goals to get picasso to go and to save his art so the next day michael took another long lunch break and visited mr miazga in the flat that had once been his own mr miazga was working alone at his computer with the resigned grimness of someone unemployed at fifty my wife is not here mr miazga sighed is she perhaps at your house michael tried to think of what would be polite and realized that nothing would be i dont know its possible i try not to go there i hate that man michael sighed too sometimes i do you you love him the two are not mutually exclusive michael looked at the zipdrive disk in his hand thaddeus he began i have a lot of respect for you and so i am going to ask something that i would not ask from just anyone mr miazga kept keying in a program ok ask i want you to redo all his work mr miazga sniffed he should make backups he does i do but that wont work michael had rehearsed this next part it would be difficult to explain how i know this but believe me it is true every trace of his work will disappear when he dies a fault in how he programs stranger than that i can promise you that all his paintings and ceramics will disappear as well that would be a loss but consider if his new work in computer art would disappear as well mr miazga shrugged i am not a critic no thank heavens you are a creative technologist so ask yourself this question is he not finding out what can really be done artistically with this stuff mr miazga went quiet what are you asking im asking you to rekey in any code he makes im asking you to redo every gif im asking you to rescan every graphic that way the work will survive why mr miazga turned to him his bafflement shot through with something genuinely enquiring in his shoulder bag michael had volume two of the john richardson biography the books are laced with every existing photograph of picasso often in his workshop michael opened it at the chapters dealing with the early s silently he kept turning each of the pages michael could see the exact moment when mr miazga understood he jumped as if someone had stabbed him with a pin its him he said and turned to michael wideeyed the rules are simple whenever he goes back to wherever it is he comes from everything he has done in this world will vanish mr miazga rifled through the pages it really is him he looked at michael with something like horror then he crossed himself is this some kind of miracle i dont really know we could talk about it all afternoon and still not understand it can you believe me thad mr miazga went back to the photographs he gave a nervous laugh it is remarkable his eyes said is it god or the devil who has done this if you do this i will tell him what you are doing if its a choice between his work surviving or marta i imagine your wife will be safe mr miazga chortled ducked and smoothed down his impeccable hair a man might prefer to have his wife back for other reasons i imagine she still loves you i imagine she will be grateful that you are still there to pick up the pieces and ok here comes the second impossible thing can i promise you something thad when he goes she will have no memory of him neither will you it will be as if he never existed it was all beginning to be a bit too much for mr miazga he expelled air and pulled his hair back even flatter i imagine that you are aware of the value of his work and that whatever the personal situation you can see that there is value in making sure the work survives it was a question left for him to answer mr miazga covered his face with his hands and appeared to wash his face with them as though they were flannels ok i will do it he said snatching his hands away then he seemed to crumple oh i am a weak man you are in control of your emotions thad whatever the situation with your wife you are still able to see clearly and you are a normal man who wants his marriage to survive mr miazga looked round at him slowly his face more creased than usual in folds and you do well too you get him back i dont have him thad and im doing this so that i can send him away mr miazga looked at him for a few moments and said for you i will do this not for him michael returned to work elated he boomed hello at shafiq and tony and bounced so effectively at ebru that she had no time to say anything about his absences he kissed her on the cheek talked to her about her trip to turkey and asked her to run a report on their data using different variables then he slammed into his in tray and got a fair way through it he saw from the papers that it was too late to agree to speak at the american conference well ok you cant do everything he tore up the correspondence threw it in the wastebin and emailed an apology at pm he tapped all the remaining older papers into a neat pile and put them in a folder he was the last to leave michael wandered in a circuit around archbishops park it was the day before the clocks went back and it was nearly dark there was no one else there though it was still warm and the trees had all their leaves michaels feet began to drag as if he had forgotten to drink any water during the whole of the day michael avoided going home he finally took the tube and ended up in the camden bar the redfaced bearded men ignored him he watched other laconic unfearful souls play darts it wasnt enough to have love you needed to have power the two were so much alike love and power only exist between people both come from inner liveliness perhaps they were the same thing since to fail at one seemed in some way to be bound up with failure in the other michael finished a pint of becks and finally went back to his flat this flat it is mine michael said i bought it hmph said picasso from his computer he turned and glowered a warning youre welcome to stay if you still need to you can sleep in my bed or on my sofa but please stop bringing women back picasso smiled you are jealous michael smiled not at all it is inconvenient to come back and find my bed occupied picasso seemed to swell and darken like clouds do not threaten me how have i threatened you i have asked you to keep strangers out of my bed picasso said you will make me angry why because i ask for good behaviour yes it is bourgeois oh please it would be bourgeois to sit by helplessly while you turn me out of my own house if you want to make a mess and fill a flat with whores go find one of your own picasso finished keying in with a musical flourish i will do so he turned and challenged michael his jaw thrust out good said michael that night picasso noisily made up a bed downstairs for the first time in months michael slept in his own bed alone he felt the separation like scar tissue from his sternum down to the top of his penis its over he realized it really is over there was sadness like a story ending and another sensation that was like fear trepidation well call it unease michael knew that it was a necessary unease it was the unease you feel when you lose a tooth or change jobs it was the unease of learning i love you michael accepted and it will have to end he wept one long slow hot unwilling tear and that was all in the morning michael went downstairs and picasso was making coffee he looked smaller he turned and smiled and said good morning and pushed an empty cup in michaels direction you have set me free havent you picasso said yes you will let me live michael nodded picasso chuckled and gave his head a funny shake you have become tired of me but you dont threaten me that is good he said it is economical he made a fist to emphasize the last word michael allowed himself to be drawn economical how toh said picasso and spread his hands out over the selfevident empty table one should never give everything it is wasteful it tries too hard his eyes said i am going to live i am going to live without conditions two weeks later picasso stood at night on the doorstep he had a new leather jacket slung over one shoulder and a shaved bristly head and a stud earring he had started to sell pictures his agent had found him a flat he was in an expansive mood i am going to live he said rocking on his heels indeed said michael smiling with him picasso took his hand and the work it will live too for as long as you do when you go the paintings the sculptures will disappear like the flowers said picasso and his face was impossible to read it was regretful but happy except for your computer pieces uh i have not told you this mr miazga i made a deal with him for some reason picasso threw his head back and laughed aloud he is keying in all your work again so it will remain it will stay picasso was still laughing poor miazga regard there is a man who gives everything the deal is that you stop screwing his wife it was terrible but michael was grinning too without knowing why and he suddenly spurted out a laugh he can have her declared picasso with a wave of his hand dismissing her it everything he did his little dance in place his eyes looked at michael brimming with affection you picasso said with one finger are two fingers together made a sign like a blessing he gave michael a hug and whispered in his ear but i really hated screwing you the words broke apart like rocks with laughter liar said michael you were in me all night picasso stepped back true he proclaimed he spun around and held up a hand to wave goodbye true he bellowed as he walked away without looking back and michael for some reason felt a wild unaccountable joy it was as if there were a giant tiger lily flower all red spangled with yellow and it was just beyond the sky filling it invisible i am going to live michael repeated he watched picassos retreating back with love and gratitude and relief what am i looking for michael finally cleared his in tray and saw in it a reminder deadline for grant proposals he lightly thought why have they sent me this the answer seemed to thump him in the heart because you didnt do the application no i must have didnt i michael couldnt remember not doing it but then you dont remember not doing something he was sure he had done it well or rather it felt as if he had but his only memory of application forms was he realized from last year for the sixmonth initial grant he opened up my documents he did a find and there was no file called application or council form or any other likely name on either the server or his hard disk he must have sent it out he couldnt have been so stupid he sorted all his emails by address and looked at everything he had sent to the council only one had an attachment and that was simply the first progress report michael went out and asked ebru if she still kept a record of all outgoing and incoming white mail mmmm hmmm she said and handed him the register good girl he said wistfully looking at her brisk pinched face and she was a good girl better than he was to record each outgoing item of post it wasnt as if she were a secretary she was a postgraduate researcher michael went though the list line by line for all of august and september there was nothing no conventional mail whatsoever to the biological research funding council do we have a record of courier dispatches her eyes said of course we have yes that what you were looking for michael ebrus gaze was upsettingly direct and unfriendly she was plainly fed up with him there was nothing in her manner to encourage him to tell her what had happened michael lied i sent back some faulty software i need to know when if youll tell me where you sent it i could find it for you well i know roughly when and i know it was sent by ordinary post so itll be easier if i just scan for it her grey eyes rested on his and then she shrugged and then she passed the dispatch courier receipts in silence there were only three dispatches in august and none of them was for the research council michael slowly closed the register and found that his limbs did not want to move there would have been no funding after september they should have enough to finish the light learning experiment but that wasnt the point the point was to use the current study as a benchmark to see how other learning activities produced different results theyd talked about it the team expected it michael could not believe he had done it that he had fucked up that badly that he was so stupid so incompetent his flesh seemed to crawl nervously all over his bones part of him was trying to take action or perhaps escape himself he rang the research council the conversation left his heart shrivelled with shame the neurology contact was a man called geoffrey malterton he was as ever pleased to hear from michael geoffrey sounded ebullient and efficient nothing out of place in his life then whoa youre weeks too late months too late its all been snatched up im afraid im sorry but you know how fierce the competition is for grants what is your project still unfinished no no not at all its just that weve had some new ideas michael tried to sound bright and alert well then you can always apply next year the answer is no for this years money im afraid michael asked emilio for the project accounts he avoided asking ebru as soon as he saw the spreadsheet their situation was so obvious that he wondered why the staff werent talking about it simply there had been no income except interest since april it was now late october did they have enough to continue michael had supposed he would be able during the year to raise more money from other sources they had roughly one month of money left he recalculated their budget remembering extras like stationery and an unpaid water bill and had a moments panic then he remembered interest was compounded quarterly and that would be paid in at the end of november he had to track their steadily decreasing principal and try to calculate the interest it was all backofanenvelope stuff but the interest made the difference they would be ok ok meant that there was enough money to give all the staff their contractually required one months notice it could all be made to seem deliberate they had enough basic data for this particular project michael could just ignore the idea they had of following it up they should make sure that all the data were entered and correct and then run the reports there would even be time and money if they needed one final trial one more order of chicks to fill any gaps in data or design there was always a problem with staff near the end of research projects you tell them the project will end just when their work must be at its most meticulous yes they had known all along it would come to an end but yes they have living expenses so they have to look for the next contract or post they often leave before finishing especially when the end of the project is unexpected and they have not been able to plan he went to the cold store they had done a good job while he was going crazy the slides were all in order and labelled the salami wafers had all been stained and stored with something numb and slow part way between dread and relief he saw the project had been well done michael went into the soft dark redlit room there were the chicks his chicks peeping out of need and hunger they were warm and feathery in his hands as light as dust kicking and struggling for life they would be the last batch to be killed and suddenly michael saw them afresh they were like his angels all his beautiful angels alive and hungry and here for such a short time he was surprised by a sudden welling up of tears he loved them he was going to lose them he loved them and he didnt want to kill them he stood transfixed by confusion torn by irreconcilable emotions for the chicks for his research for his old life with its mild addictions to science order and shots of whisky and of semen he had no desire or idea of what to desire simply he was unmanned meaning he had lost a self he could not answer the question what do i do next he stood in the dark cradling a little chick weeping for it making peeping noises himself please god make it stop please god just take it away ill be good just tell me what to do and ill do it the world is not to be seduced by words the world stayed the same waiting for him to act michael remembered the first day they had moved into the arches ebru emilio hugh inspected their wellresourced lab running around the cold room and the darkroom and the emergency generator like kids ebru had kept deferring to him michael where do you want this she had called him hoja which meant teacher or master in turkish she would never call him that again michael took a deep breath a parental voice from somewhere said do it mikey get it over with shafiq was in his box ebru and emilio were together in the front office hugh was hunched over the camera michael asked to see them in his office in fifteen minutes he spent those fifteen minutes rehearsing what he was going to say with his fingers spread out across the top of his desk as if they were roots drawing strength from it their body language alone was enough to wrench his gut ebru slouched in her arms crossed in front of her her mouth pushed to one side with sour suspicion shafiq stood like prince charles erect his hands clasping each other behind his back as if to stop him hitting someone his plump face was turned upwards as if absorbing a blow emilio looked bored irritated impatient i spent so much time building them up into a kind of family michael thought ive destroyed it theres no good way to say this so ill be brief weve collected enough data which thanks to all your efforts is in super shape really its all recorded the data entered everything in cold store well done really they were as frozen as the samples they knew what was coming which means that the project is entering the home stretch we still have some slides to photograph which i see hugh has well in hand what we need to do now is just make sure we have enough data all in order and then try to turn it into some kind of information which i reckon we can do before the end of the calendar year ebru flicked hair out of her eyes um that means the project will end and that ill be giving you formal notice today youve been a terrific team and i wanted you to have the news as soon as i did you forgot to apply for the grant didnt you michael ebru said it no i uh took advice from the research council they said it was probably best if we tried to wind the project up as a second grant was highly unlikely michael wiped his mouth was she going to call him a liar as well as incompetent ebru hovered for a moment like a hawk over a motorway bank then she shrugged and went silent she couldnt be bothered any questions there was a beat ebru shook her head and murmured no well if you have any just ask ebru you and i will need to go over all the contracts and make the nuhnonrenewals official hugh there is the photography to continue emilio you and i will need to get going on the data processing silence i uh was wondering if people wouldnt like to get together today for a lunch my treat never had words of his sounded so much like a creek running dry i would like to say thank you the team glanced at each other ebru said it maybe later michael when the project ends the last day or something ok said michael his hands did something awkward in midair ok thanks gang they started to file out oh one other thing um we really have a lot of data and i was wondering if we really need need any more which would mean i want us to set this last batch of chicks free that was enough to make ebru stop and turn around oh that is a good idea she said without any tonal variation in her voice well theyre such beautiful little things and weve got a lot of data and it just seems such a shame oh god oh no he could feel his face it was crumpling at the corners of his mouth and his cheek was twitching up towards his eyes he was starting to cry and he had no real idea why it is a very strange sensation to break down in public and for that public to stare back at you stonily completely unmoved by anything like sympathy cry you bastard their eyes seemed to say cry for your little project we could just let them go in the park he was begging ebru said that is illegal itll be an illegal little party michael bounced in his seat trying to communicate that it would be naughty and fun its stupid theyll die it isnt even kind said ebru and turned and walked out shafiq shuffled away hugh said ill get going on the photographs emilio said smiling but with a direct gaze whatever youre on michael stop taking it they processed the chicks without even telling michael they were doing it they did it very quickly and neatly michael went into the photography room hugh was photographing as before but ebru was staining samples those are fresh said michael we have to do it while theyre young michael otherwise they will be too mature to compare with the other samples i asked you not to do that when ebru turned and her gaze challenged him challenged his right to give any orders at all when did you ask me not to michael we discussed your idea about setting them free and decided it was wrong and we decided that it was stupid to waste them and so we follow proper procedure her hand made an involuntary little wave sweeping him away we will do everything in order michael you dont have to do a thing im very unhappy you did that ebru held out her hands in something like helplessness i am helpless to help you michael i am helpless to say anything other than that your unhappiness makes no difference michael had nothing else to do so he typed all the official notices of nonrenewal he went over the accounts and planned the new expenditure that is the kind of thing a good little boy does when admonished there is no coming back from being justly admonished by your staff and then being defied by them he worked alone in his office deliberately until late no one popped in to say good night see you tomorrow at pm he did a round of the lab turning out a few lights in the reception box the night guard was pleased to see him he was a londoner excockney a vanishing breed hello sir he said perking up i havent seen you this late in ages how are you sir he sounded genuinely pleased to see michael i decided to give up all that staying late oh very wise sir very wise my wife says the same about me at my age but the moneys good and between you and me it gets me out from under her feet it was terrible to be treated with friendliness and respect the leaves had begun to fall in archbishops park and they had blown across the street crunching underfoot walking back to waterloo seemed to take forever he shuffled with dreamlike slowness hed fucked it he had well and truly fucked it he stood stricken on the platform at waterloo wanting to hide he walked back to his old flat near goodge street on automatic pilot he got all the way to looking up at his old window and seeing his ceiling illuminated through it and a moving shadow he thought oh good phils home then he realized no hes not no one is at home home is over home is gone my animal brain just walked me back here his animal heart stood outside the building yearning upwards at the light on the old ceiling i want my job back my beautiful project i want my partner my flat my peace of mind i want my old life back too late michael youre not going to get it the idea of walking back to goodge street tube and going all the way to camden made him close his eyes with fatigue he wondered if he could just ask the miazgas to let him back in for ten minutes snooze he just wanted to clear his head but he would have to explain to them and worry them and involve them again in his life so he turned dazed as if on painkillers and dragged his way back to goodge street station everything around him the eisenhower security center the cenotaph in front of it was like reassuring old friends seen after a divorce there was the reject shop no it wasnt it was now something called cargo change swept over everything like a tide turn your back and its as over as the first world war michael tried to find the flower the flower was whatever he had touched when luis had left him the joy in the world in himself i have seen it it was real it can come when things go wrong its strongest when you have been brave and strong not when youve fucked up messed everyone over lost it not when youve thrown your life out of the window there was now a porn shop on tottenham court road well there would be they had been moving north out of soho for some time as real estate got too valuable even for the sex industry and only cappuccino it seemed could turn a penny or rather enough pennies gaze the word the shop called itself there were ribbons of coloured plastic across the door there always were in porn shops like ketchup bottles always looking the same well hello professor said a voice someone was standing in the doorway michael blinked it took him a moment to recognize who it was the guard from goodge street station he was wearing a fancy tshirt the kind youre not supposed to tuck in and the same blue security trousers that made his legs and butt look somehow bolshy have a look round dont be shy the guard said he looked chunkier perhaps he had been working out but his mouth still habitually sneered he held apart the plastic strips as if opening a dressing gown come on im sure ive got something for you he emphasized you as if he knew and understood michael michael had no direction no reason to do anything else so he went inside it was bright like christmas full of colour i expect youre surprised to see me here said the guard i suppose you could say i found my metier he grinned cheekily here have a look at these he handed michael video boxes covered with coloured computer printout the images were of naked men i get these from round the world he said he dipped down behind the counter and pulled out a folder he opened it up to show clear wallets full of more laserprinted images rancho rauncho one of them boasted starring spike harden and mustapha most american he said proudly uncensored you wont find this sort of stuff for sale anywhere else in the west end not at these prices beautiful stuff michael noticed hes wearing a wedding ring look at this now this is the guvnor max schnarr he goes all round the world russia eastern europe quebec all sorts of strange places picks up all the bestlooking men himself and theyre so besotted with him that they let him make a film hes in em himself this ones from venezuela michael stared bored beyond description bored into some netherworld where nothing you said made any difference hold on the guard leaned forward ive got some really special stuff if this kind of thing is too tame red yellow brown he leaned back and waited what do your mates next door think of this michael asked goodge street station was three doors down that lot i just tell em what im making these days it beats working for london underground i can tell you youre not gay said michael doesnt mean to say i dont like pleasing men the guard gave a wobble of his eyebrows and something queasy washed off him it was attraction but attraction as if it were music played backwards it was revulsion so strong that it mimicked attraction listen youre not in this line of work ill tell you how i do it his blanched skin and blue blank eyes shone he wanted the professor to understand that he was not some stupid oik you can buy this stuff with copyright off the internet you just pay a oneoff fee its expensive but it comes with all rights and you download it at three am when the lines are clear and its lovely quality mpeg compression you can transfer it to dvd or video the punters could do the same but it would take them fortyfive minutes to download and theyre bound to lose the line halfway through i got in a leased line that costs i can tell you but i got a thriving mailorder business in fact i had that before i opened the shop i want to become the main source for gay porn in the entire uk michael started to look through the files i tell you some of this stuff is really strong i mean underthecounter even in america youve seen nothing like it mate the underground guard leaned forward come on tell me what youre into michael could feel his breath on his cheek he could smell it mint on mint there was a polo circling his mouth even now it clicked every time he spoke ive got it for you or i can get it come on you can tell me latin manhattan ghost with the most a lad in with his wonderful lamp michael remembered phil in his porn phase they cost fifty thousand dollars to make and return two hundred and fifty do it six times and youre a dollar millionaire the guard was pleased you know how it works then i mean im looking for an angel michael looked up what angel you know theatrical investor to put up the money im trying to make a video of my own because i mean youre absolutely right the money gets made in production its not like that for any other part of the film industry for regular films its distribution but with this stuff its all underthecounter which is too expensive and slow or on the net which frankly is too cheap youre giving the stuff away on the net which is why its available on oneoff id love to turn it around and sell distribution back to the states hey the british are coming eh that could be the title said michael the underground guard was getting excited he chuckled youre dead right my project just closed down said michael i have no money to invest ah well one day my ship will come in said the guard in the meantime think about what youre into and let me know like i say if i dont have it i know where to find it dont michael stopped at the door dont the police bother you naw theyd rather people got into this stuff than pick up some disease but only because the drugs are so expensive on the national health sooner or later ill end up in jail goes with the territory his blunt pale face established beyond doubt hed do well in prison michael thanked the guard and left the logical part of michaels brain got him home regretfully coldly michael sat in his flat in the dark listening to traffic and the shouts of kids from the clubs michael tasted emptiness there were times when he wanted luis back but that would prove luiss point in a way he would even take philip back he would take anything michael it is getting hard to see any progress in all this he thought of the guards stubby pale body its little potbelly the undoubtedly uncircumcised cock and the thought produced a weary sort of sexual response ok come on then the air wavered and parted its lips and the guard stepped into michaels sitting room why does god suffer the devil nice place the guard said casing it then he said shit then he had to sit down hed understood faster than most what he was youre not real michael said still bored still exhausted youre a copy i make copies of people i think i want to have sex with its a miracle if you can figure it out tell me do you mind if i smoke the angel asked michael waved go ahead it makes no difference once you go my lungs will clean up again the movements of the angels pale pudgy hand were jagged as if pins were prodding him with one hand he flipped out a fag and then a match his left hand tapped out a nervous rhythm on his thigh the guard had broken out in a sweat and his eyes grew narrower and brighter as he looked about him his eye fastened onto the wall covered with jumping picassos did one of us paint those he asked jabbing a finger at them one of us copies youre quick said michael have to be everyone in my familys a thief the angel tapped the end of the cigarette on the matchbox before finally lighting up he drew in gratefully then blew out you eaten anything he asked michael had to think no he said quietly i meant to get a takeaway but i forgot its all right i got plenty of dosh ill go get it for you the angel bolted up from the sofa as if it were electrified that wouldnt be honest said michael why not i bet i make more than you do once you go back to whatever it is you come from the money you gave the man will disappear it would be like stealing ill give you my money michael heaved his wallet out of his trousers disappear the angel did a little shuffle in place mmm hmmm said michael and held out a tenner he took the money then he said ill need the keys laboriously michael passed those and then he said you dont come back with them ill wipe you out of existence and theyll be back here in my pocket not if i give them to the man then theyll stay there wont they a long pause you dont really know what would happen with either the keys or the money the angel rocked back and forth slightly on his heels thats right michael didnt another experiment he could make if he had the heart for another experiment if he hated killing chickens why would he want to wipe out the guard to discover if he got his keys back and what would happen if his keys stayed lost knock and ill open the door said michael sorry but you did say you were a thief i never i said my family was i tried all my life not to be and im not see michael nodded though it does kind of leave you crook inside bent in all kinds of directions the angel smoothed down his hair like drivers do after theyve done something stupid like veer out of their lanes michael walked down the stairs with him to let him out the air felt like glue he had to fight his way through the guard stopped to breathe out smoke funny innit i already know nothing i say or do can make a difference to anything its a shortcut to a lot of things being an angel said michael the guard said angel huh thats what you call us what would you call yourself oh a right little devil what do you want to eat theres a little takeaway place it looks like a minicab office it does steak sandwiches turn left and left again youll find it just follow the smell get something for yourself too if you want right ill be back then there was an awkward smile and michael rocked himself wearily to his feet they thumped down the hollow wooden steps together each of them sounding as real as the other michael let the guard out and gave him a wave as he walked across the street michael discovered he had no energy to climb the stairs he sat down on them instead and waited he thought of the guard the pale glow of his sweatiness his pudginess the crispness of the gelled hair the rounded jelly of his arse in the tight trousers it was as if repugnance were a sock that could be turned inside out michael thought of the wedding ring on the angels finger he thought about that business of being bent in all directions well do it if he wants to michael thought that was the extent of the attraction michael wished again that he were in love if he were in love with someone it would be sitdown meals and not takeaways he would have someone he could talk to about the grant and the project and how he was to live through it there was wisdom in love without love wisdom stayed unformulated simply because there was no one who cared enough to talk there was a thumping on the door michael groaned to his feet fumbled with the lock and the guard burst into the stairwell wafting a kind of freshness interwoven with a delicious smell of steak brrrrrr its parky out there the guard said and bounded up the stairs he strode ahead of michael into the kitchen area cold vapour steamed off him i should have borrowed one of your jackets right ill just put this away to keep warm he peered at the cooker and deciphered its ancient markings where are the plates top shelf over the cooker might as well warm the plates as well the angel cast him a sideways glance so can i spend the night here yes if youd like thanks said the angel where are the place mats um michael couldnt remember he had to remember where the place mats were and when he went to get them he walked as if he had lead boots on knives forks salt a lovely little setting for two was laid out on the table michael was aware of something like a mismatch between the man and his behaviour the guard sniffed you got anyone to clean this place no admitted michael i probably should my last boyfriend wasnt exactly tidy not exactly no said the angel the whole place is covered in china clay did he do all those paintings then yup sighed michael hes only been gone a couple of days the angels back went very still whered he go to his agent found him a place he has his first exhibition next week ah so you do let some of us live then the guard said it as he stood up with candles for the candlestick michael wasnt sure why he didnt like the guard saying that knowing that he didnt have time to work out why he didnt like it there we go said the angel holding out his hands to the professionally set table hes worked as a waiter michael realized you got any serviettes the angel asked later michael waited for him under the duvet of the bed the guard was one of those people who brush and spray they try to wash their private parts without making a sound of water splashing and they powder themselves michael knew the result well the guard would taste of alcohol base and smell like the ground floor of selfridges the guard walked back upstairs from the john wearing michaels robe and holding in his tummy he still had on his socks he would have been handsome if he didnt leer and his body language had been less jerky and angular the guard dumped himself next to michael he did indeed smell like a floral tribute but the body was alabaster smooth plump and cool to the touch the guard asked what do you like doing its more important to know what you like doing said michael youre married yeah well i do other things too what are you bi yeah sort of im not a thief but when i was younger well i got sent down my brothers needed some help on a job and i got caught i wasnt so big then in fact as it happens i was a bit small for my age anyway while i was in the nick i sort of found out that if you let the other guys do things then they werent so i dont know aggressive they were still right little bastards he managed a kind of sneering chuckle but they were placated he propped his head on his elbows and you what do you get up to eh with this little miracle of yours too much the guard liked that he settled down with a chuckle ho i bet come on tell me what you been up to who have you had um the new zealand all blacks that high diver whos a brit but his familys italian a very nice black musician loads what and they just come and perform for you yeah i think the real miracle isnt that theyre here its that they want to sleep with me its not surprising youre a very goodlooking man the guard gave him an encouraging nudge the words sounded false michael suspected that he was being flattered so who would you ask for ooh someone like you the guard grinned one tooth was outlined in silver michael knew he was being flattered what would you like to do he asked again insisting the angel ventured as if onto thin ice well would it be all right if we just cuddled yeah sure fine said michael who was hardly up for it anyway on the night after you discover that you have destroyed your job it is reassuring to be held it was pleasant even necessary for michael to feel a warm smooth soft body enveloping him from behind as if it were there to shield him as if it were offering him love or stability or both there was a simple catlike sensuality about feeling the other body stir of taking its hand of hearing someone murmur sleepily youll let me stay wont you please michael awoke in the morning to hear a sizzling sound he thumped downstairs to find the angel at the stove frying bacon and eggs i couldnt find the coffee the guard said the kitchen looked brighter as if the sun were out the floor michael saw had been cleaned the angel picked up his gaze as if it were a tip i washed the floor for you he said this place is filthy theres shadows on your sheets probably skidmarks and all only i didnt want to look too close i still cant find the coffee as it happens the guard gave michael a full cooked breakfast michael offered to do the washingup but the guard said hadnt you better be getting on look why dont you let me stay here and clean up a bit michael couldnt help but smile you really want to stay as long as you can dont you the guard grinned inexpertly smiling was not his strongest suit i like to make myself useful ok stay and clean up said michael he found that the thought of going to work and facing the team all over again made the angel seem a refuge of domesticity i should have asked your name michael said nick just plain nick nick dodder then he said here your tie needs straightening at work that day michael tried to be committed he started out well planning expenditure until the end of the project then he had a bit of a blow emilio handed in his notice i had an offer already you see for when uh this project finished he pronounced it finishshed when will you go emilio flinched and didnt answer he probably wanted to go as soon as possible emilio was the projects it man any real problems with the network or any fresh programming to be done and they would miss him michael sighed ok well your contract holds us both to a minimum of a months notice and im going to need you to work out your notice basically we need to audit what weve got in terms of reports generate any new report forms and train up hugh and ebru to use them emilio looked discomfited if if i finish all that before the month is up could i go it is three years work michael guaranteed ill think about it said michael he meant no thanks for letting me know the day darkened michael slowed down the truth was that he had destroyed his project this truth did not go away like an unwelcome guest the truth stayed like a dysfunctional family like your inescapable self michael hid his face and when michael got back home the flat smelled of roast beef the entire ground floor was in order the books were on shelves places had been found for all of luiss canvases bags of clay splattered wood old newspapers plastic ice cream containers rope and bits of tyre nick was pleased with his work a lot of its upstairs if you want to go through it personally id just chuck the lot have you insured this place yes why nick took michaels shoulder bag to hang up because if your friend has even started to sell his stuff each one of those paintings is worth at least three hundred pounds and theres forty of them thatll be worth twelve k you like roast potatoes at dinner nick was full of schemes you should do this place up and sell it those are regency banisters you could do up the whole place as regency its just opposite the tube its got a roof garden only one point of access on the street no neighbours if you put in a second lockable door at the head of the staircase this place would be worth three hundred four hundred thousand hell two bedrooms camden town i tell you a year from now it would be worth half a million if you needed help doing it up im pretty handy as it happens it might be a good idea its a brilliant idea itll be work mind you ill think about it it was what he had said to emilio there was something michael didnt like come on get up off your arse this place will never get back in order if you dont get into some habits why dont you let me wash and you put away you know where things go so rather neatly as a team they got the dishes washed nick soaped them lavishly rinsed them in water so hot it steamed and shook them this thing of yours this miracle he said scrubbing between the teeth of michaels forks you say you can call up anybody i mean we could call up james dean he was gay hed be happy to do anything from the sound of things he did nick chuckled darkly he rinsed a glass people would pay to see him do it as well what do you mean make a film we could do yeah as if it were michaels idea michael had an answer he shook his head the instant he went back the film would show nothing and that i do know for certain nick seemed absorbed in polishing a wine glass he held it up to the light so you mean they cant be photographed the image only stays as long as they are here every trace of them goes think of it as a fast death like i said being an angels a shortcut its what happens to all of us after were gone the children sell the house the new owners tear out the garden to make a driveway and throw away our old photographs it just happens quicker to angels nick tried to look philosophical he succeeded in looking like a contestant on a quiz show yeah he said his brows touching he put a plate in the rack so if they hang around these angels their photographs stick around as well michael imagined them hundreds of angels hanging around camden town so people could see them wanking in films that said michael would be like a run in reality realitys already running mate said nick with eyes like cash registers and after dinner michael found himself caught in a fleshy hug hmmm said the guard kissing him as if he were still washing plates there was something awkward in the way he did it his arms pushed michael away as much as they held him nick leaned back and looked at michael in what could have been affection if it hadnt looked appraising im into a lot of things the angel promised rubbing his crotch against michaels you couldnt fault him for being oversubtle there was one side of michaels sensuality which had not been explored of late he crunched a bitter pill and nick offered up his buttocks michael was surprised the things that were unattractive on the front of nick his pale plumpness were beautiful from the back his buttocks were white flawless mounds though his body gave evidence that it had been penetrated many times before michael was aware from the clenching of nicks jaw that it was not comfortable for him but that was not what nick said shall i stop asked michael pulling back naw naw its great go on pumping from viagra headachy and breathing thinly because the drug had swelled up the inside of his nose michael came squirting from a penis that was artificially clogged with swollen veins his cock felt like a cake decorator squeezing out icing from a tiny hole the orgasm kept coming as it were until his balls ached and he felt drained and he actually wanted it to end someone michael didnt even like had just given him the most thorough orgasm of his life so michael woke up once more with nick in the flat this time nick was putting away his clothes you said nick need to do your laundry yeah maybe but its my laundry thought michael you have a washing machine michael knew what was coming no well i can go to coin operated while youre at work if you like what is it with you i can do my own laundry do it yourself if it suits you michael hated the whole business of going to the laundry ill give you some money wouldnt want to rob the coinop would we nick grinned that night michael found all his socks individually stored in transparent plastic bags and sorted by colour blue black brown white why did you do that michael demanded feeling trespassed upon nick was cooking again stops you losing them mate otherwise they get separated and nobody needs a drawerful of half pairs of socks trick of me mums you can say thank you if you like michael felt helpless there was absolutely no way to say that it wasnt useful you could even see which colour each pair was just just ask me next time youre going to change something nick bowed to hear is to obey oh master of the lamp incidentally ill be polite about the contents of your fridge but lets just say that some of it had prices on in shillings and pence its all still in the bin and if you want to go through it please feel free he canoodled his way forward and gave michael a kiss he was actually wearing an apron it was like watching a character in eastenderswho the writers have decided would go suddenly gay at dinner he helped himself only after first serving michael you dont use it for anything do you this miracle of yours i get my socks put in plastic bags well theres a thrill look why dont you let me make a few suggestions you did well lets make some more see who we can get in here its such a waste not to use it what you go and ask any other bloke in the kingdom gay or straight what theyd do if they could have anybody they wanted and theyd tell what theyd do soon enough i can tell you and that would be what they say not what theyd do look lets go to bed after dinner and see what takes your fancy if theres something you really want ill just hive myself off give me the power to come back by myself and i can come and go as convenient michael lied i cant do that have you tried michael lied yeah a couple of times nick seemed to find it funny he chuckled like hell you did there was some kind of issue about power michael now knew that in bed nick insinuated himself next to michael now lets see who shall we have then eh he mentioned a boyish notsoyoung film star beloved of young girls nick nuzzled up against michael michael didnt fancy the little squit id like to piss on him said nick with a sudden surge of aggression that made michael go still i wouldnt want to do anything to him at all he is a bit wimpish maybe youd like something a bit more butch he mentioned a boxing champion low of brow high of aggression who was currently in prison for pummelling a waiter in a restaurant that could be a bit more of a challenge i hear hes hung like a horse talk about biting off more than you can chew eh oh all right sighed michael the brute arrived in an italian suit with a neck that was wider than his head imagine that on top of you you wouldnt need the viagra with him he wouldnt care if you were hard or not nicks merry little eyes said you didnt know i knew about the viagra did you he nudged him look at the size of it that would cure your haemorrhoids michael felt something move in the air that was also a tickle inside his head he felt it move and clench and try to hold go on said nick to the boxer drop em michael extended himself into the air he felt himself grapple with something michael pushed it back down and saw a tremor in the muscles around nicks mouth nick had tried to make the boxer lower his trousers i call the shots said michael nick chuckled nick had tried to take control of the miracle with a single swipe michael pushed the boxer back to where he had come from he felt his eyes blaze nick looked surprised all right you didnt like him michael was angry but could find no words that was not nicks problem i was just trying to find something you might like or do you only want me his eyes made of blue ice simply could not do melting warmth i may not want you at all warned michael aw baby was he being sarcastic or affectionate michael couldnt tell both explanations fitted his behaviour his tone of voice he stroked michaels arm lets just go to sleep nick turned off the light and swung his best feature towards michael michael felt his penis creep out of its shell in the dark nicks body was as warm and as comforting as a lovers nick was loyal nick never left him nick never gave up thinking of things to do for him i thought id finally tackle the old studio today nick said at breakfast he meant the place where picasso used to work it was still crowded with stuff the artist had thought he might use bicycle wheels a single furlined glove masses of magazines stained with paint sheets and towels crusty with dried colour dont do that let me call luis and see what he wants from it first michael looked at the flat with the newly polished wooden floors and clean kitchen counter tops he thought of luis and knew luis would demand he keep it for him no on second thoughts just chuck it for me nick passed him a packed lunch michael ate it alone at his desk chicken sandwiches an apple sticks of celery he got back from work and nick said you got the internet right do you think i could use it the throw rugs were out on the roof garden drying what for no downloading whole videos no no just a few images youre a mean bugger aint ya yes i am how many images look ill be careful all right each night dinner was direct from cookbooks boeuf en croute curries with raisins and homemade chapatti every day a different part of the flat would have been scrubbed and polished michael would come home to be presented with internet images of twelveyearolds in loincloths students in a wrestling school in india pubescent under folds of cloth doesnt that look sweet go on admit it theyre lovely nick moved the computer into the bedroom he downloaded images of a man who had cut off his penis and was now hammering nails through his testicles the man had posted it himself with an email address for responses nick giggled more like an enail i mean that one would let you do anything to him anything at all nicks eyes burned with a tiny pinprick light and his high greasy forehead gleamed like an icefloe michael would be reading a book in bed and nick would call here you got to see this michael looked up wearily look at this fat old whore she loves being made fat look shes got a progress chart here shes fattening herself up like a goose she says she wants someone to keep her in a dungeon and forcefeed her and then cook her and eat her this struck nick as being wildly funny i mean she actually wants to be cooked michael looked at the womans face she was smiling bright and intelligent she looked like someone who might work for him he felt sick i want that stuff off my hard disk i want you to go and empty the cache and make sure it stays empty nick laughed at him ohhoho man you dont know the half of it you really dont and i dont need to that stuff is illegal and its criminal no its not they do it to themselves they do it to themselves because because their imaginations have been corrupted ohho man listen to you you sound like someones maiden auntie people just do not naturally cut off their cocks they do it because it has a social meaning thats why they want people to send them email that means there has to be a social system for it to have meaning in the first place and people like you are creating it nick was still roaring ahhaall right ill get the stuff off your bleeding hard disk ill bring it in on video instead this struck him as particularly funny and sure enough michael came home the next day to find a video from russia playing on his television a soldier was being lifted up and lowered onto a waiting cock he winced from pain he glanced directly at the camera hoping for it to stop then he threw his head back in pain the two men who bounced him up and down glanced nervously at each other was this right michael punched off the power what would have happened if id brought a colleague home with me youd have changed channels nick giggled i would have turned you off thats what i meant nicks laughter subsided you really wouldnt have the right to do that you know nick stood up to face michael he was smiling with some kind of catlike satisfaction his voice started out silky but roughened as he spoke whatever i am michael i am a living thinking feeling being you have no more right to switch me off or send me back than a mother has a right to throttle her own child you got that you think about it michael while youre being so high and bloody moral about everything michael had no answer im not one of your bleeding little chickens you called me up now youre responsible for me what am i supposed to do eh run around and pick up your shitstained underwear and wash it just so youll let me stay alive am i supposed to go back to my trade which incidentally i was doing very well at dont you think people might notice michael if two nick dodders showed up in the same business in the same town im here because of you mate and youre stuck with me michael was caught completely off guard you could get a job oh cheers thanks charming without any papers without anything to prove who i am except someone else who lives with his wife in vauxhall yeah a job right so were agreed then are we michael was lost agreed about what i get to stay here until i find a job and can support myself i need to think about that well you better think about it michael because i dont have anywhere else to go nicks voice rose extremely effectively to a bellowing roar of outrage and i am fed up with you threatening to kill me every time i do something you dont like got that michael found he was shaking sorry to shout said nick deflating im stuck with him my god hes right im stuck with him and after dinner nick slid next to him under the sheets and said im sorry mike i lost my temper all right its just this whole thing gets on my nerves im an active guy no pun intended and this hanging around the house just isnt good for me look ive got an idea see us both out of a hole all right what is it michael said knowing he wasnt going to like it theres no point me applying for ordinary jobs i got no skills and even if i could prove who i was all it would do is show i got my education in the slammer so ive got to work for myself right now i got an idea for a bit of whats called basketweave marketing its porn right said michael its better than that mate picture this youre a retired bengali millionaire right youre fat youre old youre rich and youre staying in a posh hotel you go on line and you see a lovely bit of video and its got this beautiful blond hunk hung like a horse well youre as black as the ace of spades and you got a kink for blonds and it says no money upfront you can have this beautiful blond hunk just pay us when he shows up well youre a bit suspicious but you done something similar before so you have a go and five minutes later shall we say miraculously there is an angel on your doorstep with a big blond dick and orders to shoot and he doesnt do nothing until we receive your securely encrypted credit card number nicks eyes were glazed he seemed to be staring into some kind of paradise huh you can even download the video as a souvenir michael wanted this not to work there would be no video it would disappear when they did nick cuddled up to him well part of the idea is that our angels wouldnt disappear no offence but the way you treat us is a bit exploitative tuh you send us packing as soon as youve used us now wed keep our angels and that would be good for business cos you see you never really take off as a business if you stay a takeaway you got to have premises people like to eat out sometimes sometimes its a bit inconvenient with the inlaws staying people like to see a real address in the real world they wont pay the bill otherwise so wed keep em all in a hotel all our angels maybe lots of hotels once we got going all around the world and that would be the pitch see the video have the hunks eat in eat out michael was caught off guard that would cost a fortune nick lolled his head on michaels chest not as much as you think you see normally you got to pay a living wage i mean your staff have to eat right wrong nick groaned to himself with genuine pleasure we wouldnt even have to feed them angels dont need to eat did you know that michael looked blank you havent been watching ive been going without food i dont even feel hungry i dont even need to wash havent you noticed i stopped doing that but i still smell of roses i dont need to buy clothes i just call up one of my old suits naw we just keep em hundreds of them as long as we want them in basements until we get going michael didnt have to think he just said it sounds like hell well not once we get enough dosh to fix the places up michael was certain of one thing im not going to do this nick fell coldly back onto the bed well what are we going to do then he looked back at michael perhaps he saw something gather in michaels eyes his own went soft and begging please dont kill me michael all right im inconvenient i didnt ask to be born you brought me here in case i was a good fuck and i was i dont like being fucked michael but i let myself be fucked because the alternative was not being here at all and that is why i say what are we going to do about this hmm you have to be part of the solution michael you got to take some responsibility michael was cold all over and sweaty he ran a hand over his forehead this was always coming he realized sooner or later i would call something like this up i either kill him or i let him live ive never stood for anything in my life i never marched in protest i never turned down a job because it was immoral i guess i thought i was a good person because i paid my bills and hadnt actually killed anyone and that so far is the meaning of my life no harm done i dont like nick bit his lip and looked pained he shrugged his eyebrows as if to say its best to use the honest word blackmailing people but this could get really nasty i can be nasty sometimes i just cant help it theres too much gone on in the past look i was on the game for a while all right i got kicked out of the house and my house was a house of professional thieves i was too much even for them theres nothing i havent done i dont trust myself staying here with you i advise you to get rid of me strongly so thats why im asking now what alternatives do we have that was exactly what michael was thinking i could give you money but that would mean i would always be giving you money i could get rid of you and tell myself you were never real but unfortunately you are right you are a thinking feeling being and i do not have the right to destroy you and i could let you do what you want to do which which i think is some kind of betrayal of what all of this is about nick pressed his advantage you could give me money to make a film that might do it do you have a spare fifty k or i suppose i could go and talk to my opposite number by which i mean nick i suppose i call him nick the guard gave a little wave with his fingertips and mimed a cute embarrassed hello do you think hed be pleased to see me michael it might take some explaining but it would also prove that i wasnt lying about the man in camden town who can call up angels and at the end of it i think he might be just as interested as me in the commercial possibilities only the real nick dodder wouldnt be in your thrall would he and that nick isnt one bit nicer than this one michael thought im being threatened he still held nick in his arms or we maybe could go ahead with my takeaway idea you provide the cheap raw materials and i do the rest if you were smart michael thats what youd do because if you did that you would be rich it was as if the crumpled bed were a plain they were looking down on it in the dark in a camden bedroom and they could see an entire world it was a world in which mankind finally had what it wanted an inexhaustible supply of whores who were at last actually subhuman torture bondage snuff all of it and no harm done nick chuckled we could mix and match you know build the perfect man a bit of brad there a bit of a buck porn star where it counts pretty little boys with holes just above their cocks so you could fuck them frontwise people could pay to sleep with elvis presley or president kennedy or marilyn just after she snuffed it we could offer hot or cold running marilyn trying it on its called you step just a little over the line to see what you can get away with itd be a public service we could get the serial killers in lovely little things they could do to our angels and in the end no harm done it would save real lives that would michael the dennis nilsens of this world could cut young men in half and leave the drains unblocked nick chuckled you try it on and if nothing stops you you go on until you destroy the world or rather sell it until nothing worth having exists no naw nicks cuddle became a little shake naw you got everything you want dont you michael youve got no ambition you know that no ambition except you just want to be left alone hmmm ok then heres something else we could do that would leave you alone the king james version of the bible calls them the little foxes its a mistranslation it really should read the little fruitbats the little fruitbats land so lightly and nibble at the edges leaving toothmark scrapes on the skin of the pears you cant believe anything so small could become such a threat so quickly love starts small too a pleasant smile over drinks that grows into a lifetime of care this was the opposite of love and it starts out with a quick fuck nick kissed michael on the cheeks youd never see me again i promise he smiled all you have to do is give me the power to make angels michael was quick i cant do that hmm you can give me different clothes have you tried to give someone else the power you havent have you so you dont know michael understood something and went cold youve already tried to call them up by yourself nick chuckled of course i have you dont think id just sit around all day by myself surely go on give it a go see if you can im sure that i cant you mean youre sure you wont you dont think youre being just the slightest bit territorial here michael its like ihave the power nobody else is going to get it its not mine to give bullshit whose is it then gods i wasnt aware that you scientists had proof that god exists you dont know what this is for michael or where it comes from he imitated michael sounding nerdish and american its not mine to give well its plainly not yours to take is it at last michael had said something undeniable nick sighed no its not look were both tired lets just sleep on it maybe we can find a way for you to help me make my film thats all i want michael just find a way to make a bit of dosh all right good night after all making dosh was what was really valued making dosh was good nick kissed him on the cheek turned around and was soon asleep he left michael turning and twisting staring into the darkness im a prisoner he realized hes got me this little horrible turd has got me stitched up he thinks michael sat up and looked at nick in the dark he listened to nick breathe he is alive michael thought but its a different kind of life its a life i can control and because it comes from me perhaps i can see what is always there more clearly like the extraordinary circumstance of breathing just of breathing by itself oxygen invades the blood carried by blood cells which feed the mitochondria the element they need to spark fuel into energy to maintain the slowburning fire that is life the brain doesnt even need to think about it it is delegated the brain puts together sound and images it harvests the world and gives it shape sounds smells and then it can think about it all creating evergrowing forests of abstraction invisible codes names equations rules for handling the world and desire desire perhaps the biggest miracle of all desire the imperative without source or logic or cause desire simply there in the bones the brains desire that sets the priorities for the self and all its processes i need this what do i do to get it now i need that and move to get that too nick looked so harmless asleep his face in the light from the window looked young and without blemish his breath smelt of innocence is this what a parent feels to see in someone else so clearly just how extraordinary the puzzle is breath blood food sweat bones teeth eyes how they all fit together a million miracles more miracles than you can count all boiled down to one particular miracle the one that you fed at your breast the one whose face looks like its fathers the one you named parents love like god they say my son is a murderer but i dont stop loving him my daughter is on drugs and calls me bitch and whore but i dont leave her desire makes life and life makes responsibility which sounds so dull and wearying but its the goal of lust it is what lust strives to produce responsibility ok my little vicious angel all you can see is greed and you are far too old for me to change that and youre driven by all the men who fucked you when you didnt want it because because you didnt know you were a miracle i could get inside your head and try to cure it forcefully who would i turn you into nick i could make you into oh someone who wants to do good in the world you could go and work for an aids charity and all i would have to do is completely reconstruct your personality and do i know how to do that can i give you a happy childhood in say slough with weekends in the country and if i could would that be enough to make you kind and good i would need to invent parents who believed there was more than money and conflict and status so whose parents would i give you id need to give you their loving genes as well since i dont know enough about the mix of inheritance and upbringing and that would mean you would have a different face in other words i could replace you with an entirely different person and how would that be one jot different from killing you i dont know enough my angel to stir that little head of yours around as if it were soup i have to remember however clever you are that you are a poor powerless creature you want to make hell but you cant do it without me so you wont do it you will however do whatever else it is in your nature to do michael knew then what he was to do he felt calm he even liked himself he gave the sleeping nick a kiss on the cheek and covered nicks bare cold arm with his own in the morning michael was up first it was he who cooked breakfast nick stumbled out scowling with sleepiness surprise and turned tables my turn to cook this time said michael what are you so bloody cheerful about nick slumped into the chair life said michael he presented a plate of bacon and eggs to him and ive decided what im going to do about you oh yeah sniffed nick smelling of sleep and trying to sound unconcerned and what would that be absolutely nothing michael smiled oh yeah yeah theres nobody responsible for you mate but you so go ahead you want to stay in this world be my guest like everything else human or angel youll have to decide what to do next how youre going to live where how go ahead decide thats life nicks jaws worked youll never get rid of me that way who says i need to nick coughed suppose i smash the place up michael chuckled does it look like i care about this place nick was waking up suppose i go to the real nick dodder go ahead i dont suppose the real nick dodder gives a flying fuck about anybody does he whats he going to do give you half his income say move in with my wife listen mate nick dodder is a shit he gets a certain perverse satisfaction pandering porn he wants to hurt as many people human or angel as he can hes a real nasty piece of work who cheats on his wife and who if the world let him would poison it but you you are no longer nick dodder you have an opportunity mate you can become different you could become a nice person if you put your mind to it but in the end its all up to you even if i were your dad or lord god almighty it would still be up to you and not me so michael put on his suit and pulled on his shoes and nick ate slowly sullenly ignoring him so michael said again up to you nick oh and dont presume i am no saint nick do anything to hurt me and how do you know i wont lose patience and send you back nick blinked at him you dont said michael michael went to work and sat down in his office to look at reports he heard a peeping sound he nipped out of his office to the warm and darkened redlit chamber it was full of chicks he had a single moment of profound confusion michael stood in the circle of his own self which is timeless for a moment he thought that these were the last batch of chicks without quite understanding why he felt so shocked then he remembered we killed them michael gathered himself in and feeling delicate walked into ebrus office rocking like a table with uneven legs ebru why did we order more chicks she looked up i ah sorry michael i dont understand you when did we order more chicks she looked at emilio michael could feel sweat on his upper lip if we need them for more data you should have asked me we need to control expenditure ebru went very still her eyes widened and she looked worried and she said extremely carefully michael what are you talking about the darkroom is full of chicks how did they get there michael i cleaned the darkroom out yesterday there is nothing there now its full of chicks come and see ebru rolled her eyes but they stayed wide she looked like someone whose boss has finally gone mad and is beginning to wonder if she herself has not helped drive him over the edge the eyes got wider as she heard the sound the sound of need driving new life chicks peeping ebru followed michael through the double sets of doors which stopped all light entering the room was thick with the smells of straw and faeces ebru took her head into her hands and saw in the red light in their warmed cages were chicks this this was empty michael i did not do this maybe no no i dont think anyone would do this without consulting and michael understood i did this ive restored them he picked up one of the chicks and felt it shivering i need the shivering pleaded i need food and warmth i need to be held i need my mother i need to live i restored them because i love them and that means the miracle is not for lust its for love as well lust love driving life you were dead michael thought at the chick we killed you and so i brought you back he lifted the chick to his lips and kissed it angel he pronounced it he looked at it in the red light murder undone restitution he came up with an explanation that would appear logical we probably ordered these some time ago and they just arrived but who hatched them who put them in the cages who brought the cages back michael michael shrugged hmmm who knows somebody who was doing their job but ebru i dont want these chicks killed all right absolutely not michael certainly certainly no ebru was fierce something had gone wrong and she was mortified nobody is to blame ok ebru what will we do with them feed them we still have some feed left over dont we yes i was going to throw it all out ebru made a desperate gesture with her hands in her hair dont worry ebru its fine its all fine michael still cradled the little chick to his bosom ebru stood still her cheeks were outlined in the red light but he could not see her facial expression after a moment she said you love them dont you michael he sighed yes yes i do she chuckled nervously that is not a scientific attitude oh i dont know it just depends on the kind of science youre talking about he thought of life of how it extended to wherever angels came from and if you could make angels out of chicks what did that mean for humans she stepped forward and lightly touched his arm when the project is over we will talk ok he nodded there is a mystery here michael yes he said there certainly is ebru left and alone in the dark he began to think dominion over the animals over the fish over the fowl over the cattle we never knew what that meant responsibility we are responsible for them they are our children too michael sat on the floor of the darkroom and held up the chicken to look at it what shall i call you eh he asked it the beak was stretched wide open hungry for everything i could call you ali or bottles i could call you johnny or mark maybe i could even call you nick michael stood up and gently tipped the chick back onto straw learn he told it and he went and turned on the lights light flooded the room experiment ruined no reason to kill them a second time he left the lights burning to make the point michael finished his days work well he was determined that the lives and deaths of the previous batches would not be wasted they would be wasted if the evidence were not in order or the results without meaning he melted through the reports he saw what the stains meant the stains went into incredibly convoluted patterns patterns he saw that were already there we are born with our potential even chicks their brains extend beyond this world back forward wherever it is we come from silent as settling snow experience falls on prepared ground at the close of that day the world made sense for michael he went into the offices and said good night to them ebru emilio and they said good night back as if pleased to have him return he walked back to waterloo station his feet crossing in front of each other again but not from exhaustion but from a kind of joy when michael got home there was a mass of pink flesh mewling on the carpet it looked a bit like an unshelled crayfish only it was the size of an alsatian nick leaned against the wall all sweaty and pale and ill i nearly did it nick said not quite what the porn market demands right now but ill get better michael paused that was meant to be a copy of me wasnt it yeah nicks laugh was a shiver serve you bloody right mate let you know what its like gently michael waved it out of existence nicks eyes they were metallic like the heads of drills that were somehow pointed inwards ill keep going ill keep going till i do it michael sighed not while im here you wont there was something in the air and in michaels head at the same time something like a tentacle or an arm a member shall we say and it rose up and tried to touch michael or rather michaels power michael grabbed hold of it felt it twist and turn in the air and he wrestled it to the ground and pushed it back and down nick even involuntarily made a swallowing sound nick was covered in sweat ill go cook dinner he said he stumbled into the kitchen he cut up an onion he started to sing zippity do dah he left the knife on the counter top the onions sizzled michael sat down and took off his shoes he had a corn on his right toe and it was twitching ill give you a hand he said out of habit he went to the kitchen counter can i do anything he asked nick turned and drove the knife into michaels heart michael didnt feel anything except a kind of inconvenience in the chest breathing had become choked and unnecessarily difficult the knife was lodged deeply and blood was pouring down his shirt into his trousers itll be hell to clean up michael thought so said nick i guess you wont be here then there was very little time left no time to be afraid everything closed around michael in a rush the floor felt like a bed cushioned and soft and there was a reassuring sound like rain on a roof a sizzle like onions the hiss of white noise on a stereo michael floated as if in a warm bath somewhere up towards a corner of the kitchen nick and michael their little drama seemed further and further away he saw nick lean over michael he saw the fat glisten on the wooden spoon he saw the eyes go still and dry nick knelt next to michael almost as if he were going to help the emotions michael felt were the same poor boy he felt for them both dying was delicious like lying in late like being on the beach at twelve years old when you wanted nothing more than to be it was as if all work had ceased and everything been done to perfection death was like deciding just this once not to take out the garbage or not to do the ironing it was like all the times when need is not strong enough to make you move death was like fulfilment desire was no more there really was no longer any need to look at anything so michael ceased to see vision was blotted out by direction michael felt a tug and looked inward all he could see was a tunnel of light yes it was the optic nerve closing down that was evident to michael as soon as he saw it it looked like a scan for glaucoma when light is flashed deeper and deeper into the eye shifting from yellow to red as it penetrates you had to understand as michael did what the optic nerve was it was a flow of time light triggers electrochemical pulses which flow along the nerve in the current of time deep into the head it is broken apart like a sentence into a thousand grammatical parts these are sent to a thousand different parts of the brain now i am the light michael realized and he travelled in time in one direction only up the nerve into the self michael was read like grammar every cell in his brain that had ever been fired was fired at once and he felt the whole lifted up like a giant tangle of christmas tree lights lifted up as one final shape and it moved outside of time to where time was not and nothing more could happen it preceded michael entered eternity and froze its final frozen shape spangled with light seemed to be like a giant illuminated flower in reds and yellows sparkling with dew and michael dying still barely in time was able to survey it he was without location without volume he was a centre of gravity contemplating his life able to think of something new one last time able to call for salvation able to regret able to feel joy in that eternal life there was michael flinging snow in the high sierras there he was toting his bag to school there he was in the rialto cinema oceanside watching the sting there was michael on a small funfair ride with his dad at la jolla he had forgotten that there was little michael taking a bath in a washingup bowl and his mother blowing bubbles at him there was michael in his bedroom at night memorizing lists of endocrines there he was pumping weights there he was in thailand there he was bicycling in france with mark sipping calvaoutside a bar tabac there he was making love to a yearold from brooklyn whom he had forgotten there he was staring down a microscope into the stained patterns of a chickens brain there he was on the platform at waterloo station cursing himself cursing life and there were the dreams they were real to the self there were dinners of dogs heads in his mothers kitchen there were missed trains that turned into scarves trapped in car doorways michaels mind saying to itself while consciousness slept wake up michael youre forgetting something wake up michael youre walking the wrong way michael look at me i am here michael saw something under the petals of light it snagged them held them twisted them shook them it was dark like a shadow and it still lived and it heaved and it dragged michael saw all the parts of his brain that had never been fired they had been there before he was born they were waiting for his birth to become real he had lived a life and never used them they were the wastes they howled these wastes they were enraged they shook the flower of light wanting to be born as light the wastes were desire and desire did not want to die there in that desert michael was not there was michael not loving mark there was michael not travelling to india or china there he was not not riding a jeep over the mountain terraces of yemen there he was not failing to hold his own children there he was not bringing meals to his sick dying brothers there he was not omitting to call his mum there he was not never an actor on a stage there was michael without the brothers and sisters he never had there was michael not with his father for the last ten years of his life there they were not hiking the length of the john muir trail there was the michael who had not known his father as a little boy there was the michael who had never known true love and above all there was michael who had not slept with his father dad dad dad dad dad hello mikey a voice seemed to say hello my beautiful boy dad daddy ipicked you up when you were born all wet and i held you up to the light and i said please jesus let this one live let him be all he can be michael wanted to be held and to hold in return it was too late for that and i left you we carry our dead around with us as patterns we have learned love injects them into us semen is only the faintest physical mirroring of it the patterns are as alive as we are the voice of michaels living father told him you dont want to die mikey nothing happens after you die the shadow wastes howled forever mourning that howling would sear like sand blown in wind it would burn like fire and it would never cease desire was immortal and continued after death and that was hell heaven was what had been achieved you cant make up for things you cant make anything right nothing can happen this thought michael is the wrong time for me to die he saw his desire formless and aching and true to itself he saw it trying to twist the flower even in death desire tried to twist the nothingness like gravity it tried to wrench being from nothing desire reached out in rage and thrashed and seized and shook it was as if the shadow cast the light and not the other way around the darkness was the spider that spun the cobweb on which the dewdrops hung michael had always had a talent he could absorb people into his bones out of love and could make his bones and mind move like they did if he were thwarted enough he could wrench the molecules of the air and make them move and leap and think michael knew then he had made the angels himself of headaches and grief and rage desire made michael want to live right thought michael and desire blossomed in him like a dark flower blooming out of his heart right he said prising open reality forcing it like an arsehole to accept him the wrong way through the valve right and michael tore reality he saw nick was propping open one of michaels eyelids nick contemplated this stare quizzically as if it were a painting of his own that he was judging poor angel thought michael michael saw again what he had seen the night before the potential in the translucent skin again it was the waste that michael saw its what a parent sees and aches for and forgives and punishes out of love michael called up his living father his avenging father wore mirror shades and his marine uniform and stood six foot four he put a hand on nicks shoulder nick spun around and gaped in terror michaels father hauled him to his feet and held him and bore him off michael sent nick back up the nerve into eternity to nicks own unilluminated self the air closed shut over them all did we learn anything michael woke up in crisp white sheets he smelled them first and then opened his eyes and saw pale blue walls ebru was sitting on a small hard chair legs crossed reading a magazine michael wanted to ask her the time he couldnt talk something harsh and foreign was stuck into his nose and down his gullet and it was long and slithering and he thought it was some kind of worm he cried aloud and tried to hoist it out of him ebrus head snapped up inshallah she murmured and launched herself beside him grabbing his wrists no michael no its ok michael awwww was all he could say his throat was unbelievably parched he could feel these things reaching all the way down into his belly my god what were they sssh rest michael you have been sick you are in hospital sssh he calmed down panting he ached in all his joints and his feet felt huge and his knuckles looked swollen swollen and gnarled at the same time do not try to talk michael ok ok michael you just nod your head ok i am going now just to get the doctor leave those things ok she ran out of the room and her sneakers on the linoleum made noises like mice michael looked around hills and valleys of sheets rippled over him there was a drip feed into one of his arms the skin on his hands had gone scaly and his wrists and forearms were the same width there was tape like a very thick moustache on his upper lip he tried to think but it was as though his brain was elsewhere huge and fiery and unwilling to cram itself back into his tiny skull it waited halfunsure that it wanted to be there nick tried to kill me thats why im here in sudden alarm his hands skittered down the hospital cloak to his chest there were no bolts and stitches no swollen tissue the knife wounds were gone the door thumped ebru stood in the doorway holding it open as if remembering her manners her eyes round with something like fear a male nurse bustled in around her he was small neat pale friendly cold he reminded michael of nick all right mr blasco lets have a look at you what day is it michael sounded like donald duck the nurse chuckled i wouldnt try to talk if i were you ebru still clung to the lintel of the door its thursday michael hed been out of it for several days the nurse leaned over and propped open one of michaels eyes and shone a light into it do you feel dizzy or weak michael nodded his head im not surprised neither am i i came back from the dead youre not that bad considering if youre awake we can probably get rid of the tubes hold still this is going to give you a free shave the male nurse grinned as if hed said something funny as it was torn off his upper lip the tape sounded as if the nurse were ripping up michaels best shirts it did hurt uprooting stubble are you ready these are coming out now with a certain degree of professional skill the nurse began to haul at the tubes as if pulling a barge it didnt hurt exactly it was just horrible having something slither up through the hiatus valve then up his gorge michael began to retch the tubes heaved their way through his nasal membranes burning with stomach acid and smelling of vomit michael coughed and expelled the tubes at the nurse with fluids the male nurse smiled and sneered at the same time right he said wrapping up the tubes and placing them in a bag we can feed you properly now which is more than you were doing for yourself he began to haul off surgical gloves like a trick anxious to get home whipping off a condom youve been a silly boy havent you youd have left us if your colleague here hadnt come to find out where you were so theyre going to send you to some counselling find out what thats all about otherwise youll be fit as a fiddle in no time you sound croaked michael as if you think i dont deserve to be the male nurse didnt respond he polished off the task of throwing out the gloves as well he sealed the bag in silence dr oconnor will be here soon he said to ebru then he was gone ebru stared at him for a few moments michael she said shaking her head michael what happened michael wasnt sure what do they say is wrong they say you must have had nothing to eat for weeks her hands twisted they think it is an eating disorder aw michael understood nick had done all the cooking all those takeaways curries and stews they were all undone all those neatly packed lunches they now no longer existed angels cannot really even care for people ill show you what happened said michael and he called nick back the air did a belly dance and unveiled and nick came back oh shit he said and then ooooh shit ebru gave a faint little cry michael told her keep well back from him he is dangerous nick froze looking watchful im going to let you live nick ebru was at some kind of end michael what is this michael kept talking to nick im doing this for my sake because i do not kill also i wanted my colleague here to know that i am not crazy ive learned my lesson said nick oh no you havent it will take a lot longer than that for you to think your way through it ebru was still hiding her heart under her hand michael where did he come from nick answered her from eternity love im an angel michael makes what he calls angels he thinks hes god no i dont the blue eyes were fixed upon him youre god to me shall i tell you whats going to happen to you michael youre going to have the same life that god had nick gave a narrow amused little smile and god has had a terrible life he sniffed he keeps trying to do good im going to put you where you can do no harm you know how they seal radioactive material away they drop it into salt caverns a mile deep and the salt migrates and closes so nothing can get out im going to put you into one of those caverns nick and ill give you companions you can make a kind of porn with them if thats all you think theyre good for they can be your little demons nick was sourly resigned i always said prison went with the territory then maybe prison is what you want watcha nick made his fingers into a pistol you could have been such a handsome devil nick you could have been one of those bitchy standup comedians who trade on their whiff of cordite and who mellow with success a chat show host or a racing car driver something flash with sporting gear and sponsorship but nothing actually athletic anything that required aggression and the common touch what you will need to become now is a philosopher be yourself said michael and cast him down the air folded around nick like a pair of closing buttocks the room was still except for the sweat trickling down ebrus forehead michael what was that michael sat up he was very weak but he had been fed and rehydrated he felt light as if his bones were hollow michael felt like a bird ill explain he promised excuse me while i dress there is something i need to do you will stay here michael said ebru folding her arms a trolley with food came a cheerful black lady came i am your nutritionist she announced this may not look good but it is delicious it was a kind of pabulum with mashed bananas eating it gave michael stomach cramps but soothed his throat it was night by the time the doctor had examined him and the discharge papers were filled in thank you ebru thank you for helping me do you think you could come with me to the lab ebru took him by the arm and walked him to goodge street tube station michael was too weak to talk over the noise of the train it lurched and made him feel queasy he thought instead of what he was going to do he saw himself setting the chicks free in the park they were nervous at first clustering around his feet their down blown in different directions by the wind then suddenly they spread out around him showing against the dark grass as if fluorescent as ebru led him from lambeth north michael told her everything that had happened since the first day of the project i would not even begin to believe said ebru if i had not seen with my own eyes she pointed outward from her cheekbones as if warding off the evil eye there will come a time ebru when you wont remember this all youll remember is that i was ill but youll think more kindly of me i always thought kindly of you michael shafiq was at the security desk ebru called to him he looked up in alarm shafiq it is only us she said reassurance seemed to slim shafiq down he grew sleeker he stood up grinning michael you are all right they said you were he looked at ebru for reassurance not well im ok shafiq i i would like us to let the birds loose shafiq and ebru glanced at each other michael insisted they cant die ebru they dont need to eat so they stay cold and miserable all winter long she said these are the ones we killed ebru said no theyre not see for yourself she helped him down the corridor which was longer than he remembered to the darkroom door she swung it open the light as he had left it was on they would have seen light for a week ebru picked one of them up and gave it to him already the creature was bigger older than any of their chicks had been it looked up at michael with reptilian eyes they are already different ebru said michael smiled at himself so i could have set free a race of immortal superhens in archbishops park he saw them chasing children he saw vermin control gassing them to no effect shafiq tried to help we thought we might sell them to a chicken farmer yuck said michael he thought of someone eating angels there was only one thing to do really faced with it goodbye then he said to his children and he sent them to rejoin their immortal selves the air throughout the darkroom roiled as if full of evaporating gas fumes the chicks were gone shafiq gasped and looked roundeyed at michael michael didnt have to look at him to know that he kept his eyes averted its just something temporary shafiq its just something temporary that i can do and it will be a good sign when it stops for that will mean the wastes have stopped howling michael sighed and slapped his thigh as if closing a boot and he asked ebru well did we prove anything ebru paused for a moment as if asked to cross a chasm on a rope bridge michael asked again our experiment did we learn anything by killing all those chickens ebru considered we prove they learn but we also prove that what they had to learn was in their brains to begin with is that something worth knowing yes ebru said and then again more fiercely yes it is was it worth killing them ebru sighed you need to find your own answer for that michael michael rubbed his eyes was there a chair he needed to sit down i know what the chickens answer would be ebru shook her head but you dont michael you cant know that is the whole difficulty she took him by one arm and spurred by her example shafiq took the other they led him hobbling back to the soontobeemptied office where he could sit down michael slumped into his chair were real he said we cant undo what weve done he surveyed the filing cabinets the dark pc screens thats what makes us real part iii what do you want for christmas for a while michael stalled the project wound down the results were conclusive the learning process caused a range of chemical changes in nerve cells the pathway of that chemical change through the brain was common some neural pathways for learning about light seemed to be preestablished at least in chickens michael began work on a small publishable paper for a respected scientific journal he let emilio go to his new job early shafiq was fine he simply went back to his agency and a new post geoffrey malterton at the council found another project that could use their facility he was pleased he would end up being the labs new director not michael it was left to michael and ebru to turn out the lights on the lab one last time and share a quiet drink at the pineapple michael still had his teaching once a week which was a living not a calling he explained the basics of neurology to students for whom it was not a calling either it was a way of increasing their earning potential they argued with him about each and every mark on their phase tests and worked out from their percentages so far whether or not getting an a on the final test would make any difference to their overall grade if it wouldnt then they would stop studying christmas came full of tinsel and loneliness the students left for home except the ones who had no home they stayed on in student accommodation playing disconsolate dance music michael went home for the holidays his mother had gone back to sheffield ten years ago and lived in a terrace house near where the city ended abruptly in green she had her garden and her friends she was an age when it is still insulting to be described as spry his mother had come into her own she made an effort her hair was dyed a believable shade of ash you could see she had once been pretty and elegant though there was also now something firm around her outlined eyes she was good with a screwdriver and hard on building contractors she was confident in life she greeted michael without fuss kissing him on the cheek and patting his arm youve lost weight it suits you she didnt get that stricken are you eating look she just said as she would to one of her mates you fancy something to eat yeah sure a cheese sandwich or something i can make it go on then youll find all the things in the usual place you can make me a cup of tea while youre at it when he came back with the tray she already had the christmas cards out ready for signing she didnt believe in this nonsense of sending everything months in advance you did your christmas cards at christmas you forgot the spoons its all right my turn she stood up and came back with spoons and a white envelope you havent been ringing me and it turned out you even moved without telling me you daft pillock so i knew something was wrong that you werent telling me so i wrote you this she put the letter next to the tray go on have your tea you can read it later after the cards there were fewer and fewer cards each year one to their cousins in new zealand one to his mothers best friend beryl now in canada one to the blascos in san diego they were an isolated family they only had each other in the old days people didnt move about so much i suppose there were more of you around it seemed are you on this email because i was thinking its probably a good way for me to keep in touch could you set me up on it that would indeed be something good to do with the long and sometimes pointless days of christmas sure could in fact it would be great fun and it solved the problem of what to buy his mum for christmas instead of a scarf or chocolates they did the cards and she brought out the roast chicken with its clogged brandname stuffing and both of them ate hardly anything so are you going to tell me whats wrong youve broken up with philip broken up with everything i um forgot to apply for the grant so the project ended so youre at a bit of a loose end shall i tell you what the letter says save you reading it ok it goes like this the worst things that happen to you in life turn out to be the best things like your father he left me on my own and i thought ill never cope but look at me now and then i got that phone call from him telling me that you were gay and youd done something terrible but he wouldnt say what it was except that he was plainly going to blame me well that gave me the chance id been waiting for i finally stood up to the man i just told him it isnt your fault and its not mine either so dont go putting all the blame on me its just who our michael is and what of it ive known for ages its no news to me and you should have known too if you had your eyes open michael chuckled what did he say nothing he could say it was all true he said youre right mavis i felt sorry for him by the end of the conversation i sometimes think i killed him mavis wiped crumbs off her knee sniffed and said so what was it then this terrible thing you did michael thought then answered i made a pass at him his mother nodded once downwards people dont die from having a pass made at them michael that tickled michael and he chuckled no i guess not he didnt have himself sorted he was all front michael saw his fathers face big and needy i look at it this way because of all that you knew that i knew you didnt have to spend twenty years screwing up your courage to tell me i could just ask you straight out if phil was your boyfriend and make up the double bed speaking of which have you found yourself someone a bit more down to earth now no no one sorry for prying mothers prerogative anyway youll be all right michael youre smart you work hard youre a kind person ive known you since you were born youll be fine love that was indeed what the letter said that night in bed michael read the letter over and over when he was young his mother was always telling him to be careful now she was telling him to be brave how could i tell you mum about the miracle could i say i have the power to generate flesh from dream would you think i was crazy or am i just underestimating you again what would you say michaels head unconsciously adopted the slightly sideways bolshiness of her enquiring position and his eyes took on her slow burn and he knew she would say so how is all that any different from wanking he thought and answered her you can touch them and they have minds of their own so how is it any different from the real thing michael thought again and said its safer he saw mavis chortle just before she stood up to take out the tea things you mean like trainer wheels on a bicycle theyll have to come off sooner or later love finally michael folded the letter away and snuggled down under the duvet that smelled of fabric conditioner he felt safe and warm like a child which is what christmas is for he leaned across and snapped off the light goodnight mavis he said to her eternal and developing spirit he slept until something in the night stirred there was a smell of talcum powder and liniment and the sheets parted and someone huge and smooth and naked slipped next to michael biceps and forearms as big and wholesome as loaves of brown bread enveloped him hello mikey his father said his voice low and hot and close to his ear jesus christ hissed michael in panic and threw off the bedclothes and spidered backwards away from him street lights shone through the curtains michael saw his fathers big and handsome face and the light reflected in his eyes the eyes shone with yearning you know what this is now mikey it was a statement you know what this means sssh michael was frightened to shock his mother yes he knew what this was he had reached down into the darkness and pulled something back like a plum what he had really wanted outside time all this time so whats different his father asked rumbling deep as if out of the springs of the bed what will be different is that this time you will want me his father looked young now almost like a teenager he and his father were now nearly the same age their hands were the same size louiss hand enveloped his and coaxed him back towards him no said michael shell hear mum is real and you are not michael pointedly rolled over and turned his back the bulk of his father shifted closer to him it was the smell that was the most powerful indescribable and immediate his smell the smell of his body still vaguely like honey the smell of this breath tainted from too much exercise a bit sharp even vinegary the smell of american soap different from english those ripped muscles when pressed all around him were soft and smooth and gentle as if a giant baby were holding michael not a yearold marine sergeant who could kill automatically on demand merry christmas sergeant blasco murmured and michael let himself be held yes dad this is what i wanted yes dad this is what i dreamed of night after night morning after morning but you know something dad big and beautiful as you are im not sixteen now and though it might be easy to slip into this im not going to do it im thirtyeight and its been too long and this is my mothers house michael resisted but michael let himself be held he settled into sleep he had a dream which mingled his father with santa he was a child and under the white fake beard his saw his fathers eyes then michael had to get up to pee he stood up and rammed the front of his foot into his bookshelf how could he forget the bookshelf it was where all his records were kept outside beyond the slatted venetian blind there was still the warm murmuring of the surf michael walked on towards the door and walked into a wall the door was on the left not the right he fumbled through it advising himself to remember the stairs are just in front of this door there were no stairs and the bathroom instead of straight ahead along the landing was right and then left again and michaels eyes started wide open and he stared and saw this was not his mothers house in sheffield this was the condo in oceanside michael looked down at his legs they were thicker and iceblue in the light he stroked them they were hairless michael was sixteen and smooth there was no hair on his chest and his nipples were sore and swollen from too much sunlight he looked down at his own chest with desire and stroked it himself at sixteen the dream was always of being someone else in a different situation in the end at root all the fantasies had been this fantasy michaels dick started to creep downwards this situation was that he was young only almost a man and that his father in the last days of his sexual power wanted him this was no dream michael was awestruck ive really done it now hed wrenched and pulled bodies out of nothingness and now the need had wrenched round everything else it had wrenched the whole universe around him this was the right miracle now this was the miracle he had really needed he had become someone else michael at sixteen again back home home in california without any viagra at all his dick was twice the size it had ever been and it was slammed straight up against his stomach reaching all the way to his belly button michael was wide wide awake as wide awake as he would be if he were walking barefoot across broken glass he remembered the flower of his self the flower of cobwebs and light and areas of dark it would not be thwarted that flower if even he himself blocked it it could wrench other realities into this one if thwarted sufficiently it could evidently pull him instead into another reality into this one michael at could resist but not michael at sixteen he felt the old white carpet under his bare feet and he felt the lining of his stomach seethe and michael started to weep as he walked out of relief and fear and joy he knew he would do it now it was really finally going to happen michael went to his father and hoisted up his smooth thick legs and he looked into his fathers eyes eyes that in this reality wanted him his fathers pubic hair was a tight little purse over his pressed genitals like so many men about to fucked he was not erect michael touched him his fathers ass was smooth the crease between the cheeks was smooth and the pucker of his sphincter was neat and tidy and hairless to michael at least it still smelled of honey michael needed neither ky nor spittle to ease the passage he was luminous with lubrication he entered his father and looked into his fathers eyes and his father nodded and closed them as if to dream michael saw his own young crouched thighs thick with muscle his own belly and his dick gently shifting in and out lapping like little waves on the shore of a lake my body isnt ugly michael told his father in his mind my sex is not ugly its a gift its a gift i wanted to give to you you didnt have to treat it like something dirty you could have said no no gently no i dont want this you could have been calm and wise and said no you feel like that now because you dont know me because weve been separated because i am a man to you and not your father you could have continued to love me and care for me and hope i would find myself and someone my own age you didnt have to go and kill yourself slowly you didnt have to try to kill me you might even have let me do this once out of love just once so i could escape you now weve gone and torn the real and i dont know if i can get back and i dont even know if i want to michael rocked back and forth and felt as if he were moving through curtains he saw his own body shift when he blinked it had hair again he was he had accelerated from one reality to another then he flipped back sixteen he kept moving back and forth between the two and that acceleration became part of the ride we are fucking reality dad and that acceleration rose within himself hurtling as if towards a brick wall and there was a sudden disintegrating crash and part of him seemed to fragment and burst apart scattering inside his fathers body he came in at least two different realities at once his fathers eyes were round and brown like a cartoon animals he looked trapped cornered then the eyes crumpled into a smile you really are the most beautiful man michael thought and michael rolled away and settled this was still the room in california in some kind of s michael was still sixteen cupped between his arms his own smooth pectorals swelled his fingers rippled over his own flat tummy and down his lean thighs there was a kind of sparking in the nerve ends and suppleness in his joints he could sense speed and reactivity there michael held up the sheet and looked again at his own sixteenyearold body the thought of being in that body and in this room in this situation made him rise again this time michael turned and rolled over and presented his father now was erect and reared over him and settled on top of him as heavy as the sky as heavy as god and the thought came it could go on like this i could stay here i could start over again i could stay sixteen for ever oh michael his father breathed out and shivered and went still they lolled in each others presence as if they were warm waves michael had finally obtained his ends he slept for a while he woke up when the oceanside train went past at am his mind was clear he touched his chest and it was covered with hair he looked down and saw the slightly greying fur and his plumper stomach his father still slept beside him only two years older than he was latin bigdicked as handsome as brendan fraser and michael did not want him in the least but this was still oceanside in michael was terrified he threw off the sheet and stood up and looked out the window there over the wall was the vacant lot next to the train tracks the lot was now a multiscreen cinema and there was a new train station my god what have i done michael still had to pee he turned and walked out of the room and there was a sensation as if he were parting shower curtains reality billowed and separated and closed shut behind him in the dark he felt his way straight along the landing next to the stairs michael pulled open the bathroom door in sheffield his mother had a s colour sense and the walls were lavender and the door lintel was mauve and on the toilet naked sat himself at sixteen he was wiping his butt and looked up his face was thicker and more obstreperous he looked curiously more like his mother close the door willya get the fuck outa here the accent was pure american he was beefier the strength concentrated in his shoulders and arms he can throw michael thought he plays football we need to talk said michael his arms thinner hairier his stomach softer ill be with you in a second youre straight arent you michael demanded whats it got to do with you fruit fly another self another fantasy michael sat on the edge of the bathtub what happened whatja mean to us you were straight what happened to you this other self flushed the toilet i dunno go back to that moment in oceanside when he pulls the car over and starts to cry because hes so happy you want to live with him for a while so you go and study in san diego you play on the football team and you get your degree what happens after that this other self circled gum round and round in his mouth and looked confrontational but curiously he had henrys puppydog eyes he was bronzed and had a terrible seventies haircut compromised beatle with sideburns he looked latin i met this girl you know in school so we got married i got my degree in veterinarian medicine we moved north to ventura where her folks are this was still in his future but he knew his future because he was timeless what happened to dad he lost his job at fortyeight but with an ncos payoff and stuff ill help him set up in a window repair business theres a real call for that in oceanside all that salt air on those aluminium french windows hell show up looking cool and all those divorced women man hell get a lot of ass this michael chuckled he doesnt drink well that latin blood he knows he suffers for it in the morning so hell take it easy his head jerked backwards his face was impassive this was how a tough guy laughed man you look so english i am so english you really gay yup whats that like no different from being straight except you lead a different life did you like really make a pass at dad yes jeesh youre really sick he was amused michael thought he was going to say something like grossout city instead he said do you like me too up to a point the teenagers grin was steady jeez what dont you like about me michael stirred your attitude i know whats inside and i know what youre hiding remember i never saw dad when we were kids so whenever i did see him he didnt feel like my father when i did see him he was my ideal man there was a glimmer of understanding the voice went softer mine too he sees my kids a lot he comes up that driveway and they go running out grandpa blasco grandpa blasco cause he always brings them little presents and stuff you know tell him i love him michael blasco sighed where i am you dont exist and him and me we dont have to tell each other that shit we just know cool said michael smiling cool agreed michael the angel he looked around him at the walls and his face screwed up with distaste are all english bathrooms this colour only mums i keep thinking ill go and visit i remember my english half too keep an eye open you might even see me in london england they didnt really have much to say to each other the other michael narrowed his eyes so i guess ill be on my way its been really weird ill go said michael he stepped out of the bathroom and looked down the corridor past both bedrooms to the sitting room somebody was watching the tv he could hear sobbing music and a breathy posed womans voice whisper a scripted lament he padded down the corridor the carpet and the walls were white in the oceanside living room another michael was watching a movie at am he was crying and hugging and chewing a pillow at the same time he was practically bald with long hair in wisps and just above the ears a line of black scabs michael sat down on the sofa next to him gently fearful of disturbing or even breaking him hiya he said gently hiya this michael replied miserable and with a quick jab wiped his face howya doin oh this one sighed not so chipper he had lost even more weight than our michael had where have you spent the last twenty years this michael didnt want to talk he wanted to watch his movie it was gene tierney who these days was a gene tierney fan are you gay long pause uhhuh an american yes did you marry dad longer pause i divorced him with a shiver of irritation curdled anger this michael suddenly roused himself and snapped off the television from the remote control he turned and faced michael looking like death so what exactly do you want to know what happened what the hell do you think happened michaels voice went soothing i dont know how long do you think you can stay married to your father oh id say until about six months after you graduate and then everyone starts to ask whens michael moving into a place of his own people start to say has michael got a girlfriend people start to say louis are you seeing anybody they start asking each other have you ever seen louis with a woman are you sure thats his son the other michael was looking at the tv as if the film were still showing thats about it plus its that plus i cant imagine plus it fucks you up fucks you both up you start saying to yourself every time you fuck and every time you dont fuck this is my father there is a word for this the word is incest its supposed to be wrong this michael punches the pillow and you start to look at guys your own age and he starts to think it would be a lot healthier if you split up if he found someone else too he says that to you you cry because its true and because goddammit you dont want anyone else who could ever compete with your dad michael asked did he start to drink the other michael just nodded he sighed raggedly and how lose his job just a quick nod yes he had to have dental work whatever that meant he got all fat youd find him in the hall in the morning and hed shat himself hed get drunk and yell things one day i just got in the car and started driving bad scene this michael chuckled and shuddered at once but you got out a kind of cough not really no no i wouldnt say that how come let your father fuck you for seven years and find out michael coughed i never did i tried i never did michael the angel said you end up in la you hit the bars and declare open season on your ass he shrugged it was the s i got sick michael love is there somebody there it was his mother calling from the spare bedroom michaels heart stopped he looked about the room this was california she shouldnt be there the other michael answered shouting towards the bedrooms its ok mom im just talking to myself he leaned towards michael michael could see the shape of his skull she came over to take care of me shes a nice lady she is murmured michael look i dont want her to see me the patients eyes said shed love to see you youre healthy see you around said michael you hope not said the other michael he flicked the film back on gene tierney sat in a casino that was in circles like a circus what year is it michael asked early before the threedrug treatment michael felt sick he walked unsteadily back to the california bedroom his father was in bed waiting for him but there were strands of muscle down his neck and his pectorals sagged like an old womans dugs and were thicketed with snowwhite hair his face had collapsed everything all right mikey he asked in a phlegmy quavering voice sure dad i love you baby his fathers agespotted hand clasped his i thought youd gone away the voice trailed off with relief from panic and it could have been this too me at and him how old michael started counting and got up to and stopped there was nowhere else to go michael lay down next to him his father smelled now of dentures and catheters and the ending up of things get out go away michael told the apparition leave me alone we never would have ended up here it would have been terrible sick sad michael looked back and in the bed there was himself himself at now as he was welcome home his self said and held open his arms michael could see that he was beautiful and he could see his body was beautiful the angel smiled shyly and rolled up and over and pulled open his cheeks and the fur crinkled apart to show the oddly innocentlooking croissant of an orifice michael leaned forward to kiss this lower mouth it was like having a foot massage an unloved part of the body responded with delight to unexpected tenderness michael both gave the kiss and felt it michael was surprised how feminine his body looked with its hips spread wide and the back arched this only made him love it more so he stretched forward and kissed the back of his own neck which he had never really been able to see before it was the youngest part of his body it looked sixteen years old even now his unreliable cock was now buoyant as if floating in salt water michael pushed forward but against anal resistance it missed and swept up the crease between the buttocks michael felt his own penis between his cheeks and he felt his angel feeling himself feeling that he seemed to stand between two mirrors and feel himself reflected off into infinity michael pushed forward again and felt himself sheathed and entered at the same time there was an enfolding tenderness and warmth and superimposed on it a sudden cramp as the valve of the anus was forced to work in the wrong direction relax relax both of them whispered the pain subsided the angel settled down flat on the bed with michael inside him and suddenly there arrived that most exciting moment of all when a man welcomes you so deeply that his anus opens wide the angel turned around and michael saw his own face flushed and happy im beautiful michael thought after a time the angel said i want to see you come they bounced their way around slightly awkwardly on the bed and the angel nestled his face on michaels tummy michael stroked himself and felt the familiar rise like a voice heading for its high note but he came before it reached high c there was a jet of semen that shot up onto his shoulder and then the pitch was reached and he shot outwards again this time in lashings like cream over his other face oh said his other self who felt it too who was surprised as well oh thats spectacular michael kept on flowing like a fountain it poured down over his hand an opalescent sheen as if it were liquid ice he seemed to be settling back the walls of his penis accordioning shut in wrinkles when it suddenly tossed its head like a lion to roar one final time taking michael by surprise one final flinging of come up in an arch over his body and both of them laughed as if in relief his other self swam his hand through a pool of semen spreading it luxuriously up and over michaels belly for some reason it was funny for some reason michael laughed and laughed the joke was this he was a sexual being he always had been he had always been an especially sexual being with especial sexual power and that was why paradoxically he had been impotent it just struck him as funny thats all both of them lay chuckling for a while and they did it again what do i do next the next morning there was no doubt at all which of his many selves michael wanted to be it was christmas day and the air was full of the sound of joy to the world of breakfast sizzling downstairs and of his mother humming along the stairwell walls were lavender the carpet a kind of ribboned purplegrey and white the stair banisters a glossy orange britain in the s with thick grey bacon and eggs that had been fried in so much fat your mum tipped the pan so it would bubble over the yolks and cook them from above there were baked beans and fried bread there is destiny destiny is how you shape your potential like fantasy its a kind of self here michael was healthy gay still goodlooking and single in sheffield in england at the age of that looks great mum dont be daft michael kissed her cheek you havent shaved she complained youre not washed after mum after he sang along with the carol in a false and booming voice his mum sniffed roll over pavarotti and tell demis roussos the news she held up food on thick white plates you sit there go on these plates are hot may the lord make us truly thankful michael said finishing grace before he had begun it he tucked in after breakfast looking in the bathroom mirror michael was satisfied dammit i am goodlooking i really am i look my age thats all it was as his mum had said intelligent hardworking kind but also he had to admit kinda chewy kinda chunky michael just believe it youre sexy ok he looked back at his own flushed still olive face with its stubble and expression of slightly dazed delight youre in the best place youre in the best me they opened their presents mums was a handwritten note this is a new pc and internet connection it promised she gave him new shirts and tie clips every time i see you your ties blown back over your shoulder mum said they sipped sherry and ate christmas cake and about noon her friends called all ladies of her age all interested enough in michael he felt chipper my last projects finished more or less he told them ill think of something else to do on boxing day they went to pc world and he got a deal so good he was jealous of his mum laptop printer microsoft office and five other bits of software including an encyclopaedia for eight hundred pounds he took aol because of its supposedly simpler operation found its browser didnt let you increase the typesize easily and spent the day with his mother who tutted and felt stupid because she didnt get it it was late at night when finally she sent an email to his home address and how do i send you an answer again and how do i find it when i want it he left the next day a simple hug and a kiss she said patting his shoulder if you do move again you know change countries or the like try to remember to let me know i will mum i promise and not long afterwards michael found himself settled in on the train the weather was changeable turning between sun and rain outside the windows the sky seemed lower and the world got smaller lost in drizzle it was a grey and indistinct world maybe thats why he felt fear and misgiving close in over him he thought of the dirty camden flat awaiting him cold and dark he thought of his project what really do i do next the thought of going back to teaching filled him with dismay its just daily life michael its like that for everybody he would finish revising the article and it would end like this chicks dont make new pathways to see and interpret light they are born with them and what did that mean michael remembered the flower it was moving and unmoving at the same time like a bridge half built while its cadcam model was whole and alive that was him that beautiful powerful thing that was us all where was it it would be where there was no time and where would that be mathematics said there were eleven dimensions in all four of them existed only in time the three dimensions of space were created by the big bang they were expanding outwards that expansion was simply time flowing in one direction only towards the future but that would mean there were seven dimensions outside time they would be just as small as they were before the big bang they would be a point no height width or depth they would be like the smallest dot made by the sharpest pencil but that dot would be everywhere it would be at the core of everything around you it would be in the core of you you live there but dont know it everything in your life flows in one direction only into it a word came to him neurophysics the extension of the self into the universe he knew something was there he had once stood in its presence or rather had not stood he had thought there like someone hovering on the outside of a black hole just escaping before being sucked into its powerful maw how would you research something like that was anyone else doing any work in it michael began to get restive his hands still in gloves moved to assuage a sudden urge for movement in his gut he wanted to get up and find out he wanted a library a bibliography and a database to search how would anyone research something like that well how do they do black holes they do thought experiments they work through the logic of the mathematical descriptions and they model the maths on something else its mathematical metaphor really like einstein proving atoms exist in a paper on molecules in tea he just used the same maths that would describe pingpong balls i said it was like standing on the edge of a black hole heaven collapses into a point where gravity can no longer work because there is no space and time cannot work because there is no expansion our eternal lives happen in something like a black hole mind you only like a black hole why not use the same mathematics to describe it and see what happens michael went even more physically restive he did a little jump in place does neurophysics exist did i just make that up or did i read it somewhere and if i did make it up i could really be on to something i mean i could i could do that i could take all that mathematical work and just see what happens and i wouldnt have to cut up any chickens to do it i could just go ahead and do it and if i was wrong then thats great too a negative result is still a result weve still learned something suddenly the train was too small and too slow all he had to read was a john grisham novel and he wanted to throw it out of the train or chuck it into the steam furnace like the boat in around the world in eighty days they burned everything on it for fuel get me home get me to my computer now and dont tell me its not empirical ive been there buddy i died to get there and i saw it and ill know it when i see it again described in numbers michael settled back in his chair and slapped his own thigh outside light rain was falling like stars on grey farm outbuildings with tin roofs pulled down by gravity gravity which he had read in one paper could be described mathematically in the fifth dimension as electricity the rain fell and dried and was exhaled as vapour as a child he thought that was how the earth breathed he loved the idea the vapour going up like his own breath on a cold day and turning into mountains of steam in the sky the perfection of the system it was perfect the world was perfect life was perfect this rain and those farm buildings ancient but with new roofs were perfect gravity twists reality out of nothingness what physics calls quantum vacuum is that what made his angels if so his mind reaching into eternity can twist his dead father back into being what does it mean that he can twist those different selves so far that he can slip into another life it means there are parallel universes universes you can stub your toe on and have a black toenail the next day and parallel selves with parallel flesh you can touch so gravity is thought how can a black hole make anything and michael jumped up yet again well because we know that matter going into black holes is ultimately ejected again as new creation white holes so i can take those equations too for white holes and see if they tell me how my real self can make angels i can account for this i know i can i can account for the rain i can account for the yearning between stars somewhere there in all that process is yearning between people as well michael took a taxi from the station an extravagance to slice through the rain to get home he ran up his stairs unwinding his scarf and threw it and his coat onto the sofa and took down his stephen hawking and his daniel dennett he did a search on amazon and ordered books he began to think about how he could organize his days teaching marking papers researching at night like einstein in the patent office he would be invisible unknown effective he felt fulfilled abundant forgiving he had an answer to the question what do i do next michael made himself a cup of soup sipping it he looked at his picassos which seemed to rise up in colours like a flock of parrots the rain had stopped and sunlight pierced the layers of skyscrapers to glow on his wall and michael felt a sudden sense of joy it could be of course that the miracle had been sent to teach him about the universe it could be that it had come to help him understand god or duplicate gods experience of creation but it seemed to him now that the miracle had simply come so he could finally learn to enjoy himself that was what fun was liking your destiny over the next three days michael called back mustapha the afghani engineer and they made the love they should have made the first time he remembered rabindrath who permed his hair and who worked in college administration at one time michael had been so drawn to him that he would deliberately walk into rabindrath to feel the warmth of his body and the wiriness of his arms through his cotton shirt michael remembered stavros the greek who delivered the post and lifted weights in midwinter he wore black tshirts to show off his musculature but it was his sweet slightly dreamy smile that michael had liked so much in fact michael who had once found difficulty thinking of someone he fancied was suddenly shocked by how many beautiful people there were in the world there were his students whom university protocols said he must not touch they rained down onto his bed sweet and young and at their best no longer calculating grades or hoping to avoid paying fees until they were sure of an a in the magic space of the miracle he and students became what they were in fact equals his beautiful body did its work and michael did not even allow himself the thought im cured everything had become light and easy and floating as if they all had the bones of birds there was the boy behind the till at tesco whom michael had once found almost unbearably beautiful his beauty was not unbearable now because of that equality michael was up to it the boy from tesco liked being tickled and roared with delighted laughter on michaels bed he recombed michaels hair with gel into a kind of cross between james dean and christian bale michael combed it again to save it after the boy had gone and realized he would comb it that way from now on other kinds of fear disappeared there was the braindamaged boy michael had met at a dinner party years before his name was robin robin had reached out to michael and tried to take his hand and fumbled with it i cant say things he said i want to touch you robin had offered up his hands that were helpless to hold his slurry voice and his numb sideways lips had put off the younger michael michael welcomed him now and was rewarded in bed robin was ruined muscular twisted lithe michael wanted to photograph them but knew that was futile he wanted to sketch them but he couldnt draw then michael called up an actor who had once stayed in the same house during the edinburgh festival they had gone to bed with each other and it hadnt worked and michael had moped for weeks michael had him back now his name was stephen and he began a dance around michaels bed it was an odd looping thing he had learned in some other country somewhere like bulgaria after stephen was gone michael found he could imitate it he could make his belly and heavy feet move like stephens michael found he could recreate stavross dim smile and loping stride he found he could light a cigarette onehanded like nick he could make his face and hands move like his braindamaged lover among all his strengths michaels greatest talent would be of use only to him he could remember people in his body he would remember all of them a christmas card came late from philip it was a photograph of one of his paintings pasted on a white card it was a portrait of henry and was resolutely free from technical innovation it was just henry with hair in his eyes looking sweet his gaze was directly back at the viewer appraising on the back was a note in philips newly elegant handwriting and so i relax and become a traditionalist its more fun just getting on with the painting isnt henry beautiful we have decided to go our separate ways were still friends though would you come to a party were having one new years eve just a few friends we were wondering if you wouldnt like to come early say about pm we need to have a chat and theres someone wed like you to meet love philip the note produced a tumult of feelings first was dismay poor philip it couldnt have been an easy note to write what on earth did they want to say to him whom did they want him to meet it sounded a bit formal even a bit intimidating second was mystification what did philip know did he know henry was an angel was that why they were breaking up and if so what did philip feel about it did he blame michael and if they were breaking up well would henry live with him michael wouldnt mind living with an angel hed done that before he could see himself so clearly living with henry living here with the picassos and the unvarnished floors henry would like camden town hed like the market and its bookstores and its funky restaurants but michael wouldnt make the same mistakes if henry wanted to live in the country then michael would move he would make sure this time that they both felt that the house was their home hold on michael what if theyre splitting up because henry got tired of philip it wouldnt be surprising supposing angel henry had fallen in love with someone else michaels heart sank in fact thats the most likely scenario henrys younger hes betterlooking and he isnt screwed up and what if philip wanted to move back in with him michael felt embarrassment and dismay would he say no im waiting for henry what if henry showed no signs of interest would michael really turn down companionship amity kindness what if the end of the story was that he and phil got back together would that be so awful in fact michael you can calm down either way you win you cant lose there is nothing to worry about even so michael went out and bought a new shirt it was black and he bought a fleece to go with it he had a haircut the christian bale hairdo made him look ten years younger no it didnt it just made him look less like a hippy it made michael look like himself he sat around the house for a full hour before it was time to catch the train he checked out his hair his new clothes oh for gods sake michael theyre not going to love you because youre wearing new clothes you cant go there in a tizz youll say something daft you have no idea whats going to happen today just calm down so he took the northern line down to the central and from the central to docklands light railway at bank it was a long ride on a sunny afternoon he looked at london gnawing on his thumbnail the old east end had been shouldered to one side by glossy new buildings that looked like christmas presents wrapped up in green metallic paper the crumbling hovels of the poor were now refurbished and had bmws outside sparse art deco factories had been done up as flats and had flags and signs outside they still looked like art deco factories suddenly the train plunged into canary wharf the train was all glass like eyes stretched wide open in wonder it sighed to a halt surrounded by marble dappled with the beautiful soft white light that comes when sunshine is filtered by a high glass roof the doors opened and there was a sound of a waterfall somewhere and whispering music the car sighed away and michael saw to the right the new imperial buildings huge with carvings and frontages of polished marble there were fountains in squares with stone esplanades there were no people my god it was bleak michael tried to imagine living here it would be like living in a new suburb of topeka the only thing you could do was go to the mall the train hoisted up its skirts to stretch across dockland waterways there were boats in quays there were stranded new hotels with smoked glass and empty patios overlooking the river the umbrellas over the white garden furniture waved in place of people finally the train stopped at south quay and michael got out the whole place smelled of drains to be more specific it smelled of sewage plainly all that new plumbing leaked the pavements and the brickwork were new and gritty forgotten building timbers were piled in the parking lots beside the new buildings with to let signs in the windows there was a newsagent with an apartment over it it was open offering toffees and the national lottery next to it was of course an estate agent london property prices were booming but not apparently here there were plenty of studios for rent or piedaterres for eighty thousand pounds would suit company needing to provide accommodation to visiting executives the air was clear and freezing as if the day were made of ice the distances between buildings were californian in scope the roads didnt work like english roads they melted away into huge parking lots or twisted and turned around the canals like a dog trying to find a home in all this emptiness michael got lost consulted his map and finally found an ochrecoloured brick building beside yet another canal the doors and windows were new and halfsized he rang the buzzer and stomped his feet because he was so cold is that michael said a voice michael couldnt tell if it were henry or philip come on up top floor the staircase boomed with the sound of michaels feet the plain white pine stairs shook as he trudged up them there were scratches from furniture on the new brick walls this was not a staircase for moving pianos come all the way up called a smooth dark voice from on high at the top of the stairs one of them waited standing in the doorway against the light michael thought at first it was henry no no there were acne scars on the cheeks philip they did look just the slightest bit alike philip exclaimed michael hello how are you how have you been every word was weighted because every word was meant michael was surprised by the surge of emotion he felt the lower edge of his eyes seemed to shiver it really was very good to see the old friendly face ive been ok how are you michael meant since the breakup philip understood its ok really philip kept his smile steady and kind he had been lounging against the doorpost he stepped back and michael saw their apartment and henry all at once henry was standing in anticipation against a huge single window that looked out over the canal and a range of new buildings henry waited calmly in old jeans and an old sweater hello michael its good to see you its good to see you both said michael and his look took them both in he was relieved this was going to work this was in fact going to be delicious he liked being with them both the apartment was a good place to be if you were poor and had to be stranded out in south quay sunlight blazed through the huge single window so the flat was deliciously warm even though the ceiling was rounded and high at night it would be cold the floors were echoey pine and the furniture was direct from ikea selfassembled blonde wood the sofa was really a futon on stilts there was a cheerfully coloured foldaway metal table around it were the six walnut chairs from michaels old flat they looked stodgy and out of place the kitchen was tucked away in an alcove that was inserted beside the stairwell beside it was a doorway that led into the showertoilet in one corner were stacked in rows all of philips paintings i want to see some of those later said michael try and stop me i want you to see them said philip sauntering into the kitchen darjeeling rose hip or camomile um rose hip i think vitamin c to make up for all that booze henry spoke his soft voice echoing oddly off the hangarshaped roof the new work is really very good youll be proud of him michael felt a surge of longing towards both of them this was a kind and calm household and though michael wanted both of them he also felt sad what could bring this beautiful way of life to a halt philip was dropping the tea bags into the cups as if it were a game hes different michael thought he moves differently he used to shake and shiver all the time and look angry and dart about the place as if sensing his thought philip said henrys taught me a lot and he looked at henry with real affection he looked back at michael thank you he said to michael michael pretended not to understand philip was still looking at him it was a very kind thing to do whuh what was philips eyes rolled slightly towards the ceiling you know very well what henry stepped forward he knows michael i told him i told him a long time ago i have to keep telling him or he forgets but thats good too he turned to look at philips face it means we keep talking suddenly michael felt awkward i it wasnt something i knew i was doing henrys voice was quiet he knows that too philip stood in the sunlight and his voice was as still as henrys it really is all right michael sit down he passed michael his tea would you like some christmas cake with that michael said yes though his appetite had gone he lowered himself rather shakily down onto the sofa is it why you broke up philip was slicing cake well its hardly a permanent solution is it but no thats not the reason here you go on the white rippled plate that michael knew so well was the same old christmas cake that philip always cooked only now they didnt live with each other and had only the mildest most friendly connection with each other this felt like another reality as well philip sat next to henry and the two of them hunkered down together on the futon sofa philips found someone said henry smiling he nearly pulled it off he nearly did look entirely pleased almost without a trace of wistfulness he looked back towards philip and his face seemed to open up like a rose it was a look like a mother gives when she knows she has to let go hes done it because he knows he wont be here for ever tell him about lee said henry well youll meet him later philip was shy lees lovely said henry regaining all his poise im not going to have either one of them michael realized it was his turn for good behaviour tell me about him michael asked a little smile of delight played around the corner of philips mouth well lees from china communist china near shanghai hes over here to study computing and hes very handsome very handsome indeed said henry and he says that after his course is over that it would be possible for me to live in china and ive said yes philip chuckled at his own unexpected courage ill miss you said michael philip looked cheerful well i wont be going for a few years yet henry was full of love for him real love the love that works to lose the thing it most wants phils doing very well learning chinese i figured it might take a while so i might as well start now michael occupied himself pressing bits of philips cake together in order to eat it philips christmas cake was always too crumbly well michael it never turns out the way you expect youd better start adjusting now theres nothing else to do can i see the paintings now michael asked they were very good portraits done in a slightly impressionistic style the paint was liberally applied a little bit as if someone were making mud pies they told you things about the people there were several pictures of henry then one dreamlike painting all sunlight in this flat with a slim broadshouldered man looking away thats lee said philip the sun was lower the light was golden on the paintings on the faces you cant go back michael like time love flows in one direction only youll stay friends with philip youll write emails you might even visit him in china and henry suddenly there was the painting of henry the one on the card what what will happen when henry goes philip asked i wonder that too said michael youll have the painting i dont know if youll remember who it was but he sighed you wont feel any regret or loss you wont be in the same reality thats all make up a nice story for me said philip how i came to paint this about who he was what he was like he looked back up at michael and his eyes had something of iron in them the other friends started to arrive about seven oclock the thought of them had caused michael trepidation too but these were different friends there was no jimmy banter no guardian film critics and no arts journalists one was a somewhat too precise but sweetly quiet mathematician another was a small middleaged guy with an earring bald with a calm kind manner and an east london accent he was called declan he repaired cars in limehouse he apologized because lorraine couldnt make it lorraine worked in computing she was his girlfriend declan travels said henry it was true declan had no money but seemed to have spent his life going to peru or the andaman isles nice people the world is full of nice people philips new boyfriend arrived lee was tall and muscular and was as handsome as promised michael couldnt stop himself looking back at philip my god philip you have done yourself proud henry and philip brought in the satay and sweet potatoes people ate on their laps from paper plates and drank tiny amounts of wine it was a wellbehaved gay conversation everyone was involved there was no splitting off into anxious moody teteatetes people talked in turn lightly pleasantly and they listened in turn henry told a story about barracking a catbreeding farm through a megaphone only to discover it was a nudist colony instead michael told the story about the time that he and philip were both locked out of the flat he didnt realize until halfway through that the story embodied the simple fact of their long marriage together lee laughed at one point mysteriously henry said to philip hes not coming at midnight the fireworks went off over the river the seven friends a modest number clustered around the one westfacing window synchronized flowers of light bloomed and sparkled reflecting on the canal to michael they seemed to come erupting out the imagination from the potential of the people who had designed them he imagined them in their timeless aspect forever a blurring of sequinned light moving and still at the same moment the fireworks looked like the self someone completely naturally placed a hand on his shoulder and left it there it was padded and hot michael turned around and it was lee they toasted the new year they toasted absent friends the mathematician had lost his partner two years before michael liked them all he hadnt known one of them but before the end of the evening he passed around his card and got three in return including lees about one in the morning the first guest stood up to go michael remembered the tubes and was thinking about leaving as well when the doorbell rang philip and henry each cocked an eyebrow a voice barked up the answer phone it sounded sinewy and smooth and reassuring philip looked back at henry his eyes wide and gleaming and philip nodded quickly yes he waited at the top of the stairs hello hello he said sorry but i had my sisters party to go to said a breathless voice and philip seized a hand and pulled in henry only this was henry with slightly longer hair wearing a brown sweater with a hole in it this is him said philip michael meet the real henry this is stumpy stumpy perked up so youre the magic man he said his cheeks were redder than henrys and the mushroom smell was stronger ah ah yes michael looked back at henry and all three of them henry philip and stumpy laughed i told you once that stumpy would love to know about this said henry and henry and stumpy gazed at each other grinning and slightly dazzled stumpy wobbled slightly in place and henry had to catch him and they were brotherly in each others arms and philip cuddled stumpy too partly to keep him standing i had a bit too much at my sisters stumpy said chuckling hes staying with his sister she lives in camden town too its a long trip from camden town said stumpy michael asked how did you get together henry wrote me a note and said he was my longlost twin and sent me a photo of one of philips paintings of him stumpy mimed amazement so we met and he told me all about you how does it work michael heard himself say the universe is twisted out of nothing by gravity and i think i will be able to prove that thought and gravity are the same thing wow stumpys eyes widened and he laughed with a kind of pleasure while shaking his head michael realized he hadnt told henry anything about his new research he wanted henry particularly to understand ive got a new project i think i can describe what has happened using equations henry reached forward and gave michael a kind of hug that turned into a shake of approbation michael looked at stumpy and found he was embarrassed i mean i think i can do it i dont know yet ive still got to do the work it sounds fairly mindblowing said henry i wish my head was a bit clearer said stumpy weve got other guests said henry pointedly to philip when philip didnt move henry pulled him away and for some reason michael regained his old clarity he had forgotten his talent for turning science into words michael sat with stumpy on the futon sofa he explained how he would apply the equations used to describe black and white holes he explained that in the fifth dimension the equations that describe electricity also describe gravity and thought is a matter of changing electrical charges oh said stumpy and fell forward holding his head he sat back up if you did that you might end up proving that god exists i might end up proving that he doesnt chuckled michael stumpy was younger than henry his smile was brighter his enthusiasms more overbearing his words more common and less distinct michael looked at henry and pondered what that meant youre wiser than your original model henry of course youre timeless you are as wise as you will ever become and does that mean you know what will happen or rather what is likely to happen michael looked back at this bright and cheerful confident yearold it was like looking at old photographs of friends you would need me more michael thought i could even help you grow into becoming henry it was nearly two oclock well ive really got to go michael said he kissed them all on the cheek and hugged henry and phil together in a heap thank you thank you thank you he said stumpy looked a little wistful as he shook michaels hand and suddenly michael was back out in the night luck was with him the evening seemed somehow warmer than the day and he did not have a long wait for the train he heard it whining towards him even as he climbed the station staircase the train doors whooshed open to show a car that was nearly empty past canary wharf it began to fill with people a gang of indian lads in fleece jackets and trainers got on at west india quay they all had heliumfilled balloons the balloons were metallic in the shape of dolphins at the next stop a merry black girl bounced in as lightly as the balloons turning and laughing with her elegantly groomed friends at westferry two groups arrived ebullient new city lads in modern fabrics who sang abba songs against a competing group of what looked like nurses michael was one of the oldest people there he watched secure and detached from his early found seat and settled into a kind of contented concentration he seemed to go on settling deeper and deeper the settling almost made a sound it would have been a sound like rain what were falling were impressions the black girl had done her hair in perfect rows the aidsawareness ribbon on her coat was in fact an enamelled broach michael pondered the generosity that impelled her to take up permanently a cause that many people would think was someone elses the indian boys began shyly to offer people their balloons they gave one to michael michael thought of his chicks we ought to let them all go free he said to one of the lads thatd be great peopled look up and see all these dolphins up in the sky theyd go like oh wow the sky is full of dolphins it seemed to michael that it was an inspired thing to say i wouldnt let this one go if you dont want me to do what you want man its a party everyone michael included got off at bank to change onto the central line tube there was a long long wait for the train a raucous bevy of young women stood near michael they were plump pale and nearly nude all in the common fashion of tight trousers peeloff tops with little straps and shortish hair parted in the middle they showed off pastures of perfect white shoulders a sacrifice in winter they had all written on pieces of paper which they had taped to themselves innocent said one till proven guilty another said free to good home they were all more than a bit pissed and had done something extremely daring in either a pub or a party and couldnt stop talking about it when the train came the girls all ran though they didnt need to the thick heels of their shoes clopping like horses hooves they swept themselves and michael into the carriage on a gust of giggles michael sat down and let everything rain around him a fat businessman with bags under his eyes like croissants was gently going to sleep on the shoulder of a young man with slickedup hair the young man gently tapped him a girl was standing fast asleep against her boyfriend as if slowdancing she was thin and pale almost translucent with a slight contented smile it was the smile she would wear lying next to him in their own bed and the settling seemed to stop and michael came to rest finally on the floor of the ocean where it was deep and cool and calm and silent he loved them all it had nothing to do with lust or feeling safely superior or being merely drunk he was clearheaded more clearheaded than he had been in a long time he saw the girls wanted fun and friends and to be noticed and not to be dull before their time michael wished they would always be friends and always go out and never go sour from bitterness he yearned for the sleeping man finally to find family or friends the young man with the slicked hair had decided to let him go on sleeping and that it did him no harm to leave him be michael wished that people would give the lad the same leeway and that he would lose his slightly tense pinched air in the quiet in the peace it seemed to him that he knew their stories and could guess how far they could go and loved them like a father loves from a distance with best wishes it was promiscuous this love it went beyond lust and romance and making families michael moved beyond biology the train pulled into the next station and michael saw its notice slip past like someone trying to sidle unnoticed into the bathroom he sat and waited for a while as the engine whirred and he saw the sign partially obscured by the window frame ourt road jesus christ its tottenham court road his stop just before the doors closed michael jumped off its in the morning michael you cant go missing your stop he was tired and strolled towards the northern line the balloon bobbed along after him still tugging at his hand just beyond the arch to the northbound platform he heard doors rumbling shut oh shit hed just missed the train he jumped forward in time to see the grey and red train sigh away moaning gently the platform was empty and there was a rush of wind as if another train were coming and someone stepped out of the moving air michaels body knew the green gym uniform before his mind did he jumped with recognition hello there said a familiar voice youve stopped coming in for your workout it was the cherub no time im afraid youve managed to lose some weight though it suits you thank you the cherub stirred looking chagrined and glanced about him ill try to keep my clothes on this time shall i it was good to see him so how is tony tonys fine said the angel him and the girlfriend are going to move up north she wants to open a restaurant you might like to pop in and say goodbye to him since you know you liked him so much thank you maybe i will the angel chuckled maybe you wont michael ventured and how are you the angel looked pained me im a bit different michael nodded you become different the angel had a pleading look michael felt love just ask me he whispered i dont want my life to be just working in a restaurant showing people to tables michael asked does that mean tony doesnt want it either the angel shook his head no no way he loves jacqui he wants a family so he makes sacrifices but that doesnt mean that part of him me i guess part of him wants adventure he wants to go places see things and and i thought i could go there for him and he could see it in his dreams like when we made love he saw that in his dreams he saw it for real right he saw it for real the angel had passionate eyes need where michael asked where do you want to go i can do this michael realized my god what a thing to be able to do the angels face was set i want to go to tibet i want him to see one of those big monasteries he wants to see tibet and well i know he never will i can see all the way to the end you see tibet agreed michael lust pulls you out pulls you into becoming someone else can i go now the angel asked glancing at his watch yes now promised michael all you have to do is leave the platform and when you turn left at the way out sign youll be in tibet brill said the angel and shook his hand youre a star mate thanks thanks a lot say hello to tony for me sure the angel promised ill make sure he sees it the cherub looked anxiously at his watch and he turned and broke into a half run michael watched his broad back retreat down the platform the cherub stopped and waved just outside the exit do you know why i called you up michael shouted to him the cherub nodded because you know its not going to last much longer he called thanks said michael to the cherub to the miracle itself michael held a little hand up a gentle sigh of a wave he still held the dolphin balloon and it dipped in farewell the cherub turned left and was gone someone tapped michael on the shoulder he turned and there was henry redfaced and panting gotcha henry said grinning michael was expecting to see an angel this henrys hair dangled differently and he wore a brown sweater with a hole in it but there was no doubt in michaels mind that he had called this one up too youre stumpy said michael and he found he was grinning as much as anyone is replied the angel his cheeks glowed silver and sweaty as if he had run to catch up with michael they both grinned and their grins latched as though their braces had locked my god youre pretty said michael he couldnt help himself he took the angels hand and to his delight it squeezed back and the angels cheeks glowed even brighter michael was a bit pissed and that allowed him to feel his own delight he glanced up the platform what the heck there was no one there and anyway it was new years eve without any doubt that the angel would want him michael pulled stumpy to him and kissed him the angel shuddered in surprise and then his mouth worked stumpy was delicious he tasted of cinnamon he tasted of celebration michael was slightly stunned he had never kissed someone and felt taste as communication he pulled back and looked into stumpys beautiful nutbrown eyes im embarrassed said stumpy im not said michael i didnt say i didnt like it im enraptured said michael and it was true he laughed and pulled back and bounced the dolphin balloon up and down in his grasp there was answering laughter two men settled next to them on the platform and it took a moment for michael to realize who they were the chinese thai who had danced and grown up to run a plant nursery cradled mustafa the afghan michael laughed these are angels he announced to stumpy these are two more of my dear dear angels and he pulled them to him and quickly kissed them both stumpys eyes widened these are them these are more of them he reached out to touch them and the thai seized his hand happy new year the thai said syllable by memorized syllable and dipped his head its love isnt it said stumpy the train arrived but the thai and the afghan did not get on it they waved as if at the departure of a ship as if saying goodbye the train pulled away and they were dragged slowly past the window and michaels eyes were suddenly stung as if pricked by bees and he could not think why i think we must have caught the last train he said stumpy smiled up at him this is going to be a very nice new years he had to shout over the noise of the train a miraculous new years his eyes were unbelieving and admiring and wondering they got off at camden town at the foot of the escalator the angel enfolded himself under michaels arm the escalator lifted them up towards heaven like the machinery of an eighteenthcentury opera outside in the bracing air the dolphin balloon grinned wideeyed like a welcoming baby michael asked his angel who still stayed bleary within his arm shall we let him go aw why protested stumpy because if we let him go well see him swim among the stars said michael stumpy smiled yes he said balloon liberation free all balloons now michael let the dolphin go it bobbed for a moment its eyes still on them as if reluctant and then it turned away and began to rise a drunken man stopped beside them he was a vicar in a dog collar what a beautiful thing he fluted they all watched together the dolphin was silver and white and held the reflected light as if it carried candles fancy a swig the vicar asked and held out a small hip flask of whisky both stumpy and michael drank the dolphin gleamed until finally it was one of the stars themselves which one do you think he is michael asked all of them said stumpy hes become all of them or maybe all of them were dolphins all along they walked north with the vicar who was as pink as a rose and they all began to sing jerusalem and did those feet in ancient time they parted at the empty market street waving goodbye stumpy went all floppy his hair lashing michaels arms im sorry i dont usually drink he said thats ok whispered michael ive never met anyone like you said the angel his eyes squiffy well ive met henry who is like you stumpy nodded yes a wide grin on his face hes me when im older he says i ought to become a politician i think thats what he did he even told me which labour mp i should ask to work with this little angel was very proud of himself im going to do that he seemed to come into focus the trouble with protests is that nothing happens nothing changes thats not good enough his eyes had the hunger the light that michael had seen in henrys eyes to change things for the better michael thought he had never seen anyone as beautiful he said that just happens to be my front door they stumbled up the stairway and into the front room and michael switched on the light and the picassos on the wall seemed to leap into life stumpy saw them and seemed to think the locale had painted them i love camden town its like it could have been posh and rich but it decided not to be so its full of good things and its sleazy at the same time the angel put his hand on michaels breast like you there was something in the angels eyes that had been given too quickly and too completely for michael not to feel overwhelmed he found he chuckled and ducked youre drunk lets get you to bed and they thumped up the final staircase stumpy undressed as henry always did slowly and methodically in a way that meant all the clothes in the morning would look ironed and that somehow cancelled out any doubt that he was anything other than what he said he was im too sleepy for sex he said simply do you mind i dont think said michael that this is about sex its about dolphins said stumpy and grinned stumpy slipped out of his trousers and his underwear and his skin all over was almost as silver as the dolphins he stumbled against the bed and then into it goodnight my love said michael it was that quick and that simple and that unthinking stumpy reached back over himself and took michaels hand michael snapped off the light and as heavy as curtains sleep fell in a dream he looked up into the sky and it was full of dolphins and knew somehow it was a dawn sky later there was a movement in michaels head it was not entirely pleasant to feel the flesh inside his skull flex like a muscle he woke up and everything was dusky grey in a different year the blackbirds were singing their unexpectedly beautiful song though they lived south in the gardens next to michaels old life michaels mouth was dry from dehydration dreamily he stood up and padded out of his bed and he felt the realities part again as a series of curtains dropping away he was padding down the corridor of the condo in california he heard his father snore rest in peace he murmured i will always love you and you will always love me somewhere in eternity we are father and son running on that beach and it doesnt matter what kind of love i feel for you and he moved past the little table with the telephone to turn left leaving philip behind him in their big lancashire bed he turned at the doorway to see him asleep in their old flat well what do you know baby we both finally grew up and he slipped downstairs towards the sitting room in the camden flat and the expressionistic toilet who had left the lights on he thumped down the steps and was only mildly surprised to see there was a party it was all right he realized he had been having a new years party of his own hello hello said james the irish monk merrily he was wearing a lumberjack shirt now instead of monks robes and a handsome moustached man in plus fours canoodled next to him this is my george i wanted you to meet him he came to the monastery he followed me all the way to california and i just went away with him to big sur they both had grey hair michael smiled pleased for them ah a voice ah my old friend and michael was suddenly enveloped in picassos arms look look at what you made possible for me picasso threw an arm up towards the wall of beautiful paintings here here did you see this he pushed a leaflet at him glossy and in four colours it was for an exhibition modernizing art it said and showed a computer screen full of glowing colours it was michaels own mirror face al pressed against him and stepped back and was enfolded in the generous arms of mark weve just realized we should have met because of you said mark you and i would have become lovers for a while and afterwards al and i would get together and then wed both be alive said al can you be together now we always were that was the potential said al he seized michaels hand hard and thats as real as if it had actually happened someone put on music the old oceanside record player sang out cinderella bottles came dancing towards michael and took him up mischievously in her arms she held her nose up in the air miming broadway posh billie holiday leaned next to the record player she was older now in the s and she was wearing a blue satin dress man billie said chuckling to herself how can anybody sing that stuff it sticks in your throat she tried anyway billie sang julie andrews as if it were true in her rough old voice it was a sweet song about falling in love billie gave it uncertainty billie turned it into a song about last chances the old music swelled and the two voices blended hopeful exhausted and innocent exalted the sweet long ended happy new year growled billie and held up an unsteady toast for them all and there was henry henry was weeping with joy its all right michael he said shaking it really is all right everything will be fine really michael hugged him to soothe him i love you said michael i love you too said henry michael said you know whos upstairs henry nodded yes and smiled you planned this exclaimed michael realizing henry closed his eyes once and opened them i can see all the way to the end he said his eyes were as steady as car headlights i am he said there and he pointed far away beyond michael knew what he meant always i gotta pee explained michael michael stumbled out of his sitting room into the dark landing with the floor that would ram slivers into his feet parched headachy and hungover he slumped down on his own coldseated toilet and held his head in his hands he could feel a movement in the structured fat of his brain a kind of kink as if it had shifted gears abruptly the music was turned off suddenly it was dawn for real grey and quiet michael wiped himself and padded out into his neglected sitting room it was empty and quiet and dark god it was drab it was like a hangover after a party was over why was it so dull suddenly it wasnt just that the lights were off then he saw why the walls were blank all the picassos were gone so was the desk that was the only thing picasso had directly carried up the steps himself and suddenly eyes wide with terror michael knew what that meant its over my god its over and then he remembered stumpy he had not got the angels home address and he couldnt ask henry henry would be gone would the real stumpy have any trace of memory of meeting michael what if he couldnt find stumpy again michael ran up the stairs and darted round the lintel of the doorway into the bedroom and he saw the bed was full a pale silver arm reached across the empty sheet for michael everything else had gone but the real stumpy was still there then michael knew what that meant too
