jeffery deaver manhattan is my beat the first book in the rune series the land of faery where nobody gets old and godly and grave where nobody gets old and crafty and wise where nobody gets old and bitter of tongue william butler yeats chapter one he believed he was safe for the first time in six months two identities and three residences behind him he finally believed he was safe an odd feeling came over himcomfort he finally decided yeah that was it a feeling he hadnt experienced for a long time and he sat on the bed in this fairtomiddling hotel overlooking that weird silver arch that crowned the riverfront in st louis smelling the midwestern spring air an old movie was on television he loved old movies this was touch of evil orson welles directing charlton heston playing a mexican the actor didnt look like a mexican but then he probably didnt look like moses either arnold gittleman laughed to himself at his little joke and told it to a sullen man sitting nearby reading a guns ammo magazine the man glanced at the screen mexican he asked stared at the screen for a minute oh he went back to his magazine gittleman lay back in the bed thinking that it was damn well about time he had some funny thoughts like the one about heston frivolous thoughts amounttonothing thoughts he wanted to think about gardening or painting lawn furniture or taking his grandson to a ball game about taking his daughter and her husband to his wifes gravea place hed been too afraid to visit for over six months so the sullen man said looking up from the magazine whats it gonna be we gonna do deli tonight gittleman whod lost pounds since christmas he was down to said sure sounds good deli and he realized it did sound good he hadnt looked forward to food for a long time a nice fat deli sandwich pastrami his mouth started to water mustard rye bread a pickle naw said a third man stepping out of the bathroom pizza lets get pizza the sullen man who read about guns all the time and the pizza man were us marshals both were young and stonyfaced and gruff and wore cheap suits that fit very badly but gittleman knew that these were exactly the kind of men you wanted to be watching over you besides gittleman had led a pretty tough life himself and he realized that when you looked past their facade these two were pretty decent and smart guysstreetsmart at least which was all that really counted in life gittleman had taken a liking to them over the past five months and since he couldnt have his family around him hed informally adopted them he called them son one and son two he told them that they werent sure what to make of it but he sensed they got a kick out of him saying the words for one thing they said most of the people they protected were complete shits and gittleman knew that whatever else he wasnt that son one was the man reading the guns magazine the man whod suggested deli he was the fatter of them son two grumbled again that he wanted pizza forgetaboutit we did pizza yesterday an irrefutable argument so it was pastrami and cole slaw good on rye gittleman said and a pickle dont forget the pickle they come with pickles then extra pickles hey go for it arnie son one said son two spoke into the microphone pinned to his chest a wire ran to a black motorola handitalkie clipped onto his belt right next to a big gun that might very well have been reviewed in the magazine his partner was reading he spoke to the third marshal on the team sitting by the elevator up the hall its sal im coming out okay the staticky voice responded elevators on its way you wanta beer arnie no gittleman said firmly son two looked at him curiously i want two goddamn beers the marshal cracked a faint smile the most response to humor gittleman had ever seen in his tough face good for you son one said the marshals had been after him to lighten up enjoy life more relax you dont like dark beer right asked his partner not so much gittleman responded how do they make dark beer anyway son one asked studying something in the wellthumbed magazine gittleman looked it was a pistol dark as dark beer and it looked a lot nastier than the guns his surrogate sons wore make it gittleman asked absently he didnt know he knew money and how and where to hide it he knew movies and horse racing and grandchildren he drank beer but he didnt know anything about making it maybe hed take that up as a hobby tooin addition to gardening home brewing he was fiftysix too young for retirement from the financial services and accounting professionbut after the rico trial he was definitely going to be retired from now on clear came the radio voice from the hallway son two disappeared out the door gittleman lay back and watched the movie janet leigh was on screen now hed always had a crush on her was still pissed at hitchcock for killing her in the shower gittleman liked women with short hair smelling the spring air thinking about a sandwich pastrami on rye and a pickle feeling safe thinking the marshals service was doing a good job at making sure he stayed that way the rooms on either side of this one had adjoining doors but theyd been bolted shut and the rooms were unoccupied the us government actually paid for all three rooms the hallway was covered by the marshal near the elevator the nearest shooting position a sniper could find was two miles away across the mississippi river and son one the guns ammo subscriberhad told him there was nobody in the universe who could make a shot like that feeling comfortable thinking that tomorrow hed be on his way to california with a new identity thered be some plastic surgery hed be safe the people who wanted to kill him would eventually forget about him relaxing letting himself get lost in the movie with moses and janet leigh it was really a great film the very opening scene was somebody setting the hands of the timer on a bomb to three minutes and twenty seconds then planting it welles had made one continuous shot for that exact amount of time until the bomb went off setting the story in motion talk about building the suspense talk about wait what was that gittleman glanced out the window he sat up slightly outside the window was what was that it seemed like a small box of some sort sitting on the window ledge connected to it was a thin wire which ran upward and disappeared out of view as if somebodyd lowered the little box from the room above because of the moviethe opening scenehis first thought was that the box was a bomb but now as he lunged forward he saw that no it looked like a camera a small video camera he rolled off the bed walked to the window looked at the box closely yep thats what it was a camera arnie you know the drill son one said because he was heavy he sweated a lot and he sweated now he wiped his face stay away from the windows but whats that gittleman pointed the marshal dropped the magazine to the floor rose and stepped to the window a video camera gittleman asked well it looks like it it does yeah is it but its not yours is it no the marshal muttered frowning we dont have surveillance outside the marshal glanced at the thin cable that disappeared up presumably to the room above them his eyes continued upward until they came to rest on the ceiling shit he said reaching for his radio the first cluster of bullets from the silenced machine gun tore through the plaster above them and ripped into son one who danced like a puppet he dropped to the floor bloody and torn shivering as he died no gittleman cried jesus no he leapt toward the phone a stream of bullets followed him upstairs the killer would be watching on the video camera knowing exactly where gittleman was gittleman pressed himself flat against the wall the gunman fired another shot a single it was close then two more inches away teasing him it seemed like nobody would hear the only sound was the cracking of plaster and wood more shots followed him as he dodged toward the bathroom debris flew around him there was a pause he hoped the killer had given up and fled but it turned out that he was after the phoneso gittleman couldnt call for help two bullets cracked through the ceiling hit the beige telephone unit and shattered it into a hundred pieces help he cried nauseated with fear but of course the rooms on either side of this one were emptya fact so reassuring a few moments ago so horrifying now tears of fright in his eyes he rolled into a corner knocked a lamp over to darken the room more bullets crashed down closer testing trying to find him the gunman upstairs watching a tv screen of his own just like gittleman had been watching charlton heston a few minutes ago do something gittleman raged to himself come on he eased forward again and shoved the tv set on a roller stand toward the window it slammed into the pane cracked it and blocked the view the video camera had of the room there were several more shots but the gunman was blind now please gittleman prayed quietly please someone help me hugging the walls he moved to the doorway he fumbled the chain and dead bolt shivering in panic certain the man was right above him aiming down about to pull the trigger but there were no more shots and he swung the door open fast and leapt into the hallway calling to the marshal at the elevatornot one of the sons an officer named gibson hes shootingtheres a man upstairs with a gun you but gittleman stopped speaking at the end of the hallway gibson lay facedown blood pooled around his head another puppetthis one with cut strings oh no he gasped turned around to run he stopped looking at what he now realized was the inevitable a handsome man darkcomplected wearing a wellcut suit standing in the hallway he carried a polaroid camera in one hand and in the other a black pistol mounted with a silencer youre gittleman arent you the man asked he sounded polite as if he were merely curious gittleman couldnt respond but the man squinted and then nodded yeah sure you are but gittleman looked back into his hotel room oh my partner wasnt trying to hit you in there just to flush you we need to get you outside and confirm the kill the man gave a little shrug nodding at the camera causa what were getting paid they want proof you know and he shot gittleman three times in the chest in the hotel corridor which used to smell of lysol and now smelled of lysol and cordite from the gunshots haarte unscrewed the suppressor and dropped it and the walther into his pocket he glanced at the polaroid picture of the dead man as it developed then put it in the same pocket as the gun from his belt he took his own walkietalkiemore expensive than the marshals and unlike theirs sensibly equipped with a threelevelencryption scramblerand spoke to zane his partner upstairs the one so proficient with automatic weapons hes dead ive got the snap get out on my way zane replied haarte glanced at his watch if the other marshal had gone to get foodwhich he probably had since it was dinnertimehe could be back in six or seven minutes thats how much time it took to walk to the restaurant closest to the hotel order takeout and return he obviously hadnt gone to the restaurant in the hotel because they would just have ordered room service haarte walked slowly down the four flights of stairs and outside into the warm spring evening he checked the streets nearly deserted no sirens no flashing lights of silent rollups his earphone crackled haartes partner said im in the car back at the hilton in thirty see you then haarte got into their second rental car and drove out of downtown to a park in university city a pleasant suburb west of the city he pulled up beside a maroon lincoln continental overhead a jet making its approach to lambert field roared past haarte got out of the car and walked to the lincoln he got in the backseat checking out the driver kept his hand in his pocket around the grip of the nowunsilenced pistol the man sitting in the rear of the car a heavy jowly man of about gave a faint nod his eyes aimed toward the front seat meaning the drivers okay you dont have to worry haarte didnt care what the mans eyes said haarte worried all the time hed worried when hed been a cop in the toughest precinct of newark new jersey hed worried as a soldier in the dominican republic hed worried as a mercenary in zaire and burma hed come to believe that worry was a kind of drug one that kept you alive once he finished his own appraisal of the driver he released his grip on the pistol and took his hand out of his pocket the man said in a flat midwestern accent theres nothing on the news yet there will be haarte reassured him he flashed the polaroid the man shook his head all for money death of an innocent and its all for money he sounded genuinely troubled as he said this he looked up from the picture haarte had learned that polaroids never show blood the right color it always looks darker that bother you the man asked haarte death of an innocent haarte said nothing innocence or guilt just like fault and mercy were concepts that had no meaning to him but the man didnt seem to want an answer here the man handed him an envelope haarte had received a lot of envelopes like this he always thought they felt like blocks of wood which in a way they were money was paper paper was wood he didnt look inside he put the envelope in his pocket no one had ever tried to cheat him what about the other guy you wanted done haarte asked the man shook his head gone to ground somewhere in manhattan we arent sure where yet we should find out soon you interested in the job new york haarte considered itll cost more theres more heat its more complicated wed need backup and we probably should make it look accidental or at least set up a fall guy whatever the man said lackadaisically not much interest in the details of haartes craft whatll it cost double haarte touched his breast pocket where the money now rested a lifted gray eyebrow you pick up all expenses the cost of backup equipment haarte waited a moment and said add ten points for the backup i can go there the man said they shook hands and haarte returned to his own car he called zane on the radio once more were on again this time in our own backyard chapter two rune got elected to pick up the videotape and her life was never the same after that she argued with her boss about picking up the tapetony the manager of washington square video on eighth street in greenwich village where she was a clerk oh she argued with him rewinding a tape playing with the vcr snapping the controls she stared at the fat bearded man forget it no way she reminded him how hed agreed she didnt have to do pickups or deliveries and that was the deal when hed hired her so she said there tony peered at her from under flecked bushy eyebrows and for some reason decided to be reasonable he explained how frankie greek and eddie were busy fixing monitors or somethingthough she guessed they were probably just figuring out how to get comped into the palladium for a concert that nightand so she had to do the pickups i dont see why i have to at all tony i mean i just dont see where the haveto part comes in and right about then he changed his mind about being reasonable okay heres where it comes in rune its the part where im fucking telling you to you know as your boss anyway whatsa big deal theres only one pickup thats like a total waste of time your life is a waste of time rune look she began not too patiently and went on with her argument until he said thin ice honey get your ass outa here now she tried not in the job description only because it wasnt in her nature to give in too quickly and then she saw him go all still and before he exploded she stood up and said oh will you just chill tony in that exasperated sly way of hers that would probably get her fired someday but so far hadnt then hed looked at an invoice and said christ its only a few blocks from here avenue b guys name is robert kelly oh rune thought mr kelly well that was different she took the receipt snagging the retro fakeleopardskin bag shed found in a usedclothing store on broadway she pushed out the door into the cool spring air saving all right all right ill do it putting just the right tone in her voice to let tony know he owed her one for this in her two decades on earth rune had learned that if she wanted to live life the way she did it was probably a good idea to collect as many obligations from people as she could rune was five two one hundred pounds today she wore black stretch pants a black tshirt under an businessmans arrow shirt shed cut the sleeves out of so it looked like a white pinstripe vest black ankle boots there were twentyseven silver bracelets all different on her left forearm her lips varied in size compressing expanding a barometer of her mood she had a round face her nose pleased her her friends sometimes said she looked like certain actresses who appeared in independent films but there were few presentday actresses she cared about or tried to look like if you took audrey hepburn and put her in a downtown new wave version of breakfast at tiffanysthats who rune wanted to resemble and in many ways she did she paused looked at herself in a mirror sitting in an antiques shop window the words wholesale only larger than the name of the place several months ago shed gotten tired of her spiky blackpurple haircut had rinsed out the frightening colors and had stopped trimming the do herself the strands were longer now and the natural chestnut was emerging staring at the mirror she now teased the hair out with her fingers then patted it back down it wasnt long it wasnt short the ambivalence of it made her feel more homeless than she normally did she started once more on her journey to the east village rune glanced down at the receipt again robert kelly if tonyd told her right away who the customer was she wouldnt have given him so much crap kelly robert member since may deposit cash robert kelly my boyfriend thats what shed told frankie greek and eddie at the store theyd blinked trying to figure out what that meant but then shed laughed and made it sound like a jokebefore they grinned and sneered and asked what was it like to be in bed with a seventyyearold man though shed added well we have been out on a date which left enough doubt to make it fun robert kelly was her friend more of a friend than most of the men shed met in the store and he was also the only one shed ever gone out within her three months working there tony had a rule against going out with customersnot that any rule of tonys would slow her up for more than a halfsecond but the only men she ever seemed to meet at the store were either long domesticated or about what youd expect from somebody who picks up clerks in a greenwich village video store hi im john fred stan sam call me sammie i live up the street thiss an armani you like it im a fashion photographer i work for morganstanley i got some blow hey you wanna go to my place and fuck kelly robert deposit cash wore a suit and tie every time shed seen him he was fifty years older than she was and when shed offered to do him a favor a little thing copy a tape for him for free hed looked down blushing and hed asked her out to lunch to thank her theyd gone to a highly turquoise s revival soda shop called the soda shop on st marks and surrounded by nyu students who managed to be both morbidly serious and giddy at the same time had eaten grilled cheese sandwiches with pickles shed ordered a martini hed laughed in surprise and said in a whisper hed thought she was sixteen the waitress had somehow accepted the fake id which showed her age to be according to the authentic documentationher ohio drivers licenserune was twenty at lunch hed been a little awkward at first but that didnt matter rune was an old hand at keeping the conversation going then he warmed up and theyd had a great time talking about new york cityhe knew it real well even though hed been born in the midwest how he used to go to clubs in hells kitchen west of midtown how hed have picnics in battery park how he used to go for hikes in central park with a lady friend of his rune loved that expression when she was old she hoped shed be somebodys lady friend shed oh damn rune stopped in the middle of the sidewalk goddamn she reached into her bag and found that shed forgotten the tape shed made for him which was too bad for mr kelly because hed be looking forward to it but mostly it was too bad for herbecause shed left it at the store and if tony found shed made a bootleg of a store tape jesus hed kick her right out on her ass no pleas for mercy accepted at washington square video but she couldnt very well go back now and pull it out from underneath the counter where shed hidden it shed bring it to mr kelly in a day or two or slip it to him the next time he stopped in would tony find it would he fire her and if he did well thems the breaks which is what she usually said or at least thought when she found herself back in line at the new york state department of labor a place where she was a regular and where shed made some of her best friends in the city thems the breaks her mantra of unemployment of fate in general too she supposed except that today trying to be cavalier about it she decided she didnt want to get fired for her this was a curious sensationone that went beyond the usual paininthebutt inconvenience of job searching that began to loom when a boss would motion her over and say rune lets you and me talk or this isnt going to be easy though it usually was very easy rune took the firings better than most employees she had the routine down so why was she worried about getting canned now she couldnt figure something in the air maybe as good an explanation as any rune continued east through the area that nyu and the real estate developers were decimating for dorms and boring cinderblock apartments a large woman thrust a petition toward her save our neighborhood it said rune passed the woman by that was one thing about new york it always changed like a snake shedding skins if your favorite area vanished or turned into something you didnt like there was always another one thatd suit you all it took was a subway token to find it she glanced again at mr kellys address east tenth apartment b she crossed the street and continued past avenue a avenue b alphabet soup alphabet city the neighborhood growing darker shabbier more sullen scarier save our neighborhood chapter three i haarte didnt like the east village when it came to the cointoss to see who was going to stake out the targets apartment three weeks ago after theyd gotten back from the gittleman hit in st louis he was glad zaned won he paused on east tenth and looked for surveillance in front of the tenement zaned been there for a half hour and had said the block looked clean theyd learned that a while ago the target had vanished from his apartment on the upper west sidethe apartment the us marshals service had provided for himand hed given the slip to his minders but that info was old the feds mightve tracked him down againthose pricks could find anybody if they wanted toand be checking this building out so this morning haarte paused scanned the street carefully looking for any signs of babysitters he saw none haarte continued along the sidewalk the streets were piled with garbage moldy books and magazines old furniture cars doubledparked on the narrow streets several moving vans too people in the village always seemed to be moving out haarte was surprised anybody moved in hed get the fuck out of this neighborhood as fast as he could today haarte was wearing an exterminators uniform pale blue he carried a plastic toolbox which contained not the tools of the bugkillers trade but his walther automatic on which was mounted his lansing arms suppressor also inside the box was the polaroid camera this uniform wouldnt work everywhere but whenever he had a job in new yorkwhich wasnt often because he lived therehe knew the one thing that people would never be suspicious about was an exterminator im almost there he said into his lapel mike the other thing about new york was that you could seem to be talking to yourself and nobody thought it was weird as haarte approached the building east tenth street zaneparked a block away in a green pontiac said streets clear saw a shadow in his apartment assholes in there or somebody is for this hit the way theyd worked it out haarte was going to be the shooter zane was getaway he said three minutes till im inside drive around back into the alley anything goes wrong we split up meet me back at my place okay he walked into the foyer of the building stinks in here he thought dog pee maybe human pee he shivered slightly haarte made over a hundred thousand dollars a year and lived in a very nice town house several miles from here overlooking the hudson river and new jersey so nice he didnt even need an exterminator haarte checked out the lobby and hallway carefully the target might not be thinking about a hit and haarte could possibly just call up on the intercom and say that he was there to spray for roaches the target might just let him in but he might also come to the top of the stairway aim into the foyer with his own piece and start shooting so haarte decided on the silent approach he jimmied the frontdoor lock with a thin piece of steel the cheap lock clicked open easily he stepped inside and took the pistol from his toolbox started down the hall to apartment b rune was surprised seeing robert kellys building surprised the way people sometimes are when they come to visit a friend for the first time shed seen his modest clothes and had expected modest quarters but she was looking at pisspoor the brick was scaly diseased shedding its schoolhousered paint in dusty flakes the wooden window frames were rotting rust water had trickled down from the roof and left huge streaks on the front step and sidewalk some tenants had patched broken panes with cardboard and cloth and yellowing newspaper of course shed known that the east village wasnt the greatest neighborhoodshe came to clubs here a lot and hung out with friends in tompkins square park on avenue a dodging the druggies and the wannabe gangsters but picturing the gentlemanly mr kelly the image that had come to mind of his home was a proper english town house with frilly plaster moldings and flowered wallpaper outside would be a black wroughtiron fence and a neat garden like the set in a movie shed seen as a little girl sitting next to her fathermy fair lady kelly would sit in the parlor like rex harrison in front of the fire and drink tea he would take small sips a cup of tea lasted forever in english movies and read a newspaper that didnt have any comics she felt uncomfortable embarrassed for him almost wished that she hadnt come rune walked closer to the building a threelegged chair lay on its side in the baredirt garden outside the front stairs a bicycle frame was fastened with a kryptonite lock to a noparking sign the wheels chain and handlebars had been stolen who else lived in the building she wondered elderly people she supposed there were a lot of retirees around there she herself would rather spend her final years there than in tampa or san diego but how had they happened to end up there she wondered thered be a million answers thems the breaks the building just across the alley from mr kellys was much nicer painted clean a fancy security gate on the front door a blond woman in an expensive pink joggers outfit and fancy running shoes pushed out the doorway and stepped into the alley she started her stretching exercises she was pretty and looked disgustingly pert and professional save our neighborhood rune continued to the front stairs of mr kellys building an idea occurred to her shed pick up the tape but instead of going back to the store shed take a few hours off she and mr kelly could go have an adventure shed take him for a long walk beside the hudson lets look for sea monsters shed suggest and she had this weird idea that hed play along there was something about him that made her think they were similar he was well mysterious there was nothing literal about himbeing unliteral was runes highest compliment she walked into the entryway of his building beneath the filth and cobwebs she noticed elaborate mosaic tiles brass fixtures carved mahogany trim if it were scrubbed up and painted she thought thisd be a totally excellent place she pushed the buzzer to b thatd be a fun job she thought finding junky old buildings and fixing them up but people did that for a living of course rich people even places like this could cost hundreds of thousands anyway shed want to paint murals of fairy tales on the walls and decorate the place with stuffed animals and put magical gardens in all the apartments she supposed there wasnt much of a market for that kind of look the intercom crackled there was a pause then a voice said yes mr kelly who is it the staticky voice asked heres johnnyyyyyyy she said trying to impersonate jack nicholson in the shining she and mr kelly had talked about horror films he seemed to know a lot about movies and theyd joked about how scary the kubrick film was even though it was so brightly lit but apparently he didnt remember who she was disappointed that he didnt get it its rune you knowfrom washington square video im here to pick up the tape silence hello she called static again ill be there in a minute is this mr kelly the voice didnt sound quite right maybe it wasnt him maybe he had a visitor a minute i can come up a pause wait there the voice commanded this was weird hed always seemed so polite he didnt sound that way now must be the intercom several minutes passed she paced around the entryway she was looking outside when finally she heard footsteps from inside coming down the stairs rune walked to the inner door peered through the greasy glass she couldnt see through it a figure walked forward slowly was it mr kelly she couldnt tell the door opened oh she said in surprise looking up the woman in her fifties with olivetinted skin stepped out glanced at her she made sure the door closed before she left the entryway so rune couldnt get insidestandard new york city security procedures when unknown visitors were in the lobby the woman carried a bag of empty soda and beer cans she took them out to the curb and dropped them in a recycling bin mr kelly rune called again into the intercom you all right there was no answer the woman returned and looked over rune carefully help you she had a thick caribbean accent im a friend of mr kellys oh her face relaxed i just called him he was going to come down hes on the second floor i know im supposed to pick up a videotape i called five minutes ago and he said hed be right out i just walked past his door an it was open she said i live up the hall rune pushed the buzzer and said mr kelly hello hello there was no answer ima go see the woman said you wait here she disappeared inside after a moment rune grew impatient and buzzed again no answer she tried the door then she wondered if there was another door maybe in the side or in the back of the building she stepped outside walked to the sidewalk and then continued on to the alley the pert yuppie woman was still there stretching the only exercise rune got was dancing at her favorite clubs world or area or limelight dancing was aerobic and she also built upperbody strength by pushing away drunk lawyers and account execs in the clubs coed rest rooms no there was nobody else maybe she then she heard the scream she turned fast and looked at mr kellys building heard a womans voice in panic calling for help rune believed the voice had an accentmaybe the woman shed just met the woman who knew mr kelly somebody the voice cried call the police oh please help rune glanced at the woman jogger who stared at rune with an equally shocked expression on her face then a huge squeal of tires from behind them at the end of the alley a green car skidded around the corner and made straight for rune and the jogger they both froze in panic as the car bore down on them whats he doing whats he doing whats he doing rune thought madly no no no when the car was only feet away she flung herself backward out of the alley the jogger leapt the opposite way but the woman in pink hadnt moved as fast as rune and she was struck by the sideview mirror of the car she was thrown into the brick wall of her building she hit the wall and tumbled to the ground the car skidded onto tenth street and vanished rune ran to the woman who was alive but unconscious blood pouring from a gash on her forehead rune sprinted up the street to find a pay phone it took her four phones and three blocks before she found one that worked chapter four mr kellys door was open rune stopped in the doorway stared in shock at the eight people who stood in the room no one seemed to be moving they stood or crouched singly or in groups like the mannequins shed seen in the import store on university place gasping she rested against the doorjamb shed raced back from the pay phone and charged up the stairs no trouble getting in this time the cops or the emergency medical service medics had wedged the building door open she watched them six men and two women some in police uniforms some in suits her eyes fell on the ninth person in the room and her hands began to tremble oh no oh no the ninth personthe man whose apartment it was robert kelly he sat in an old armchair arms outstretched limp palms up eyes open and staring skyward like jesus or some saint in those weird religious paintings at the met his flesh was very paleeverywhere except his chest which was brownred from all the blood there was a lot of it oh no her breath shrank to nothing short gasps she was dizzy oh goddamn him tony for making her pick up the tape and see this goddamn frankie greek goddamn eddie for pretending to fix the fucking monitors when all they were really doing was figuring out how to get into a concert for free her eyes pricked with tears goddamn but then rune had a curious thought that no no if this had to happen it was better that she was there rather than them at least she was mr kellys friend eddie or frankie wouldve walked in and said wow cool a shooting and it was better for her to be the one to see this out of respect for him no one noticed her two men in business suits gave instructions to a third who nodded the uniformed cops were crouched down writing notes some were putting a white powder on dark things a black powder on light rune studied the faces of the cops she couldnt look away there was something odd about them and she couldnt figure it out at first they just seemed like everybody elseamused or bored or curious about something then she realized thats what was odd that there was nothing out of the ordinary about them they all had a workaday glaze in their eyes they werent horrified or sickened by what they were looking at god they seemed just like the clerks in washington square video they looked just like me doing what i do renting movies eight hours a day four days a week just doing the job the big boring j they didnt even seem to notice or to care that somebody had just been killed her eyes moved around the apartment slowly mr kelly lived here greasespotted wallpaper sagged the carpet was orange and made out of thick stubby strands the whole place smelled like sour meat there was no art on the walls some oldtime movie posters in frames leaned against a shabby couch a dozen boxes were scattered on the floor it seemed hed been living out of them even his clothes and dishes were stacked in cartons he must have moved in recently maybe around the time hed joined the video club a month before she remembered the first time hed come into washington square video can you spell your name runed asked filling out his application yes i can hed answered offhand im of aboveaverage intelligence now do you want me to shed loved that and theyd laughed then shed taken down the rest of the facts about kelly robert deposit cash address east tenth street apt b hed wanted a detective film and thinking about the old dragnet series shed said all we want is the facts sir just the facts hed laughed again no credit cards she remembered thinking that was definitely one thing they had in common what were the words you knew them real well at one time how did they go runes eyes were on him now a dead man who was a little heavy tall dignified seventhdecade balding all that the father giveth me he that raised up jesus from the dead will also quicken up our mortal bodies what bothered her most she decided was the completely still way mr kelly lay a human being not moving at all she shuddered that stillness made the mystery of life all the more astonishing and precious iheard a voice from heaven saying ashes to ashes dust to dust sure and certain hope for resurrection and the sea shall give up the words coming fast now she pictured her father laid out by the talented siblings of charles sons in shaker heights five years before rune had a vivid recollection of the man lying in the satiny upholstery but that day her father had been a strangera caricature of the human being hed been when alive with the makeup the new suit the smoothed hair there was something slick and phony about him he didnt even seem dead he just seemed odd there was something far more real about mr kelly he wasnt a sculpture he wasnt unreal at all and death was staring right back at her she felt the room tilting and had to concentrate on breathing the tears tickled her cheeks with a painful irritation the lord be with you and with thy spirit blessed be the name of the lord one of the men near the body noticed her a short man in a suit mustachioed trimmed black hair flowing away from his center part held close to his head with spray his eyes were close together and that made rune think he was stupid youre one of the witnesses youre the one called nine one one she nodded the man noticed where her eyes were aimed he stepped between her and mr kellys body im detective manelli you know the deceased what happened her mouth was dry and the words vanished in her throat she repeated the question the detective watching her face probably trying to figure out where she fit on the spectrum of relationships said thats what were trying to find out did you know him she nodded she couldnt see the body her eyes fell to a small metal suitcase stenciled with the words crime scene unit they fixed on the case wouldnt let go the tape i was supposed to pick up the tape for my job tape what tape she pointed to a plastic bag with blue letters wsv printed on it thats my store he rented a movie yesterday i was supposed to pick it up you have some id she handed manelli her real drivers license and her employee discount card he jotted down some information you have a new york address she gave it to him this he wrote down too handed back the cards he didnt seem to think she was involved maybe in his line of work you got a feel for who was a real killer in a soft voice rune said i was the one who rented the tape to him it was me yesterday she whispered manically i just saw him yesterday i he was fine then i talked to him just a few minutes ago you talked to him i just called on the intercom youre sure it was him the detective asked she felt a thud in her chest recalling that the voice sounded different maybe it was the killer shed talked to her legs went weak no im not did you recognize the voice no but it didnt sound like mr kelly i didnt think anything about it i dont knowi thought maybe i woke him up or something the voice young old black hispanic she shook her head i dont know i couldnt tell you were outside did you see anything i was in the alley this green car tried to run us down us manelli repeated you and the woman from next door right what kind of car was it i dont know dark green or light dark tags what rune asked the license plate number you notice it he was trying to run me down the driver you didnt see the number you mean thats what i mean i didnt see it how bout the state the detective asked no he sighed you see the driver no there was too much glare another man in a suit came up to them he smelled of bitter cigarettes whatta we got manelli said to him heres what it looks like captain this lady comes to pick up a videotape she calls on the intercom and we think the perp answers probably after he does the vie does the vic rune stared at the detective furious at the callousness pops him three in the chest no defensive wounds so it happened fast he never even tried to dodge and one in the tv the tv rune followed their eyes the killer had shot out the tv set a spidery fracture surrounded a small black hole in the upper right it was she noticed a very old cheap set manelli continued then this neighbor up the hall he looked at his notebook amanda leclerc she comes upstairs and finds him dead nobody hears anything the captain asked no not even the shots okay then the killer or his backups in a car in the alley he bolts and takes out one witness and nearly me too rune thought as if they care manelli consulted his notebook again names susan edelman lives next door he nodded toward the building where rune had seen the jogger stretching ice her the captain asked ice do these people had no respect for human beings no manelli said but edelmans in no shape to say anything not for a while rune remembered the woman lying on the greasy cobblestones of the alley blood on her pink jogging suit remembered feeling guilty that shed put down the poor woman for being a yuppie for being pert this young ladynodding at runesaw the car too says she didnt see much yeah the captain asked you get a look at the perp the what perp rune shook her head i speak english its my native language the driver no how many people were in the car the captain continued i dont know there was glare i told him that yeah the captain said doubtfully some people think theres glare when they just dont want to see anything but you dont hafta worry we take care of witnesses youll be safe i wasnt a witness i didnt see anything i was getting out of the way of a car that was trying to run me over its a little distracting her eyes strayed again to the corpse she found shed eased to the side of the slow detective finally she forced herself to look away she glanced up at manelli the tape she said what can i get the tape im supposed to take it back to where i work she saw the cover for the cassette manhattan is my beat manelli walked over to the vcr and pushed eject a clatter of the mechanism the tape eased out manelli motioned to a crimescene cop who walked over the detective asked whatta you think can she have it one of my biggest fears the crimescene officers latexgloved hand lifted the cassette out of the vcr he looked it over whats that manelli asked the officer i rent debbie does dallas and get hit by a bus before i can return it my widow gets a bill for two thousand bucks for some sleazy porn and rune said angrily thats not what he rented and i dont think you should joke the technician cleared his throat kept an awkward grin on his face he didnt apologize he said thing is look at the tv you know him shooting it out maybe its a coincidence but id say we better dust this tape pretty careful maybe the perp looked at it and we do that well ill tell you i wouldnt run it through my vcr with powder on it this shitll gum up anything rune said you cant just take our tape she didnt care about washington square videos inventory no what bothered her was that the cops were keeping the one thing that connected her to robert kelly stupid she thought but she wanted that tape we can actually yeah no you cant its ours and i want it the captain was irritated with her but manelli even if he too was pissed off was trying to remain civilservant polite he said why dont we go downstairs youre not supposed to be here anyway rune glanced one last time at robert kelly then followed the detective into the hall which was hot and filled with the smells of dust and mold and cooking food they walked down the stairs outside leaning on an unmarked police car manelli said to her about the tapeweve gotta keep it sorry your boss wants to complain have him or his lawyer call the corporation counsel but we gotta might be evidence why you think the killer watched the movie she asked the detective said he may have picked it up to see if it was worth taking and then shot the tv because it wasnt the detective said maybe thats crazy rune said murders crazy she was remembering the pattern the blood made on mr kellys chest he asked tell me true how well did you know him rune didnt answer for a moment she wiped her eyes and nose with the tail of her shirtvest not well he was a customer is all you couldnt tell us anything about him rune started to say sure but then realized that no she couldnt everything she thought she knew which was a lot shed iust made up the wife who was dead of cancer the children whod moved away a distinguished military career in the pacific a job in the garment district a totally cool retirement party he still talked about ten years later in the past few years hed met a group of retirees in the east village getting to know them over the months at the a p or social security or one of the shabby drugstores or coffee shops on avenues a or b graduallyhed have been shy about ithe wouldve suggested getting together for a game of bridge or a trip to atlantic city to play the slots or saved their money to hear a rehearsal at the met these were scenes she could picture perfectly scenes from movies shed seen a dozen times only none of it was true all she could tell this cop was that kelly robert deposit cash wore suits and ties even in retirement he liked to laugh he was polite he had the courage to eat in restaurants by himself on holidays and he was a lot like her rune said to the cop nothing i dont really know a thing the detective handed her one of his cards and you really didnt see anything no he accepted this all right you think of something call me sometimes that happens a day or two goes by and people remember things when hed turned away and started up the stairs she said hey he paused looked back you get the asshole that did this that would be a real good thing you know thats why i do what i do he continued up the stairs the crime scene cop passed him and walked outside carrying his metal suitcase rune glanced at him started to walk away then turned back he looked at her then away as he continued to his station wagon she called to him oh one thing for your information mr kelly didnt rent dirty movies for some reasondont ask me whyhe liked movies about cops how big a problem was it haarte considered this walking quickly toward the subway the day was plenty coolnothing like a muggy spring day around the mississippi river when theyd gotten gittlemanbut he was sweating like crazy hed ditched the exterminator coverallsthey were tossaways standard procedure after a jobbut he was still hot he reflected on whatd happened part of it was bad luck but he was also at fault for one thing hed decided against hiring local backup because the vie wasnt being minded by the marshals or anybody else so there was just zane and him for both surveillance and shooting which had worked fine for the st louis hit but here he shouldve known that some innocents might show up new york was a big fucking city more people more bystanders then he decided hed sent zane down the alley too early he just wasnt thinking so they hadnt had any warning about whoever that girl was who showed up and rang the buzzer which happened just as haarte was about to shoot the vie had risen from his chair and seen haarte haarte had shot him the old guy had fallen on the remote control and the sound on the tv had gone way up so haarte had shot the tv set out too which made another loud noise and filled the apartment with a gassy smoky smell then the girl called on the intercom again she sounded concerned and a moment later there was a call from another woman grand central station jesus he knew they were suspicious and that theyd be coming upstairs to check on the vie at any minute so haarte decided to split up hed told zane to get back to haartes apartment hed go by surface transportation it wasnt a moment too soon as he climbed out the fire escape window on the east side of the building hed heard the scream then zane took off and haarte jumped into the alley and disappeared when theyd talked ten minutes later zane to his dismay told him there were witnesses two women one of them had been hit by the pontiac but the other jumped out of the way in time id you haarte asked couldnt tell i already changed the tags but i think we oughta get the fuck out of town for a while haarte considered this the broker in st louis wouldnt pay without some confirmation of the vics death and haarte hadnt had time to take a polaroid he also didnt want to leave the witnesses alive no hed told zane we stay listen we need that backup now find out whos in town what kind of backup zane asked somebody who can shoot hi there rune leaning on the fence in front of robert kellys building turned the woman shed met in the entryway the woman with the bag of cans was standing unsteadily on the stoop arms crossed tears running down her face theyd just brought the old mans body out rune had started to leave after manelli returned to the apartment but then shed decided to stay she wasnt sure why your names amanda the woman wiped her face with a paper towel and nodded thats right how you know the cops mentioned it im rune rune she spoke absently other tenants had come downstairs gossiped about the shooting then returned to their rooms or headed up the street the two detectives left manelli said goodbye the captain hadnt even glanced at her amanda cried some more unable to stop herself rune cried too wiped her face with the tail of the shirt again how you know him amanda had an accent rune decided that sounded like a female bob marleys low and sexy from the video store washington square video where he rented movies amanda looked at her like a vcr and renting movies were a luxury she couldnt even imagine rune asked howd you know him neighbors met him when he move in a month ago but we got close real fast what it was about robert he talk to you nobody else here talk to you he always ask about my kids ask where i came from you know so hard to find somebody who just likes to listen amen rune thought he asked me a lot about me too but he no say much about himself yeah thats true he never seemed to like to talk about the past i no believe this happen what do you think it was why somebody do this rune shrugged drugs ill bet around here what else i no understand why they kill him he wasnt no threat if they want to rob him they could take it and just let him be why kill murders crazy he so nice amanda continued speaking softly so nice when i have problems with the landlord problems with ins mr kelly help me out i only know him one month but he write letters for me he real smart more tears whatm i gonna do rune put her arm around the woman he help me with my rent the ins they took my check my paycheck i working but they took my check i applied for the card you know i was trying to do it right i no cheat nobody or anything but they wouldnt let me have any money but mr kelly he lend me money for the rent whatm i gonna do now they going to send you back home she shrugged wheres that rune asked home i come from the dominican republic amanda said then added defiantly but this is my home now new york city is my home she looked back at the building why they kill somebody like him therere so many bad people out there so many people with bad hearts why they kill somebody like robert there was no answer for that of course i have to go rune said amanda nodded wiped her eyes with the shredding paper towel thank you rune asked for what waiting till they take him away to say goodbye that was good of you that was very good chapter five near quitting time tony came back to the store so where the hell were you this afternoon i needed to clear my head rune told him tony snickered thatd take more than one afternoon tony no crap for favor he dropped his backpack in front of the counter and dodged around a cardboard cutout of sylvester stallone who brandished a large cardboard gun he checked the receipts you shouldve argued with the cop christ that tape its over a hundred bucks wholesale i gave you the name of the cop to talk to you want she shot back its not my job youre the manager yeah well at least you shouldve come back after frankie greek was here by himself he gets overloaded when hes got to work by himself she said in a low voice he gets overloaded when he has to tie his shoes by himself frankie a scrawny aspiring rock star and high school dropout had long curly hair and reminded rune of the poodle on the pink skirt shed bought last week at secondhand rose a vintage clothing store on broadway he was in the back room at the moment well where were you tony persisted walking around rune said i didnt feel like coming back i mean he was dead i saw him right in front of me whoa you see the bullet holes and everything oh jesus christ hang it up okay are they like in the movies she turned away kept wiping the counter with windex tony and frankie both smoked it made the glass filthy well you shoulda called i was worried worried like im sure she said just call next time rune had a feel for it now he was backing down no trips to unemployment this week thems the breaks she felt like pushing so she pushed there wont be a next time i dont do any more pickups okay thats a rule hey were all simpatico here no the washington square video family tony glanced at frankie as the skinny young man came out of the back room think i can fix that monitor frankie said yeah well thats not your priority locking ups your priority the large man slung his dirty red nylon backpack over his shoulder again and disappeared out the front door frankie said like i heard you talking to tony and how come you didnt make up something about coming in late today like say your mother got sick or something rune said why would i lie to tony you only lie to people who have power over you so what happened with the palladium frankie was crestfallen we only got one pass and eddie like won the toss man it was blondie too he glanced at a stack of porn tapes that had been returned and needed to be reshelved one title seemed to interest him he put it aside he said that guy who was killed he was that old guy you liked right yeah i dont remember him too good was he cool she leaned on the counter playing with her bracelets she looked outside the city had these weird orange streetlamps it was close to eleven pm but the light made the city look like afternoon during a partial eclipse yeah he was cool she dug under the counter and found the bootleg tape shed made for kelly turned it over in her hands also he was kind of different like what weird not weird the way you mean what uhm way do i mean she didnt answer a thought was in her mind but there was one thing weird about him not him personally he was the nicest old guy youd ever want to meet polite so what was weird about him well hed only been a member for a month and he rented the same movie a lot a lot rune typed on the keyboard of the little kaypro portable computer on the counter then she read from the screen eighteen times wow frankie said thats weird manhattan is my beat rune said never heard of it about a like reporter a cop walking a beat one of those oldtime cop movies from the forties you know all the men wearing those big drapey doublebreasted suits and have their hair slicked back nobody really famous in it dana mitchell charlotte goodman ruby dahl whore they you wouldnt know them theyre not part of the brat pack anyway the movie just came out on tape a month ago im not surprised nobody was in a hurry to release it i watched it but it wasnt my style i like the black and white though i hate colorization its a political issue with me anyway mr kelly shows up the day after its released we had a poster up in the window the distributor sent it uh there it is in the back frankie glanced oh yeah i remember it rune continued he comes in and wants to rent it he wasnt a member so he asks about joining then this is weirdness for youhe asks how he puts tapes in his tv can you believe it he doesnt know about vcrs so i tell him if he doesnt have a player hes got to get one and i tell him where audio exchange and crazy eddies are well he doesnt have much money i can tell cause he goes do you think theyll take a check see i just moved and it doesnt have my address on it that kind of stuff and i was thinking yeah right the reason they wont take the check isnt the address its that theres no money in the account so i tell him about this place on canal where they have all kinds of used stuff and he can probably get a vcr for fifty bucks beta only ill bet frankie sneered no theyve got vhs and he leaves and i think thats the last ill see of him but the next day hes back when the store opens and he says he found a player and he joins and rents this movie hes so interested in turns out hes a real sweetheart we bullshit some talk movies yeah your date frankie observed i remember him and hes not flirting or anything hes just talking takes the film home eddie picks it up the next day okay couple days later he calls a delivery in rents something i dont know what it is and what else manhattan is my beat again this goes on for weeks frankie nodded his shaggy hair bobbing christ rune told him i feel so sorry for the guy i picture him spending all his social security check on this stupid movie i told him just to buy it but you know tony how he marks up he was charging almost two hundred what a ripoff so i tell mr kelly im going to copy it for him man tonyd be super pissed he finds out frankie said lowering his voice as if the store were bugged yeah whatever rune said she pictured mr kelly again you shouldve seen his eyes i thought he was going to cry he was so happy anyway it was like noon or something and he asked if he could take me to lunch you know to thank me so did you make the dupe for him runes face fell after a moment she said i did yeah but it was just a couple days ago i never got the chance to give it to him i wish i had i wish hed seen it once at leastthe tape id made i mean he said he didnt have anything much to give me now but when he got rich hed remember me yeah right ive heard that before i dont know he said it in a funny way like when his ship came in it was like hey you know fairy stories uhm i dont know you mean like jack and the cornstalk she rolled her eyes i was thinking about this one from japan about the fisherman urashima like who frankie greeks eyes were close together too like the detective in mr kellys apartment manelli urashima saved a turtle from some children who were stoning it he helped it back to the ocean only it turned out to be a magic turtle and took him to the sea lords palace under the ocean how could he breathe underwater he just could but dont worry about it he could breathe okay anyway the lords daughter gave him money and pearls and jewels maybe everlasting youth too i dont remember man not too shabby frankie said happily ever after rune didnt say anything for a moment not exactly he blew it what happened frankie seemed marginally interested one of the things the daughter gave him was a box he wasnt supposed to open why not doesnt matter but he did open it and bang got turned into an old man in about five seconds flat see fairy tales have rules too you have to play by them he didnt youve gotta listen to magic turtles and wizards so thats what i was thinking of when mr kelly said something about getting rich that i did a good deed and he was going to give me a reward frankie added just dont open any magic boxes rune looked up so thats my story about mr kelly is it totally bizarre or what you ever ask him about it why he rented it so often sure and you want to hear a sad answer he said that movie its the highpoint of my life he wouldnt say anything else ill bet his wife and him saw it on their honeymoon or maybe he had a wild affair with some vampy woman the night it was released and they were in a hotel in times square with the premiere right outside their window like whatd the cops say about him getting whacked they have any idea why they dont know anything they dont care frankie flicked through the pages in a rock music magazine undid one of his earrings looked at it put it into a third hole in his other ear he said so youve seen it you think its worth being the highpoint of someones life depends on how low your life has been like whats it about the young man asked this movie theres a bank robbery in the s or s okay somewhere down in wall street the robbersre holed up with a hostage in the bank and this young copyou know in love with the girl next doors name is mary that kind of herogoes into the bank to exchange himself for the hostage then he kills the robber and then what happens is the cop cant resist see hes in love and he wants to get married but he doesnt have enough money so he takes the loot and sneaks it out of the bank then he buries it someplace the cops find out about it and throw him off the force and arrest him and he goes to jail thats all i think he gets out of jail and gets killed before he digs up the money only i got bored and didnt pay a lot of attention frankie said hey here it is listen he read from the video distributor catalogue manhattan is my beat nineteen fortyseven oh this is so bogus listen a gripping drama of a young idealistic policeman in new york city torn between duty and greed rune glanced at the clock quitting time she locked the door all i know is if i ever made a movie id shoot anyone who called it a gripping drama frankie said if i ever make a movie anybody can call it anything they want as long as i like get to play on the sound track hey it says here its based on a true story about a real bank robbery in manhattan somebody got away with a million dollars it says it was never recovered really rune hadnt known that its late she told frankie lets get out of here i need to a loud knock on the glass door startled them a threesome stood outsidea man and woman arm in arm and another woman in their twenties the couple was in black jeans tshirts she was taller than he was with very short yellowwhite hair and pale caked makeup dark purple lips the man wore high black boots he was thin he had a long face handsome and angular high cheekbones they both had yellow sony walkman wires and earphones around their necks her cord disappeared into his pocket the look was downtown chic and they displayed it like war paint the other woman was chubby had spiky orange hair and she moved her head rhythmically apparently to music that only she could hear she didnt wear a walkman headset the cut and color of her hair reminded rune of woody woodpeckers another knock frankie looked at the clock what do i say one word rune said the opposite of open but then the young man in black touched the door like a curious alien and gave rune a smile that said how can you do this to us he lifted his hands pressed them together praying begging then kissed his fingertips and looked directly into runes eyes frankie called like were closed rune said open it what open the door but you said open the door frankie did the man outside said just one tape fair lady just one and then well depart from your life forever except to return it rune said theres that sure he said walking into the store but tonight we need some amusement oh sorely rune said to the blond woman when do you have to have him back to bellevue the woman shrugged the woodpecker said nothing but walked through the racks of movies studying them while her head rocked back and forth are you members rune asked the blonde flashed a wsv card three minutes rune said youve got three minutes the man such a small splinter of life dont you think two and threequarters rune responded and counting was this guy over the edge or not rune couldnt decide the blonde spoke she asked frankie whats good like i dont know im new here were all new everywhere the young man said meaningfully looking at rune all the time every three minutes every two and a half minutes david bowie said that you like him i love him rune said howd he get two differentcolored eyes the man was looking at her own eyes he didnt answer didnt matter she forgot that shed asked him a question rune found her lipstick and carefully put it on she brushed out her hair with her fingers she decided she should be more coy looked at her watch two minutes less now he asked her want to go to a party rune looked into his eyes brown swimming paisley she said maybe where your place darling he said oh that again but he caught the expression on her face and suddenly sounding much more down to earth said all of us i mean a party wine and cheezits innocent swear rune looked at frankie he shook his shaggy head my sisters gonna have her baby anytime i gotta get home please downtown man asked why not rune thought recalling that her last date had been when there was snow piled up in the gutters one minute the man said our time is almost depleted he was back in the ozone and was speaking to the blonde she looked at the orangehaired friend and said we need a movie pick one me the woodpecker asked hurry the blonde whispered the man we have less than a minute until the floods mount the earth will tremble do you always talk that way rune asked he smiled the woodpecker grabbed a movie from the shelf how about this one i can live with it the blonde answered grudgingly frankie checked them out the man said poof times up lets go chapter six this is an example of stanford whites finest work rune told them riding up in a freight elevator a metallic grinding sound chains clinking the smell was of grease and mold and wet concrete floors under construction floors dark and abandoned fell slowly past them the sound of dripping water it was a building in the tribeca neighborhoodthe triangle below canal streetdating back to the nineteenth century stanford white the blonde asked the architect rune said the mysterious man said he died for love he knew that rune thought impressed she added murdered by a jealous lover on the top floor of the original madison square garden the blonde shrugged as if love were never worth dying for the woodpecker said is this legal living here but what of course is legal the man mused i mean whose sets of laws apply there are layers upon layers of laws we have to contend with some valid some not what are you talking about rune asked him he grinned and raised his eyebrows with ambiguous significance his name had turned out to be richard which disappointed rune somebody this truly renegade should have been named jeanpaul or vladmir at the top floor the car stopped and they stepped out into a small room filled with boxes stenciled with block korean letters suitcases a broken tv set an olivedrab drum of civil defense drinking water a dozen stacks of old beauty magazines the woodpecker strolled over to them and studied the covers historical she said the only door was labeled toilet in blotchy black ink no windows how can you stand it richard asked but rune didnt answer and disappeared behind a wall of cartons she climbed an ornate metal stairway which was in the middle of the room from the floor above she gave a shrill whistle yo follow me hey you imagine the trouble i have getting groceries up here as if i buy groceries the trio stopped cold when they reached the next floor they stood in a glass turret a huge gazebo on top of the building its sides rising like a crown ten stories below the city spread around them the empire state building distant but massive stern like an indifferent giant out of a maxfield parrish illustration beyond it the elegant chrysler building southward the city swept away toward the white pillars of the trade towers to the east the frilly woolworth building city hall farther east was a blanket of lightsbrooklyn and queens opposite the soft darkness of jersey through the glass of the domed ceiling they could see low clouds glowing pinkish from the city lights shes outmy roommate rune explained looking around shes playing russian roulette in a singles bar if i dont find her back by this time eating ice cream from the carton and watching sitcoms that means she got lucky well thats how she describes it rune pulled off her jacket it went on a hanger which she hooked onto the armature of a bulbless floor lamp that held an ostrichfeather boa and a fakezebraskin sport coat she unlaced her boots and set them on the floor next to two battered american touristers she opened one looking over shirts and underwear which she smoothed adjusting away creases refolding some of the wildcolored clothes then took off her socks and put them into the other suitcase to richard she said dresser and dirty clothes hamper nodding at the suitcases you rent this the woodpecker asked i just live here i dont pay any rent why not nobodys asked me to yet richard asked how did you get it rune shrugged i found it i moved in nobody else was here he said it becomes you being and becoming rune said recalling something shed overheard a couple of guys talking about in the video store a week or so ago he lifted his eyebrows hey you know hegel oh sure rune said i love movies the circle of the floor was divided by a cinderblock wall which shed painted sky blue and dabbed with white for clouds on runes side of the loft were four old trunks a tv a vcr three futons piled on top of one another a dozen pillows in the corner two bookcases completely filled with books mostly old ones a halfsize refrigerator where do you cook asked the woodpecker what does it mean cook rune replied in a thick hungarian accent richard said i feel something epiphanic about this place very watershed you know he looked in the refrigerator a bag of halfmelted ice cubes two sixpacks of beer a shriveled apple its not turned on it doesnt work what about utilities rune pointed to an orange extension cord snaking down the stairs some of the construction guys working downstairs they let me have electricity isnt that nice of them the woodpecker asked what if the owner finds out couldnt he kick you out id find someplace else youre a very existential person richard said and the blonde i want to start our party rune shut the lights out lit a dozen candles she heard the rasp of another match the flare reflected in a dozen angled windows the ripe raw smell of hash flowed through the room the joint was passed around beer too the blonde said to the woodpecker play the movie the one you picked out rune and richard sat back on the pillows watched the blonde take the cassette from the woodpecker and open the plastic container rune whispered to him are you two like an entity or something nodding at the blonde then she thought about it or are you three an entity richards paisley eyes followed the blonde as she crouched and turned on the vcr and television he said i dont know the redhead but the other onei met her last year at the sorbonne i was writing a thesis on semiotic interpretations of textile designs is this a joke i was sitting outdoors on the boulevard st germain and saw her get out of a limousine i was filled with an intense sense of preordination like calvinism rune said remembering something shed heard her mother a good presbyterian say once his head turned to her frowning falling out of character suddenly analytical he said oh predestination well that isnt really he nodded as he considered something then smiled oh you mean sort of damned if you do damned if you dont thats pretty good thats perceptive i get off a good one once in a while what the hell is going on she wondered didnt matter she supposed he seemed impressed appearances count though she realized she still didnt have a clue about his relationship with the sullen blonde rune was about to say something cool and giddy about casablancaabout rick and lisa in pariswhen richard leaned over and kissed her on the mouth whoa rune backed off eyeing the blonde wondering if she was going to get into a catfight here but the woman didnt noticeor didnt care she was stepping back handing the joint to the woodpecker who was adjusting the tv is this crazy letting three strangers into my loft sure it is then on impulse she kissed richard back didnt back away until she felt the pressure of his hand on her breast then she sat back lets just take it a little easy okay ive only known you for a half hour but time is relative she kissed his cheek an innocent peck destined never to be a tall sultry lover rune had flirtatious down cold im feeling deprived he pouted she started to give him another oh please glance but he meant the joint the woodpecker was holding hey darling to each according to his need the woman inhaled long and gave it to him he took a drag then passed it to rune he said what well do is assume a tantra yoga position rune said tantra yoga isnt that the sex one the woodpecker asked rune gave richard an exasperated grimace he said people think sex is the thing with tantra yoga wrong its breathing it teaches you how to breathe the right way rune said i know how to breathe im good at it ive been doing it all my life shall we assume the position she was about to hit him with a pillow when he slipped into an awkward sitting position three feet away from her and started to breathe deeply fully clothed he said i meant to add that rune said you look like you hurt yourself in a bad fall the tv screen flickered the copyright notice came on sit next to me he said she hesitated then did their knees touched she felt a spark of electricity but didnt move any closer what do we do now breathe deep and watch the show yeah rune called to the woodpecker whats the movie you picked the credits for lesbos lovers came on the screen the blonde pulled the woodpecker groggily toward her and covered her mouth with her own their arms wound around each other and their fingers began undoing buttons rune whispered to richard oh you meant that show richard shrugged either one in the morning when rune woke up richard was making coffee on her hot plate she asked wherere your friends she was looking intently for something under the cushions she surfaced with her colgate and toothbrush he looked around dunno you find the john downstairs i liked the plastic dinosaurs you did the decorating yourself i assume rune was examining him now he seemed out of place wearing the black outfitnight clothesin the bright openair loft he said whats your real name its not really rune is it everybody asks me about my name what do you tell them he asked the truth but whats the truth rune smiled at him ambiguously richard laughed but the fact youve got a fake name is very interesting philosophically i mean you know what walker percy says about naming he doesnt mean like first names or family names but humans giving names to things he says that naming is different from everything else in the universe a wholly unique act think about that she did for a moment then said a year ago i worked in a diner over on ninth avenue i was doris then i think i only took the job to get the name tag they gave us it said chelsea diner hi im doris he nodded uncertainly doris she said so what do you do richard stuff oh i see she said dubiously okay im working on a novel she knew he was a writer or artist whats it about i dont really talk about it much im at a tricky part right now this was even better a mystery man writing a mysterious novel in the throes of creative angst i write she said you do a diary rune pulled a thick water and inkstained booklet off the shelf a picture of a knightcut from a magazinewas pasted on the cover my mothers kept a diary every day of her life ive only been doing it for a few years but i write down everything thats major in my life she nodded at a dozen other booklets on the shelf everything he asked nearly you going to write anything about me richard asked he was looking at the notebooks as if he wanted a peek maybe rune said combing her hair out with her fingers he said and you you want to be an actress right guess again youre thinking of whatshername woody woodpecker who your friend last night with the orange hair the one who ran off with your girlfriend whoa not my girlfriend shes not even close to bi i made a pass at her once you rune asked sarcastically i met her last week at a party we give good image you he explained we look good together being chic and making entrances thats it not a meaningful relationship i dont even know her name hard to introduce her to your parents in that case thats not in the offing he carried the coffee to her set it on the floor next to the futon what about the sorbonne rune asked pas de sorbonne i thought so but ive been to france jeanpierre would be a good name for him too or francois yeah he definitely looked like a francois richard had to go rune glanced out the window dug under a futon and found some sunglasses she put them on feeling like a celebrity richard asked nodding at the fake raybans suddenly the sun came over the building to the east and the entire room filled with intense raw sunlight ouch he said blinded i maybell get curtains but i cant afford them and my roommate wont help pay youre not paying rent why have a roommate well she pays me something anyway having a roommates like trial by fire it toughens you is what it does you dont seem tough to me thats part of being toughnot looking tough anyway ill have to be out in a few months the owner sold the building and im only staying here cause i told the contractor that im the mistress of the old owner and he dumped me so theyre letting me stay until they start renovating this floor so you going to ask me out on a date a date i havent heard that word for a long time it sounds i dont know like swahili im not used to it true she supposed really chic people dont ask other chic people out on dates they just go places together still there was a certain commitment involved in the concept so she said date date date there now youre used to it so you can ask me out we just spent the night together on separate futons she pointed out and you want a date i want a date how about dinner he asked thats good okay i asked you on a date well go out you happy its not a date yet you have to tell me when and i mean exactly not a month not a week ill call you oh that are you kidding are men genetically programmed to say those three little words gimme a break he looked around helplessly i dont have my daytimer here hed call her and he had a daytimer this was scary richard was rapidly losing his appeal never mind she said cheerfully okay how about tomorrow he asked i know im not doing anything tomorrow not too eager nowwatch it i guess where do you want to go he asked you can come here ill cook i thought you didnt cook she said i dont cook well but i do cook well save the four seasons for a special occasion she looked at her wrist she wore two watches theyd both stopped working what time do you have eight shit i have to go rune said slipping off her tshirt she could sense richard watching her thin body eyes sweeping up and down she turned to him wearing only her bugs bunny panties so what are you staring at put her hands on her hips and got him to blush yes score one for me glad you dont shop at fredericks of hollywood he said a good recovery this boy had potential as she dressed richard asked whats the hurry didnt think your store opened until noon oh im not going to work she said im going to the police chapter seven miss rune detective manelli said we are investigating the case she looked at his organized desk herenot standing in front of a corpsehe seemed like an insurance agent the closetogether eyes werent so noticeable they moved quickly surveying her and she decided he might be smarter than shed thought his first name was virgil she looked at the nameplate twice to make sure shed read it right she nodded at the file open on his desk the one hed been reading but thats not his case mr kellys i mean he took a breath let it out no its not which one is his she asked stridently how far down is it she gestured at the stack of folders the captainthe one shed met in mr kellys apartmentbreezed in he glanced down with a splinter of recognition but didnt say anything to her they want to hear today he told manelli about the tourist killing theyll hear today manelli said wearily you got anything no the mayor you know the post the daily news i know the captain looked at rune once again he left the office were doing everything according to procedures manelli told her whos the tourist somebody from iowa knifed in times square dont start with me on that she said just let me get this straight youre no closer to rinding mr kellys killer than you were yesterday on manellis desk opening up like a mutant flower was a piece of deli tissue around a mass of corn muffin he broke off a chunk and ate it how bout you give us a day or two to make the collar the to arrest the killer i just want to know what happened in new york city weve got to deal with almost fifteen hundred homicides a year how many people are working on mr kellys case me mostly but therere other detectives checking things out look ms rune just rune what exactly is your interest he was a nice man the decedent what a gross word that is mrkellywas a nice man i liked him he didnt deserve to get killed the detective reached for his coffee drank some put it down let me tell you the way it works i know how it works ive seen enough movies then you have no idea how it works homicide why do you have to use such big fancy words decedent homicide a man was murdered maybe if you said he was murdered youd work harder to find who did it miss murder is only one kind of homicide mr kelly could have been a victim of manslaughter negligent homicide suicide suicide her eyebrows lifted in disbelief thats a really bad joke manelli snapped back a lot of people stage their own deaths to look like murder kelly couldve hired somebody to do it for the insurance oh she hadnt thought of that then she asked did he have an insurance policy manelli hesitated then he said no i see he continued can i finish rune shrugged well interview everybody in the building and everybody hanging around on the streets around the time of the killing we took down every license number of every car for three blocks around the apartment and well interview the owners were going through all of the deced through mr kellys personal effects well find out if he had any relatives nearby if any friends have suddenly left town since most perps wait perpetrators right yeah since more of em are friends or relatives of or at least know the vie thats the victim maybe were lucky well get a description of a suspect thatll go something like male caucasian six feet male black five eight wearing dark hat really helpful understand his eyes dropped to a notepad then well take what ballistics told us about the gunhe hesitatedand check that out she jumped on this so what do you know about the gun he was glancing at his muffin it wouldnt rescue him you know something rune insisted i can see it somethings weird right come on tell me it was a ninemillimeter mounted with a rubberbaffled silencer commercial not homemade like most sound suppressors are he seemed not to want to tell her this but felt compelled to and the slugs the bullets they were teflon coated teflon like with pots and pans yeah they go through some bulletproof vests theyre illegal rune nodded thats weird you dont see bullets like that very often usually just professional killers use them just like only pros use commercial silencers keep going about the investigation then sooner or later while were doing all that work maybe in three or four months well get a tip somebody got ripped off by a buddy whose cousin was at a party boasting he iced somebody in a drug robbery or something because he didnt like the way somebody looked at him well bring in the suspect well talk to him for hours and hours and hours and poke holes in his story until he confesses thats the way it happens the way it always happens but you get the picture it takes time nothing happens overnight not if you dont want it to rune said and before he got mad she asked so you dont have any idea manelli sighed you want my gut feeling where he lived some kids from alphabet city needed crack money and killed him for that with fancyschmancy bullets found the gun stole it from some oc soldier organized crimein brooklyn happens rune rolled her eyes and this kid who wanted money enough to kill for it shot the tv and left the vcr and hey did mr kelly have any money on him manelli sighed again pulled a file from halfway down the stack on his desk opened it he read through it walkingaround money fortytwo dollars but the perp probably panicked when you showed up and ran off without taking anything was the room ransacked it didnt appear to be rune said i want to look through it the room the detective laughed no way its sealed no one can go in he studied her face listen up ive seen that look before you break in itll be trespassing thats a crime and id be more than happy to give your name to the prosecutor he broke off another piece of muffin looked at it set it down on the paper what exactly do you want he asked it wasnt a dismissal he seemed just curious his voice was formal and soft did you know hed rented that movie that was in his vcr eighteen times in one month so doesnt that seem odd i seen people jump off the brooklyn bridge because they think their cats possessed by satan nothing seems odd to me but the movie he rented get this it was about a true crime some robbers stole a million dollars and the money was never found when he asked frowning i never heard about that it was like fifty years ago now manelli got to roll his eyes she leaned forward said enthusiastically but its a mystery dont mysteries excite you no solving mysteries excites me well thiss one that oughta be solved and it will be in due time i gotta get back to work what about the other witness rune asked susan edelman the one who got hit by the car shes still in the hospital has she told you anything we havent interviewed her yet now i really have to rune asked whatll happen with mr kellys body he doesnt seem to have any living relatives his sister died a couple of years ago theres a friend in the building amanda leclerc she put in a claim for permission to dispose of the body well keep it in the mes office until thats approved so thats all i can tell you now you dont mind i have to get back to work rune feeling an odd mixture of anger and sorrow stood and walked to the door the detective said miss she paused with her hand on the doorknob you saw what happened to mr kelly you saw what happened to ms edelman whatever you feel i understand but dont try to help us out thats a real bastard out there this isnt the movies people get hurt rune said just answer one question please just one silence in the small office from outside the noise of computer printers typewriters voices from the offices around them rune asked what if mr kelly was a rich banker would you still not give a shit manelli didnt move for a moment glanced at the muffin didnt say anything rune thought he thinks im a pain in the ass he sort of likes me but im still a pain in the ass he said if he was from the upper east side he was a partner in a big law firm then i wouldnt be handling the case but if i was the filed still be seventh in my stack rune nodded at his desk take a look its on the top now chapter eight shed called amanda leclerc but the woman wasnt home to let her into mr kellys building so she had to do it the oldfashioned way the way detective manelli unknowingly suggested breaking and entering at the bodega up the street from mr kellys building she told the clerk two boxes of diapers please put them in two bags and paid twenty bucks for one pair of playtex rubber gloves and two huge boxes of disposable diapers muchos ninios the lady asked rune took the bulgins bags and said si the pope you know the clerk not much older than rune nodded sympathetically she walked out of the bodega toward avenue b it was already fiercely hot and a ripe garbagey smell came from the streets she passed an art gallery in the window were wild canvases violent red and black slashes of paint she smelled steamed meat as she passed a ukrainian restaurant in front of a korean deli was a sign hotfood qtr lb alphabetville at kellys building rune climbed the concrete stairs to the lobby remembering the mans voice from the intercom who was it she shivered as she stared at the webby speaker she tried amanda once again but there was no answer so she looked around outside there was only one person on the street a handsome man in his thirties a pretty boy a thug from a martin scorsese film he wore a uniform of some kindlike the people who read gas and electric meters do he sat across the street on a doorstep and read a tabloid newspaper the headline was about the tourist whod been knifed in times square the case detective manelli was supposed to talk to the captain about rune turned back set the bags down opened one box of diapers and stuffed two of the pads under her black tshirt she buttoned the white blouse over it she looked about thirteen months pregnant then she picked up the bags crimped them awkwardly under her arms and opened the huge leopardskin purse staring into the black hole with a scowl dipping her hand into the stew of keys pens makeup candy kleenex a knife old condom boxes scraps of paper letters music cassettes a can of cheese spread for five minutes she kept at it then she heard the steps someone coming down the stairs a young man rune looked up at him embarrassed letting one of the bags of diapers slide to the ground just be a klutz she told herself lord knows youve had plenty of practice she picked up one of the bags and accidentally on purpose dropped her purse on the ground need a hand the young man asked unlocking the outer door and pushing it open for her retrieving her purse stuffing it under her arm my keys are in the bottom of this mess she said then thinking she should take the initiative she frowned and said quickly waityou new here i dont think ive seen you before uhm about six months he was defensive she pretended to relax she walked past him sorry but you know how it is new york i mean yeah i know thanks yeah he disappeared down the firstfloor hallway rune climbed to the second floor there was a red sign on the door to mr kellys apartment do not enter crime scene hypo the door was locked rune set the diapers in the incinerator room and returned to mr kellys door she took a hammer and a large screwdriver from her purse eddie from the store whod made her promise to forget hed given her a lesson in burglary had said the only problem would be the dead bolt and if there was a medeco and a metal door frame she could forget it but if it was just the door tumbler and wood and if she didnt mind a little noise rune put on the playtex glovesthinking about fingerprints they were the smallest size she could find at the bodega but were still too big and flopped around on her hands she tapped the screwdriver into the crack between the door and the jamb just about where the bolt was then looked up and down the hall and took the hammer in both hands drew it back like a baseball bat remembering when she used to play tomboy softball in high school she looked around again the corridor was empty she swung as hard as she could at the handle of the screwdriver and just like at softball she missed completely the gloves slipped and with the crack of a gunshot the hammer streaked past the screwdriver and slammed through the cheap paneling of the door shit trying to pull the hammer out of the thin wood she worked a large splintery piece toward her it cracked and fell to the floor she drew back again aiming at the screwdriver but then she noticed that the hole shed made was large enough to get her hand through she reached in found the door lock and the dead bolt and got it open then pushed the door wide she stepped inside and closed the door quickly and she froze bastards a tornado had hit the place the explosive clutter of disaster goddamn bastards goddamn police every book was on the floor every drawer open the couch slashed apart the boxes dumped out clothing scattered one bald spot in the mess under kellys floor lamp next to the chair with its dark horrible stain and the small bullet holes with spiny brown tufts of upholstery stuffing sprouting outward whoever had ransacked the room had stood thereor even sat in the terrible chairunder the light and examined everything then thrown it aside bastards her first thought had been the police did this and she was ready to cab it right back to the police station and give virgil manelli hell the narroweyed son of a bitch but she remembered the detectives neat desk his brisk haircut and trimmed mustache and she decided that someone else had done it a window was open and the fire escape was right outside the sill anybody couldve broken in hell she had but it wasnt druggies either the vcr and clock radio were still here who had it been and what were they looking for for an hour rune browsed through the mountains of mr kellys life she looked at everythingalmost everything not the clothes even with the gloves on they were too spooky to touch but the rest she studied carefully books letters the start of a diaryonly three entries from years ago revealing nothing except the weather and his sisters healthboxes of food the bold roaches were already looting bills receipts photos shoeboxes as she sifted carefully through everything she learned a bit about mr robert kelly hed been born in in cape girardeau missouri hed come to new york in then moved to california hed volunteered for the army air corps and served with the ninth air force a sergeant supervising ordnance in some of his letters hed used the words dearest sister or darling mother which made rune cry hed written about the bombs that were loaded into the a airplanes on their raids against occupied france and germany sometimes hed write his name in chalk on the pounders proud that he was helping win the war she found pictures of him in performances in the uso for soldiers in someplace called east anglia he seemed to be a sadfaced standup comic after the war there seemed to be a fiveyear gap in his life there was no record of what hed done from until in hed married a woman in los angeles and had apparently begun a series of sales jobs insurance for a while then some kind of machinery that had something to do with commercial printing his wife had died ten years ago theyd had no children it seemed he was close to his sister he took early retirement somehow hed ended up back here in the new york area most of what she found was simply biographical but there were several things that troubled her the first was a photograph of mr kelly with his sistertheir names were on the backtaken five years before he looked exactly the same as he had last week and she decided he was the sort that aged early like her own father and then seemed frozen in time in their later years what was odd about the picture was that it had been torn into pieces kelly himself hadnt done it since one square had been lying on the dried bloodstain it had been torn by the ransackers the other thing that caught her attention was an old newspaper clipping a bookmark in a battered copy of a daphne du maurier novel the clipping from the new york journal american dated read movie tells true story of gotham crime it was underlined and asterisks were in the margin fans of the hit film manhattan is my beat now showing on fortysecond street may recognize on the silver screen the true story of one of new yorks finest footsteps sounded outside the door rune looked up they passed by but she thought theyd slowed a chill of panic touched her spine and wouldnt leave she remembered where she was what she was doing remembered that manelli had warned her not to come here remembered that the killer was still at large time to leave rune slipped the clipping into her bag and stood she looked at the door then at the window and decided the fire escape was the choice of pros she walked to the window and flung the curtain aside jesus my lord she stumbled backward as the man on the fire escape his face a foot away from her screamed not a gasp or shout but a gutshaking scream shed scared the hell out of him hed been standing outside on the fire escape peering cautiously through the window now he backed away slowly nearly paralyzed with terror it seemed easing step by step up the peeling blackenameled metal then he turned and sprinted up toward the third floor she guessed he was in his late sixties he was balding with a face that was tough and pocked and gray not the kind of face that should be screaming her heart was pounding from the shock of the surprise her legs felt rubbery she stood up slowly and pushed her head out the window squinting she watched himhis fat belly taut above hammy pumping legsas he climbed through the window directly above kellys apartment she heard his footsteps walking heavily and quickly overhead she heard a door slam rune hesitated then walked to the front door knelt down and looked out through the crack coming down the stairs scuffed shoes baggy fatmans pants and suit jacket tight around the arms then his tough pocked face under a brown hat yes it was him the man from the fire escape he walked very quietly he didnt want to be heard hes leaving thank you god his face was the color of cooked pork sweat glistening on his forehead thank you thank you thank then he stopped and looked at the door to mr kellys apartment for a long while no its okay he thinks ive left he wont try to come inside thank the man stepped closer no its all right she told herself again he thinks that once he went upstairs i climbed out onto the fire escape and got away through the alley you another step as cautious as don johnson closing in on a dozen drug dealers in miami vice the man paused a foot away rune was afraid to lock the dead bolt or put the chain on hed hear her she pressed her palms against the door pushing as hard as she could the man walked directly to it then stopped inches away the thin woodhell shed whacked right through it herselfwas all that protected her runes small muscles trembled as she pressed against the door which is when the screwdriver slid out of her pocket in horror she watched it fallas if it were in slow motion it was a scene from a brian depalma movie she grabbed at the tool caught it then fumbled it no she reached down fast and managed to snag the screwdriver an inch above the oak slats of the floor thank you frozen in position like the game of statue she played as a kid rune listened to the mans labored breathing he hadnt heard anything hed have to know she left hed have to she slipped the screwdriver back into her pocket but as she did so she brushed the claws of the hammer which was hooked into the waistband of her pants the tool fell straight to the floor its head bouncing twice with echoing slams no she shouted in a whisper planting her feet on the opposite wall leaning hard into the door rune ducked her head waiting for the fist that she knew would slam through the cheap wood clawing for her hair her eyes shed be dead just like robert kelly it would only be a matter of minutes seconds and she would die but no he turned and ran down the stairs finally rune stood staring at her shaking hands and remembering some movie shed seen recently where the teenage hero had escaped from some killer and had stood frozen gazing at his quivering hands rune had groaned at the cliche but it wasnt a cliche at all her hands were trembling so badly she could hardly open the door she peered out hearing sounds of chatting voices and faroff tvs childrens squeals why had he run she wondered who was he a witness the killers accomplice the killer runeevery muscle shakingwalked fast to the incinerator room scooped up the diapers and hurried down the stairs two women on the landing nodded at her preoccupied with their conversation rune started past them head down but then she paused and in an exasperated voice said people dont know how to behave anymore they dont know a thing about it do they the women looked at her smiling in polite curiosity that guy a minute ago he almost knocked me over me too one woman said her gray hair was in pink curlers who is he rune asked breathing hard leaning against the banister thats mr symington in b he crazy the woman didnt elaborate so he lived here which meant he probably wasnt the killer more likely a witness yeah the womans friend added move up there last month whats his first name victor i think something like that never says hello or nothing so what the curler woman said hes nobody youd want to talk to anyway i dont know rune said indignantly id have a couple things to tell him the curler woman pointed to the box of diapers greatest invention ever was after tv her friend said rune said well sure and started down the stairs she ran into amanda on the street corner look the woman said shed been to hallmark and had bought a fake silver picture frame inside shed put a picture of her and mr kelly it was at christmas and they were in front of a skinny pine tree decorated with a few lights and tinsel there was still a smear of adhesive on the glass from the price tag its totally cool rune said and started to cry once more you have babies amanda was looking at the diapers oh long story you want them a faint laugh did that years and years ago rune pitched them out ive got a question what do you know about victor symington that guy live upstairs yeah amanda shrugged not so much he been in the building for maybe six weeks a month he never say hi never say how you doing i no like him so much i mean why not say good morning to people whats so hard about that you tell me whats so hard you said mr kelly never talked about his life much no he didnt did he mention anything about a bank robbery or a movie called manhattan is my beat you know i think he say something about that movie yeah a couple times he was real happy he find it but he never say anything about a bank robbery are you going to have a funeral for him i talked to the police and they said you wanted to bury him the woman nodded rune thought this is what you think of when somebody says a handsome woman amanda wasnt beautiful but she was ageless and attractive he has no family amanda said i have a friend he cuts grass at forest lawn maybe i can work something out with him to get mr kelly buried there thats a nice place if i can stay here in the us i mean but i no think that going to happen rune whispered to her dont give up just yet what i think mr kelly was about to get a lot of money mr kelly amanda laughed he never said anything about that to me i cant say anything for certain but think im right and i think this symington knows something about it if you see him will you let me know dont say anything to him she gave the woman the number of the video store call me there sure sure i call you rune watched the skepticism surface on her face you dont believe me do you she asked amanda the woman shrugged believe that mr kelly was going to get some money she laughed again no i no think so but hey you find it you let me know she said looked at the picture once more you let me know once upon a time walking west toward avenue a rune looked up and down the street for symington gone the heat was bad city heat dense heat wet heat she didnt feel like hurrying but she also didnt want to get into a shouting match with tony so she broke one of her personal rules and hurried to work once upon a time in a kingdom huge and powerful and filled with many wonders there was a princess a very small princess who no one took seriously she continued along the sidewalk feeling exhilarated shed met her first black knighta pockfaced man in his sixties wearing an ugly brown hatand escaped from him without being broads worded to death oh she was a beautiful princess though she was too short to be a model a beautiful princessand would be a lot more beautiful when her hair grew out then one day the princess became very sad because a terrible dragon hilled a hind old man and stole his secret treasure a secret treasure that hed promised to give her part of and thatd also save the bacon of a friend of his who was getting hassled by the creeps at immigration and naturalization third avenue broadway university place so the beautiful princess herself set out to find the dragon and she did and she slayed him or slew him or at least bagged his ass so hed have to hang around attica for twentyfive to thirty years she got the treasure of gold which she split with the friend and they both netted a cool half million rune walked into the video store watching tony inhale the breath that would come out as where the fuckve you been sorry rune held up her hands to preempt him its been one of those mornings she stepped behind the counter and logged onto the register so fast that she didnt notice across the street the man shed thought of as pretty boy the one in the meterreader jacket slide into a booth in the coffee shop he continued to watch her just like hed been watching her as hed followed her from the building on tenth street where theyd hit the old man rune grabbed a handful of tapes started to reshelve them thinking and the princess lived happily ever after chapter nine on the phone with susan edelman the pinksuited jogger the one whod been struck by the car in the alley beside mr kellys building couldnt talk long she was very groggy im being released uhm tomorrow can you uhm call me then she gave rune her phone number but it had only six digits then tried again and couldnt remember the last four numbers oh shell be a great witness rune thought sourly ill look it up in the phone book rune told her you listed uhm yeah feel better rune told her i got hit by a car susan said as if telling rune for the first time what had happened rune reshelved a few more tapes then as soon as tony left she told frankie she was going for coffee then booked out of the store outside she looked around the streets of the city caught a glimpse of somebody who looked familiara young man with dark curly hairbut she couldnt place him his back was to her something familiar about the stance his muscular build whered she seen him where but he stepped quickly into a deli so she didnt think anything more about him that was one thing about greenwich village you were always running into people you knew everyone thought new york was a huge city but that wasnt true it was a collection of small towns a yellow cab cruised up the street and she flagged it down she was in the new york public library in twenty minutes the books on general city historythere were hundredsdidnt help her much at all the history of crime in new york that was something else one thing she learned was that in manhattan there were more bank robberies per square mile than anywhere in the countryand most of them occurred on friday the traditional payday so with that volume of heists the union bank stickup didnt get much coverage she found a few references to it the only one that gave any details was in a book about the mafia which reported only that the family probably wasnt involved the newspapers were betterthough the robbery didnt get a lot of coverage because it hadnt occurred on a slownews day at the same time the hero cop was bargaining with the holdup man for the hostages life the rest of the world was following king edwards abdication which had filled all the city papers with features and sidebars rune couldnt help but read some of the articles she decided it was the most romantic thing shed ever heard she studied the picture of mrs simpson would anybody give up a kingdom for me would richard she couldnt come up with a satisfactory answer to that question and turned back to the stories about the union bank robbery after the shootout was over the robber was in the morgue and the million bucks was missing though that didnt seem too important at first because the hostage was safe and patrolman samuel davies was a hero the only hiccup was that there was no satisfactory explanation as to how the robber passed the suitcase containing the money to his partner outside the bank before davies started negotiating with him an accomplice of the deceased robber it is suspected secreted himself outside the bank and in a moment of confusion while patrolman davies was boldly approaching the bank seized the illgotten loot and absconded a month later the question of what had happened to the money had been answered and the newspaper stories were very different hero patrolman indicted in union bank theft boy admits hiding cops loot in mothers housea shame and disgrace says commissioner rune sitting at the huge oak platform of a table felt a queasy shiver for the cop the story came out that hed talked the robber into exchanging himself for the hostage who fled from the bank then hed convinced the thief to hand over his revolver what happened next was speculation davies claimed the robber had a change of mind and jumped him there was a scuffle the robber knocked down the cop and went for the gun davies tried to pull the pistol away from him they fought the gun went off the robber was killed but a young shoeshine boy testified that hed been hiding outside the bank waiting for something to see when a door above him opened and a man looked out it was davies the cop yes sir i can identify him sir he looks just like that man right there sir only that day he was wearing a uniform he asked for the boys address and then handed him a suitcase told him to take it home he says to me he says that if i opened the bag or i said anything about what happened id go to reform school and get the tar beat out of me every day i done what he said sir davies denied it allmurdering the robber taking the money breaking into the shoeshine boys home in brooklyn and stealing the suitcase then hiding the loot somewhere the policeman made a tearful defendant the papers reported but that didnt sway the jury davies got five to fifteen years the patrolmens benevolent association claimed all along he was the victim of a frameup and urged his parole he served seven years of the sentence but controversy around davies continued after his release only two days after he walked out the front door of sing sing in ossining new york in he was tommygunned to death at the corner of fifth avenue and ninth street in front of the gothic fifth avenue hotel no one knew who was behind the shooting though it looked like a professional hit the money was never recovered nothing more about the crime appeared in the press until the tiny blurb about the movie manhattan is my beatthe clipping rune had found in kellys apartment a homeless man sat down next to her at the library table she smelled foulness in the wake of the air around him like most derelicts he managed to seem both harmless and scary at the same time he whispered to himself wrote on a piece of wrinkled paper in the tiniest handwriting shed ever seen one of her watches seemed to be working she glanced at it oh shit it was after two her tenminute break had stretched to longer than two hours tony could be back she took a cab to the village but on impulse had the cabbie stop at fifth avenue the site of the fifth avenue hotel she paced back and forth slowly wondering where samuel davies was when he was gunned downwhat hed been doing what went through his mind when he realized what was happening if hed seen the black gun muzzle pointed at him she walked in wide circles weaving through the crowd until a copa reallife cop nypdwho was leaning on a patrol car must have decided she was acting a little suspicious and started walking slowly in her direction rune looked at the menu taped in the window of the glitzy restaurant on the corner frowned and shook her head she strolled toward university place the cop lost interest back at the store tony was waiting for her he lectured her for a whole two minutes on promptness and she did her best to look contrite what he grumbled thought id be out all day huh like you usually are she thought but said sorry sorry sorry wont happen again cross my heart i know it wont thiss your last chance late once more and youre outa here ive got people lined up to get a job lined up she looked out the front door where tony out back in the alley she then realized she should be more contrite sorry just a joke he glowered and handed her a pink whileyouwereout slip another thing this isnt message central now go get coffee and make it up to me you bet she said cheerfully he eyed her uncertainly the message was from richard it said confirming our date she liked the quotation marks she folded the pink slip of paper and slipped it into her shirt pocket here tony grumbled handing her money for the coffee naw thats okay she said its on me perplexing the poor man no end youre from ohio it was eight pm they were sitting in runes gazebo listening to the pachelbel canon rune had eight different recordings of the piece shed liked it for yearseven before it had caught on the way greensleeves and simple gifts had richard continued ive never met anyone from ohio she was wearing a black tshirt black stretch pants and redandwhitestriped socks shed done this as a homage to richards costume the other night he however was in baggy gray slacks keds and a beige texaco service shirt with the name ralph embroidered on the pocket this man is pure downtown i love him rune sang whats round on the ends and high in the middle its ohio thats it one more syllable and rodgers and hammerstein couldve written a musical about it ohio richard said thoughtfully there must be something in that solid dependable workingclass sort of metaphoric you were there and now yourehe waved his hand around the lofthere its a nice state she said defensively i dont mean anything bad but whyd you come here and not chicago or la a job no i know boyfriend nope you moved to manhattan by yourself to go on a real quest you have to go by yourself remember lord of the rings sort of refresh my memory sort of how could he not remember the best book of all time all the hobbits and everybody started out together but in the end it was frodo who got to the fiery pit to destroy the ring of power all by his littleold lonesome okay he said nodding not sure what the connection was but why manhattan rune explained i didnt spend a lot of time at home in the afternoons after school i mean my dad was pretty sick and my momd send my sister and me out to play a lot she got the dates and boyfriends i got the books books id hang out at the shaker heights library there was this book of pictures of manhattan i read it once and just knew i had to come here then she asked well how bout yout because of what rimbaud says about the city uhm wait shed seen the movie and hated it she didnt know rambod been a book she thought of the cardboard cutout in washington square videoof stallone with his muscles and that stupid headband not sure remember his poem about paris poem not exactly rimband wrote that the city was death without tears our diligent daughter and servant a desperate love and a petty crime howling in the mud of the street rune was silent trying hard to figure richard out downtown weird and smart shed never met anyone like him she was watching his eyes the way his long fingers went through a precise ritual of pulling a beer can out of the plastic loops that held the sixpack tapping the disk of the top to settle the foam then slowly popping it open watching his lean legs long feet the texture of his eyes she had a feeling that the posturing was just a facade but what was underneath it and why was she so drawn to him because there was something she couldnt quite figure out about him because of the mystery richard said youre avoiding my question why did you come here this is the magic kingdom youre not addressing rimbauds metaphor addressing why did he have to talk that way rune asked you ever read the oz books follow the yellow brick road he sang in a squeaky voice thats the movie but frank baumhe was the authorhe wrote a whole series of them in his magic kingdom of oz there were lots of lands all of them are different some people are made out of china some have heads like pumpkins they ride around on sawhorses thats just what new york is like every other city ive ever been in is like a discount store you knowclean cheap convenient but what basically unsatisfying thats what theyre literal theres no magic to them come here she took his hand and led him to the window what do you see the con ed building where right there i dont see a building rune turned to him her eyes wide i see a mountain of marble carved by three giants a thousand years ago they used magic tools ill bet crystal hammers and chisels made out of gold and lapis i think one of them i forget his name built this castle were in right now and those lights you see them over there all around us theyre lanterns on the horns of oxen with golden hides circling around the kingdom and the rivers you know where they came from they were gouged out of the earth by the gods toes when they were dancing and then and then therere these pits underground huge ones you ever heard the rumblings underneath us theyre worms crawling at fifty miles an hour sometimes they get tired of living in the dark and they turn into dragons and go shooting off into the sky she grabbed his arm urgently look theres one now richard watched the making a slow approach to laguardia he stared at it for a long time rune said you think im crazy dont you that i live in a fairy story thats not bad not necessarily i collect them you know fairy stories rune walked to her bookshelves she ran her finger across the spines of maybe fifty books hans christian andersen the brothers grimm perraults fairy tales the quillercouch old french stories cavendishs book on arthur and three or four volumes of his man myth and magic she held up one an original edition of lady gregorys story of the tuatha de danann and of the fianna of ireland handed it to him is it valuable richard flipped through the old book with his gorgeous fingers to me it is happily ever after he scanned pages rune said thats not the way fairy stories end not all of them she took the book from him and began thumbing past pages slowly she stopped heres the story of diarmuid he was one of the fianna the warrior guards of ancient ireland diarmuid let an ugly hag sleep in his lodge and she turned into a beautiful woman from the side thats the other side capital sthe land of magic thats sounds pretty happy to me but that wasnt the end she turned away and stared past her dim reflection at the city he lost her they both had to be true to their natureshe couldnt live in the side and she couldnt live on earth he had to return to the land of mortals he lost her and never found love again but he always remembered how he much hed loved her isnt that a sad story she thought for some reason of robert kelly she thought of her father tears pricked her eyes you sure have a lot of stories he said eyes on the spines of her books i love stories she turned to him couldnt keep her eyes off him he was aware of it and looked away you were like him coming after me the other night all dressed in black i thought of diarmuid when i first saw you like a knight errant on a quest she scrunched her face up accompanied by two tacky wenches richard laughed then added i was on a quest for you he kissed her youre my holy grail she closed her eyes kissed him back then said suddenly lets eat the cutting board in the shape of a pig was her kitchen table she cut open a round loaf of rye bread spread mayonnaise on both sides she noticed him watching her watch closely i told you i could cook thats cooking i think i can really cook i just havent done it much i have a bunch of cookbooks she pointed to the bookcases again my mother gave them to me when i left home i think she wanted to give me a diaphragm but lost her nerve at the last minute so she gave me fannie farmer and craig claiborne instead i cant use them much most recipes you need a stove for she poured cold chinese food from the carton onto the sliced loaf and cut it in half the cold pork poured out the sides when she sawed the dull knife through the bread and she scooped up the food with her hands and spread it back between the domes of rye okay he said dubiously well thats interesting but when she handed him the sandwich he ate enthusiastically for a skinny boy he had quite an appetite he looked so french he really had to be francois so he asked you going with anybody not at the moment or for any moments in the last four months three weeks half my friends are getting married he said he went through his beercan ritual again his long fingers beating out a hesitant rhythm on the top of the can then opening it and pouring the beer while he held the glass at an angle marriage hmm she said noncomrmttally where was all this headed but he was on to a new subject so whatre your goals she took a big bite of rye bread to eat dinner i guess i mean your life goals rune blinked and looked away from him she believed shed never asked herself that question i dont know eat dinner she laughed eat breakfast dance work hang out have adventures he leaned forward and kissed her on the mouth you taste like hunan mayonnaise lets make love his arms encircled her no rune drained her second beer you sure no yes she felt herself pulled forward toward him and she wasnt sure whether he was actually pulling her or she was moving by herself like a ouija board pointer he rolled on top of her they kissed for five minutes growing aroused that warm water sensation flowing up her calves into her thighs no yes no but she was saved from the debate by a voice shouting home a womans head appeared up the stairway zip it up a woman in her late twenties wearing a black minidress and red stockings climbed up the stairs high heels her hair was cut short in a s style and teased up the hair was black and purple so the roomies date hadnt turned out the way shed hoped rune muttered sandra richard richard sandra sandra examined him she said nothing to him but to rune you did okay then turned toward her half of the room unzipping her dress as she walked revealing a thick white strap of bra rune whispered shes a jewelry designer or thats what she wants to do days shes a paralegal but her hobby is collecting men shes slept with fiftyeight of them so far she has the score written down of course shes only come twentytwo times so theres some debate on what she can count theres no roberts rules of order for this sort of thing i suppose not richards eyes followed a vague reflection of sandra in the window she was on the far side of the cloud wall stripping slowly she knew she was being watched the bra came off last rune laughed and took his chin in her hand kissed him darling dont even think about it that woman is a time bomb you get into bed with her its like a group grope with a hundred people you dont know where theyve been christ runes voice grew soft i worry about her i dont like her but shes on some kind of weird suicide thing you ask me a guy looks at her and bang its in the sack richard said therere ways to be safe rune shook her head i knew a guy a friend used to work at one of the restaurants i tended bar at i watched his boyfriend get sick and die then i saw my friend get sick and die i was at the hospital i saw the tubes the monitors the needles the color of his skin everything i saw his eyes i was there when he died an image of robert kellys face came back to her sitting in the chair in his apartment an image of her fathers face richard was silent and rune knew shed committed the new york city crime being too emotional she cleaned up the remnants of dinner kissed richards ear and said lets watch a movie a movie why because i have to catch a killer chapter ten shed already seen manhattan is my beat once but watching it this time was different not because she was on a quote date unquote with richard not because they were lying side by side in the loft with hazy stars visible overhead through the peaks of glass but because when shed watched it before it had just been a movie that a nice quirky old man had rented now it was the rabbit holea doorway to an adventure the film was hokey sure filled with those classic images from that whole cumbersome era shed told frankie greek aboutthe baggy suits stiff hair the formalities of the dialogue the young cop twirling his billy club would say well now mrs mcgrath how are the misters corns this morning but she paid little attention to the period costumes and the words mostly what she noticed watching it this time was the grit the film left a sandy uneasiness in her heart shadows everywhere the contrasty black and white the unanticipated violence the shootingswhere the robber winged one of the heros fellow cops and a bystander for instance or the scene where the cop died in front of the hotelwere very disturbing even though there was no sam peckinpah slowmotion blood splattering no special effects it was like that great old alan ladd movie shaneunlike modern thrillers thered been only a half dozen gunshots in the entire film but they were loud and shocking and you felt each one of them in your gut manhattan is my beat also seemed pretty grated but rune felt the studio pulling a fast one in its portrayal of the cops virginal girlfriend played bywhat a name ruby dahl it was so clear to rune that the poor thing was lusting youd never know it from her lines oh i cant explain my feelings roy i just worry about you so theres so much evil out there but if her dresses and sweaters were highnecked rubys bosom was sharp and beneath the tame dialogue you knew she had the hots for roy she was the character that got the long camera shot when the judge announced that her fiance was going to prison she was the one rune cried for at two am sandra threw a shoe at them and rune shut off the vcr and the tv not bad once richard said whyd we have to sit through it twice he himself had given up his own quest for the evening and had kept his hands off her for the past several hours because i didnt take notes the first time she rewound the tape the bootleg copy shed made for robert kelly she looked at the scrawl of notes shed written on the back of a flier for a health club richard stretched and went into some weird yoga position like a pushup with his pelvis pressed into the floor his head back at a crazy angle staring at the stars above them okay i slept through most of it the second time i have to be honest were you joking about the killer the movie is why that customer i told you about is dead he saw it three times he couldnt take it anymore he killed himself dont joke she was whispering and he missed the flare in her voice she pulled her bag toward her and handed him the clipping shed found in kellys apartment he looked at it but put it down before he could have read more than a couple of paragraphs he closed his eyes she frowned and took the yellow brittle paper what it is she explained the movie was a true story there really was a cop in the thirties who stole some robbery money and hid it he denied the whole thing and nobody ever found the million dollars he got out of sing sing and got gunned down a few days later and supposedly he never had a chance to collect the money its just the way it happened in the film richard yawned rune on her knees crouched like a geisha holding the clipping i think what happened was mr kelly bought an old book at a secondhand store on st marks you know the book vendors near cooper union there was this clipping in it he read iti think he was interested in new york historyso he got a kick out of it but didnt think too much about it then what happens what then she said last month hes walking past washington square video and sees the poster for the film he rents it he watches it and he gets the bug you know what i mean the bug she waited richard seemed to be listening she said that feeling that gets to you when you know theres something out there but you dont know what but you have to find out what the mystery is like you youre mysterious she felt a trill of pleasure thats what my name means you know rune i thought a rune was a letter it is but it also means mystery in celtic and what does doris mean anyway she said ignoring him i think mr kelly and i were a lot alike sort of like you and me she let that sit between them for a minute and when he didnt respond she wondered and whats your mystery frangois jeanpaul vladmir richard after a moment he said im awake im listening rune continued what mr kelly did was decide he was going to find the money what money the money the cop took that was never recovered the million dollars come on rune the robbery was when fifty years ago sure maybe somebody found it maybe it got burned up you can always find excuses to give up on your quest before you start besides quests arent just about finding money or grails or jewels theyre about adventures mr kellyd been alone for years no family not many friends living by himself this was his chance for an adventure what was his life just sitting by the window all day and watching pigeons and cars here was a chance for a treasure hunt she started bouncing up and down remembering something he told me listen to this listen when he took me out to lunch he told me when his ship came in he was going to do something nice for me well what was the ship it was a million dollars richard said im tired i have to work tomorrow on your novel he hesitated for a minute and she didnt think he was being completely honest when he said thats right first date too early to push she asked are you going to put me in it in your novel maybe i will will you make me a little taller and grow my hair out no i like you just the way you are as he rolled over on his side she reread the old newspaper clipping now remember in the movie what the cop did with the money the groggy answer he snuck outside the bank and gave it to a shoeshine boy who took it home the cop broke into the kids house and stole it i was awake for that part and there was that totally melodramatic struggle all that loud music and the boys mother fell down a flight of stairs rune pointed out that was big in oldtime movies old ladies falling down flights of stairs that and angelic kids getting the dread unnamed disease guaranteed to make them waste away slowly she thought back to the film okay in the newspaper stories there was a shoeshine boy the cophis real name was samuel davies not roygave the kid the money and said take it home or basically ill beat the crap out of you that was the last anybody every heard of the money in real life but in the movie the cop gets it back from the kid and buries it in a cemetery someplace who came up with that idea hiding the money in a graveyard the writer who else he made it up richards eyes were closed the writer interesting then her attention returned to the tv she turned the vcr on again and fastforwarded it to the scene where dana mitchell playing the darkhaired squarejawed cop buries the suitcase in a city cemetery she hit the freezeframe button on the vcr and advanced the tape one frame at a time as the images shuffled slowly past rune said out loud but mostly to herself the answers here its here someplace he watched it eighteen times eighteen eighteen eighteen chanting the word mr kelly gets a clue he finds out something and then he figures out where the money is or okay maybe he cant get it himself hes getting old he had arthritis a limp he cant go digging around in cemeteries alone he needs help he tells somebody a friend an acquaintance somebody youngerwho can help him mr kelly tells this guy everything and then whats he do he gets the money and kills mr kelly maybe he was the guy in the green car what green car she hesitated another good social rule on a first date dont tell the guy that a killer just tried to run you over at a murder scene the police mentioned the killer was driving a green car richard pointed out in which case its gone the killer left town with his million dollars so what can you do find him is what i can do he killed a friend of mine anyway part of that moneys mine and theres this friend of my friend in the building whos going to get deported if she doesnt get some money he said why dont you just go to the police police she laughed they dont care why else he was looking at her closely now all right she admitted because theyd keep the money i know its out there i mean it could be what you said before about the writer making it up he mustve researched the real crime wouldnt you think id guess richard responded i mean isnt that what you do for your novels research yeah sure research a lot of research rune mused maybe he knows something course he wrote the script fifty years ago think hes still alive who knows how could i find out he shrugged why dont you ask somebody at the film school at nyu or the new school it was a good idea she kissed his ear see you like quests as much as i do i dont think so but i also have a feeling i cant talk you out of this can i nup you never give up on a quest until you succeed or you her voice trailed off seeing once again the pale skin of robert kelly dotted with his own blood the green car speeding toward her susan edelman flying into the brick wall well until you succeed thats all there is to it she looked at richards face his eyes closed lips parted slightly she tried to decide which she liked better his looking dreamyhe was real good at dreamyor the intense paisley eyes gazing intensely back at her dreamy she concluded he wasnt a warrior knightnot an arthur or cuchulain or percival de gales no he was more of a poetknight or a philosopherknight she heard his breath steady slow how nice she thought to feel the warm weight of somebody next to you in sleep she wanted so badly to lie beside him feeling him against her whole body but instead of stretching out she pulled off her wicked witch socks and aimed the remote control at the vcr then watched the movie one more time until the scripty words the end splashed up on the screen chapter eleven a karate flick was on the monitor oriental men in black silk trousers sailed through the air fists hissing like jet planes every time somebody got hit it sounded like a cracking board one of the chinese actors stepped toward a couple of rivals and spoke in a southern drawl okay you two back outa here real slow and you wont get hurt rune leaned back on the stool in front of the register at washington square video squinted at the monitor hey you hear that that is completely wild he sounds just like john wayne tony held his blue deli coffee cup and cigarette in one hand and flipped through the post with the other he looked up at the screen critically and hes going to beat the shit out of those guys in ten seconds flat it took closer to sixty and while he was doing it rune mused you think thats easy dubbing i mean you think i could get a job doing that tony asked dont tease me rune you quitting or you mean when you get fired rune spun her bracelets they dont have to memorize their lines do they they just sit in a studio and read the script thatd be so coolitd be like being an actress without having to get up in front of people and memorize things frankie greek was combing out his shaggy hair with a pick he rubbed the mustache hed started a month ago it looked like a faint smudge of dirt he stared at the tv screen shit look at that he kicked four guys at once he turned to rune you know i just found this out a lot of music in movies they do it afterward they add it on what you thought they had a band on set rune shut off the vcr tony looked at the tv hey whatre you doing it stinks she said it doesnt stink its great the actings ridiculous the costumes are silly theres no story frankie greek said thats what makes it so like you know the end of his sentence got away from him as they often did he prowled through the racks to find another film rune looked over the store the stained gray industrial carpet the black stringsleft over from promotional cardshanging down from the airconditioning the faded redandgreen holiday tinsel that was stuck to the walls with yellowing glue i was at a video store on the upper east side and it was a lot classier than here tony looked around what do you want were like the subway we serve a valuable function nobody gives a shit were classy not classy rune checked out two movies to a young man one of the daytime people she called them theyd rent movies during the day they worked at nightactors waiters bartenders writers at first shed envied them their alternative lifestyles but after she got to thinking about it how they were always blearyeyed or hung over and seemed dazed smelled like they hadnt brushed their teethshe decided aimlessness like that depressed her people would be better off going on quests she concluded she returned to her previous topic and said to tony that place uptown the video store they had all these foreign films and ballets and plays id never heard of most of them i mean its like you go in there ask for predator cop this alarm goes off and they throw you out tony didnt look up from dear abby got news babe predator cop makes us money masterfuckingpiece theatre doesnt wait is that a real movie frankie said master what jesus christ tony muttered rune said i just think we could doll the place up some get new carpet oh maybe we could have a wineandcheese night frankie greek said hey i could get the band to come down we could play some friday night and like hows this you could put a camera on us put some monitors in the front window so people the ones outsided notice us and theyd come in cool hows that it sucks thats how it is just an idea frankie greek slipped a new cassette into the vcr another one rune said watching the credits no no this is different frankie said he showed tony the cover now youre talking tony folded up the newspaper and concentrated on the screen patient as a priest with a novitiate he said rune you know who that is its bruce lee were talking classic in a hundred years peoplell still be watching this im going to lunch she said you dont know what youre missing bye be back in twenty okay she called adding once she was outside ill try richards idea about the film school was a good one but she didnt actually need to go to the film department itself she stopped at the eighth street deli which did a big business selling overpriced sandwiches to rich nyu students and professors she paused on her way inside looked around this was the deli where that guy with the curly hairthe one she sorta recognizedsorta didnthad ducked into yesterday she wondered again if hed been checking her out thinking youve got yourself more secret admirers first richard now him never rains but get real she reminded herself and walked up to the counterman who said next oh hi hey there rickie rune said he was working his way through school he was an nyu junior a film major and he could have been robert redfords younger brother when rune first started working at wsv shed spent a ton of money and many hours here talking to rickie about filmsand hoping hed ask her out theyd remained good friends even after rickie introduced her to his livein boyfriend she lifted the cellowrapped apple pie for him to see opened it began eating he handed her usualcoffee with milk no sugar they talked about movies for five minutes while he made tall sandwiches out of roast beef and turkey and tongue rickie knew a lot of heavyduty stuff about movies and even though he always said film or cinema never movies he didnt get obnoxious about it she finished the pie and he refilled her coffee rickie rune asked you know anything about a film called manhattan is my beat never heard of it came out in the late forties he shook his head then she asked is there like an old film museum at your school weve got a library not a museum the public librarys got that arts branch up at lincoln center momas probably got an archive but i dont think they let just anybody in thanks love she said hey i dont make the rules start working on a grant proposal or get a letter from your grad school adviser and theyll let you in but thats pretty heady stuff experimental films indies what do you need to know i need to find the screenwriter what studio made it metropolitan he nodded good old metro why dont you just call em up and ask theyre still around oh theyre like everybody else nowadays owned by some big entertainment conglomerate but yeah theyre still around and somebody thered know where the writer is now be your best bet screen writers guild probably wont give out any information about members hell i were you i wouldnt even call id just go pay em a visit rune paid he charged her a nickel for the pie she winked her thanks then said cant afford to fly out to la take a subway its cheaper you need a hell of a lot of transfers rune said the manhattan office darling metro has an office here sure all the studios do oh the east coast office wants to rip the throat out of the west coast office and vice versa but theyre still part of the same company theyre that big building on central park west you mustve seen it oh like i ever go uptown awesome the corporate office building of the entertainment corporation of america proud owner of metropolitan pictures forty stories overlooking central park a single company rune couldnt imagine having twenty stories of fellow workers above you and twenty stories below she tried to imagine forty stories of washington square video filled with tonys and eddies and frankie greeks it was scary she wondered if all the metro employees ate together in a single cafeteria did they all go on a company picnic taking over central park for the day waiting for the guard to get off the phone she also wondered if someone would see her and think she was an actress and maybe pull her onto a soundstage and throw a script into her hand though as she flipped through the companys annual report she realized that that probably wouldnt be happening because this wasnt the filmmaking part of the studio the new york office of metro did only financing licensing advertising promotion and public relations no casting or filming but that was all right her life was a little too busy just then for a career change thatd take her to hollywood the guard handed her a pass and told her to take the express elevator to thirtytwo express rune said grinning excellent her ears popped in the absolutely silent carpeted elevator in twenty seconds she was stepping off on the thirtysecond floor ignoring the receptionist and walking straight to the ceilingtofloor window that offered an awesome view of central park harlem the bronx westchester and the ends of the earth rune was hypnotized may i help you the receptionist asked three times before rune turned around if worked here id never get any work done rune murmured then you wouldnt be working here very long reluctantly she pried herself away from the window this is the view youd have if you flew to work on a pterodactyl the woman stared rune explained thats a flying dinosaur still silence try being adult rune warned herself she smiled hi my names rune im here to see mr weinhoff the receptionist looked at a chart on a clipboard follow me she led her down a quiet corridor on the walls were posters of some of the studios older movies she paused to touch the crisp wrinkled paper delicately farther down the hall were posters of newer films the ads for movies hadnt changed much over the years a sexy picture of the hero or heroine the title some really stupid line he was looking for peace she was looking for escape together they found the greatest adventure of their lives shed seen the action movie that line referred to and if the story had been their greatest adventure well then those charactersd been leading some totally bargainbasement lives rune paused for one last aerial view of the magic kingdom then followed the receptionist down a narrow hallway betting herself that mr weinhoffs would be one totally scandalous office a corner one looking north and west with a bar and a couch maybe hed be homesick for california so what hed insisted they do to keep him happy was to put a lot of palm trees around the room a marble desk a leather couch a bar of course would he offer her a highball what was a highball exactly they turned another corner she pictured weinhoff fat and wearing a threepiece checkered suit smoking cigars and talking like a baby to movie stars what if tom cruise called while she was sitting in his office could she ask to say hello hell yes shed ask or robert duvall sam shepard oh please please please they turned one more corner and stopped beside a battered pepsi machine the receptionist nodded there she turned around where rune asked looking around confused the woman pointed to what rune thought was a closet and disappeared rune stepped into the doorway next to which a tiny sign said s weinhoff the office about ten feet by ten had no windows it wasnt even ten by ten really because it was stacked around the perimeter with magazines and clippings and books and posters the deskchipped cigaretteburned woodwas so cluttered and cheap that even the detective with the closetogether eyes wouldve refused to work at it weinhoff looked up from variety and motioned her in so youre the student whats the name again im so bad with names rune nice name i like it parents were hippies right peace love sunshine aquarius all that can you find a place to sit well she got one thing right he was fat a ruddy nose and burst vessels in his huge cheeks a great santa glausif you could have a jewish santa no checkered suit no suit at all just a polyester shirt white with brown stripes a brown tie gray slacks rune sat down you want coffee youre too young to drink coffee you ask me course my granddaughter drinks coffee she smokes too god forbid thats all she does dont approve but i sin so how can i cast stones no thanks ill get some you dont mind he stepped into the corridor and she saw him making instant coffee at a water dispenser so much for the highballs he sat back down at his desk and said to her so howd you hear about me i called the public relations department here her voice rose in a question see im in this classthe roots of film noir its calledand im writing this paper i had some questions about a film and they said they had somebody on staff whod been around for a while around for a while i like that thats a euphemism is what that is and here i am well ill tell you why they sent you to me you want to know ill tell you what i am is the unofficial studio historian at metro meaning ive been here nearly forty years and if i were making real money or had anything to do with production theydve fired my butt years ago but im not and i dont so im not worth the trouble to boot me out so i hang around here and answer questions from pretty young students you dont mind i say that say it all you want good now the message saiddo i believe it youve got some questions about manhattan is my beat thats right well thats interesting you see a lot of students or reporters interested in scorsese welles hitch and you can always count on fassbinder spielberg lucas coppola three four years ago we got calls about cimino that heavens gate thing oh we got calls but i dont think anybodys ever done anything about the director of manhattan is my beat hal reinhart anyway i digress what do you need to know the movie was true wasnt it weinhoffs eyes crinkled no thats the whole point thats why its such a bigdeal movie it wasnt shot on sets it was based on a real crime it didnt cast gable tracy lana turner bette davis gary cooper or any of the other suredraw stars you understand none of the actors thatd guarantee that a film no matter it was a good film it was a bad film that a film opened you know what i mean opened sure runes pen sped across the pages of a notebook shed bought it a half hour before had written film noir on the cover then smeared the ink with her palm to age it like a master forger it means people go to see it no matter what its about right you are now manhattan is my beat was probably the first of the independents why dont you hear about it nowadays because it was also the first of the bad independents youve seen it four times what you also tell your dentist to drill without novocaine well if you saw it that many times you know it didnt quite get away from the melodrama of the big studio crime stories of the thirties the director reinhart couldnt resist the shoeshine boys mother falling downstairs the high camera angles the score hitting you over the head you should miss a plot twist so other films got remembered better but it was a big turning point for movies his enthusiasm was infectious she found herself nodding excitedly you ever see boomerang elia kazan he shot it on location not the greatest story in the world for a crime flicki mean theres not much secret who did it but the point isnt what the story was but how it was told that was about a real crime too it was awhatta you call itevolutionary step up from the studiolot productions hollywood thought you had to do manhattan is my beat was of the same ilk oh you gotta understand the era had a lot to do with it too i mean shifting to movies like that the war it robbed the studios of people and materials the bigproduction set pieces and epicsuhuh there was no way they could produce those and it was damn good they did you ask mehey whos asking me right but i think movies like manhattan helped move movies out of the world of plays and into their own world boomerang the house on nd street henry hathaway did that oh he was a gentleman henry was quiet polite he made that film i guess in fortyseven manhattan is my beat was in that movement its not a good film but its an important film and they were all true those films rune asked well they werent documentaries but yeah they were accurate hathaway worked with the fbi to do house so then if there was a scene in the movie say the characters went someplace then the reallife characters may have gone there maybe did you know anyone who worked on manhattan i mean know them personally sure dana mitchell he played roy the cop right right right handsome man we werent close but we had dinner two three times him and his second wife i think it was charlotte goodman we had signed here for a couple films in the fifties i knew hal of course he was a contract director for us when studios still did that he also did west of fort laramie and bomber patrol hey you know your films hals still around i havent talked to him in twenty years i guess is he in new york no hes on the west coast where i have no idea dana and charlotte are dead now the exec producer on the project died about five years ago some of the other studio people may be alive but they arent around here this is no business for old men im paraphrasing yeats you know your poetry you studying poets in school yeah all of them yeats erica jong stallone stallone yeah you know rambo your school teaches some strange things but education who understands it rune asked isnt there anybody in new york who worked on the film whoa darling the spirit is willing but the mind is weak weinhoff pulled out a film companion book and looked up the movie ah here we go hey here we go manhattan is my beat oh sure ruby dahl who could forget her she played roys fiancee and she lives in new york ruby naw shes gone same old story booze and pills what a business were in what a business what about the writer weinhoff turned back to the book hey here we go sure raoul elliott and if he was credited as the writer then he really wrote it all by himself i know raoul he was an oldschool screenwriter none of this prowrestling for credits you see now in a singsong voice weinhoff said polished sixtyseven pages of the tenth draft so i get the top credit in beerbelly extended typeface and that other hack only polished fiftythree pages so he gets his name in antleg condensed or no screen credit at all whine whine whine naw i know raoul if he got the credit he wrote the whole thingfirst draft through the shooting script does he live in new york ah the poor man hes got alzheimers god forbid hed been in a home for actors and theatrical people for a while but last year it got pretty bad now hes in a nursing home out in jersey you know where sure but i dont think hell tell you much of anything id still like to talk to him weinhoff wrote down the name and address for her he shook his head funny you hear about students nowadays they dont want to do this they dont want to do that yourei pegged you right away i dont mind sayingyoure something else talking to an old yenta like me going to all this trouble just for a school paper rune stood up and shook the old mans hand like i think you get out of life what you put into it all right im two hours late she thought she wasnt just hurrying this time she was sprinting to get to work this was something shed never done that she could ever remember tonys voice echoing in her memory back in twenty back in twenty along eighth street past fifth avenue to university place dodging students and shoppers running like a football player like president reagan in that old movie of his the one without the monkey no big deal tonyll understand i was on time this morning thems the breaks hes not going to fire me for being a measly two hours late a hundred twenty minutes the average running time for a film how could he possibly be upset no way rune pushed into the store and stopped cold at the counter tony was talking to the woman who was apparently her replacement showing her how to use the cash register and credit card machine oh hell tony looked up hi rune how you doin oh by the way youre fired pack up your stuff and leave he was more cheerful than hed been in months chapter twelve the woman an attractive redhead in her twenties looked uncertainly at rune then at tony rune said look tony im really really sorry i got you only lie to people who can control you but i dont want to get fired i dont i dont i dont i got stuck on the subway power failure or somebody on the tracks it was disgusting no lights it was smelly it was hot and i rune ive had it frankie greeks sister went into labor just after you left and he had to take her to the hospital and i know she did cause i called her obgyn to check you did what rune asked tony shrugged he coulda been faking whatd i know but whatta you want me to do when you give me some halfassed excuse about the subway call the head of the mta ask him if the e train got stuck at thirtyfourth street please dont fire me i had to work by myself for two fucking hours rune jesus tony its not like a hot dog stand at giants stadium at halftime how many customers did you have thats not the point i missed lunch ill be better i really time out the redhead said shutting them both up she added im not taking the job what tony was looking at her i cant take somebody elses job youre not i fired her before i hired you its just that she didnt know tony rune said hated that she was pleading but she couldnt help it what would richard think if he heard she got canned he already thought she was totally irresponsible id feel too guilty the redhead explained tony you said you needed a job i do but ill find something else no no doll tony said dont worry but then she said in a stony voice you fire her im leaving too tony closed his eyes momentarily jesus christ he then leaned forward and glared at rune okay frankies only going to be working halfdays until his sisters back home you can fill out his schedule but if you miss any more shifts without a real excuse thatll be it thank you thank you thank you tony then smiled at the woman probably thinking hed scored some points with her for his generosity he didnt notice that her expression as she looked back at him was the way you squint at a roach just before you squoosh it rune tony said this is stephanie isnt she pretty great hair dont you think why dont you show our beautiful new employee the ropes im going to the health club he sucked his gut in slung his backpack over his shoulder and pushed out the door isnt she pretty got great hair rune stepped on the jealousy long enough to say to stephanie thanks i dont know what to say i cant really afford to get fired right now oh ive been there stephanie glanced at the door as tony disappeared down the street so hes really in a health club you bet he is rune whispered then said burger king at the same time stephanie said mcdonalds they burst into laughter you dont want to get the straight and gay adult mixed up when youre putting them back rune was explaining right you dont the woman did have incredible hairlong redblond strands that tumbled over her shoulders the way hair seems to do only in shampoo commercials whats your name again rune now asked her it started with an s but she had a lot of problems with s names susan sally suzanne stephanie right rune stored it away in her brain and continued with the training session see we dont have covers on the porn so people have to rent them by the titles with some its easy soldier boys cowboy rubdown muscle truckers you know but some you cant tell we had one euv rent big blonds only it turns out that blondes with an e on the end is girl blondes and without the e is boy blonds did you know that i didnt anyway he got boys with big dicks and he wanted girls with big boobs he wasnt happy hey your hair is totally radical is that your real color for now it is stephanie examined runes arm love your bracelets yeah rune shook her arm they jingled stephanie said someone wanted me to do a porn movie once in la this guy said he was a ucla film grad came right up to me in a coffee shopi was hanging reading varietyand asked me if i wanted to do skin flick no kidding rune said nobodyd ever asked her to do a porn film she was wondering if she should feel insulted stephanie paused looking at a poster for gaslight ingrid bergman she was beautiful even with short hair rune said like in for whom the bell tolls she ran her fingers over her head patted the strands down again thought about a wig the porn did you do it naw just didnt seem right id be scared to death of you know catching something stephanie shrugged whered you get them the bracelets everywhere ill be walking down the street and then theres this feeling i get and its a bracelet calling me next store i come to bang theres one in the window stephanie looked at her skeptically it happens i swear to god tony said you were slacking off every minute i spend not making his life easier is his definition of slacking off what it is this friend of mine got murdered and im trying to find out what happened no yeah stephanie said i got carjacked in hollywood was in a honda you wouldnt think anybodyd kill somebody for a honda but i thought they were going to shoot me i let em take it they just drove off stopped at a stop sign and signaled to make a right turn like nothingd happened doesnt it seem weird theyd kill you for a car or even just a few hundred dollars or for a million dollars rune thought seeing in her minds eye robert kelly lying back in his chair the bullet holes in his chest and the one in the tv stephanie added i took a selfdefense course after that but that doesnt do you any good against a guy with a gun rune pushed the sad thoughts from her mind and walked through the shelves putting the tapes back gesturing stephanie after her youll learn stuff working here about human nature thats why i took the job of course i dont exactly know what to do with the human nature i learn but its still fun to watch people im a voyeur i think what can you learn about people in a video store hows a forinstance theres this guy cute a stockbroker always smelled like garlic but i flirted with him anyway he rents all these charles bronson films chuck norris schwarzenegger then he shows up here one night and hes got this yuppie trendoid girl hanging on him like hes a trapeze okay suddenly no more commando all he wants are things like the seventh seal and fellini and a lot of the recent woody allenyou know not bananas but the relationship stuff and things youd see on pbs right that lasts for a month then miss culture goes byebye and its back to death wish for a couple months then he comes in with some other girl all in leather and studs i know what youre thinking but guess what she likes old musicals dorothy lamour bing crosby bob hope fred and ginger thats all he rents for two months guys going to develop a complex i mean youve gotta be yourself right stephanie was brushing her hair rune continued like speaking of adult films oh dont call them dirty movies tony doesnt like that and besides its a megabusiness we make forty percent of our gross on them even though theyre only twelve percent of inventory well what i was saying was that now women rent almost as many as men and they dont rent all that much straight mostly its gay male flicks yeah stephanies sullen eyes flashed with a splinter of interest then the lids lowered again the brush went back into her purse rune decided stephanie would be a washington square video employee for thirty days max she could get just as boring work in restaurants and the pay would be three times as good why would women rent gay films way i figure it rune said its that the guys in gay films look a lot better than guys in straight films you know theyre really hunks cut work out take care of themselves straight films you see a lot of flab ive heard stephanie glancing with boredom at the adult section said lesbians are out of luck sounds like naw naw thats another good market weve got lets see girls on girls lesbos lovers sappho express but its mostly men rent those therere more girlfriends over in the west village not so many here rune walked back to the counter fluffed her hair out with her fingers stephanie looked at it said thats an interesting effect with the colors how did you do it i dont know it just kind of happened trying to figure if her comment was a compliment rune didnt think so interesting thats a bitch of a word interesting you have any freaks come in rune said depends on what you mean theres a guy knows every lineeven the tv and radio broadcastsin night of the living dead then this lawyer told me he and his wife rent casablanca after they have sex and i can look up in the computer and tell you that they must be having problems theres this one guy mad max hes real creepy and always rents slasher films those stupid things like halloween and friday the th part you know sexist bastards stephanie said thats who makes those films but turns out hes a social worker for a big hospital uptown and volunteers for meals on wheels things like that seriously i keep telling you a video store is a great education stephanie said you have a boyfriend im not sure rune said she decided this was a pretty accurate statement is rune your real name for now it is a queue formedand rune walked stephanie through the checkout procedure i cant believe this is your first day youre a born clerk rune told her thanks loads stephanie drawled dont tell tony but what im hoping is ill meet some producers or casting agents here i want to be an actress just a dry spell right now i havent auditioned for a month what about all those casting calls in la a casting call doesnt mean you get the part la is yucky new yorks the only place to be i knew i liked you rune said and rented the seven samurai sleeping beauty and lust orgy to a pleasant balding businessman chapter thirteen the rivers are moats the buildings are parapets wait is that right what exactly is a parapet anyway the buildings are parapets the stone pitted and stained with age and cloudy water dripping slick stalactites and stalagmites dark windows with bars on the dungeons were riding down down down the hooves of our horses muted by the cold brick down into the secret entrance that leads under the moat out of the magic kingdom out of the side richard guided the old dodge into the holland tunnel and headed for new jersey isnt it wild rune asked the orange lights flashed by the gassy sweet smell of exhaust flowing into the car what there is probably a hundred feet of water and yuck on top of us right now thats really something he looked dubiously up at the yellowing ceiling of the tunnel above which the hudson river was flowing into new york harbor something he said uneasily it was his car the dodge they were in this was pretty odd richard lived in manhattan and he actually owned a car anybody who did that had to have a pretty conventional side to them after all paying taxes and parking and registration fees this bothered her some but she wasnt really complaining it turned out that the nursing home where the writer of manhattan is my beat lived was forty miles from the city and she couldnt afford to rent wheels for this part of her quest whats the matter she asked nothing and they drove through the rest of the claustrophobic yellow tunnel in silence rune was careful when men got moody it could be a real pisser put them with their buddies let em get drunk and snap their jocks and throw footballs or lecture you about bunuel or how airplane wings work and they were fine but holy st peter something serious comes upespecially with a woman involvedand they go all to pieces but after twenty minutes when they were out of the tunnel richard seemed to relax he put his hand on her leg more sparks how the hell does that happen she wondered rune looked around as they headed for the turnpike gross the intersections were filled with stoplight poles and wires and mesh fences and gas stations she looked for her favorite service station logopegasusand didnt see one thats what they needed a winged horse to fly them over this mess how did you get off work richard asked her it was sunday and shed told him that shed been scheduled to work eddie covered for me i called him last night thats a first for medoing something responsible he laughed but there wasnt a lot of humor in his voice richard removed his hand and gripped the wheel he turned southwest the fieldsflat like huge brown lawnswere on either side of the highway beyond were marshes and factories and tall metal scaffolding and towers lots filled with trailers from semi trucks all stacked up and stretching for hundreds of yards its like a battlefield rune said like those thingswhat do you suppose they are refineries or somethingare spaceships from alpha centauri richard looked in the rearview mirror he didnt say anything he accelerated and passed a chunky garbage truck rune pulled an imaginary air horn and the driver gave her two blasts on his real one tell me about yourself she said i dont know all the details he shrugged not much to tell ugh did he have to be such a man she tried a cheerful tell me anyway okay he grew slightly animated the hipster from the other night had partially returned he was born in scarsdale the son of pleasant suburban parents and raised to become a doctor lawyer or other member of the elite destined to grind down the working class he had an uneventful boyhood distinguished by chess club latin club and a complete inability to do any kind of sport rock and roll saved his ass though and he grew to maturity in the mudd club and studio cool i loved them then for some unknown reason fordham decided to give him a degree in philosophy after four years of driving the good fathers there to distraction with his contrarian ways after that he took the opportunity to see the world rune said so you did go to paris ive always wanted to see it rick and lisa casablanca and that hunchback guy in the big church i felt so sorry for him i didnt exactly get to france richard admitted then slipped back into his thirdperson narrative what he did was get as far as england and found out that working your way around the world was a lot different from vacationing around the world being a punch press operator in londonif you can get to be a punch press operator at allisnt any better than being one in trenton new jersey so the young adventurer came back to new york to be a chic unemployed philosopher going to clubs playing with getting his ma and phd going to clubs picking up blondes without names and brunettes with pseudonyms going to clubs working day jobs getting tired of clubs waiting to reach a moment of intersubjectivity with a woman working away on his novel right on his novel so far he seemed to be pretty much on her wavelengthdespite the car and the moods she was into fairy stories and he was into philosophy which seemed different but when she thought about it rune decided they were both really the sametwo fields that could stimulate your mind and that were totally useless in the real world somebody like richardmaybe him maybe not but somebody like him was the only sort of person she could be truly in love with rune believed i know whats the matter she said why do you think somethings the matter i just do well he said what tell me remember that story i told you which one youve told me a lot of stories about diarmuid i feel like were a fairy king and queen whove left the sideyou know the magic land she turned around gasped oh youve got to look at it turn around richard look im driving dont worryill describe it therere a hundred towers and battlements and theyre all made out of silver the sun is falling on the spires glowing and stealing all that energy from the sunhow much energy do you think the sun has well its all going right into the magic kingdom through the tops of the battlements she had a sudden feeling of dread as if shed caught his mood a premonition or something after a moment she said i dont know i dont think i should be doing this i shouldntve crossed the moat shouldntve left the side i feel funny i almost feel like we shouldnt be doing this leaving the side he repeated absently maybe thats it and looked in the rearview mirror again he might have meant it might have been sarcastic she couldnt tell rune turned around hooked her seat belt again then they swept around a long curve in the expressway and the country arrived hills forests fields a panoramic view west she was about to point out a large cloud shaped like a perfect white chalice a towering holy grail but rune decided shed better keep quiet the car accelerated and they drove the rest of the way to berkeley heights new jersey in silence he hasnt had a visitor for a month the nurse was saying to rune they stood on a grassy hill beside the administration building of the nursing home richard was in the cafeteria hed brought a book with him thats too bad i know its good for the guests the nurse continued people coming to see them how is he some days hes almost normal some days hes not so good today hes in fair shape who was the visitor last month rune asked she said an irish name i think an older gentleman kelly maybe could have been yes i think so runes heart beat a bit faster had he come to ask about a million dollars she wondered rune held up a rose in a clear cellophane tube i brought this is it okay if i give it to him hell probably forget you gave it to him right away but yes of course you can ill go get him you wait here they dont come to see me much last time was let me see let me see let me see no they dont come we have this party on sundays i think it is and what they do is its real nice what they do is put when the weathers nice put a tablecloth on the picnic benches and we eat eggs and olives and ritz crackers he asked rune its almost fall now isnt it the nurse said in a voice aimed at a threeyearold you know its spring mr elliott rune looked at the old mans face and arms it seemed like hed lost weight recently and the gray flesh hung on his arms and neck like thick cloth she handed him the flower he looked at it curiously then set it on his lap he asked youre rune he smiled in a way that was so sincere it almost hurt he said i know of course i know your name to the nurse wheres bips whered that dog get to rune started to look around but the nurse shook her head and rune understood that bips had been in puppy heaven for years hes just playing mr elliott the nurse said hell be back soon hes safe dont you worry they were on a small rise of grass underneath a huge oak tree the nurse set the brakes on his wheelchair and walked away saying ill be back in ten minutes rune nodded raoul elliott reached up and took her hand his was soft and very dry he squeezed it once then again then released it like a boy testing the waters with a girl at a dance he said bips you couldnt believe what they do to him these boys and girls they poke at him with sticks if he gets too close to the fence youd think theyd be brought up better than that what day is it sunday rune answered i know that i mean the date june fifteenth i know that elliott nodded he fixed a gaze on an elderly couple strolling down the path the grounds were trimmed and clean couples elderly and mostly of the same sex walked slowly up the paved paths there were no stairs curbs steps low plants nothing to trip up old feet i saw one of your movies mr elliott flies buzzed in then shot away on the warm breeze big thick white clouds sent their sharpedged shadows across the grass elliott said my movies i thought it was wonderful manhattan is my beat his eyes crinkled with recognition i worked on that with ah this memory of mine sometimes i think im going loony there were a couple of the boys who were they wed have a ball i ever tell you about randy no well randy was my age a year or two older maybe we were all from new york somed been newspapermen some were writing for the atlantic or editing for scribners or conde nast but we were all from new york oh it was a different town in those days a very different town the studio liked that they liked men from new york like frank ohara we were friends frank and i we used to go to this bar near rockefeller center it was called well there were a lot we went to in hollywood too wed hang out in hollywood you worked on a newspaper sure i did which one there was a pause and his eyes darted well there were the usual ones you know its all changed mr elliott do you remember writing manhattan is my beat sure i do that was a few years ago charlie gave it a good review frank said he liked it he was a good boy henry too they were all good boys we said we didnt like reviews we said what we said was reviewers were so low you shouldnt even ignore them he laughed at that then his face grew somber but we did care oh yes maam but your father can tell you that where is he is he around here the old head with its wave of dry hair swiveled my father isnt bobby kelly your father rune saw no point in breaking the news about mr kellys death to the old man she said no hes a friend well where is he he was just here he stepped away for a few minutes wheres bips hes off playing i worry about the traffic with him he gets too excited when theres cars about and these boys they poke sticks at him girls too he was aware of the flower again and touched it did i thank you for this she said you bet you did rune sat down on the grass beside the wheelchair crosslegged mr elliott did you do your own research for the movie for manhattan is my beat research we had people do our research the studio paid for it pretty girls pretty like you and they researched the story that the movie was based on the cop who stole the money from union bank they arent there anymore ill bet you they went on to timelife a lot of them or newsweek the studio paid better but it was a wild sort of life some of them didnt want is hal doing okay now and hows dana handsome man he was fine theyre both fine did you find out anything about the cop who stole the money the cop in real life i mean sure i did what elliott was looking at his wrist where his watch probably should have been ive lost it again do you know when well be leaving itll be good to get home again between you and i i mean between you and me i dont like to travel i cant say anything to them though you understand do you know when were leaving i dont know mr elliott i sure dont so what did you find out about the cop who stole the money cop in manhattan is my beat i wrote the story i tried to write a good story theres nothing like that you know isnt that the best thing in the world a good story it was a wonderful story mr elliott she got up on her knees i especially liked the part where roy hid the money he was digging like a madman remember in the movie it was hidden in a cemetery in real life did you ever have any idea where the cop who stole the money hid it the money he looked at her for a second with eyes that seemed to click with understanding all that money and rune felt a low jolt in her stomach a kick she whispered what about the money his eyes glazed over again and he said what they do heretheyll do it when the weathers nicethey put paper on the tables like tablecloths and we have picnics here they put nuts in little paper cups theyre pink and look like tiny upsidedown ballet dresses i dont know where the tables are i hope they do that again soon wheres bips rune sank back down on her haunches she smiled hes playing mr elliott ill look out for him they sat in silence for a moment and she asked what did robert kelly want when he came to visit you a month ago his head nodded toward her and his eyes had a sudden lucidity that startled her who bobby why he was asking me questions about that damn movie the old face broke into a smile just like youve been doing all afternoon rune leaning forward studying his face the lines and gnarls what exactly did you talk about you and bobby kelly your father bobby oh the usual i worked on manhattan with some of the boys i know you did what did bobby ask you about it stuff stuff she asked cheerfully elliott frowned somebody else did too somebody else was asking me things her heart pounded a little faster when was that mr elliott do you remember last month no no just the other day wait i rememberit was today little while ago he focused on her it was a girl boyish looked a lot like you wait maybe it was you he squinted rune felt that he was on the verge of something she didnt say anything for a moment like the times she and her father would go fishing in rural ohio playing the heavy catfish with the frail sears rods you could lose them in a wink if you werent careful bobby kelly she tried again when he came to visit what did he ask you about the movie the eyes dropped and the lids pressed together the usual you know are you his daughter just a friend where is he now hes busy he couldnt make it he wanted me to say hello to you and tell you that he had a great time talking to you last month you talked he told me you talked all about what was it again that place what place that place in new york the place i sent him hed been looking for it for a long time is what he told me runes heart thudded hard she turned her head and looked directly into his milky eyes he was happy when i sent him there you should have seen his face when i told him about it oh he was real happy wheres bips just playing mr elliott im looking after him where did you send bobby kelly he was real anxious to find it and i told him right off im sure i did do you remember now oh one of those places there are lots of them you know rune was leaning forward please try to remember she thought please pleasepleaseplease didnt say anything silence the old man shook his head he sensed the importance of her questions and there was frustration in his eyes i cant remember im sorry he rubbed his fingers together sometimes i think im going loony just loony im feeling pretty tired i could use a nap thats okay mr elliott she tasted her disappointment but she smiled and patted his arm then moved away quickly when she felt how thin it was thought of her father hey dont worry about it rune stood up walked behind him and took the white plastic handles of the chair undid the brakes she started to wheel the chair toward the sidewalk elliott said suddenly the hotel florence five fourteen west fortyfourth at tenth avenue rune froze she dropped into a crouch next to him her hand on the frail bone of his arm thats where you sent him i i think so it just came to me thats wonderful mr elliott thank you so much she leaned forward and kissed his cheek he touched the spot and seemed to blush richard appeared and stepped up toward them starting to speak rune held up her hand to him he stopped raoul elliott said i want to take a nap now wheres bips hes playing mr elliott hell be here soon elliott looked around miss can i tell you something sure i lied rune hesitated then said go ahead tell me bipss a little shit ive been trying to give him away for years you know somebody who wants a dog rune laughed i sure dont sorry elliott looked at the flower curious again started to pull off the cellophane wrapping it defeated him and he set it back on his lap rune took the flower from him and opened it up he held it lightly in his hands he said youll come back sometime wont you we have this party when its spring we can talk about movies id like that rune said id love to youll say hi to your father for me sure i will the nurse was approaching the old mans head sagged against the side of the wheelchair he breathed slowly his eyes were not quite completely closed but he was asleep he started to snore very softly rune looked at him thinking again how much he resembled her father toward the end of his life cancer or aids or old age deaths packaging is all so similar the nurse nodded to her and took the chair wheeled it down the path the flower fell to the sidewalk the nurse picked it up and set it on his lap again a dense shadow of a cloud that rune thought looked just like a dragon rearing up on its sturdy hind legs passed over them she turned to richard lets get out of here lets get back to the side chapter fourteen the florence hotel near the hudson river was in hells kitchen west of midtown rune knew her new york history at one point this had been one of the most dangerous areas in the city the home of the gophers and the hudson dusters murderous gangs that made the mafia look tame most of the dangerous elements had been urbanrenewed away when the tunnel to new jersey was built but the dregs of some irish and latino gangs remained it was in short not a neighborhood to be hanging out in alone at night thanks tons richard she thought hed left her there after dropping her off in front of the florence a fourstory flophouse with a scarred and peeling facade shed started to ask him again what the matter was but then some kind of radar kicked in and she decided it would be a bad move cant really hang around hed told her youll be okav ill be fine wonder woman thats me gotta meet some people tonight otherwise id stay she hadnt asked who been dying to but hadnt no thats fine you go on you sure go on some people she watched his car drive away he gave her a formal wave she hesitated only a moment before she stepped carefully around the bum who slept in front of the beercanfilled flower box under the narrow front window she pushed open the lobby door and stepped inside the smells were of damp wallpaper disinfectant some vague unpleasant animal scents the sort of place that made you want to hold your breath the clerk looked up at her from behind a plexiglas security barrier that distorted his features a thin man hair slicked back wearing a dress shirt and rustcolored corduroy pants the shirt had dark stains the pants light yeah he called im a social worker from brooklyn rune said you asking me im telling you who i am yeah a social worker im trying to find some information about a patient of mine a man who stayed here for a month or so dont you call em clients what we get social workers here all the time they dont have patients they have clients one of my clients she corrected herself you got a license a license a drivers license look im older than i no a social work license a license oh that see i was mugged last week when i was on assignment in bedford stuyvesant visiting a client they took my pursemy other purse my good purse and that had my license in it ive applied for a new one but you know how long it takes to get a replacement tell me worse than a passport im talking weeks the man was grinning whered you go to social work school harvard no shit the smile didnt leave his face if theres nothing else im pretty busy he picked up a national geographic and flipped it open look i have my job to do i have to find out about this man robert kelly the clerk glanced up from his magazine he didnt say anything but rune even through the scuffed plastic could see caution in his eyes she continued i know he stayed here for a while i think somebody named raoul elliott recommended that he come here raoul nobodys named raoul summoning patience rune asked do you remember mr kelly he shrugged she continued did he check anything here a suitcase maybe a package in the safe safe we look like the kinda hotels gotta safe its important again the man didnt respond suddenly rune understood shed seen enough movies she lifted her purse slowly and opened it reached in and took out five dollars she slid it seductively toward him just like an actor in a movie shed seen a month or so ago harrison ford she thought or michael douglas that actord gotten results she got a laugh rune gave the clerk another ten look kid the going rates fifty for information thats the way it is all over the city its like a union fifty shit she handed him a twenty thats all got he took the money i dont know nothing you bastard i want my money back except one thing about your client kelly this priest or minister father soandso called i dont know a couple days ago he said kellyd dropped off a suitcase for safekeeping he couldnt get him at his apartment and had this as his only other number this priest figured i might know where kelly was he didnt know what to do with the suitcase yes rune thought remembering the scene in manhattan is my beat where roy buried the money in a cemetery next to a church excellent thats great you know where the church was you have any idea i didnt write nothing down but i think he said he was in brooklyn brooklyn runes hands were up against the grimy plexiglas she leaned forward bouncing on her toes thiss awesome the man slipped her money into his pocket well happy day he opened the magazine again and began reading an article about penguins outside she found a pay phone and called amanda leclerc amanda its rune how are you been better missing him you know robert only knew him for a little while but i miss him more than some people i knew for years and years i was thinking about it and you know what i thought whats that that maybe because we werent so young no more we got to be more closer faster sort of like there wasnt a lot of time ahead of us i miss him too amanda rune said havent heard nothing about mr symington he hasnt been back no nobodys seen him i was asking around well ive got good news she told her about the church and the suitcase the woman didnt answer for a moment rune you really thinking there maybes some money they keep coming after me for the rent im trying to find a job but its tough nobody hires old ladies like me i think were on the right track well what do you want me to do start calling churches in brooklyn see if mr kelly left a suitcase there you can go to the library and get a brooklyn phone book weve got one at the video store ill take a through l you take m through z z do any churches start with a z i dont know st zabars okay ima start calling first thing in the morning rune hung up she looked around her the sun was down now and in this part of the city the bleakness was wrenching but what she felt was only partly the sorrow of the landscape the rest was fear she was vulnerable low buildingsa lot of them burnedout or in various stages of demolitiona few auto repair shops an abandoned diner a couple of parked cars nobody on the street whod help her if she was attacked a few kids in gang colors sitting on steps sharing a bottle of colt or a crack pipe a hooker a tall black woman on nosebleedhigh heels leaned against a chainlink fence arms crossed some bums shoring on grates or in doorways she felt very disoriented she was back in manhattan but she still felt that something separated her from her element from the side starting down the street eyes on the filthy pavement keeping close to the curbaway from the alleys and the buildings where muggers and rapists lurk thinking back to lord of the rings thinking how quests always start off in springtime with nice weather good friends around to see you off hearty food and drink in your pack but they end up in mordorthe bleakest of kingdoms a place full of fire and death and pain it seemed to her that someone was following though when she looked back she could see nothing but shadows she worked her way to midtown and caught a subway an hour later she was back home in the loft no note from richard and sandra was outa date on sunday totally unfair nobody ever had a date on sunday hell she slipped manhattan is my beat in the vcr and started it once more the movie was halfway through before she realized that shed been reciting the dialogue along with the actors shed memorized it perfectly damn scary she thought but kept the film running till its end haarte was angry it was monday morning and he was sitting in his town house zane had just called and told him that the one witness susan edelman was about to be released from the hospital and that the other girl the one with the weird name was investigating the case harder than the nypd angry which was a difficult emotion in this business haarte wasnt allowed to be angry when hed been a cop there was nothing he could do with his anger as a soldier and mercenary and nowas a professional killerhe found anger to be a liability a serious risk but he was mad oh he was furious he was in his town house thinking about how messy this fucking job had become killing a man ought to be simplicity itself he and zane had gotten drunk a month ago sitting in the bar in the plaza hotel theyd both grown maudlin and philosophical their job they decided was better than most because it was simple and pure as they poured down lagavulin scotch haarte had derided advertising execs and lawyers and salesmen theyve got complicated bullshit lives zane had countered but thats reality and realitys complicated and hed answered if thats reality you can have it i want simplicity what he meant was that there was a weird kind of ethics at work here haarte really believed this someone paid him money and he did the job or he couldnt do it in which case he gave the money back or he tried again simplicity either someone was dead or not but this hit wasnt simple anymore there were too many loose ends too many questions too many directions it might take he was at risk zane was at risk and of course the people whod hired them were at risk too the man in st louis didnt know exactly what was going on but if he found out hed be enraged and that made haarte all the angrier he wanted to do something yet he couldnt decide what there was the witness in the hospital there was the weird girl the one in the video store he needed to snip some of those loose ends but as he sipped his morning espresso he couldnt decide exactly how to handle it there are many ways to stop people whore a risk to you you can kill them of course which is the most efficient way in some cases and sometimes killing witnesses and meddlers makes the case so much more difficult to investigate that the police put the matter low on their list of priorities but sometimes killing people does the opposite it gets the press involved it galvanizes cops to work even harder killings one way but you can also hurt people scare them it doesnt take much physical pain at all to put somebody out of commission for a long long time lose a limb or your eyesight often they get the message and develop amnesia about what they saw or what they know and the cops cant even get you for murder you can also hurt or kill someone close to the person you want to stop their friends or lovers this works very well hed found what to do haarte stood up and stretched he looked at his expensive watch he walked into his kitchen to make another cup of espresso the thick coffee made zane agitated but haarte found it calmed him cleared his head sipping the powerful brew thinking what was supposed to be simple had become complicated thinking time to do something about that there she was up ahead haarte had waited for her there an alley for a half hour walking down the street in her own little world he wondered about her haarte often wondered about the people he killed and he wondered what there was about him that could study people carefully and learn about them for the sole purpose of ending their lives this fact or that fact which somebody might find interesting or cute or charming could in fact be the linchpin of the entire job a simple fact shopping at this store driving this route to work fucking this secretary fishing in this lake a halfblock away she paused and looked in a storefront window clothes did women always stop and look at clothes haarte himself was a good dresser and liked clothes but when he went shopping it was because a suit had worn out or a shirt had ripped not because he wanted to amuse himself by looking at a bunch of cloth hanging on racks in a stuffy store but this was a fact about her that he noted she liked to shopwindowshop at leastand it was going to work out for the best because farther up the street a block away from the store she was examining he noticed a construction site he crossed the street and jogged past her she didnt notice him he looked over the site the contractor had rigged a scaffolding around a fivestory building that was about to be demolished there were workmen in the building but they were on the other block and couldnt even see this street haarte walked underneath the scaffold and stepped into the open doorway he looked at the jungle of wires and beams inside the chill open area of what had been the lobby the floor was littered with glass conduit nails beer cans not great but it would do he glanced up the street and saw the girl disappear into the clothing store good he pulled latex gloves out of his pocket and found a piece of rope cut a foot length with the razor knife he always kept with him then he went to work with the rope and several lengths of pipe five minutes later he was finished he returned to the entryway of the building and hid in the shadows long to wait he wondered but no it turned out only four minutes strolling down the street happy with her new purchase whatever it was the girl was paying no attention to anything except the spring morning as she strolled along the sidewalk twenty feet away fifteen ten she started under the scaffolding and when she was directly opposite him he said oh hey miss she stopped gasped in fright took a deep breath like you scared me she said angrily just wanted to say be careful where youre walking its dangerous round here he said nothing else she squinted wondering if shed seen him before then she looked from his face to the rope he held in his hand her eyes followed the rope out the doorway along the sidewalk to the lally column she stood beside and she realized what was about to happen no please but he did haarte yanked the rope hard pulling the column out from underneath the first layer of scaffolding hed loosened the other columns and removed the wood blocks from under them the one that the rope was tied to was the only column supporting the tons of steel and twobyeights that rose for twenty feet above the girl as she cried in fear her hands went up fingers splayed but it was just an automatic gesture pure animal reflexas if she could ward off the terrible weight that now came crashing down on her the commotion was so loud that haarte never even heard her scream as the wood and metallike huge spearstumbled over her sending huge clouds of dust into the air in ten seconds the settling was over haarte ran to the column and undid the rope he tossed it into a dumpster then he pulled off the latex gloves and left the construction site careful to avoid the spreading pool of blood migrating outward from the mound of debris in the center of the sidewalk the man stood at the top of the stairs turning three hundred sixty degrees around the girls loft any notes any diaries any witnesses he was wearing a jacket with a name stitched on it hank below the name he himself had stenciled dept of public works meter reading service the meter man turned back to the loft walked along the bookshelves pulled out several books and flipped through them there had to be something here shed looked like a scavenger the sort who doesnt throw anything away and fuck it looked like she hadnt he got to work looking through all the books papers all the shit stuffed animals scraps of notes diaries shit she wasnt the least bit organized this was gonna take forever his urge was to fling everything around the room rip open the suitcases cut open mattresses but he didnt he worked slowly methodically this was against his nature if youre in a hurry do it slowly somebody told him that and he always remembered it one of the guys he worked for a guy now deaddead not because he got careless but dead because they were in a business where you sometimes got dead and that was all there was to it youre in a hurry do it slowly carefully looking through the cushions boxes bookcases a box stuffed into the futon was labeled magic crystals inside were pieces of quartz magic he whispered the word as if hed never said it before as if it were japanese jesus im in outer fucking space he found a cassette labeled manhattan is my beat and picked it up set it down then footsteps shit who the hell was this giggling a womans voice not here come on no wait he reached into his pocket and wrapped his hand around his pistol a twentyish woman in a white bra and dress bunched around her waist stopped at the top of the stairs she looked at him he looked at her tits who the fuck are you she demanded pulling the cloth halfheartedly up to her chest whore you he asked the way he asked it she said sandra immediately youre her roommate rune yeah i guess he laughed you guess how long you known her not you know long he took in this information carefully noted her body language if she was dangerous innocent if shed ever killed anyone how long is you know long huh how the fuck longve you known her a couple of months is all what the hellre you doing here a man late twenties blond jockish came up the stairs he squinted then stepped up beside sandra the meter man ignored him she said like whatre you doing here he finished looking through the bookcase jesus he didnt want to have to flip through every book there mustve been five hundred of them hey the blond man called the lady asked you a question sounded like a line from a really bad movie the meter man loved movies he lived alone and spent every saturday afternoon at the quadriplex near him he squinted what was it the question whatre you doing here she asked uneasily he pointed to his chest i read meters you cant just come in here the young man said sandra tried to shush himnot concerned so much about the words themselves as the attitude but the boy waved her off you cant enter without permission its trespassing thats actionable oh actionable whats that mean that she can sue your ass oh actionable well we had reports of a leak yeah what leak sandra asked who reported it the meter man grinned at her looked at her chest again nice tits and she wasnt ugly just needed some color and to get rid of that punky makeup and why a white bra like old ladies wear he shrugged i dunno somebody downstairs complained well i dont see a leak she said so why dont you leave you havent had any water damage lately whys a meter reader interested in repairs and leaks from sandras horny companion the meter man glanced out the window it really was one fucking incredible view he looked back when theres a leak you can tell by looking at the meter that makes sense dontcha think were you looking through runes stuff naw i was looking for the meter sandra said well its not up here so why dont you leave why dont you say please the blond jock did it just like redford or steve mcqueen or stallone wouldve he stepped in front of sandra crossed his arms in his polo shirt and said the lady wants you to leave professional or not the meter man debated that side gave in the way it usually did he said if shes a lady whys she fucking an asshole like you the blond smiled shaking his head stepping forward tensing the muscles that came from the magic of nautilus machines youre outa here it turned out not to be that much fun and the meter man decided it hadnt been worth the unprofessional part oh mixing it up with a guy who knew what he was doing that wouldve been one thing going a few rounds really getting a chance to trade knuckles but this fucking yuppie christ they did a little scuffling a little pushpull saying that stuff you said in street fights why you motherfucker that sort of thing then the meter man got bored and decided he couldnt risk being there any longer and who knew who this pair had called he broke free and got blondie once in the solar plexus then once in the jaw zap that was it two silent punches the guy went to his knees more nauseated than hurt which is what gut punches do probably the first fight the guy had been in ever shit hes going to the guy puked all over the floor jesus andy sandra said thats gross meter man helped andy to his feet eased him down on the bed okay enough fun he thought time to get professional again he said to sandra heres the dealim from a collection agency your friend owes a couple thousand on her credit card and shes been dodging us for a year were tired of it that sounds like rune sure look i dont know where she is i havent heard he held up his hand you fucking tell anybody you saw me here ill do the same thing to you he nodded at the young man who lay on his back moaning his arm over his eyes sandra shook her head i wont say anything as he walked out sandra said you fight good she let the dress slip revealing her breasts again the meter man tugged the dress back up smiled said tell your boyfriend he should always keep his left up hes a defense kinda guy chapter fifteen ms rune she turned paused as she was walking through the door of washington square video rune however wasnt looking at the man whod stopped her it was the badge and the id card in the battered wallet that got her attention he was a us marshal neat she thought before she decided she ought to be nervous my names dixon he looked just like what a casting director would pick for a federal agent tall and craggy he had a faint queens accent she thought about detective virgil manelli and how hed worn a suit this guy was wearing jeans and sneakers a black baseball jacket bridgeandtunnel clothesmeaning from the outer boroughs he wouldnt get into area her favorite afterhours club wearing this kind of outfit trimmed brown hair he looked like a contractor its just rune not ms he put the badge away and she caught a glimpse of a huge gun on his hip awesome thats a schwarzenegger gun she thought man that would shoot through trucks then remembered she should be nervous again he squinted then gave a faint smile you dont remember me she shook her head let the door swing shut i saw you the other dayin the apartment on tenth street i was part of the homicide team in mr kellys apartment right she nodded thinking back to that terrible morning but she didnt remember anything except manellis closetogether eyes the shotout tv mr kellys face the blood on his chest dixon looked at a notebook put it back in his pocket he asked have you been in touch with a susan edelman recently susan oh the other witness the yuppie with the designer jogging outfit i called her yesterday the day before she was still in the hospital i see can i ask why you called her because somebodys got to find the killer and the cops couldnt care less but she told dixon just to see how shes doing why dixon paused for a moment she didnt like the way he was looking at her face assessing her he said ms edelman was killed an hour ago what she gasped no im afraid so what happened dixon continued she was walking past a construction site a scaffolding collapsed it might have been an accident but of course we dont think so oh no has anyone threatened you or have you noticed anything suspicious since the killing on tenth street no she looked down for a moment uneasy then back to the marshal dixon examined her face closely his expression gave away nothing he said for your sake for a lot of peoples sake i need you to tell me what your involvement with this whole thing is theres no thiss real serious miss it mightve seemed like a game at first but it isnt now i can have you put into protective custody and well sort it out later i really dont think youd like to spend a week in womens detention now whats the story there was something about his voice that sounded as if he was really concerned sure he was threatening her in a way but that just seemed to be his style it probably went with the job and she felt that he was really worried that she might end up like kelly or susan edelman so she told him a few things about the movie the stolen bank loot about the connection between mr kelly and the robbery nothing about symington nothing about churches or suitcases nothing about amanda leclerc dixon nodded slowly and she couldnt tell what he was thinking the only thing that seemed to interest him was the old robbery whyd he lift his eyebrow at that she wondered dixon asked where do you live she gave him the address phone number no phone you can call here the video store leave a message dixon thought for a moment i dont think youre in danger i didnt see anything i really didnt just this green car thats all i remember no faces no license plates theres no reason to kill me this seemed to amuse him well thats not really the issue miss the reason youre not dead is that somebody doesnt want you dead not yet if they did youd be gone if i were you though id forget about this bank robbery money maybe thats what was behind mr kellys shooting youre probably safe for now but if you keep poking around who knows what could happen i was just suddenly his face softened and he smiled youre a pretty woman youre smart youre tough i can see that i just wouldnt want anything to happen to you rune said thanks ill keep that in mind though she was really only thinking two things that dixon wasnt wearing a wedding ring and that he was a hell of a lot cuter than shed thought at first what was that all about did that guy have a badge stephanie sounded breathless rune walked behind the counter at washington square video joining stephanie at the register she answered he was a us marshal then she shook her head the other witnessto mr kellys murder she was killed no it mightve been an accident maybe not rune stared at the monitor there was no movie in the vcr and she was looking at silent snow probably not she whispered are you uhm safe stephanie asked he thinks so thinks but theres one thing funny what he was a us marshal you said that why would he be involved in a murder of somebody in the east village what do you mean rune was thinking i saw this movie on dillinger you know john dillinger not personally ha he robbed banks which is like a federal offenseso it wasnt the city cops who were after him it was the gmen gmen federal agents you know government men like the fbi like us marshals oh wait youre not thinking hes investigating that bank robbery you were telling me about the one fifty years ago rune shrugged he didnt say anything but its kind of a coincidence dont you think he seemed real interested when i said something to him about it stephanie turned back to variety little farfetched but whats farfetched in the whole scheme of thingsas richard might have asked rune found the brooklyn yellow pages she opened it to churches seemed funny you could find escort services rotorooter companies and churches in the same directory she flipped through the pages man there were a lot of pages she started to make calls a half hour later stephanie asked rune you think ill get the part what part rune asked absently phone tucked between her ear and her shoulder she was on hold it also seemed weird to call a church and be put on hold didnt i tell you im auditioning next week its only a commercial but still they pay great ive got to get it its totally important rune stiffened suddenly as the minister came on the line hello reverend father sir im trying to find some information about my grandfather robert kelly about seventy do you know if he spent any time at your parish robert kelly no miss i sure dont okay father thank you oh and have a nice day she set the receiver in the cradle pushed aside the yellow pages and asked stephanie do you say that to priests what have a nice day i mean shouldnt you say something more meaningful more spiritual say whatever you want stephanie put variety away began reshelving cassettes in the stacks she said if i dont get the job ill just die its a whole commercial thirty seconds id play a young wife with pms and i cant enjoy my anniversary dinner until i take some pills what pills i dont know crampaway what well something like that then i take them and my husband and i waltz off happily i get to wear a long white dress thats so disgusting when they do that wear white in menstrual commercials im also worried cause i cant waltz dancing isnt exactly my strong suit and i cantjust between you and mei cant sing too good either its a real pain in the ass getting jobs when you cant sing and dance youve got a great body and great hair and youre tall goddammit flipping through more pages ignoring the synagogues and mosques amandas calling too i feel sorry for her poor woman imagineher friends killed and theyre kicking her out of the country by the way i dont think theyre all parishes stephanie said you think i was pissing them off by calling them parishes rune was frowning i think they get pissed when you worship satan and cast spells i dont think they care what you call their churches im just telling you for your own you know edification rune picked up the phone and then put it down again she glanced at the door as a thin young woman darkcomplected entered the woman had a proper pageboy cut and was wearing a navyblue suit carrying a heavy law or accountingfirm briefcase in one hand rune swiftly sized her up whispered to stephanie a dollar says its richard gere stephanie waited until the woman moved to the comedy section and pulled the sting off the shelf before reaching into her pocket and slipping four quarters onto the countertop rune put a dollar bill next to them stephanie murmured think youre getting to be hot shit huh you can spot em i can spot em rune said the woman wandered around the aisles not sensing rune and stephanie watching her while they pretended to work she came up to the counter and set the newmanredford movie on the rubber change mat beside the cash register ill take that she handed rune her membership card stephanie smiling reached for the money the woman hesitated and then said oh maybe ill get another one too stepping away to the drama section she set power next to the sting richard geres bedroom eyes gazed out from the cover stephanie pushed the two dollars toward rune and rang up the rental the woman snagged the cassettes and left the store howd you know stephanie asked rune look she typed in the womans membership number into the computer and called up a history of all the movies shed rented thats cheating dont bet if you dont know the odds i dont know rune stephanie said you think mr kelly was into hidden treasure or something but look heres this woman rents richard gere films ten times in six months thats just as weird as kelly rune shook her head naw you know why she does that shes having an affair with him you know the way it is now sex is dangerous you have to take matters into your own hands so to speak makes sense to me funny you seem like more of a risktakertracking down hidden treasure and murderers but you wont go to bed with a guy ill sleep with somebody i just want to make sure its the right somebody right stephanie snorted you do like your impossible quests dont you rune slipped the bootleg manhattan is my beat into the vcr a few minutes later she mused wasnt she beautiful on the screen ruby dahl with the bobbed blond hair was walking hand in hand with dana mitchell playing her fiance roy the cop the brooklyn bridge loomed in the background it was before the robbery roy had been called in by his captain and told what a good job he was doing but the young patrolman was worrying because he was broke he had to support his sick mother he didnt know when he and rubyd be able to get married maybe hed leave the forcego to work for a steel company but youre so good at what you do roy darling i would think theyd want you to be commissioner why if i were in charge thats what id make you handsome dana mitchell walked beside her solemnly he told her she was a swell gal he told her what a lucky stiff he was the camera backed away from them and the two people became insignificant dots in a shadowy blackandwhite city rune glanced down at the countertop ohmygod what stephanie asked alarmed its a phone message so wheres frankie dammit im going to kick his butt what he took the message but he just left it here under these receipts she held it up look look its from richard i havent heard from him since yesterday he dropped me off on the west side rune grimaced kissed me on the cheek goodbye ouch a cheekkiss only yeah and after hed seen me topless stephanie shook her head thats not good tell me about it the message read runerichard asked you over for dinner tomorrow at seven hes cooking he has a surprise for you and he also said why the hell dont you get a phone ha ha but he was kidding yes i thought hed given up on me after we went to the nursing home on sunday nursing home rune you gotta pick more romantic places for dates oh im going to ive got this totally excellent junkyard i go to no no no its really neat she fluffed her hair out again what should i wear i have this polkadot tank top i just got at secondhand rose and this tigerskin skirt thats about eight inches wide what tiger skin oh like its not real if youre into rain forests and stuff like that i mean it was made in new jersey rune the problem isnt endangered species well what is the problem stephanie was examining her closely are those glowinthedark earrings i got them last halloween she said defensively touching the skulls why are you looking at me that way you like fairy stories right sure you remember cinderella oh its the best did you know in the real story the brothers grimm story the mother cut the ugly sisters heels off with a knife so their feet would fit into the rune stephanie said it patiently what lets think about the disney version for a minute rune looked at her cautiously okay you remember it yeah stephanie walked around rune slowly examining her you understand what im getting at oh a makeover stephanie smiled dont take it personal but i think you need a fairy godmother chapter sixteen rune wanted slinky stephanie reluctantly indulged her but the expedition to stores that specialized in svelte was a failure rune spent a half hour in tiny hot changing rooms trying on long black dresses and playing with her hair trying to look like audrey hepburn trying to look slinky but then the word frumpy crept into her mind and even though she could strip and look at her flat stomach and thin legs and pretty face once she thought frump that killed it no long dresses today you win she muttered to stephanie thank you was the abrupt reply now lets get to work they walked south out of the village richard likes long and slinky rune explained of course he does stephanie replied hes a man he probably likes red and black bustiers and garters too but she went on to explain patiently that a woman should never buy clothes for a man she should buy clothes for herself which will in turn make the man respect and desire her more you think i know radical rune said stephanie rolled her eyes and said well go for european richards very frenchlooking id like to get him to change his name to what it was francois now im leaning toward jeanpaul what does he think about that havent told him im going to wait a few weeks wise soho the former warehouse and manufacturing district adjoining greenwich village was just becoming chic the area used to be a bastion of artistsinresidence working painters and sculptors who were the only people who could legally live in the neighborhood under the city zoning code but while the city granted permits only to certified artists it did nothing about controlling the cost of the huge lofts and as the galleries and wine bars and boutiques moved into the commercial buildings the residential prices skyrocketed into the hundreds of thousands it was funny how many lawyers and bankers suddenly found they had talent to paint and sculpt they passed one clothing store painted stark white inside rune stopped abruptly and gazed at a black silk blouse love it so do i stephanie agreed can we get it no whv not whats wrong with it see that tag thats not the order number thats the price four hundred and fifty dollars come on follow me i know a little spanish place up the street they turned off west broadway onto spring and walked into a store that rune loved immediately because a large white bird sitting on a perch by the door said hello sucker to them when they entered rune looked around she said im game but its not funky its not new wave its not supposed to be after twenty minutes of careful assembly stephanie examined rune with approval and only then allowed her to look in a mirror awesome rune whispered youre a magician the maroon skirt was long though it was more billowy than slinky on top she wore a lowcut black tshirt and over that a lacy seethrough blouse stephanie picked out some dangly earrings in orange plastic its not the old me but its definitely a sort of me i think youre evolving stephanie told her as the clerk wrapped up the clothes rune said you know the story of the little red hen was it on sesame street i dont think so she was the one who was baking bread and nobody helped her except this one animal i forget what it was duck rabbit who knows anyway when the bread was done all the other animals came to the hen and said they wanted some but she said haul ass creeps and she only shared it with the one that helped her well when i find the bank money im going to share it with you me you believe me richard doesnt the police dont stephanie didnt say anything they stepped outside and returned to west broadway you dont have to do that rune she said finally but i want to maybe you can quit the stupid video store and audition fulltime really no the hungarian accent was back dont argue with peasant woman very pigheaded oh wait rune glanced at a store across the street richard said hes got a surprise for me i want to get him something they ran across broadway dodging traffic rune stopped caught her breath looked in the window what do men like she asked stephanie said themselves and they walked inside the store seemed futuristic but it may actually have been antique rune reasoned since it reminded her of how her mother described the sixtiesgaudy and filled with weird glowing lights and spaceships and planets and a confusion of incense smells musk patchouli rose sandalwood rune looked at a blacklit poster of a ship sailing in the sky and said highly retro stephanie looked around bored in the display cases geodes crystals stones opals silver and gold magic wands of quartz wrapped with silver wire headdresses meteorites nasa memorabilia electronic music tapes optical illusions colored lights broken apart by spinning prisms crawled up and down the walls its going to make me epileptic stephanie groused this is the most radical store ever dont you think isnt it fantastic rune picked up two dinosaurs and made them dance the jewelrys nice stephanie was leaning over a counter what do you think hed like this stuff is too expensive a ripoff rune spun a kaleidoscope hes not really into toys i dont think the clerk a thin black man with a round handsome face framed by rastafarian dreadlocks said to rune in a deep musical voice what you see in there nirvana look she handed the heavy tube to him he played along peering inside ah nirvana there she is special today on kaleidoscopes that show you enlightenment half price rune shook her head doesnt seem right you should pay for enlightenment this is new york he said whatchu want stephanie said im hungry then rune saw the bracelets in a huge glass pyramid a dozen silver bracelets she walked to the end of the counter staring at them her mouth slightly open exhaling an oh you like them do you the clerk asked can i see that one there rune took the thin bracelet held it up to her face turned it over and over the silver grew thicker and thinner and the ends were like two hands clasped together the rastafarian grinned she look nice she look nice on your arm but she stephanie asked the clerk was studying runes face mebbe you thinkin bout givin her away to someone mebbe you thinkin that he held the bracelet in his long sensuous fingers studied it carefully rune thought of richards hands slowly opening a beer can the clerk looked up to some man friend of yours rune didnt pay attention to his words how did you know that stephanie asked him he grinned silent then said hes a nice man i think stephanie looked at him uneasily how did you know and rune who wasnt surprised at all by the clerks words said ill take it its too expensive the rastafarian frowned hey i offer you satori i offer you love and you say that be too expensive bargain with him stephanie commanded rune said wrap it for a present the rastafarian hesitated you sure sure im sure why oh jus this bracelet she be important in your life i got this feelin be very important he fingered the metal hoop dont be too fast to give her away no no dont be too fast to do that can we eat now stephanie asked im hungry as they walked to the door the clerk called to rune you hear me rune turned looked into his eyes i hear you ill go in sir rune handed stephanie a hot dog shed bought from the vendor in front of trinity church downtown near wall street she continued speaking til go in sir is what roy the copdana mitchellsays to his captain theyre all standing around the front of the bank with their bullhorns and guns til go in sir and its a big surprise because hes just a beat cop and a young guy nobodyd been paying any attention to him but hes the one who volunteers to rescue the hostage rune took her own hot dog from the man they sat down beside the wroughtiron fence in front of the cemetery thousands of people were walking past on broadway some disappearing down wall street into the curving solemn griminess of the buildings stephanie ate thoughtfully looking at the hot dog uncertainly after each bite then roy goes let me try it sir i can talk him out i know i can uhhuh stephanie was gazing straight ahead the hordes of passing crowds were mesmerizing so the lieutenant goes all right officer if you want to go i wont stop you rune threw out her halfeaten hot dog stood up but its dangerous she sounded as melodramatic as the character in the film itself that was another cop a friend of his said that and danaremember that dreamy kind of look he haddana says tm not letting anyone get killed on my beat his jaw was all firm and he pulled his hat straight and handed his nightstick to his friend then walked across the street and climbed in the side window rune started pacing come on lets go i want to see the real bank stephanie glanced at the last inch of hot dog then pitched it into a garbage can she wiped her hands and mouth with a thin napkin they descended into wall street a white luminescence shone through the milky clouds but the street with its narrow packed rows of dark office buildings was gloomy rune said they shot the movie at the old union bank building itselfthats were the actual robbery took place the bank went bust years ago and the building was sold its been a bunch of things since then last year some company bought it and made a restaurant out of the ground floor stephanie said can we get some coffee there i need some coffee rune was excited walking ahead of her then slowing and falling back into step isnt this too much walking the same streets the actors did forty years ago maybe dana mitchell stopped right here and put his foot up on that fire hydrant to tie his shoe maybe oh look rune gripped her arm there the corner thats where the robber fired a shot as the cops were closing in after the alarm went off its a great scene she ran toward the corner dodged past a young woman in a pink suit and pressed back against the marble as if she were under fire stephanie get down get under cover youre crazy stephanie said walking slowly to the wall rune reached forward you want to get shot get down she pulled stephanie laughing into a crouch several passersby had heard her they looked around cautious stephanie pretending she didnt know rune whispered youre out of your mind looking at the crowd speaking louder shes out of her mind runes eyes were bright can you imagine it the banks around the corner and listen a jackhammer sounded in the distance a machine gun the robbers got a machine gun an old tommy gun hes blasting away at us okay its right around the corner and hes got a hostage and a million dollars ive got to save him stephanie laughed and tugged at runes arm playing along now no no dont go its too dangerous rune adjusted an invisible hat eased her shoulders back nobody gets killed on my beat and turned the corner just in time to see a bulldozer shovel what had been one of the floors of the union bank building into a huge dumpster no rune stopped in the middle of the congested sidewalk several businesspeople bumped into her before she stepped back oh no her hand went to her mouth the demolition company had taken down most of the building already only part of one wall remained the stubby dozer was shoveling up masses of shattered stone and wood and metal rune said how could they do it what they tore it down its gone rune stepped away from stephanie her eyes on the men who worked the clanking jackhammers they stood on the edge of the remaining wall forty feet up and dug apart the masonry at their feet she glanced up the street then walked slowly across it to the plywood barricade that shut out pedestrians from the demolition site she couldnt look through the peepholes cut by the workers they were at a sixfooters level so she walked into the site itself through the open chainlink gate a huge ramp of earth led down to the foundation where the truck holding the dumpster idled there was a resounding crash as the tons of rubble dropped into the steel vessel stephanie caught up with her hey i dont think were supposed to be here i feel weird rune told her why they just destroyed the whole place and it was so familiar i knew it so well from the movie and now its gone how could they do it below them a second bulldozer lifted a huge steelmesh blanket and set it on top of a piece of exposed rock there was a painful hoot of a steam whistle above their heads the bulldozer backed away then two whistles a minute later the explosives were detonated a jarring slam under their feet smoke the metal blanket shifted a few feet three whistle blaststhe allclearsounded rune blinked tears formed its not the way it should be she stooped and picked up a bit of broken marble from the banks facadepinkish and gray the colors of a trout smooth on one side she looked at it for a long time then put it in her pocket its not the way it should be at all she repeated lets go stephanie urged the bulldozer lifted the mesh away and began to dig out mouthfuls of the shattered rock chapter seventeen shed wrapped it up the bracelet but then walking up to third avenuepast the discount clothing stores the hallmark shop the delis shed decided the wrapping paper was too feminine it had a viney pattern that wasnt anything sissier than youd see in the old arabian nights illustrations but richard might think they were flowers so halfway to his apartment she slipped her hand with its newly polished nailspink not green or blue for a changeinto her bag and tore off the paper and ribbon then waiting for the light on twentythird street rune started to worry about the box giving him something in a box something supposed to be what was the word spontaneous seemed too formal men got scared you gave them something that was too premeditated goddamn men the nails went to work again and opened the box which joined the crumpled arabian paper in the bottom of the leopardskin purse she held the bracelet up in the light wait was it too feminine did it matter he was a philosopher knight remember not the kind killing peasants with a broadsword anyway there definitely was something androgynous about himlike hermaphroditus and now that she thought about it rune decided that was one of the reasons they were so compatible the malefemale yinyang was in flux for both of them she put the bracelet in her pocket see what it is i was buying one for meremember i told you i love bracelets so what i did was i saw this one and it looked too masculine for me and i thought well it just occurred to me you might rune stopped for the light she was in front of an indian store sitar music and the smell of incense flooded out into the street the light changed see i got this special deal at a jewelry store i go to two for one yeah no shit amazing and i thought who do know whod like a bracelet and guess what you won crossing the street then she saw his apartment building a block ahead she tried to be objective but was still disappointed it was a boxish highrise squatting in a nest of boxish highrises a little bit of suburbia in manhattan she couldnt picture her blackclad knight living among tiny widows and salesmen and nurses and med students from nyu oh well she continued along the sidewalk and stopped outside his building hey richard would you like a bracelet if not no big deal i could give it to my mother sister roommate but if youd like it its a pretty radical design dontcha thinktake a look at it rune stepped away from the building and looked at her reflection in the window oh a bracelet rune its fantastic put it on me ill never take it off she polished the silver on her sleeve then dropped it into her pocket again oh a bracelet well the thing is i never wear them well the thing is my girlfriend gave me a bracelet just like this the day she killed herself well the thing is im allergic to silver goddamn men seeing him with that dark hair and the long french face that crazy electricity hit her again she knew her voice was going to shake and she thought goddammit get this under control whats best flirty surprised seductive she opted for a neutral hi she stood in his doorway neither of them moved he gave her one of those scary werejustfriends looks he almost seemed surprised to see her rune hey how you doing great good you hey how you doing okay he nodded and she saw he was definitely uncomfortable though he kept the smile on his face there were major explosions in her wanting to vaporize away wanting to ease her arms around him and never leave mostly she wondered what the hell was wrong silence as an elderly lady with a jutting sour mouth walked her cairn terrier past glancing disdainfully at them richard said so hows the video business he looked her up and down didnt say a word about the new outfit glanced at the earrings didnt say anything about them either good okay well why dont you come on in she followed him inside wait she thought looking him over whats going on he was wearing a babyblue buttondown shirt tan chino slacks and topsiders ohmygod topsiders nothing black nothing chic he looked like a yuppie from the upper east side then she glanced around his apartment she couldnt figure itthat somebody who wore black leather and tapped the tops of his beer cans with such elegant fingers could live in a place with white conran furniture rock and roll posters on the wall and a metal sea gull statue a copper sea gull just let me check on something he disappeared into the kitchen whatever he was cooking smelled great none of her girlfriends could get that kind of smell out of a kitchen lord knew she never had she was examining his bookshelves mostly technical books about things she didnt understand college paperbacks stacks of the new york times and the atlantic monthly he came back into the room stood with his arms crossed so skittish now uhhuh so she couldnt think of anything to say for a moment then she blurted out i thought maybe after dinner you might want to go for a ride i found a great place its in queens a junkyard i know the owner he lets me in its really radical like a huge dinosaur graveyard you can sit up on some of the wrecksits not gross dirty you know like garbageand watch the sunset over the city its really wild its your mega junkyard okay richard come on tell me what i did to fuck up tonight the thing is hi came the womans voice from the door rune turned to see a tall woman with long blond hair walk through the open door the woman was wearing a gray pinstriped suit and black pumps she gave rune a friendly glance then walked up to richard and hugged him rune this is karen uhm hi rune said then to richard your message about dinner karen lifted a perfect eyebrow knowingly took a bottle of wine out of a paper bag and disappeared tactfully into the kitchen actually richard said delicately that was supposed to be thursday wait the message said tomorrow and the date on it was yesterday he shrugged i told the guy i talked tofrankie somebodyi told him thursday she nodded and he thought today was thursday goddamn heavy metal its destroyed his brain cells shit shit shit yo fairy godmother yo wave your magic wand and get me the hell out of here listen you want to stay have some wine thatd be a pretty picture she thought the three of us sipping wine while hes waiting for me to leave so he can put the tantra moves on tootall karen no think ill go sure ill walk you to the elevator oh dont argue too hard now richard continued oh wait let me get you what i have for you my surprise right i think youll like it so rune how do you know richard karen was calling from the kitchen yeah he picked me up the other night ands been trying to fuck me ever since met in a video store we talk about movies some i love movies karen called maybe we could all go sometime maybe richard appeared from his bedroom he was carrying a white envelope thats my present be right back he said to karen this sauce is so good she called from the kitchen she stuck her pert head into the doorway nice meeting you oh love the earrings as they walked to the elevator richard said karens a friend we work together rune wondered how does somebody work with you when you write novels they got four doors down the corridor before he said thiss a little awkward but she and i really are just friends we are going out arent we you and me i mean sure were going out i mean we arent going out all the time though right we can have other friends sure thats the way it has to work right i am absolutely going to murder frankie greek he pushed the down button arent we in a hurry oh here he thrust the envelope at her she opened it inside was an application to the new school over on fifth avenue a joke it had to be a joke ive got a buddy works for admissions richard explained he told me theyre starting this new program retail management you dont even need to get a degree you get a certificate she felt sick wait youre giving me career counseling rune youre so smart youve got so much energy youre so creative im worried about you wasting your life she stared numb at the paper in her hand richard said you could work your way up in the video store business become a manager then maybe you could buy a store or even a chain you could really be on a hell of a vertical track she laughed bitterly but thats not me richard im not a verticaltrack kind of person look ive worked in that diner i told you about in a bike repair shop a deli a shoe store ive sold jewelry on the street done pasteups and mechanicals for a magazine sold mens colognes at macys and worked in a film lab and thats just in the couple years ive been here before i die im going to do a lot more than that im not going to devote my life to being manager of a video store or any other one thing dont you want a career she felt utterly betrayed more so than if shed found karen and richard in bed an event that was probably only minutes away when she didnt answer he said you should think about it rune said sometimes i get this idea i should go to school get a degree law school maybe business school like my sister something but then you know what happens i have this image of myself in ten years at a cocktail party and somebody asks me what i do andthis is the scary parti have an answer for them she smiled at him which is he didnt get it thats the point it doesnt matter the scary part is that i have an answer i say im a lawyer an accountant a hooseywhatsis maker bang there i am denned in one or two words that scares the hell out of me whyre you so afraid of reality my life is real its just not apparently your kind of reality he said harshly no its not real look at this game of yours what game findthehiddentreasure whats wrong with that do you understand that a man was killed did it ever occur to you that it wasnt a game to robert kelly that you could get hurt or a friend of yours could get hurt that ever occur to you itll work out you just need to believe she gasped as he took her angrily by the shoulders and led her to a window at the end of the hallway pointed outside beneath them was a mass of highways and rail sidings and rusting equipmenthuge turbines and metal parts beyond that was a small factory surrounded by standing yellowish water mud filth whats that he asked she shook her head not understanding what is it his voice rose what do you mean her voice crackled its a factory rune theres shit and pollution it makes a living for people and they pay taxes and give money to charity and buy sneakers for their children who grow up to be lawyers or teachers or musicians or people who work in other factories its nothing more than that its not a spaceship its not a castle its not an entrance to the underworld its a factory she was completely still i like you a lot rune but going with you is like living in some movie she wiped her nose the cars below whined past whats wrong with movies i love movies nothing as long as you remember they arent real youre going to find out im not a knight and that okay maybe there was some bank robbery moneywhich i think is the craziest frigging thing ive ever heardbut that its spent or stolen or lost somewhere years ago and youll never find it and here you are pissing your life away in a video store jumping from fantasy to fantasy waiting for something you dont even know what it is if thats your reality you can keep it she snapped wiping her nose fairy stories arent going to get you by in life i told you they dont all have happy endings but even if they dont rune you close the book you put it on your shelf and you go on with your life they arent real and if you live your life like youre in one youre going to get hurt or somebody around yous going to get hurt so whyre you the expert on reality you write novels he sighed looked away from her i dont write novels i was trying to impress you i dont even read novels i write audiovisual scripts for companies hello im john jones your ceo welcome to salesfest its not weird its not fun but it pays the bills but you youre just like me the clubs the dancing the magic we like the same things its an act rune just like it is for everybody who lives that way except for you nobody can sustain your kind of weirdness when youre frivolous when youre irresponsible you miss trains and buses and dinner dates you but she interrupted therell always be a next train she wiped her eyes and saw the mascara had run shit she must look pathetic she said softly you lied to me the elevator arrived she pulled away from him and stepped into the car rune they stood three feet away she inside he out it seemed to take forever before the doors started to close as they slowly did she thought that diarmuid or any knight wouldnt let her get away like this hed push in after her shove the doors aside hold her tell her they could work out these differences but richard just turned and walked down the corridor therell always be another train she whispered as the doors closed your stepsisters keep you in tatters like this no no no dear that will never do how can you be the fairest one at the ball in these rags now let me see what i can do yes oh my that should be just right and closing her eyes she waved her magic wand three times there appeared as if from thin air a gown of silk and lace stitched with golden and silver thread and for her feet rune recited this from memory as she walked along university place she paused crumpled up the new school application and threepointed it into a trash basket she glanced at herself in a mirror hanging in a wig shop the lipstick was fine and the blusher on the cheekbones was fun to do and easy thank you stephanie the eyes had been okayat least before the tearsd turned her into a raccoon rune took another sip of millerfrom her third canwrapped in a paper bag shed bought a sixpack at a deli up the street but had somehow managed to drop three cans within the past two blocks a couple holding hands walked past rune couldnt help staring at them they didnt notice they were in love oh dear cinderellas fairy godmother said coachmen whats the good of turning a pumpkin into a coach if you have no coachmen to drive you ahha mice rune turned back to the mirror teased her hair with her fingers and stepped back to look at the results she thought i dont look like cinderella at all i look like a short whore her shoulders sagged and she dug into her bag found a kleenex and scrubbed the rest of the makeup off her face combed her hair back into place she pulled off the orange earrings which karen the girls basketball champ had loved so much and dropped them into her purse what was wrong why was it so hard to get men interested in her she considered everything im not tall and blond true im not beautiful but im not dogugly either maybe she was a lesbian rune considered this it seemed possible and it explained a lot like why she got hit on by men but never proposed tothey could sense her orientation probably not that she wanted to get married necessarilybut she did want the chance to say lemme think about it no she just wasnt the sort men went for that was probably all part of it maybe the way the gods made you the way you were they might make you short and cute a little like audrey hepburn but not enough to make menreal men chivalrous men gary grant men knights errantfall for you the gods are just letting you down easy saying if theyd meant you to have somebody like richard theyd have made you four inches taller and a thirtysix c or b at least and given you blond hair but being gay this was something to think about could she deal with it itd be hard to own up to but maybe shed have to admit it some things you cant run from admitting it she felt relief flood through her it explained why she was reluctant to sleep with a man right awayshe probably didnt really like sex with men and if richard turned her on like an electric current it was probably just because of what shed realized beforethat there was something feminine about him sure that made sense telling mother would be hard maybe she should get a crew cut maybe she should become a nun maybe she should kill herself at the corner of eighth street rather than turn toward the subway to get a train to the loft she turned the other way to return to the video store she knew what she wanted to do get a movie maybe it happened one night as long as im going to cry anyway why not get a movie to go along with it ice cream beer and a movie cant lose with that combination how about gone with the wind how about lesbos lovers ten minutes later she pushed inside washington square video frankie greek was behind the counter and he was looking totally sheepish well he damn well ought to fucking up when he took that message from richard she was going to give him hell but as she looked at him playing nervously with the vcr remote it seemed there was something else on his mind he was nervous but it wasnt because of her hello rune what is it frankie your sister okay yes shes fine he recited she had a baby i know you told us whats the matter how are you tonight doing okay i hope doing good a wannabe rock musician talking like mister rogers something was really wrong here whats with you nothing rune i heard it was kind of cold out there tonight it was like he was in a bad skit on saturday night live cold what the hell are you rune a mans deep voice asked she turned oh it was that us marshal dixon she remembered hi he said hey marshal dixon he laughed you make it sound like a sheriff in a bad western call me phillip she looked at frankie paler than mick jagger in february i saw his badge frankie said he arrests people who screw up phone messages rune muttered huh never mind how you doing dixon asked smiling then he frowned looked at her face theres a little he pointed at her cheek she grabbed a paper towel and scrubbed away at a bit of eye makeup thats got it dixon said hey love the outfit really his eyes swept over itand sure enough she felt a bit of that electric sizzle again not as highvoltage as with richard but still i never do drugs frankie greek said dixon looked at him curiously some musicians do i mean you hear about it but i never have some of my songs are about drugs but thats like just something to write songs about i stay away from them well good for you rune gave him an exasperated look then said to the marshal anything more on the case naw then he seemed to think he shouldnt be talking quite so bluecollar and added no no evidence in the edelman death he shrugged no prints at the scene no witnesses you havent seen anything odd lately been followed no dixon nodded looked at some videos picked one up put it down so he said two sos from two different men in one night rune wondered what this one meant could i talk to you he asked motioning her to the front of the store sure they stood by the window next to a distracting cardboard cutout of michael j fox just thought youd like to know i checked out that case you told me about the union bank heist you did he shook his head i didnt find anything technically its still open but nobodys been on the case since the fifties they only keep murder cases open indefinitely i tried to find the file but it looks like it was pitched out ten twenty years ago i thought maybe you were investigating it the robbery me dixon laughed again he had a nice smile richard she was thinking had that mysteriousness about him something going on under the surfaceyou couldnt quite believe his smile dixons seemed totally genuine he took off his baseball cap rubbed his hair in a boyish way put the hat back on she said i mean it was kind of a coincidence you were asking about mr kelly and everything bank robberyd be the fbi not the marshals im involved only cause the killer used the kind of bullets a lot of hit men use we check stuff like that out teflon rune said oh you know about that the police told me but if you dont care about the robbery then whyd you look up the case he shrugged looked away i dunno seemed important to you a little tingle nothing as highvoltage as with richard but it was something besides richard who she thought she was in love with had just been giving her crap about her life while this guy almost a stranger had gone to the trouble to help her with her quest little red hen she gave him a coy look a scarlett ohara look thats the only reason you came all the way down here to tell me about a fiftyyearold case he shrugged avoided her eyes i stopped by your place and you werent there and i called here and they said sometimes you just hang out and talk about movies with people he said this as if hed practiced it like a shy boy rehearsing his lines to ask a girl out on a date embarrassed he crossed his arms so you took the chance id be here right after a moment he said and ill bet you want to know why yeah she said i do well he swallowed how could somebody with such a big gun be so nervous he continued i guess i wanted to ask you out i mean if you dont want to forget it but rune frankie called phone wait right there rune told dixon then added emphatically dont go away sure sure i wont go anywhere she picked up the phone it was amanda leclerc rune i thought you want to know the woman said quickly her accent more pronounced because of her excitement victor symingtons daughter she over here i mean right now you want to see her rune glanced at dixon who was looking at video boxes he glanced at the xrated section blushed and looked away quickly rune debating furiouswhat should she do a man who wanted to ask her out versus the quest this was totally unfair rune amanda said i dont think she going to stay too long eyes on dixon eyes on the brooklyn yellow pages oh shit into the phone she blurted out ill be right over chapter eighteen you had the baby rune looked up from the building directory so thick with graffiti she couldnt find the number of amanda leclercs apartment her surprised eyes rested on the surprised face of the young man whod let her into the apartment building two days beforewhen shed been extremely pregnant now she let him open the door for her again and she walked inside i did thanks rune said courtney madonna brittany six pounds four ounces congratulations he said he couldnt help but stare down at her belly you uh feeling okay feeling great rune assured him i just ran out for a minute and forgot my keys wheres your little girl he asked when you lie lie with confidence shes upstairs watching tv watching tv well shes with her father and hes watching tv they both like sitcoms say which apartment is amanda leclerc in again oh amanda on the second floor yeah i think f right right right rune started up the stairs two at a time dont you think you should take it a little easy peasant stock she called back cheerily on the secondfloor landing she noticed that there was a piece of plywood over the hole in mr kellys door there was also a large padlock on it the police tape had been replaced she walked past it itd been hard to turn down phillip dixon he unlike richard was somebody who had no problem with either the word or the concept of date rain check hed asked you bet hey you like junkyards shed asked him on her way out the door of the video store he hadnt missed a beat love em rune now knocked on amandas door and the woman called whos there me rune the door opened good shes upstairs i talk her inta staying to see you didnt want to but she is has she heard anything from her father i dont know i didnt ask her i just said you were looking for him and it was important what apartment is he in again three b rune remembered that symington lived directly above mr kelly rune climbed the stairs amandas and mr kellys floor had smelled like onions this one smelled like bacon she paused in the hallway the door to b was six inches open rune eased forward seeing first the hem of a skirt then two thin legs in dark stockings they were crossed in a way that suggested confidence rune started to knock but then just pushed the door open all the way the woman on the bed turned to her she was looking through a stack of papers she had high cheekbones a face glossy with makeup frosted hair forced into place with a ton of spray she looks like my mother rune thought and guessed she was in her early forties the woman wore a plaid suit and she smoked a long dark brown cigarette she gazed at rune then said that woman downstairs she said somebody was looking for my father is that you yes the woman turned away slowly stubbed out the cigarette pressing it into an ashtray it died with a faint crushing sound she looked rune up and down my theyre getting younger and younger like excuse me how old are you twenty whats that got to do with anything i just want to ask you a few what did he promise you a car he did that a lot he was always giving away cars or saying he would porsches mercedes cadillacs of course then thered be problems with the dealer or the registration or something cars i dont even and then it came down to money but thats life isnt it hed promise a thousand and end up giving them a couple of hundred what are you talking about rune asked another examination the woman got as far as runes striped stockings and clunky red shoes before her face revealed her dismay she shook her head you couldnt forgive me but you couldntve charged all that much what was your price for the night you think im a hooker my father called them girlfriends he actually brought one to thanksgiving dinner once at my house in westchester lynda with a y you can imagine that scene with my husband and children i dont even know your father the woman frowned wondering if rune might be telling the truth maybe theres some misunderstanding here ill say there is youre not no rune said im not a faint laugh im sorry the woman extended her hand my names emily richter im rune she reluctantly shook it first name and last actress sometimes so rune you really dont know my father no and youre not here for any money not exactly she thought she shook her head emily continued what do you want to see me about do you know where he is thats what im trying to find out he just vanished i know he did emily examined runes face carefully the woman had probing eyes and rune looked away emily said and i have a feeling you know why maybe which is i think he witnessed a murder that man who was killed in the building emily asked i heard about that it was downstairs wasnt it right and you think father saw it happen rune walked farther into the apartment she sat down on a cheap dining room chair she glanced around the place it was very different from mr kellys she couldnt figure out why at first then she realized this was like a hotel room furnished by one phone call to a store that sold everything pictures furniture carpet a lot of light wood and metallic colors and laminate coordinated suburban tack what did it remind her of ohmygod richards place emily lit another cigarette rune glanced into the kitchen she saw enough food to last through a siege like her mothers pantry she thought with its provisions of flour yellowing boxes of raisins and oatmeal and cornstarch the colored cans green del monte red campbells only here the difference was that everything was new just like the furniture emilys voice was softer as she said i didnt mean to suggest anything what i said before ever since our mother died fathers been well a little unstable hes had a series of young friends at least he waited until she died to turn adolescent again she shook her head but a murder so maybe hes in danger the cigarette paused halfway to her mouth then lowered rune told her i guess hes okay i mean i dont know that he isnt he sure didnt hang around for very long after the man downstairs was killed what happened rune told her about robert kellys death why do you think my father saw it happen what it was i came back here to pick up something after mr kelly was killed and i was in the apartment downstairs how did you know him this mr kelly he was a customer at the store where i work we were sorta friends anyway i saw your father and he saw me in the apartment he was terrified that was weirdme scaring anybody she laughed but the way i figure it the day mr kelly was killed your father was hanging out on his fire escape he saw the killer come out of the apartment after he killed mr kelly i think your father got a look at the killer emily shook her head but why would he run just seeing you i dont know maybe he couldnt see me too clearly and thought i was the killer whod come back to destroy some evidence or something emily was looking down at the fake oriental carpet but the police havent called meshe nodded again which must mean you havent told them about him no why not runes eyes drifted away the thing is i dont like police emily watched her carefully for a moment more then said probingly but thats not exactly the thing is it theres something else rune looked away trying to be cool and poised it wasnt taking well all i know is that im worried about my father emily said he can be exasperating at times but i still love him i want to find him and it sounds like you do too why wont you tell me then from somewhere rune managed to find an adult gaze she slapped it on her face and gave emily a womantowoman smile i have this feeling youre not telling me everything either the woman hesitated she inhaled and blew a fat stream of smoke away from them maybe im not ill show you mine if you emily didnt want to smile but she did okay the truth she looked around the apartment ive never been here before this is the first time i havent been in any of his apartments for the past year isnt that an awful thing to say rune said nothing emily sighed she was looking much less adult than she had we had a fight last summer a bad one there was silence then she smiled at rune a bleak lifting of her mouth trying to make light the smile faded he ran away from home isnt that silly your father ran away from home like thats radical emily asked are your parents still alive my mother is shes in ohio my father died a few years ago did you get along with them when you were at home pretty good i guess my mom is a sweetheart my dad i was sort of his favorite but dont tell my sister i said that he was really really cool emily looked at her with a cocked head youre lucky my father and i fought a lot we always have even when i was young id have a boyfriend and dad wouldnt like him he wasnt from the right kind of family he didnt make enough money he was jewish he was catholic i fought back some but he was my father and fathers have authority but then i grew up and after my mother died a few years ago something odd happened the roles switched he became the child hed retired didnt have much money id married a businessman and i was rich he needed a place to stay and he moved in with us but i didnt do it right suddenly i had the power i could dictate just the opposite of the way it was when i lived at home i handled it badly last summer we were arguing and i said some terrible things i didnt mean them i really didnt they werent even true i thought dadd just fight back or ignore them well he didnt what he did was he took some things and disappeared her voice quaked emily fell silent she held her cigarette in an unsteady hand ive been trying to find him ever since he stayed at the y for a while he stayed at a hotel in queens he had an apartment in the west village idont know when he moved here ive been calling people he knowssome of his old coworkers his doctorstrying to find him finally a receptionist at his doctors office broke down and gave me this address emily smoothed her skirt it was a long skirt expensive silk slinky was the only way to describe it rune decided now ive missed him again emily told her didnt you just call and apologize i tried a few months ago but he hung up on me why dont you just give it time maybe hell calm down hes not that old is he in his sixties a look at the carpet again the thing is hes sick he doesnt have much longer thats why the doctors receptionist agreed to tell me where he was he has cancer terminal rune thought of her father and now she recognized symingtons gray face the sweaty skin she thought too hed better not die before she herself had a chance to find him and ask him about mr kelly and the stolen money feeling guilty but thinking it anyway so what is it youre not telling me the adult emily had returned time to show me yours im not sure hes just a witness rune said what do you mean okay if you really want to know i think your father might be the murderer chapter nineteen impossible rune said i think mr kelly found some money and your father found out about it i think your father stole the money and killed him emily was shaking her head never dadd never hurt anybody once again rune thought of symingtons facehow terrified hed seemed well maybe he had a partner who killed him emily started to shake her head but then she paused what rune asked tell me dad wouldnt kill anybody i know that but i see something in your face keep talking a good adult line to say right out of a gary grant movie she believed the sort audrey hepburn had said a million times but the woman said slowly the last time i talked to him i asked if he needed money and he saidhe was really angrybut he said that he was about to get more money than i could imagine and hed never take another damn penny from me or hank ever again he said that rune asked excitedly emily nodded weve got to find him rune said will you turn him in to the police emily asked rune was going to say no but she stopped herself you only lie to people who can control you i dont know i think i believe he didnt kill mr kelly i want to talk to him first but where is he how can we find him emily said if i knew i wouldnt be here now is there anything there rune nodded toward the mail emily had been looking through no its mostly just dear occupant the only lead ive got is the name of his bank i tried calling them to see if they had an address but they wouldnt talk to me rune was thinking about another movie shed seen a few years ago who was in it de niro harvey keitel the actora private eyehad bluffed his way into a bank and gotten information maybe it was sean connery look you dont understand the man is dying for gods sake give me his address heres his account number sir i cant its against policy hell with your policy a mans life is at stake you have the account number she asked emily no well how about the branch ive got that that should be all we need i dont think theyll give you any information youd be surprised i can be extremely persuasive rune wiped her eyesthinking how stephanie the only real actress she knewwould do it im sorry but its really really important the young man was a vice president of the bank but he looked young enough to be a clerk at a mcdonalds what with that wimp mustache and babysmooth cheeks it was the next morning ninethirty and the branch had just opened the lobby surrounding them was deserted the vice president seemed uncomfortable with this young woman sitting in front of his desk crying he scanned his desktop helplessly then looked back at rune hes not getting his bank statements any of them none hes very upset grandfathers such a tense man im sure that was the reason for the stroke hes very whats the word you know fastidious the young man offered meticulous thats it and when he realized hes not getting the statements jesus he really had a fit whats his account number rune was digging in her purse one minute two she heard muzak pumping through the glossy white marble lobby she stared into the pit of her purse i cant seem to find it anyway we probably couldnt read it he tried to write it down for me but he cant control his right hand too well and that frustrates him and i didnt want to upset him unnecessarily i cant do anything without his account his face was all red and his eyes were bulging i thought he was going to burst a whats his name the man asked quickly the mustache got an anemic swipe and he leaned toward his computer vic symington well victor he typed the young man frowned he typed some more his fingers flying across the keys he read frowned again i dont understand you mean that your grandfather wants another copy of his final statement final statement hes moved see and the statement hasnt come to his new address what do you have listed as the new address weve got a problem miss the hamburgerslinging vice president looked up rune felt herself start to sweat her stomach churning shed blown it now he was probably pushing one of those secret buttons that alerts the guards shit she asked problem someone closed out your grandfathers account two days ago if he thinks hes still got money in this bank somethings wrong how could he have gotten here to close his account the poor man cant even eat by himself he didnt do it in person it says toa next to the withdrawal he issued a power of attorney and the attorneyinfact closed the account mother she didnt runes hands went to her face shes always said that shed rob grandfather blind how could sheve done it rune was sobbing again dry tears pouring into her hands tell me you have to was it mother i have to know im sorry miss its against our policy to give out information on customers witout written permission oh this sounded familiar remembering the movie she leaned forward to hell with your policy a mans life is at stake his life the vice president asked placidly sitting back why well because in the de niro or keitel or connery movie the bank officer had just caved because why the man asked he wasnt really suspicious he was just curious the stroke if mother stole his money it could be the end for him another stroke a heart attack im really worried about him the young man sighed another mustache swipe another sigh he looked at the computer screen the check was drawn to ralph stein esquire hes a lawyer oh thank god rune exclaimed thats grandfathers lawyer stine right ein oh sure we call him uncle ralph hes a sweetheart rune stood up here in manhattan right citicorp building thats the one the vice president tapping computer keys like a travel agent said but does your grandfather think he still has an account here rune walked toward the exit the poor man hes really like a child you know the man placed his fingers together they were pudgy fingers and rune imagined that he would leave good fat fingerprints on whatever he touched just like a clumsy felon his nails were dirty too the office where they sat was large yellowpainted filled with boxes and dusty legal books a dead plant sat in the greasy window diplomas from schools shed never heard of hung on one wall next to a clock it was two in the afternoonit had taken her this long to track down attorney stein she had to be at work at four but there was still plenty of time dont panic she told herself the lawyer looked at her with a cool gaze neutral was the word that came to mind he seemed to be the sort of man who wanted to find some weakness about you and notice it and let you know he noticed it even though hed never mention it he wore a suit that fit very closely and monogrammed cuffs that protruded the sausages of fingers pressed together how do you know victor his voice was soft and neutral and that surprised her because she expected lawyers would ask questions with gruff voices sneery and mean rune swallowed and realized suddenly she couldnt be symingtons granddaughter stein might have done the mans will hed know all the relatives by heart then she remembered who his daughter emily thought she was at first she smiled and said im a friend putting special emphasis on the word he nodded neutrally from where we used to live near each other the east village id come and visit him sometimes ah and how did you know about me he mentioned you he said good things about you so youd visit him the lawyer looked her up and down with a whisper of lechery on his face once a week sometimes twice for an old guy he was pretty well energetic so can you tell me where he is rune asked no she swallowed again and was mad that this man was making her swallow and be nervous sometimes it was so hard to be adult she cleared her throat and sat forward why not the lawyer shrugged client confidentiality why do you want to see him he left in such a hurry i wanted to talk to him is all and i didnt get a chance to one day he was on tenth street and the next he was gone how old are you isnt that some kind of crime to ask how old someone is im not discriminating against you on the basis of your age i just want to know how old you are rune said twenty how old are you i assume you dont really want to talk to him do you i assume your relationship or whatever you want to call it wasnt based on talking now five hundred she blurted out he owed me five hundred for one night stein looked her up and down again for one hour rune said one hour he responded im very good not that good the lawyer said one client of mine paid four thousand for two hours four thousand whatd that involve she thought of several bestselling tapes at washington square video mistress q and house of pain sick world out there the lawyers neutral voice asked and if i were to give you that five hundred dollars would you forget about mr symington would you forget that he left in a hurry would you forget everything about him no rune said abruptly the man blinked got a rise out of him there she tried on her adult persona again but i will for two thousand which got an even bigger rise and he actually gave her a smile it wasnaturallyneutral but it was a smile nonetheless he said fifteen hundred deal she started to extend her hand to shake but apparently this wasnt done in matters of this sort he pulled a pad toward him where should i send the check here rune held her hand forward palm out another smile irritated less neutral this time she was supposed to be stupid and intimidated but here she was staring back into his eyes looking more or less adult finally he rose ill just be a minute payable to cash i assume thatll work he walked silently out of the office buttoning his jacket as he left he was gone longer than rune thought hed bethinking hed just tell his secretary to cut a checkbut no he was gone for a full five minutes which was more than enough time for rune to lean forward and flip through steins rolodex and find victor symingtons card the address had been crossed out several times and a new one written in in brooklyn the address was in brooklyn she recited it several times softly out loud closed her eyes she tested herself and found shed memorized it she flipped the rolodex back to where it had been rune fell back into her slouch in the chair and looked at the lawyers wall wondering if there were some special kinds of frames you were supposed to use for diplomas mr gotoschoolandleadaproductivelife richard didnt have any goddamn diplomas on his ugly beige suburban walls phillip dixon the us marshal hadnt even gone to college she bet he seemed perfectly happy but before she could play her game of making up an elaborate life for him starting with his partner being tragically gunned and dying in his amrs lawyer stein returned he had an envelope and a sheet of paper handed her both she scanned the document quickly but it was full of whereases and words like indemnity and waiver she gave up after the first paragraph thats a receipt for the money you agree that if you dont keep your bargain we can sue you for all this money back plus costs and attorneys fees and rune was staring at the check punitive damages whatever rune signed the paper put the check in her bag so mr symington doesnt exist right mr who chapter twenty so how was the date stephanie asked with richard rune responded who else the redhead replied rune considered the question for a moment then asked you ever see rodan they were at the counter of washington square video you mean his sculpture who this was like stallones poetry no i mean the flying dinosaur that destroyed tokyo or maybe new york or someplace a movie from the fifties missed that anyway that was my date a disaster not even a spielberg disaster movie a bmovie disaster she told stephanie about karen shit thats bad otherwoman stuff hard to get around them thems the breaks rune said here she reached into her purse and handed steph the orange earrings no the woman protested you keep them nope im off high fashion listen do me a favor please what ive got to go to brooklyn can you work for me i guess but wont tony be pissed just tell him i dont know i had to go someplace to visit frankies sister in the hospital shes home with the baby well i went to see her at home tonyd call and check rune nodded youre right just make up something i dont care whatre you gonna do in brooklyn the money ive got a lead to the money not that stolen bank money yep and dont forget the story of the little red hen stephanie smiled im not quitting my day job just yet probably a good idea rune slung her leopardskin purse over her shoulder and headed out the door but keep the faith im getting close ten minutes later she was en route to brooklyn in search of victor symington on the subway the riders were silent subdued one woman whispered to herself a young couple had their precious new tv on the seat next to them bundled in thick string a receipt from a crazy eddie store taped to the box a latino man stood leaning forward staring absently at the mta map he didnt seem to care much where he was headed almost everyone in the car bathed in green fluorescence was slumped and sullen as the car lurched into the last station in manhattan before the descent beneath the east river uneasy again leaving the side leaving her territory just before the doors eased shut a man walked stiffly onto the train he was white but had a dark yellowish tan she couldnt guess his age the car wasnt full but he sat directly across from rune he was wearing dusty clothes coming home from a construction job or hard day labor tired spent he was very thin and she wondered if he was sick he fell asleep immediately and rune couldnt help but stare at him his head bobbed and swayed eyes closed his head rolled keeping his blind focus on rune she thought hes death she felt it deep inside her with a chill death hades a horseman of the apocalypse the dark angel whod fluttered into her fathers hospital room to take him away the spirit who wrapped his ghostly arms around mr kelly and held him helpless in the musty armchair while someone fired those terrible bullets into his chest the lights flickered as the train switched tracks and then slowed as it rolled into one station then they were on their way again five minutes later the train lurched and they stopped again the doors rumbled open waking him up as his eyes opened he was staring directly into runes she shuddered and sat back but couldnt look away he glanced out the window stood up quickly shit missed my stop missed my stop he walked out of the car and because she kept staring at him shuffling along the platform as the train pulled out rune saw the man whod been following her as her gaze eased to the right she glanced into the car behind her and saw the young man compact italianlooking she blinked not sure why she remembered him and then recalled that shed seen somebody who looked a lot like him someplace else the loft no in the east village near mr kellys apartment outside mr kellys apartment the day shed broken in yes that was it and it was the same guy whod ducked into the deli when shed been on the street in front of washington square video pretty boy wearing the utility jacket sitting on the doorstep smoking and reading the post or was it it looked like him but she wasnt sure no con ed jackets today the man wasnt looking her way didnt even seem to know she was there reading a book or magazine engrossed in it no it couldnt be him paranoid thats what she was seeing the man with the yellow eyes seeing death had made her paranoid it was just life in a city of madmen dirty screeching subways fifteen hundred homicides a year a thousand police detectives with closetogether eyes us marshals who like to flirt paranoia what else could it be hell she thought get real it could be because of a million dollars it could be because of a murder thats what else it could be the lights went out again as the train clattered through another switch she leapt up heart pounding ready to run sure that pretty boyd come pushing through the door and strangle her but when the lights came back on the man was gone was probably standing in a cluster of people by the door about to get off at the next stop see just paranoia she sat down and breathed deeply to calm herself when the crowd got off he wasnt in the car any longer two stops later at bay ridge rune slipped out of the car looking around no sign of any prettyboy meter readers she pushed through the turnstile climbed to the sidewalk glancing up and down the street trying to orient herself and saw him walking out of the other subway exit a halfblock away looking aroundtrying to find her jesus he had been following her she looked away trying to stay calm dont let him know you spotted him he pushed roughly through crowds of exiting passengers and passersby aiming in her direction trying to look nonchalant strolling along the street pretending to gaze at what was displayed in store windows but actually hoping to see the reflection of an approaching taxi pretty boy was getting closer he mustve shoved somebody out of the way she heard a macho exchange of fuck you no fuck you any minute hed start sprinting toward her any minute hed pull out the gun and shoot her dead with those teflon bullets then reflected in a drugstore window she saw a bright yellow cab cruising down the street rune spun around leapt in front of a pregnant woman and flung the door open before the driver even had a chance to stop in a thick middleeastern accent the driver cried what the hell you doing drive the cabbie was shaking his head no uhuh nohe pointed to the offduty lights on the top of the yellow chevy yes she shouted drive drive drive rune saw that pretty boyd stopped surprised not sure what to do he stood cigarette in his hand then began taking cautious steps forward toward them maybe worried that the scene at the cab would attract some cops then he must have decided it didnt matter he started to run toward her rune begged the driver please only a few blocks she gave him an address on fort hamilton parkway no no uhuh twenty dollars twenty no uhuh she looked behind her pretty boy was only a few doors away hand inside his jacket thirty please please please he debated well okay thirty drive drive drive shouted rune why you in a hurry the driver asked forty fucking dollars drive forty the driver floored the accelerator and the car spun away leaving a cloud of bluewhite tire smoke between the chevy and pretty boy rune sat huddled down in the vinyl stained rear seat goddammit she whispered bitterly as her heart slowed she wiped sweat from her palms who was he symingtons accomplice probably shed bet he was the one whod killed mr kelly the triggermanas the cops in manhattan is my beat had called the thug whod machinegunned down roy in front of the hotel on fifth avenue and from the look in his dark eyes she could tell he intended to kill her too time for the police she wondered call manelli call phillip dixon it made sense it was the only thing that made sense at this point but then there was the matter of the million dollars she thought of amanda thought of her own perilous career thought of how shed like to pull up in front of richard and karen in a stretch limo and decided no police not yet a few minutes later the cab stopped in front of a lightgreenandbrick twostory row house the driver said thats forty dollars and dont worry about no tip she stood on the sidewalk hidden behind some anemic evergreens looking at the row house that was according to his lawyers rolodex victor symingtons current residence a pink flamingo stood on one wire leg on the front lawn a brown christmas wreath lay next to a croquet mallet beside the stairs an iron jockey with black features painted caucasian held a ring for hitching a horse lets do it she muttered to herself not much time pretty boy would be looking for a pay phone just then to call symington and tell him that he couldnt stop her and that she was on her way there it wouldnt be long before pretty boy himself d show up she thought she could handle symington by himself but with his strongarm partner probably a hothead thered be trouble she rang the doorbell she had her story ready and it was a good one she thought rune would tell him that she knew what he and pretty boy had done and that shed given a letter to her lawyer explaining everything and mentioning their names if anything happened to her shed tell him the letter would be sent to the police only one flaw symington wasnt home goddammit she hadnt counted on that she banged on the door with her fist no answer she turned the knob it was bolted shut glancing up and down the street no pretty boy yet she clumped down the graypainted stairs and walked around to the back door she passed a quorum of the seven dwarfs in plaster planted along the side of the building then found the gate in a cheap mesh fence around the backyard at the back door rune pressed her face against the glass hands shrouding out the light it was dark inside she couldnt see much of anything part of her said pretty boy could be there at any minute the other part of her broke out a small windowpane with her elbow she reached in and opened the door she tossed the broken glass into the backyard which was overgrown with thick bright grass she stepped inside she walked through to the living room like minimal she muttered in the bedroom were one bed a dresser a floor lamp the kitchen had one table and two chairs two glasses sat on the retro formica counter spattered like a jackson pollock painting a few chipped dishes and silverware in the living room was a single folding chair nothing else rune paused in front of the bathroom there was a stained glass window in the door oooo classy poddy she muttered somebodys initials on the door wc the guy who built the house she guessed she looked through the closetsall of them except the one in the bedroom which was fastened with a big new glistening lock under the squeaky bed were two suitcases heavy battered leather ones she pulled them out starting to sweat in the heat of the close stale apartment she stood up and tried to open a window it was nailed shut why she wondered she went back to the suitcases and opened the first one clothes old frayed at the cuffs and collar points the browns going light the whites going yellow she closed it and slid it back in the second suitcase a razor an old doubleedged gillette a tube of shave cream like toothpaste a swiss army knife keys a small metal container of cuff links nail scissors toothbrush she dug down through the layers and found a small battered brown accordion folder with a rubber band around it it was very heavy she opened it she found a letterfrom weissman burkow stein rubin pcdescribing how his savings about fiftyfive thousand had been transferred to an account in the cayman islands a plane ticket oneway coach to georgetown on grand cayman the flight was leaving day after tomorrow next to it she found his passport shed never seen one before it was old and limp and stained there were dozens of officiallooking stamps in the back she didnt even look at the name until she was about to put it back wait who the hell was vincent spinello oh shit at steins law firm when shed looked through the lawyers rolodex shed been so nervous shed misread the name shed seen vincent spinello and thought victor symington oh christ shed gotten it all wrong and shed even broken the poor mans window all a waste she couldnt believe it the danger the risk pretty boy all a waste goddamn she whispered harshly only wait the letter she opened the letter again it was addressed to symington and at this address so what was he doing with vincent spinellos passport but as she looked at the passport again the condensed grim little picture there was no doubt spinello was the man shed seen at robert kellys apartment who was he she dug to the bottom of the folder and found out what made it so heavy was something that was wrapped in a piece of newspapera pistol with it was a small box of cheap cardboard flecked browngreen the box too was heavy on the side was printing in what she thought was german she could make out only one word teflon oh god symingtonor spinellowas the man whod killed robert kelly he and pretty boy had found the union bank robbery money theyd stolen it and killed him and the loot was in the closet rune dropped to her knees and looked at the padlock on the closet leaned close squinting pulled it rattled the solid lock then she froze at the sound of a door opening then closing was it the front or the back door she couldnt tell but she knew one thing it was either pretty boy or symington and she knew something else they both wanted her dead rune gave one last tug at the closet door it didnt move a millimeter footsteps inside now nearby if he finds me here hell kill me she stuffed the accordion envelope into her bag and slung it over her shoulder a creak of floorboards no no she thought they were in the front of the apartment in the living room which wasnt visible from where she was she could probably get out the back without being seen she glanced into the corridor fast then ducked back into the bedroom yep it was empty rune took a breath and ran from the bedroom she slammed right into victor symingtons chest he gasped in terror stepped back the ugly hat falling from his head in reflex he lunged out and slugged her hard in the stomach doubling her over oh god she wheezed a huge pain shot through her chest and jaw rune tried to scream but her voice was only a whisper she dropped to the floor unable to breathe symington furious grabbed her by the hair and spun her around dropped to his knees his hands smelled of garlic and tobacco he began to search her roughly are you with them he gasped who the fuck are you she couldnt answer you are arent you youre working for them he lifted his fist rune lifted an arm over her face who she managed to ask he asked how did you he stopped speaking struggling to catch her breath rune looked up symington was staring at the doorway someone stood there pretty boy rune blinked rolled to her knees no thank you thank you thank you it was his daughter emily rune was so grateful to see the woman that it wasnt until a second later that she wondered howd emily find the place had she followed me here wait something is wrong symington let go of rune backed up emily said how did we find you you were going to ask haarte has some good contacts haart rune wondered whos heart she asked oh no its haarte symington whispered then he nodded hopelessly i shouldve guessed whats going on rune demanded symington was looking at emily with an imploring expression on his face please emily didnt respond he continued would it do any good to say i have a lot of money the money rune said he killed mr kelly and stole his money both symington and emily ignored her is there anything i can do symington pleaded no emily said and took a pistol from her pocket she shot him in the chest chapter twentyone the way he fell is what saved rune the gun was small but the impact knocked symington backward and he slammed into the pole of the floor lamp which fell against the bathroom door sending a shower of glass into the hallway emily danced out of the way of the splinters which gave rune a chance to sprint into the bedroom but the woman recovered fast she fired the gun again and rune heard a terrible stereo sound of noises the blasts of the gun behind her the crash of the bullets slamming into the plaster wall inches from her head thenwith another punch of breathtaking pain she dove through the bedroom window hands covering her face shards of glass flying around her trailing the window shade she rolled onto more sad evergreens and dropped onto the grass coming to rest against one of the plaster dwarfs panting she lay on the lawn the smell of dirt and damp grass enveloped her she could hear birds squabbling in the trees overhead and then the air around her exploded a dwarfs face disintegrated into white splinters and dust on the street fifty feet away rune caught a glimpse of a man with shotgun she couldnt see his face but she knew it was pretty boyheart probably the one symington mentioned or hearts partner he and emily were working together she didnt know who they were exactly or why they wanted to kill symington but she didnt pause to consider those questions she rolled under another plant then scrabbled to her feet clutching her purse she sprinted into the backyard then clambered over the chainlink fence and then she ran behind her from symingtons yard came a shout a second shotgun blast she heard the hiss of something over her head it missed and she turned down an alley kept running running until her vision blurred running until her chest ignited and she couldnt breathe another ounce of air finally miles away it seemed rune stopped gasping she doubled over sure she was going to be sick but she spit into the grass a few times and remained motionless until the nausea and pain went away she trotted another block but pulled up with a cramp in her side she slipped into another backyardbehind a house with boardedup windows she crawled into a nest of grass between a smiling bambi and another set of the seven dwarfs then lay her head on her purse thinking shed rest for ten fifteen minutes when she opened her eyes a huge garbage truck was making its mournful behemoth sounds five feet away from her and it was dawn theyd be watching for her maybe at the midtown tunnel maybe at a subway stop emily and pretty boy and not just them a dozen others she saw them all nowthem with a capital t walking down the streets of brooklyn on this clear cool spring morning faces glancing at her knowing that she was a witness knowing that she and her friends were about to dieto be laid out like robert kelly like victor symington they were all after her she was hitching her way back to manhattan back to the side shed thumbed a ride with a delivery van the driver a wildeyed puerto rican with a wispy goatee who swore at the traffic with incredible passion and made it to the brooklyn bridge a drive that should have taken threefourths of an hour at this time of day in fifteen minutes he apologized profusely that he couldnt take her into manhattan itself and then she ran once more over the wooden walkway of the brooklyn bridge back into the city which was just starting to come to life traffic hissed beneath her the muted horns of the taxis sounded like animals lowing she paused halfway across to rest leaning against the railing the young professionals walked pastwearing running shoes with their suits and dresseson their way to wall street from brooklyn heights what the hell had she been thinking of quests adventures knights and wizards and damsels no she thought bitterly these were the people who lived in the magic kingdom lawyers and secretaries and accountants and deliverymen it wasnt a magic place at all it was just a big teeming city filled with good people and bad people thats all just a city just people its a factory rune theres shit and pollution it mahes a living for people and they pay taxes and give money to charity and buy sneakers for their children who grow up to be lawyers or teachers or musicians or people who work in other factories its nothing more than that once over the bridge she walked north toward the courthouses past city hall staring up at the twisty gothic buildingthe north face made of cheap stone not marble because no one ever thought the city would spread north of the wall street district then into chinatown and up through soho to washington square park which even this early was a zoo a medieval carnival jugglers unicyclists skateboard acrobats kids slamming on guitars so cheap they were just rhythm instruments she sat down on a bench ignoring a tall senegalese selling knockoff rolexes ignoring a beefy white teenager chanting hash hash sens sens smoke it up sens women in designer jogging outfits rolled their expensive buggies of infant lawyerstobe past dealers and stonedout vets it was greenwich village rune sat for an hour once some vague resolve coalesced in her and she stood up but it vanished swiftly and she sat down again closed her eyes and let the hot sun fall on her face who were they emily pretty boy where was the money she fell asleep againuntil a frisbee skimmed her head and startled her awake she looked around in panic struggling to remember where she was how shed gotten there she asked a woman the time noon it seemed that a dozen people were staring at her suspiciously she stood and walked quickly through the grass north through the white stone arch a miniature arc de triomphe they were old films both of them one was she wore a yellow ribbon the john wayne cavalry flick it was playing now rune didnt notice what the other one was maybe the searcher or red river yellow ribbon was showing when she sat down the seats in the old theater on twelfth street were stiffthin padding under crushed fabric upholstery there were only fifteen or so people in the revival house which didnt surprise herthe only time this place had ever been crowded was on saturday night and when they were showing selections from the new york erotic film festival watching the screen she knew the old john forddirected western cold shed seen it six times but today it seemed to her to be just a series of disjointed images salty old victor mclaglen the distinguished graying wayne the intensified hues of the fortyyearold technicolor film the shoulderpunching innocent humor of the bluebloused horse soldiers but today the movie made no sense to her it was disconnected images of men and women walking around on a huge rectangle of white screen fifty feet in front of her they spoke funny words they wore odd clothing they played into staged climaxes it was all choreographed and it was all fake her anger built anger at the two dimensions of the film the falsity the illusion she felt betrayed not only by emily symington or whoever she was not only by what had happened in brooklyn but by something else something more fundamental about how she lived her life about how the things she believed in had turned on her she stood and left the theater outside she bought a pair of thickrimmed dark glasses from a street vendor and put them on she turned the corner and walked down university place to washington square video tony fired her of course his words werent cute or sarcastic or obnoxious like shed thought hed be he just glanced up and said you missed two shifts and you didnt call youre fired this time for real but she didnt pay him much attention she was staring at the newspaper on the counter lying in front of tony the headline mafia witness hit which didnt get her attention as quickly as the photo did a grainy flashlit shot of victor symingtons town house in brooklyn the six surviving dwarfs the shattered window rune grabbed the paper hey tony snapped im reading that one look at her eyes though and he stopped protesting a convicted syndicate money launderer who had been a key witness in a series of racketeering influenced corrupt organizations rico trials of midwest crime leaders earlier this year was shot to death yesterday in a ganglandstyle hit in brooklyn vincent spinello was killed by gunshots to the chest a witness who asked not to be identified reported that a young woman with short hair fled from the scene and is a primary suspect in the case another witness in the same series of cases arnold gittleman was murdered along with two us marshals in a st louis hotel last month the paper crumpled in her hands me she thought thats me the young woman with short hair she used me emily the bitch used me she knew all along where symington was and got me out there to make it look like i killed him and hell my fingerprintsre all over the place primary suspect tony snatched the newspaper away from her you can pick up your check on monday please tony she said i need money now cant i get cash no fucking way ive got to get out of town monday he said returned to his paper look ive got a check for fifteen hundred bucks give me a thousand and ill sign it over to you yeah like youve got a check thats going to clear im sure tony its payable to cash from a law firm out frankie greek stuck his head out of the storeroom and said hey rune like you got a couple calls this cop manelli and that us marshal guy dixon oh and stephanie too tony barked but dont call em from here use the pay phone outside stephanie rune thought if theyd been following me theyve seen me with her oh jesus mary shes in danger too she ran back to the counter and swept the phone off the cradle tony started to say something but then seemed to decide that it wasnt worth fighting the battle after all hed won the war he turned on his worn heel and retreated to the other counter carrying the newspaper stephanies groggy voice finally answered rune whereve you been you missed work last night tonys really pissed steph listen to me her voice was raw they murdered that man i was trying to find symington theyre trying to make it look like i did it what and they tried to kill me who i dont know they work for the mafia or something i think they mightve seen you too rune are you making this up is this one of your fantasies no im serious several customers glanced at her she felt a shiver of fear she cupped her hand over the receiver and lowered her voice look on the front page of the post the storys there you have to call the police i cant my fingerprintsre all over the house where symington got killed im a suspect jesus rune what a mess im going back to ohio when now as soon as i can get some money tony wont pay me prick stephanie spat out i can lend you some i can give you a check for fifteen hundred are you serious yeah its payable to cash you can have

how bout union square park the subway entrance southeast side okay good a half hour is it safe stephanie asked cautiously pretty safe a pause i dont want to get beat up or anything i bruise real easy and i cant be bruised for my audition as she stepped into the street rune heard the mans voice right beside her youre a hard person to find panicked rune spun around richard was leaning on a parking meter the yuppie in him had been exorcized mr downtown was back he wore boots black jeans and a black tshirt he also wore a gold hoop in his ear she noticed that it was a clipon he looked tired you have he continued as fdr said a passion for anonymity i called you at the store a couple of times i was worried about you i havent been in for a while there was this party last night i thought you might want to go you didnt ask whats her name cathy the amazon karen he held on to the parking meter and spiraled around it slowly weve only had dinner that once dont worry about her were not going out thats your business i dont care dont act so possessive how can i be acting possessive if i tell you i dont care what you do with cathykaren whats wrong he was frowning following her eyes to the short darkcomplected man with curly hair standing two doors away his back was to them rune inhaled with a frightened hiss the man turned and walked past them it wasnt pretty boy she turned back to richard trying to focus on him though what she was seeing was the stupid grin of the plaster statue of dopey or sneezy as it disintegrated under the shotgun blast the gun had been astonishingly loud sounded more like a bomb going off richard took her by the shoulders rune arent you listening to me whats wrong she backed away eyes narrowing slowly leave me alone what stay away from me do you want to get hurt im poison stay away what are you talking about he reached out and took her hand no no she shouted the tears started she hesitated then hugged him get away from me forget about me forget you ever met me she turned and ran through the crowds of greenwich village toward union square waiting under the artdeco steel entrance to the subway rune slouched against the cool tile she absently watched a crane a lopsided tshaped structure rising above an enormous new housing project on union square its just a crane she told herself thats all it was not a tool of the gods not a huge skeleton of a magic animal what she saw was just a construction crane moving slowly under the control of a faceless union worker lifting steel reinforcing rods for workmen in dusty jeans and jackets to install magic hell she thought again about calling manelli or dixon but why should they believe her there was probably an allpoints bulletin out on her already just like thered been for roy the cop after hed stolen the loot in manhattan is my beat at least shed had the foresight to get rid of some of the evidence when shed stopped by her loft to pick up the check shed realized she still had spinellos accordion envelope and thrown it into the trash if the cops found her with that itd be a sure conviction no shed leave town leave the side leave the magic kingdom go back home get a job go to school well it was damn well about time time to grow up forget quests she saw stephanie her reddish hair glowing in the afternoon sun as she walked through the park they waved at each other it seemed ridiculously innocent rune thought as if they were girlfriends meeting for drinks after work to complain about bosses and men and mothers rune looked around saw no one suspiciouswell no one more suspicious than youd normally see in union square parkthen joined stephanie youre hurt the woman glanced at her forehead where rune had been cut by a piece of glass or plaster its okay what happened rune told her god you have to go to the police you can talk to them tell them what happened yeah right they can place me at two different crime scenes im the number one suspect but wont the cops find you in ohio she gave a faint smile they mightif they knew my real name which they dont stephanie smiled back true oh here she handed rune a wad of bills its about three hundred that enough rune hugged her i dont know what to say she gave stephanie the check no no this is too much little red hen remember i just need enough to get home on you keep the rest tonyll probably fire you too just for helping me come on stephanie told her ill help you pack and take you to the airport they started down into the subway you think its safe to go back to your loft emily and pretty boy dont know about it manelli and that us marshal do but we can sneak in through the construction site nobodyll see us we can a chill like ice down her back she gasped ten feet away pretty boy stepped out from behind a pillar holding a black pistol dont fucking move he muttered to rune anger on his face he moved forward toward rune not paying any attention to stephanie apparently he didnt even think they were together rune froze but stephanie didnt she stepped past him fast which caught him completely off guard screaming rape rape she shoved her palm fingers stiff and splayed into his face his head snapped back and he staggered against the wall blood pouring from his nose fuck he cried her selfdefense class stephanie stepped toward him again it looked like she was going to kick him this time but pretty boy was good too he knew what he was doing he didnt try to fight back he leapt to the side about three steps out of range wiped the blood from his mouth and started to raise the pistol toward her then the arm closed around his neck a passengera huge black manhad heard stephanies cry and had come up behind their attacker and locked his muscular arm around pretty boys throat choking he dropped the gun and grabbed the mans forearm trying futilely to break the grip the big man behind him seemed to be enjoying the whole thing he said cheerfully to pretty boy hokay asshole leave thladies lone you hear me they ran stephanie in the lead she must have belonged to a health clubshe was moving like a greyhound if pretty boy was there rune figured emily must be nearby too besides the token seller wouldve called the cops by then rune wanted to get as far away from the station as possible gasping running following stephanie as best she could they were two blocks from the subway when it happened at thirteenth and broadway a taxi jumped a red light just before it changed which was the exact moment stephanie ran into the intersection between two doubleparked trucks she didnt have a chance all she could do was roll onto the hood to keep from getting crushed under the wheels the driver hit the brakes which gave a low wild scream but still the cab hit her hard some part of her bodyher face rune thought in despairslammed into the windshield which turned white with fractures stephanie cartwheeled onto the concrete a swirl of floral cloth and red hair and white flesh no rune screamed two women ran up and started tending to her rune dropped to her knees beside them she hardly heard the litany of the cabdriver she ran through light it wasnt my fault it wasnt my fault rune cradled stephanies bloody head in her arms youll be okay she whispered youll be okay youll be okay but stephanie couldnt hear chapter twentytwo rune stood by the window of the hospital looking out onto the park it was an old city park on first avenue more rocks and dirt than grass most of the boulders painted with graffiti tinted red and purple they seemed to be oozing from the underbelly of the city itself like exposed organs she turned away a doctor walked by not looking at her none of them had looked at herthe doctors the orderlies the nurses the candy stripers shed given up waiting for a kindly old man in a white jacket to come into the hallway put his arm around her and say about your friend dont you worry shell be fine the way they do in movies but moviesre fake richards words echoed they arent real no one had stopped to talk to her if she wanted any information she had to ask the nurses again and shed get the same look shed gotten two dozen times before no news well let you know she looked out the window once more watching for pretty boy thinking maybe hed gotten away from the man in the subway and escaped from the cops followed the ambulance here paranoia again but its not paranoia if theyre really after you hoping that stephanie had hurt pretty boy really bad when shed hit him a character in one of her fairy stories a friendly witch had told someone never to hope for harm to someone else hope for all the good you want but never wish harm on anyone because the witch said harms like a wasp in a jar once you release it you never know who its going to sting but now rune hoped stephanie had hurt the bastard real bad she wandered up to the nurses station an older woman with a snake of a stethoscope around her neck finally looked up oh we just heard about your friend what tell me they just took her to radiology for more scans shes still unconscious thats what you were going to tell me that you dont know anything i thought youd want to know shell be back in icu in forty minutes an hour depending useless rune thought ill be back if she wakes up tell her ill be back oh please pan and isis and persephone let her live rune stood by the east river watching the tugs sail upstream the circle line tour boat too a barge three or four cabin cruisers the water was ugly and ripesmelling the traffic from the fdr drive rushed past with a moist tearing sound which set her on edge it sounded like bandages being removed just an adventure thats all i wanted an adventure lancelot searching for the grail psyche for her lost lover eros like in the books in the movies and rune would be the hero shed find mr kellys killer shed find the million dollars shed save amanda and would live happily ever after with richard god of heavenly powers who by the might of thy command drivest away from mens bodies all sickness and infirmity be present in thy goodness these were the words shed said so often during the last week of her fathers life that shed memorized them without trying to her father a young man a handsome man who played with rune and her sister all the time taught them to ride bicycles who read them stories who took them to plays as readily as to ball games a man who always had time to talk to them listen to their problems no fairy stories didnt always have happy endings but they always had endings that were just people died and lost their fortunes in them because they were dishonest or careless or greedy there was no justice in her fathers death though hed lived a good life and hed still died badly slow and messy in the shaker heights garden hospice no justice in mr kellys death no justice in stephanies getting hurt none if she died please speaking out loud now with this thy servant stephanie that her weakness may be banished and her strength recalled her voice fell to a whisper and then she stopped praying staring at the ugly river in front of her rune took off her silver bracelets one by one and tossed them into the water they disappeared without any sound that she could hear and she took that as a good sign that the gods who oversaw this wonderful and terrible city were happy with her sacrifice though when she got to last bracelet the one that shed bought for richard she paused looking at the silver hands clasped together she heard his voice again youre going to find out im not a knight and that okay maybe there was some bank robbery moneywhich i think is the craziest frigging thing ive ever heardbut that its spent or stolen or lost somewhere years ago and youll never find it she gripped the bracelet firmly ready to throw it after the others but then decided no shed save this oneas a reminder to herself about how adventures can get friends and family hurt and killed how quests work only in books and in movies and here you are pissing your life away in a video store jumping from fantasy to fantasy waiting for something you dont even know what it is she slipped the last bracelet back on her wrist and slowly returned to the hospital upstairs the nurses had changed shifts and no one could find stephanie rune had a terrible moment of panic as one nurse looked at a sheet of paper and found a black space where there should have been a list of patients from adult emergency services whod gone to radiology she felt her hands trembling then the nurse found an entry that said stephanie was still upstairs ill let you know the nurse promised rune stood at the window for a long time again then heard a voice asking for her she turned froze the doctor was very young and he had a mournful expression on his face it seemed that he hadnt slept in a week rune wondered if hed ever told anyone before that a patient had died her breath came fast she gripped the bracelet maniacally youre a friend of the woman hit by the cab he asked rune nodded he said shes transitioned from a deteriorating status rune stared at him he stared back waiting for a response finally he tried again shes in a stable situation i she shook her head his words not making sense to her shell be okay the doctor said rune started to cry he continued she has a concussion but there isnt much blood loss some bad contusions whats a contusion a bruise oh rune said softly stephanie who didnt want to get bruised for her audition she asked him is she awake no she wont be for a while thank you doctor she hugged him hard he endured this for a moment then retreated wearily back through the swinging doors at the nurses station rune asked for a piece of paper and a pen rune wrote steph im leaving thanks for everything dont come near me dont try to contact me ill only get you hurt again love r she handed the note to the nurse please give this to her when she wakes up oh and please tell her im sorry running again looking behind her as often as she looked forward past garbage cans litter on the street puddles past the fake gaudy gold of the puck building in soho surrounded by the sour smell of the fringe of the lower east side running running rune felt the trickle of sweat down her back and sides the pain in her feet as they slammed on the concrete through the thin soles of her cheap boots air flooded into her lungs and stung her chest a block from her loft rune pressed against the side of a building and looked behind her no one was following it was just a peaceful shabby street she checked out the street in front of her loft no police cars even unmarked ones familiar shadows familiar trash the same brokendown blue van that had been there for days plastered with parking tickets she waited until her pounding heart calmed if emily and pretty boy found out about her place would they come here probably not theyd know the police would be staking it out besides they were probably gone themselves shed been the fall guy they needed their job was done theyd probably left town which is what im going to do right now round on the ends and hi in the middle its ohio rune walked around the block then snuck through the plywood fence of the construction site workers in hard hats came and went she walked past them quickly into her building she started up in the freight elevator smelling the grease and paint and solvents she was already sickfrom exhaustion and fearand the scents turned her stomach even more the elevator clanked to a stop at the top floor she unhooked the chain guard and stepped out no sounds from the loft upstairs but there was a chance somebody was there she called rune its me are you home no response its your friend jennifer rune nothing then up the stairs slowly peering out of the opening in the floor the empty loft stretched out around her she raced to her side of the loft grabbed one of the old suitcases she used for a dresser opened it she walked around the room trying to decide what to take no clothes no jewelryshe didnt own much other than her bracelets she picked some pictures of her family and the friends shed met in new york and her bookstwenty or so of them the ones shed never be able to replace she considered the videosdisney mostly but she could get new copies of those rune noticed the tape of manhattan is my beat she picked it up and flung it angrily across the room it crashed into a table shattering several glasses the cassette itself broke apart too she found a pen and paper she wrote sandra its been radical rooming with you ive got the chance to go to england for a couple years so if anyone comes looking for me you can tell them thats were i am im not sure where but i think ill be somewhere near london or edinborow hope your jewelry makes it big your designs are really super and if you ever sell it in london ill buy some good lox rune she folded the paper left it on sandras pillow and picked up the heavy suitcase which is when she heard the footsteps they were on the floor below whoever it was hadnt come up via the elevator theyd snuck up the stairs so they wouldnt be heard the only exit was the stairwaythe one the intruder was now coming up she heard cautious feet gritty she looked across the loft to her side of the roomat her suitcase and leopardskin bag no time to get a weapon no time for anything nowhere to run she looked around her glass house nowhere to hide chapter twentythree he took the stairs one at a time slowly slowly pausing listening and struggling to control his anger which throbbed like the pain in his facefrom when that fucking redhead had nailed him in the subway listening above him and listening below he was out of his uniform nowhed ditched the meter readers jacket a while ago before he trailed the little shorthaired bitch to brooklynand i downstairs some of the construction guys had given him some shit about just walking into the building hed just i kept walking giving them a fuckyou look and not even i bothering to make up a cover story so listening for somebody laying in wait for him upstairs listening for somebody following but he heard no footsteps no breathing no guns being racked pausing at the top of the stairs head down okay go walking fast into the loft eyes taking in places he could go for cover only he didnt have to worry she wasnt there shit hed been sure shed come back if only to get her stuff before she took off pointing the gun in front of him he made a circuit of the loft shed been there there was a suitcase half filled there was that godugly purse of hers but no sign of the bitch maybe then he heard it a click and a grind the elevator he ran to the stairs thinking shed snuck out behind him but no the cage was empty it was going down so she was coming home hed gotten there before her he ducked behind a halfheight wall of cinder block out of view of the stairway and waited for her to come to him rune was exactly eight feet away from pretty boy standing in the steady stream of wind outside the loft a hundred feet above the sidewalk her boots perched on a thin ridge of metal that jutted out six inches from the lower edge of the buildings facade most of her body was below the glass windows and if she ducked pretty boy couldnt see her only she was compelled to look because shed heard the elevator start down somebody was coming up and pretty boy was going to kill them her hands quivered her legs were weak as if her muscles were melting the wind was cold up there the smells different raw she looked down again at the cobblestone patches of the street coming through the asphalt she closed her eyes and pressed her face against her arm for comfort cobblestonesthe final scene in manhattan is my beat ruby dahl walking slowly down the wet street crying for her tormented fiance gunned down in greenwich village roy roy iwould have loved you even if you were poor rune looked back into the loft and saw pretty boy shift slightly then cock his ear toward the doorway who was coming up in the elevator sandra some of the construction guys please let it be the policemanelli or dixon coming to arrest her for the shooting in brooklyn they had guns theyd at least have a chance against the killer suddenly pretty boy crouched and held the guns muzzle up his right index finger on the trigger he looked around him turning his head as though listening whoever was there was calling out some words yes she could vaguely hear a voice rune rune are you here it was a man richard ran up the stairs shouting something no no no she cried silently oh not him please dont hurt him she closed her eyes and tried to send him a message of danger but when she looked again she saw that hed walked farther into the loft rune pretty boy couldnt see him from the other side of the wall but he was following richards steps with the gun rune saw him cock it with his long thumb and point it to the spot where richard was about to appear oh no there was nothing else to do she couldnt let anybody else get hurt because of her she raised her right fist above the glass shed break the window scream for richard to run pretty boy would panic and spin around shoot her but richard might just have enough time to leap down the stairs and escape okay now do it but just as she started to bring her fist down on the window richard paused hed seen the notethe note shed written to sandra he picked it up and read it then shook his head he looked around the loft one more time and then started down the stairs pretty boy peeked out from behind the wall slipped his gun into his belt he stood thank you thank you rune lowered her right arm and held on to the ledge again pretty boy searched the loft again looking for her then started down the stairs runes fingertips were numb though her arm muscles ached and her legs were on fire with pain but she stayed where she was until below her she saw pretty boy jog out of the building and disappear east she edged to the small access door and crawled inside she lay on her bed for five minutes until the quivering in her muscles stopped then she picked up the suitcase and purse and left the loft not even thinking to say goodbye to her castle in the sky on the streets of tribeca she paused looking around there were construction workers there were businessmen and businesswomen there were messengers shed thought pretty boy and emily were gone wouldnt bother with her but shed been wrong there and that meant they might have other partners was it any one of these people several faces glanced at her and their expressions were dark and suspicious she shrank back into an alley hid behind a dumpster shed wait until it was night just hide therethen hike up to the bus station then she saw a bum coming up the alley only he didnt look quite like a bum to her he was dirty like a homeless man and he wore shabby clothes but his eyes seemed too quick they seemed dangerous he looked up and saw her paused for just an instant too long lowered his head again and continued up the alley ignoring her but really trying too hard to ignore her he was one of them too go girl go she slung her purse over her shoulder grabbed the heavy suitcase and bolted from behind the dumpster the bum saw her debated a moment then started running too directly behind her rune couldnt run fast not with the suitcase she struggled into franklin street and paused gasping trying to figure which way to go the bum was getting closer then a mans voice rune she spun around heart hammering rune over here it was phillip dixon the us marshal he was waving toward her she started toward him instinctively then stopped remembering that he was one of the people who wanted to arrest her what should she do she was in the middle of the streetthirty feet from the subway she heard a rumbling undergrounda train was approaching she could vault the turnstile and be on her way uptown in fifteen seconds thirty feet from the bum running toward her anger on his face thirty feet from dixon rune the marshal called come on its not safe here theyre around here somewhere the killers no youre going to arrest me i know you didnt kill symington dixon said but what else was he going to say and after the cuffs were on itd be you have the right to remain silent the bum was closer staring at her with dark cold eyes the train was almost in the station run for it now i want to help you dixon shouted ive been worried about you he started across the street but stopped when she turned away from him started toward the subway he held up his hands please theyre after you rune we know what happened they set you up they hadnt figured on you getting away in brooklyn but we know you didnt do it you were just at the wrong place at the wrong time choose she told herself now she started across the street tentatively toward dixon the bum was closer now slowing please rune the marshal said beneath her feet through the grating the train eased into the station brakes squealing choose come on youve gotta trust somebody she bolted toward dixon ran to his side he put his arm around her its okay he said youll be all right she blurted out theres a man after me in the alley and saw a car pulling up at the curb beside them the bum turned the corner he stopped cold as dixon drew that huge black gun of his shit the bum said holding up his hands hey man im sorry i just wanted her purse no big deal im just going to dixon fired once the bullet slammed into the bums chest he flew backward jesus rune cried whatd you do that for he saw my face phillip said matteroffactly lifting the suitcase and purse away from rune from the car that had just driven up a womans voice said to dixon come on haarte youre standing right out here in broad daylight there could be cops any minute lets go rune stared at the woman it was emily and the car she was driving was the green pontiac that had tried to run her and the other witness down at mr kellys apartment wrong place wrong time phillipor haarteopened the back door of the pontiac he shoved rune inside tossed her purse and suitcase into the trunk haarte got into the backseat with rune where to emily asked better make it my place he answered calmly its the one with the basement quieter you know chapter twentyfour lost in a forest hansel and gretel rune stared at the ceiling and wondered what time it was thinking how fast shed lost track of the hours just like shed lost track of her life over the past few days it reminded her of the time she was a little girl visiting some relatives with her parents in rural ohio shed wandered away from a picnic in a small state forest strolling for hours through the park thinking she knew where she was going where her familys picnic bench was a little confused maybe but with a childs confidence and preoccupation never even considering that she was lost never knowing that hours had passed and she was miles away from her frantic family now she knew how lost she was and she knew too how impossible it was to get home again welcome to reality richard wouldve told her the room was tiny a storeroom in the cellar it had only one window a small one she couldnt possibly reach barred with twisty bars of wrought iron part of the concrete floor was missing the dirt beneath was overturned when haarte had shoved her into the room shed noticed that right away the dugup dirt she told herself it was just because he was doing some work down there replacing pipes putting in a new concrete floor but she knew it was a grave rune lay on her back and looked at the cold streetlight coming through the unreachable window backstreet light light to die by there was a sudden metallic snap and she jumped a shuffle of feet outside the door a second lock clicked and the door opened haarte stood in the doorway he was cautious he looked around the room maybe to see if shed rigged any traps or found any weapons then satisfied he nodded for her to follow tears of fear pricked in her eyes but she wouldnt let them fall he led her up some rickety stairs emilys attention was on her she was amused studying rune like a real estate agent appraising an apartment when rune hesitated outside the doorway haarte pushed her in emily didnt seem to like that but she didnt say anything no one spoke rune felt the tension in the air like the scene inside the bank in manhattan is my beat where the cop is staring down the robber his hand is out not moving saying over and over give me the pistol son give it to me the lighting shadowy and stark the camera moving in close on the muzzle of the would the robber shoot or wouldnt he you wanted to scream from the tension haarte pushed rune into a cheap diningroom chair stared down at her she whimpered feeling not the least bit adult but then from somewhere in her mind an image came an illustration from one of her fantasy books diarmuid then another king arthur she ripped his hand off her shoulder dont touch me she snarled he blinked rune waited a moment staring into his eyes then walked slowly to the chair she adjusted it so she was facing emily and sat down then said in a sly tough joan rivers voice can we talk emily blinked then laughed just what we had in mind haarte pulled up a chair and sat down too rune kept spinning the sole bracelet on her wrist slipping it on and off trying to be tough looking as hip and cynical as she could the silver ring spun she looked down and saw the hands clasped together she tried not to think about richard emily said we need to know who you told about spinello and about me rune snapped you killed robert kelly why emily looked at haarte he said you could say that it was his fault what he moved into the wrong apartment emily said we felt bad i mean it looks bad for us to make a mistake like that felt bad for him too of course rune exhaled in shock he was just you killed him by mistake haarte continued after spinello testified in the st louis rico cases in january the us marshals moved him to new york witness protection they gave him a new identityvictor symingtonand put him in a place uptown but well you saw he was pretty paranoid he didnt stay where theyd set him up and got the apartment down in the village he moved into apartment b but then he heard there was a bigger apartment available on the third floor so he moved upstairs your friend kelly moved into spinellos place the information we had from the people hiring us emily said was that the hit lived in b and i mean what can we say haarte reflected i checked the directory down in the lobby but it was so covered up with graffiti i couldnt read a fucking thing besides kelly and spinello looked a lot alike they didnt look a thing alike rune spat out well they did to me hey accidents happen rune asked then you came back and tore up his place just for the fun of it haarte looked insulted of course not we heard on the news that this robert kelly guyd been killed that wasnt the hits new name so we started to think wed hit the wrong man i mean you interrupted me during the job we didnt have time to verify it i checked out the place later and found a picture of kelly with his sister letters they looked legit rune remembered the torn picture haarte had probably lost his temper when hed realized his mistake then ripped up the photo in anger he continued witness relocation doesnt do that thorough a job faking old family pictures so i figured wed fucked up we had to make it right make it right rune thought when you came to the store rune said when you pretended to be that us marshal dixon you said you were part of the homicide team at mr kellys apartment fuck of course i wasnt there haarte laughed thats the trick to lying make the person youre lying to your partner in the lie i suggested i was there and you just assumed i was rune remembered mr kellys apartment looking through his books finding the clipping the heat and the stuffiness of the apartment the horrible bloodstained chair the torn photo rune closed her eyes she left overwhelmed with hopelessness her big adventureit was all because of a mistake there was no stolen bank loot robert kelly was just a bystandera weird old man who happened to like a bad movie so honey we need to know emily said impatiently whod you tell about me nobody boyfriends girlfriends youve had plenty of time to talk to people after you ran out of our little party at spinellos house in brooklyn you knew where spinello was all along rune asked and you were just using me of course emily said i just had to lead you there through the bank and the lawyer so thered be a trail the police could find the copsd see that you were tracking him down then theyd find him and your bodywe were going to make it look like he shot you after you shot him theyd have their perp end of investigation the policere like everybody else they prefer the least work possible once theyve found a killer they stop looking for anybody else on to other cases you know so come on whod you tell why would i say anything to anybody oh come on haarte said you see somebody killed right in front of you and you dont tell the police how could i my fingerprints were all over spinellos apartment i knew i was a suspect i figured out what you were doing no you didnt haarte said youre not that smart rune remained silent at least one thing was good rune thought they dont know about stephanie suddenly haarte leapt up from the chair grabbed runes hair and jerked her head back so far she couldnt breathe she was choking his face was close to hers see you think its better to live no matter what i do to you but it isnt the only way we could let you liveand we arent really inclined to kill youbut the only way wed let you live is if we make it so that you cant tell anybody about us pick us out of a lineup say he moved a finger slowly down toward her eye she closed the lid and a moment later felt increasing pain as he pressed hard on her eyeball no his fingers lifted off her face theres a lot we could do to you his hand massaged the back of her neck we could make you a vegetable he touched her breasts or a boy between her legs or he released her hair so quickly that she screamed emily looked on without emotion rune caught her breath please let me go i wont say anything its demeaning to beg emily said ill give you the million dollars she said what million haarte asked from that old movie thats bullshit oh emily said laughing your secret treasure i will i found it haarte asked cynically you did sure where do you think ive been for the past twentyfour hours after what happened in brooklyn you think im going to hang around town why didnt i just leave yesterday as soon as you killed spinello i didnt leave because i had a lead to the money haarte considered this rune thought he was genuinely intrigued rune hands together was kneading her one remaining silver bracelet its true i promise he shook his head no doesnt make sense mr kelly did have the money i found it its in a locker at the bus station that sounds like a scene out of a movie emily said slowly whatever it sounds like its true they were both sort of believing her now rune could tell rune fiddled with the bracelet again a million dollars haarte said to emily its old money how hard to move not that hard she said theyre always finding old bills banks have to take em and the good news is even if they took the serial numbers years ago nobodys gonna have the records anymore you know anybody who could take em a couple guys we could probably get seventy eighty points on the dollar but then haarte shook his head again no its crazy a million dollars rune repeated arent you getting tired of killing people for a living there was a pause haarte and emily avoided each others eyes the room was sepia gloomy lit by two dim lamps rune looked out the window outside it was very dark with only that one cold streetlight nearby she played nervously with her bracelet squeezing it haarte and emily whispered to each other their heads down emily finally nodded and looked up okay heres the deal you give us the names of everyone youve told about me and hand over the money well let you live you dont tell us ill let haarte here take you downstairs and do whatever he wants rune thought for a moment what will you do with them whoever i told haarte said nothing as long as there are no police after us but if there are then we might have to hurt them rune squeezed the bracelet again several times hard it snapped in half she looked up youre lying honey emily began thatsthe trick to lying make the person youre lying to your partner in the lie but thats all right rune said matteroffactly because i was too and leapt out of the chair chapter twentyfive emily laughed because rune might have run toward the front door of the town house or the rear or tried for a window but she didnt do either instead she rolled toward a small door in the living room rune emily said patiently what do you think youre doing thats a closet and a locked one at that rune learned tugging on the glass knob haarte looked at emily he shook his head at runes stupidity there was no way out shed boxed herself in rune glanced back at them and saw with relief that they didnt have a clue what she really had in mind until rune jumped for the electric outlet shed had her eye on for five minutes no emily shouted to haarte shes going to rune pushed the two ends of the broken bracelet into the socket thisbracelet mon she be important in your life very important dont be too fast to give her away there was a fierce white flash and a loud crack pure stinging fire poured through her thumb and finger the lights throughout the town house went out as the fuse popped from the short circuit she smelled the scorchedmeat scent of the burn on her finger and thumb instantly ignoring the pain she was on her feet and running emily and haarte blinded by the flash were groping toward the doorway rune whod had her eyes closed when the spark arced was already thirty feet ahead of them running cautiously crouched toward the front door her useless right arm cradled in her left hand she missed the two steps down from the hallway to the entry foyer and fell heavily forward her right arm shot out in front of her instinctively and she felt the searing pain as the burned hand broke her fall she couldnt stop the grunt of pain thereshes over there emily called ill get her rune climbed to her feet hearing the womans high heels clattering after her she couldnt see haarte anywhere maybe he was down in the basement changing the fuse rune leapt toward the front door chilled by panic from the thought of emily undoubtedly armed moving close behind her she reached for the top latch on the door then stopped stepped slowly stepped back against the wall no christ no there was a man outside she couldnt see clearly through the lacy curtains but she knew it had to be pretty boy haartes and emilys partner the halo of curly hair caught pale light from the street he seemed to be looking in the window wondering why the lights had gone off inside rune turned and started toward the back of the house slowly listening for emilys heels and haartes footsteps but there was no sound at all had they fled rune turned the corner and froze there only four or five feet away was emily who inched forward feeling her way along the wall holding a gun shed kicked off her shoes was silently barefoot rune pressed against the wall the womans head turned squinting into the gloom probably hearing runes shallow breathing she had a vague image of the womans silhouette lifting the gun pointing it toward rune shell hear my heart beating she has to hear that and that it may please thee to preserve all who are in danger by reason of their labor the silenced gun fired with a loud clicking pop there was a fierce slap as the bullet hit the plaster a foot away from runes head we beseech thee to hear us good lord another shot closer rune struggled with all her will to remain silent emily turned toward the front door runes groping fingers grabbed the closest thing she could finda heavy vase on a pedestal she raised it and flung it hard toward the woman it was a solid hit emily cried out in a high wail and fell to her knees the gun disappeared into the shadows the vase thudded unbroken onto the parquet i cant find the fuses haartes voice shouted from very near where the hell is she help me emily called haarte walked forward i cant see a fucking thing rune dodged out of his way there emily called beside you what haarte began and rune sprinted down the hallway heading toward where the back door should be yes there it was she could see it and it didnt look like anybody was outside she heard haartes voice in the front of the house calling to emily and rune knew then that it was going to be all right she could escape they were nowhere near her and rune had to spring only twenty feet or so to get to the back door she slammed the hallway door shut wedged a chair under the knob and kept running haarte got to the door in a few seconds and tried to open it but it was tightly blocked rune could see dim light coming through the lace curtains on the back door nothing could stop her now shed get outside into the alley run like hell call from the first phone she found haarte slammed into the door and pushed it open slightly but the chair still held fifteen feet ten another slam go around through the kitchen haarte called to emily but their voices were a world away rune was at the door she was safe she undid the chain turned the latch and then the knob she swung the door wide and stepped out onto the back porch and stopped cold oh no no more than two feet away from her was pretty boy he was startled but not so startled he didnt lift his pistol like a quickdraw gunslinger and point it directly at her face no no no she leaned back against the doorjamb tears streaming down her face arms limp shaking her head oh no its over its over but then something odd happened the sort of thing that happened in the side in the magic realm rune seemed to go out of her body she felt as if she died and rose away into the air actually wonderingdid he shoot me am i dead floating away completely numb sailing up into the air and from there from a cloud hovering over the side she looked down and saw pretty boy putting his arm around her and leading her away from the open back door of the town house handing her off to another man behind him a man in a blue jacket that said us marshal on the back and from there to another man wearing what looked like a bulletproof vest printed with the letters nypd passed along again until finally at the end of the line was detective manelli with his closetogether eyes with his funny first name virgil manelli the detective held a finger to his lips to keep rune quiet then led her away from the house she looked back at the line of men clustered around the door big men with stony faces wearing suits of thick blue armor and carrying stubby machine guns on the sidewalk manelli handed her off one last timeto two medics who put her on a cot and began hovering over her pouring ice water on her burnt hand and then wrapping it with bandages rune paid no attention she kept her eyes on the men around the back door then pretty boy said into a microphone on his collar subject is clear move in move in move in everyone on the stairs all the knights charged into the building shouting police police federal agents flashlights illuminated the interior of the town house rune heard a funny sound laughter she looked at the attendant but he wasnt laughing his partner wasnt either she realized that the sound was coming from her delicately one of the medics asked whats so funny but she didnt answer because from inside the town house came the sound of gunshots then calls of medic medic and the men in the ambulance left her while they ran toward the back door with their bags in hand their stethoscopes flapping around their necks chapter twentysix she huddled away from him from pretty boy i want to see something some identification they were sitting in the back of a newsmelling ford government issue manelli stood outside the nypd detective rubbed his mustache and said hes legit i want to see something rune snapped pretty boy offered her his badge and an id card she looked at the card three times before she actually read everything his name was salvatore pistone call me sal everybody does youre like an fbi agent you just insulted me im a us marshal he was smiling but his eyes were oddly cold thats what haarte said yeah i found his fake badge and id hes used that identity before frosts me how often people dont fucking bother to read id cards you had you woulda seen his was fake the medic stopped by the car soak that hand in betadine solution tonight before you go to bed tomorrow see your doctor you know what betadine is she had no idea she nodded yes then to manelli the man said guys dead sal scoffed i shot him three times in the head what the fuck else would he be yeah well its confirmed who rune asked haarte sal said yeah haarte the woman shell be okay manelli asked hell of a bruise on her back dont have a clue how she got that rune remembered the vase wish shed aimed for emilys head but aside from that shell be fine the bitchll definitely see the inside of a courtroom manelli straightened up all right miss im handing you over to the feds its their case now you shoulda listened to me and stayed out i he held up a finger to his lips shushing her again you shoulda listened he walked off to his own car he glanced at her with his closetogether eyes but they were expressionless he got inside started the engine and drove off other cars were leaving more of the nondescript sedans some city blueandwhite police cars and the small emergency service unit trucks the esu men and women like soldiers after a battle were taking off their vests and loading the guns back into their car trunks or the compartments of the trucks who was he samuel haarte sal replied professional hit man im so confused she watched sals face she decided there was something a little crazy about him indoctrinated like with the moonies she had this lovehate thing with detective manelli but she liked him sal scared her she killed victor symington rune told him emily did so she was going by the name emily any last name richter haarte usually worked with somebody named zane i always thought it was a guy but it must be her one fucking tough woman sal dug around in the back of the car found a thermos and sat back he poured some coffee into the lid and offered it to her black sweet she took it and sipped the coffee it was so strong it made her shiver sal drank directly from the thermos symingtoni mean spinellohed be alive if he hadnt panicked he shouldntve took off what happened rune asked he explained im with the witness protection program you know giving federal witnesses new identities spinello and another witness that guy in st louis i read about right arnold gittleman spinello and gittleman testified against some syndicate guys in the midwest but if they already testified why kill them sal laughed coldly at her naivete its called revenge sweetheart to send the message that nobody else better talk anyway spinello took offhe didnt trust us to keep his ass safe and moved down to the village on his own never told his handler about it i was part of the team in the hotel in st louis guarding gittleman his cold eyes grew sad for a splinter of a second not an emotion he was used to it seemed i went out to get some sandwiches and beer and those assholes got gittleman and my partners im sorry he shrugged off the sympathy so i went undercover to nail the pricks sal looked at the house and we sure as shit did looks like they were the only ones too we waited as long as we could here in case somebody else showed up but nobody did what do you mean you waited as long as you could he shrugged weve been cooling our heels outside here for five fucking hours five hours she shouted then it became clear i led you here i was bait sal considered this basically yeah you son of a bitch how longve you been following me you know that old blue van in front of your loft with all the tickets that was yours she asked dumbfounded sure whatd you come up in my loft for earlier today he frowned actually at that point we figured you were dead i was checking it out to see if your body was up there jesus maria she nodded to the door ripped into him with a sarcastic i hope when i escaped just now i didnt totally screw up your plans naw sal said sipping more coffee it was good it worked out the way it did they mtghfve used you as a hostage it waswhatta you sayconvenient you got away when you did convenient rune spat you used me just like emily did you followed me to brooklyn to find out where symington was and you followed me here to catch them now sal grew angry too listen for a week i thought you mightve been one of the hit team think about it we have a city police report that you were on the scene just after the kelly killing then when im staking out the site of the hitthat tenement on tenth streetyou go in then spinello runs outside and vanishes like you scared the crap out of him and then we had more reports that somebody who fits your descriptionexcept is about nine months pregnanthas broken into kellys apartment and ransacked the hell out of it that wasnt me rune protested it was them but you did break in the door was practically open hey im not after any b and e count im just telling you why i didnt walk up to you and introduce myself shit and when we figured out you were an innocent and i tried talking to you your friend the redhead just about breaks my nose and some fucking bodybuilder closes my throat up how were we supposed to know anyway yeah they found your prints all over spinellos safe house in brooklyn but we checked you out pretty good and you didnt seem like the sort that haarte or zaned hire i talked to manelli about you and we decided you were pretty much who you seemed to be just a kid in over her head im not a kid yeah i wouldnt take points on that one what the hell were you doing in this mess in the first place rune told him about mr kelly and the money and the movie a million dollars sal laughed gimme a break stick with lotto or numbers better odds sweetheart he nodded but yeah thats what manelli was thinkingthat kellys death was a mistake well whatever that womans going down its the prosecutors game now good thing weve got a star witness who rune asked then when he just gave her a wry look she said hey forget it no way theyll send another haarte after me hey not to worry sal said finishing the coffee the witness relocation program remember youll get a whole new identity you can be anybody you want you can even make up your own name sal frowned he must have been wondering why she was laughing well what do you think rune called she sat sidesaddle five feet off the ground on a huge armature that rose phallic and rusty from a complicated tangle of industrial machinery scrap they were surrounded by piles of pitted chrome and girders wire wrecks of trucks and turbines and gears richard walked around the corner fantastic the junkyard was off seventieth in commercial queens but it was oddly quiet they looked west at the huge slash of orange brilliance behind manhattan as the sun eased through strips of dark cloud you come here much he asked only for the sunsets the light hit the twisted metal and seemed to make the different shades of rust vibrate a thousand oil drums became beautiful spindles of twisted iron became filaments of light and coils of bx cable were glowing snakes rune said come on up she was wearing the spanish outfit once more richard climbed up next to her and they walked along the armature to a platform they had a magnificent view of the city on the platform was an old picnic basket a bottle of champagne too warm rune apologized cradling the bottle but it looks classy when theyd snuck through the fence a half hour ago richard had gazed at the dobermans uneasily and stood paralyzed when one sniffed his crotch but rune knew them well and scratched their smooth heads they wagged their stubby tails sniffing at the cold macaroniandcheese sandwiches rune had packed in the basket before prancing away on their springy legs rune and richard ate until dusk then she lit a kerosene lantern she lay back using the picnic basket as a pillow got another application to the new school she told him i kind of threw out the one you gave me you going to apply for real after a moment she asked i guess id have to take classes wouldnt i its an important part of going to school thats what i figured im not sure im going to do it though i have to tell you she snuck a furtive glimpse at his face see this guy at the video store frankie greek remember him anyway his sister just had a baby and she was a window designer and it turns out i can take her job while shes on leave only have to work halfdays leave me free to do other stuff what kind of stuff you know stuff stuff rune oh itd be a radical job very artistic in soho discounts for clothes slinky dresses lingerie youre hopeless you know that well to be totally honest i already took the job and threw out the other application too she stared at the two or three stars whose light was bright enough to penetrate the city haze i had to do it richard i had to i was worried that if i got a degree or anything id get to be like too literal we couldnt have that could we then the stars were blocked out completely as richard leaned over her bringing his mouth down slowly on hers she lifted her head to meet him they kissed for a long while rune astonished that she could be aroused by someone wearing a buttondown shirt and brooks brothers slacks very slow it was all very slow though not like slow motion in a film more like vignettes frame by frame the way youd hit a vcr pause button over and over again to watch a favorite scene the way shed watched manhattan is my beat freezeframe the cloth of his collar his smooth neck his paisley eyes the white bandage on her hand freezeframe his mouth we going to be safe he whispered sure rune whispered she reached into the pocket of her skirt and handed him the small crinkly square of plastic actually he said i meant because were twenty feet in the air dont worry rune whispered ill hold you real tight i wont let you fall freezeframe she wrapped her arms around him chapter twentyseven i dont howl in the loft sandra was putting explosive red polish on her toenails she continued sourly that was the deal remember i dont howl when im in bed with a guy and you clean up after yourself she nodded at the mess rune had made when she was frantically packing i have somebody over im quiet as a mouse he howls theres nothing i can do about it but me i ask you am i quiet or what youre quiet rune bent over and picked up clothes swept up the broken glass do i howl you dont howl so where were you last night sandra asked we went to a junkyard brother that boys got a way to go sandra glanced up from her artistic nails examined rune critically you look happy got lucky huh didnt your mother teach you not to pry no my mothers the one who taught me how to pry so you get lucky rune ignored her and repacked her clothes put the books back on the shelf she paused on the floor beside the bookcase was the shattered cassette of manhattan is my beat rune picked it up the loops of opaque tape hung out of the broken plastic reels she looked at it for a moment she was thinking of robert kelly of the movie about the million dollars of bank loot that was never really therenever there for her to find anyway she tossed the cassette into the trash bin then glanced at sandras side of the loft she picked up the goodbye note shed written to her roommate it was unopened dont you read your mail she asked the woman glanced at it whatsit a love note from me whats it say nothing rune threw it out too then she flopped down on her pillows staring into the blueandwhite sky she remembered the clouds in new jersey floating over the trimmed grounds of the nursing home as she crouched next to raoul elliotts wheelchair theyd seemed like dragons and giants then the clouds she stared at them for a long time now after the horror of the last few days she expected them to look merely like clouds but no they still seemed like dragons and giants the more things change the more they stay the same an expression of her fathers she thought about the old screenwriter raoul elliott next week shed go out and visit him again bring him another flower and maybe a book she could read to him stories are the best hed said rune agreed with him there five minutes later sandra said shit i forget some geek from that place you work or used to work the video store looked like a heavymetal wannabe frankie dont know maybe he came by with a couple of messages she read a slip of paper one was from this amanda leclerc he said he couldnt understand her too good shes like foreign and he was saying if they come to this country why dont they learn to speaka the language the point sandra so this amanda person she called and said shed heard from this priest or minister or somebody in brooklyn sandra juggling the nail polish smoothed the wrinkled note rune sat up a minister sandra was struggling to read like im really not programmed to be a message center you know yeah okay i got it she said she talked to this minister and hes got this suitcase it was somebodys named robert kellys a suitcase and he doesnt know what to do with it the minister but he said its like very important rune screamed yes she rolled on her back and her legs straight up in the air kicked back and forth whoa take a pill or something sandra handed her the message she read it st xaviers church on atlantic avenue brooklyn oh and heres the other one she found another slip in her purse it was from stephanie she was out of the hospital and feeling a lot better shed stop by later all right rune cried im glad somebodys happy sandra added im depressed not that anybody cares she continued to paint her nails carefully ive got to call richard were taking a trip where brooklyn old folks homes junkyards why am i not surprised hey dont hug me watch the polish rune got richard at home this was weird it was the afternoon what was he doing home she realized that he hadnt told her exactly where he wrote his boring meetyourceo scripts rune was on the street calling from the pay phone hey how come youre home i thought you worked for a company with whats her name tootall karen he laughed again i do mostly freelance im sort of an independent contractor we need to go to brooklyn a church on atlantic avenue can you drive he said youre home now im in my office office he asked my exterior office oh he laughed a pay phone so can we go whats going on in brooklyn she told him about the ministers message then added i just called himthe priest amanda found i sort of told him a white lie which was that im robert kellys granddaughter thats not a white lie its a fullfledged lie especially to a man of the cloth you oughta be ashamed anyway i thought you were going to forget about the money i did forgot completely it was him called me she persisted said that mr kellyd been living in a home attached to the church until he found an apartment and that hed left a suitcase with the minister for safekeeping he didnt want to carry it around until he was settled it wasare you listening he said it was too valuable to him to just carry around the streets of the city another pause its too crazy richard said she added and get this i asked him if there was a cemetery nearbylike in the movie manhattan is my beat see dana mitchell the cop buries the money in a new grave and there is is what a cemetery next to the church dont you see mr elliott told mr kelly about the church and mr kelly went there and dug up the money okay he said dubiously then he asked youre at your loft will be in five minutes he said seductively you going to be by yourself sandras there bummer cant you send her out to buy something how bout we go to brooklyn now then well think about some privacy im on my way rune reached the stop of the stairs in her loft and stopped stephanie the redhead smiled wanly she sat in runes half of the loft on a pile of pillows she was palepaler than usualand she wore a scarf that partially covered a bruise on her neck there was also large bandage on her temple and an eggplantcolored mark on her cheek ohmygod rune blurted out examining her you do bruise dont you she hugged the woman carefully you look well i look awful you can say it not for somebody who got run over by a cab hey theres a compliment for you there was dense silence for a moment i dont know what to say steph rune was nervous and she did busywork straightening up clothes i got you involved in this whole thing i almost got you killed and it was so stupidwe were running from a federal marshal a what stephanie gave a laugh that guy in the subway the one you hiti thought he was working for them but it turned out he was a us marshal isnt that radical just like the texas rangers she told stephanie about haarte and emily i heard something about it on the news in the hospital stephanie said a shooting at this town house i never guessed you were involved runes eyes were excited again oh oh and talk about adventures they want me to be the star witness isnt that scary sure but i dont care i want that bitch to go away for a long time they killed mr kelly and they tried to kill meand you too well im pretty sure therell be plenty of cops to look out for you rune wandered to the bookcase replaced some of the books shed packed to take home i called the video store they told me you quit that tony stephanie said what an asshole i couldnt deal with himnot the way he treated you rune grinned coyly so you want a hundred thousand dollars what rune told her about the minister little red hen remember you believed in me if there really is any money youll get some of it stephanie laughed you think there is im not sure but you know me optimist stephanie supplied you got it i plop rune cocked her head she heard the sound again a drip soft plop she glanced at where it was coming fromsandras side of the apartment you dont really have to give me anything rune i know i dont have to but i want to plop plop damn sandrad spilled her nail polish there was a big red stain on the floor jesus sandra rune turned the corner and stopped there was her roommate in her thick white bra and black panty hose eyes staring at the apex of the glass ceiling she lay on her futon the bullet hole in her chest was a tiny dark dot the stain wasnt nail polish it was the blood that was trickling down her arm and onto the floor stephanie stood up and pointed the gun at rune she said come on back over here love lets have a little talk chapter twentyeight youre haartes partner rune whispered she nodded my names lucy zane the woman said coldly haarte and i worked together for three years he was the best partner i ever had and hes dead thanks to you then whos emily just backup we use her sometimes for jobs on the east coast rune sitting down on the cushions shaking her head everything floating in front of hera big soup richard the money pretty boy emily and haarte robert kelly she felt the slamming of her heart in her chest as the hopelessness arose again and she lowered her face into her hands whispering oh no oh no she was too numb for tears not even looking up she said but your job at the video store howd you get the job how do you think i fucked tony i hope it was disgusting rune spat out was but it didnt last long a minute or two but you were my friend you helped me get the clothes why whyd you do that got close to you so we could set you up haarte and killed two us marshals in st louis that put a lot of heat on us and we fucked up the spinello hit in the village so we needed a fall guy well fall girl you got elected almost worked too too bad the cab had good brakes rune said coldly were lucky sometimes even people like me rune shook with anger and fear stephanie continued heard from emily the judge denied her bail request but she said to say hello she hopes you and id have a nice visit and i think we will now theres one thing ive got to know did you tell the cops or marshals anything about me a click and a grind sounded behind them runes eyes flashed for a second richard stephanie glanced at the sound then turned back to rune tell me she said and ill let you go bullshit rune scrabbled away into the cushions as if theyd protect her from the black gun ill let you go the woman said i promise im the only witness how can you let me go you have to kill me she looked at the clouds outside the loft the dragons the giants the trolls marching past miles high not caring a bit for what was going on down on earth the grinding started again the elevator was coming up you mustve told them about me after the accident did the marshal i hit in the subway think i was part of did you tell them my name its not real no but ive used it before i can be traced through it chains clinking chains and the grind of metal on metal another loud click a scrape whos coming to visit rune i dont know stephanie glanced at the stairway then back at rune she said so what do you have in your hand rune couldnt believe that the woman had seen her oh she was good she was very good show me stephanie persisted rune hesitated then held up her hand and slowly opened the bandaged fingers the piece of stone from the union bank building my souvenir the one i picked up when you were with me that day down in wall street now what were you going to do with it throw it at you rune responded smash your goddamn face why dont you just toss it over there lucy zane held the silenced gun very steadily on runes chest rune pitched the stone away just as richard climbed the stairs and said hi he froze seeing the gun in stephanies hand what is this stephanie waved him in okay just stand there she backed up so that she could keep them both covered she held the gun out straight it was small and its black metal gleamed in the sunlight the short cylinder of the silencer was dark too her voice now had an edge to it i dont have much time whod you tell about me rune and what did you tell them i want to know and i mean now let him go richard said what the hell is this are you two joking stephanies left hand went out toward him palm up the nails were done in careful purplepink shut up asshole just shut up to rune what did you tell them god richard whispered looking at rune rune sank back into the cushions put her hands over her eyes sobbing no no i dont give a shit about you or emily or anybody i wont testify ill tell them it wasnt emily or you mr kellys dead spinellos dead just leave us alone stephanie said patiently maybe ill consider that you have to understand rune i like you i really do youre charming and i was really touched you were going to give me some of that ridiculous money that almost choked me up but you have to tell me thiss just business all right i didnt tell anybody anything about you i dont believe you its true all i did was write about you in my diary i mentioned you and emily she sat back hand in her lap small defeated i thought you were my friend i described you and wrote how nice you were to help me buy some clothes if this choked her up too stephanies expression didnt show it where is it the woman asked the diary let me have it and ill let you go both of you promise i promise rune debated then walked to her suitcase rummaged through it i cant find it she looked up frowning i thought i packed it she opened her leopardskin bag looked through that too i dont know i oh there it is on the bookcase the second shelf stephanie eased over to the bookcase touched a notebook this one no the one next to it on its side stephanie pulled the book off the shelf and flipped it open where do you mention an explosion the first bullet broke a huge chunk out of the bluesky wall and sent fragments of cinder block raining through the room the second shattered a panel of glass in the ceiling the third tore apart a dozen books which pitched through the air like shot birds the fourth caught stephanie squarely in the chest as she was turning shocked mouth open toward rune there may even have been a fifth shot and a sixth rune wasnt sure she had no idea how many times she pulled the trigger of the gunthe one that rune had pulled from the accordion folder shed thrown away earliertossed into the trash can beside her bed all rune saw was the smoke and dust and paper flecks and clouds and blue sky of concrete and broken glass flying through the loft around stephaniebeautiful pale stephanie who spiraled to the floor and all rune heard was a huge ringing roar from the gun which after a few seconds as richard scrambled from the floor and started toward her was replaced by an animals mad screaming she didnt even know was coming from her chapter twentynine head bowed at the altar rune was motionless kneeling shed thought she could remember all the words but they wouldnt come to her and all she could do was repeat over and over again in a mumbling whisper we yield thee praise and thanksgiving for our deliverance from those great and apparent dangers wherewith we were compassed after a moment she stood and walked slowly up the aisle toward the back of the sanctuary still whispering she said to the man wearing black ministers robes this is a totally radical church reverend thank you miss kelly at the door she turned and curtsied awkwardly toward the altar the minister of st xaviers glanced at her curiously maybe curtsyingwhich rune had just seen a character do in some old mafia moviewas only for catholics but so what she decided stephanie was right about one thing short of devil worship and animal sacrifices ministers and priests probably arent all that sensitive about technicalities they left the sanctuary your grandfather didnt mention any children when he stayed with us in our residence he said his only relative was his sister but shed died a few years ago really she asked but then the minister continued he didnt talk much about himself he was a bit mysterious in some ways mysterious yep she said after a moment that was grandfather we used to say that about him wasnt grandfather quiet all of us would say it all of you i thought you said there were just two of you you and your sister oh well i mean all the kids in the neighborhood he was like a grandfather to them too watch it rune told herself its a minister youre lying to and a minister with a good memory she followed the man through the rectory building filled with dark wood wrought iron the small yellow lights added a lot of churchy atmosphere to the place though maybe they used smallwattage bulbs just to save money it was very well religious here rune tried to remember a good movie shed seen about religion and couldnt think of one they tended not to have happy endings they walked into a large dormitory newer than the church though the architecture was the samestained glass arches flowery carvings she looked around it was some kind of residence hall for senior citizens rune glanced into a room as they passed two beds yellow walls mismatched dressers lots of pictures on the walls homier than youd think there were two elderly men inside the room as she paused looking in one of the men stood up and said i am a very foolish fond old man fourscore and upward not an hour more or less and to deal plainly i fear i am not in my perfect mind ill say youre not in perfect mind his friend chided youve got it all wrong oh you think you can do better listen to this his voice faded as rune and the minister continued down the corridor how long was grandfather here rune asked only four five weeks he needed a place to stay until he found an apartment a friend sent him here raoul elliott runes heart thudded harder yes you know mr elliott weve met once so elliott had been confused he hadnt sent mr kelly to the florence hotel but hereto the church maybe mr kelly was staying in the florence when he visited the screenwriter and the poor mans mind just confused them wonderful man the priest continued oh hes been very generous to us here at the church and not only materially he served on our board too until he got sick a shame whats happened to him isnt it that alzheimers the minister shook his head then continued but we have so few rooms robert didnt want to monopolize onehe wanted to make it available for somebody less fortunate so he moved into the hotel florence for a while he left the suitcase here said hed pick it up when he moved into a safer place he was worried about breakins he said the bag was too important to risk getting stolen rune nodded nonchalantly thinking one million dollars she followed him to a storage room the minister unlocked the door with keys on a janitors selfwinding coil rune asked did grandfather spend much time in the church itself the minister disappeared into the storage room rune heard the sound of boxes sliding along the floor he called no not much how about the grounds the cemetery did he spend much time there the cemetery i dont know he might have rune was thinking of the scene in manhattan is my beat where the cop his life ruined was lying in his prison cell dreaming about reclaiming his stolen million dollars buried in a cemetery she remembered the closeup of the actors eyes as he wakened and realized that it had just been a dreamthe blackness of the dirt hed been digging up with his fingers becoming the shadows of the bars across his hands as he woke the minister emerged with a suitcase he set it on the floor here you go rune asked you want me to sign a receipt or anything i dont think thatll be necessary no rune picked it up it was as heavy as an old leather suitcase containing a million dollars ought to be she listed against the weight the minister smiled and took the case from her he lifted it easily and motioned her toward the side door she walked ahead of him he said your grandfather told me to be careful with this he said it had his whole life in it rune glanced at the suitcase her palms were moist funny what people consider their whole life isnt it i feel sorry for people who can carry their homes around with them thats one of the reasons the church has this residence home you really feel god at work here they walked to his small office he bent over the cluttered desk and sorted through a thick stack of envelopes he said i wished robert had stayed longer i liked him a lot but then he was independent he wanted to live on his own rune decided that she was going to give the church some money fifty thousand she decided then on a whim upped the ante to a hundred gs he handed her a thick envelope addressed to mr bobby kelly oh i forgot to mention this came for him care of the church a day or so ago before i got around to forwarding it i heard that hed been killed rune stuffed it under her arm outside he set the suitcase on the sidewalk for her again my sympathies to your family if theres anything i can do for you please call me thank you reverend she said thinking you just earned yourself two hundred thousand little red hen rune picked up the suitcase walked to the car richard eyed the bag curiously she handed it to him then patted the hood of his dodge he lifted the bag and rested it on the car they were on a quiet side street but heavy traffic swept past at the corner superstitiously they both refused to look at the scuffed leather bag they gazed at the singlestory shopsa rug dealer a hardware store a pizza place a deli the trees the traffic the sky neither touched the suitcase neither said anything like knights who think theyve found the grail and arent sure they want to because it would mean the end of their quest the end of the story time to close the book to go to bed and wake up for work the next morning richard broke the silence i didnt even think thered be a suitcase rune stared at the patterns of the stains on the leather the elastic bands from a dozen old airline claim checks looped through the handles i had some moments myself she admitted she touched the latches then stepped back i cant do it richard took over its probably locked he pressed the buttons they clicked open wheel of fortune rune said richard lifted the lid magazines the holy grail was magazines and newspapers all from the s time newsweek colliers rune grabbed several shuffled through them no bills fluttered out a million aint going to be hidden inside of time richard pointed out his whole life rune whispered mr kelly told the minister his whole life was in here she dug to the bottom maybe he put the money into shares of standard oil or something maybe theres a stock certificate but no all the suitcase contained was newspapers and magazines when shed gone over every inch of it pulled up the cloth lining felt along the moldy seams her shoulders slumped and she shook her head why she mused whatd he keep these for richard was flipping through several of them he was frowning weird theyre all from about the same time june the laughter startled her it was so abrupt she looked at richard who was shaking his head what he couldnt stop laughing what is it finally he caught his breath his eyes were squinting as he read a thumbeddown page oh rune oh no she grabbed the magazine an article was circled in blue ink she read the paragraph richard pointed at excellent in his role is young robert kelly hailing from the midwest who had no intention of acting in films until director hal reinhart spotted him in a crowd and offered him a part playing dana mitchells younger brother who tries unsuccessfully to talk the tormented cop into turning in the illgotten loot kelly displays striking talent for a man whose only experience onstage has been a handful of uso shows during the war moviegoers will be watching this young man carefully to see if he will be the next member of the great hollywood dream the unknown catapulted to stardom they looked through the rest of the magazines in one manhattan is my beat was reviewed and in each robert kelly was mentioned at least several times most gave him kind reviews and forecast a long career for him rune too laughed she closed the suitcase and leaned against the car so thats what he meant by his whole life he told me the movie was the high point of his life he must never have gotten any other parts stuffed in one of the magazines was a copy of a letter written to mr kelly from the screen actors guild it was dated five years before she read it out loud dear mr kelly thank you for your letter of last month as a contract player you would indeed be entitled to residual payments for your performance in the film manhattan is my beat however we understand from the studio which is the current owner of the copyright to the film that there are no plans for its release on videotape at this time if and when the film is released you will be entitled to your residuals as per the contract rune put the letter back when he told me he was going to be richwhen his ship came inthats what he meant it had nothing to do with the bank robbery money poor guy richard said hed probably be getting a check for a couple hundred bucks he looked up and pointed behind her look the sign on the dormitory read st xaviers home for actors and actresses thats what he was doing here it had nothing to do with the money kelly just needed a place to stay richard pitched the suitcase into the backseat what do you want to do with them she shrugged ill give them to amanda i think theyd mean something to her ill make a copy of the best review for me put it up on my wall they climbed into the car richard said it would have corrupted you you know what the money just like the cop in manhattan is my beat you know the expression tower tends to corrupt absolute power corrupts absolutely of course ive never heard of it she thought but told him oh sure wasnt that another one of stallones he looked at her blankly for a moment then said well translated to capitalistic terms the same truth holds the absoluteness of that much money would have affected your core values mr weird was backthough this time in gap camouflage rune thought about it for a minute no way aladdin didnt get corrupted the guy with the lamp you trying to make a rational argument by citing a fairy tale she said yeah i am well what about aladdin he wished for wealth and a beautiful princess to be his bride and the genie gave him all that but people dont know the end of the story eventually he became the sultans heir and finally got to be sultan himself and it was watergate he got turned into a camel nope he was a popular and fair leader oh and radically rich so fairy tales may not always have happy endings he said like a professor but sometimes they do just like life richard seemed to be trying to think about arguing but couldnt come up with anything he shrugged just like life he conceded as they drove through the streets of brooklyn rune slouched in the seat put her feet on the dash so thatfs why he rented the film so often it was his big moment of glory thats pretty bizarre richard said i dont think so she told him a lot of people dont even have a big moment and if they do it probably doesnt get put out on video ill tell youif i got a part in a movie id dupe a freezeframe of me and put it up on my wall he punched her playfully on the arm what well you saw the film what ten times didnt you see his name on the credits he had just a bit part he wasnt in the abovethetitle credits the what thats what they call the opening credits and the copy we watched was the bootleg i didnt bother to copy the cast credits at the end when i made it speaking of names are you ever going to tell me your real name ludmilla youre kidding rune didnt say anything you are kidding he said warily im just trying to think up a good name for somebody whod do window displays in soho i think yvonne would be good what do you think its as good as anything she looked at the bulky envelope the minister had given her the return address was the bon aire nursing home in berkeley heights new jersey whats that something mr elliott sent to mr kelly at the church she opened the envelope inside was a letter taped to another thick envelope on which was printed in old uneven type manhattan is my beat draft script oh look a souvenir rune read the letter out loud dear mr kelly you dont remember me im sure im the nurse on the floor where mr raoul elliotts room is he asked me to write to you and asked if you could forward the package im enclosing here to the young girl who came to visit him the other day he was a little confused as to who she wasmaybe she is your daughter or probably your granddaughterbut if you could forward it wed be most appreciative mr elliot has mentioned several times how nice it was for her to come visit and talk about movies and i can tell you her visit had a very good effect on him he put the flower she brought him by his bedside and a couple times he even remembered who gave it to him which is pretty good for him yesterday he got this from his storage locker and asked me to send it to her thank her for making him happy all best wishes joan gilford rn richard driving through commercial brooklyn said what a great old guy that was sweet rune said i think im going to cry she tore open the envelope richard stopped for a red light you know maybe you can sell it i heard that an original draft of somebodys playnoel coward i thinkwent for four or five thousand at sothebys what do you think this oned be worth the light changed and the car pulled forward rune didnt answer right away but after a moment said so far its up to two hundred and thirty thousand what he asked smiling uncertainly and counting richard glanced over at rune then skidded the car to a stop in runes lap were bundles of money stacks of wrapped bills they were larger than modern federal reserve notes the ink was darker the seals on the front were in midnightblue ink the paper wrappers around the stacks were stenciled
