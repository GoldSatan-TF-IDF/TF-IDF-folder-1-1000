was introduced in a novel called roman blood first published in over the course of the eight subsequent novels and eighteen short stories of the roma sub rosa series gordianus has progressed from the age of thirty to the age of sixtyone his concubine bethesda has become his wife and his family has expanded to include a daughter two adopted sons one born a slave and four grandchildren a typically roman extended family as the classicist mary beard commented in the times literary supplement he has tubbed elbows with the most famous men and women of his time including caesar cicero marc antony pompey crassus and cleopatra he has taken part usually behind the scenes in many of the most important events of his era witnessing the final decades of the roman republic as it disintegrates into the civil wars that ultimately will give rise to the empire of the caesars through it all gordianuss adventures and investigations have been followed by readers in fifteen languages and a fair number of these readers thanks to the invention of email have seen fit to contact his creator with comments questions words of encouragement and notification of the occasional typographical error the first nine short stories about gordianus all of which take place in the eightyear period between the first two novels roman blood and arms of nemesis were assembled in a collection titled the house of the vestals since that book was published nine more short stories have been written readers will find them collected in these pages like the stories in the house of the vestals all these tales take place

more details in the historical notes at the end of the book preface the setting of most of the stories is the teeming beautiful endlessly fascinating endlessly wicked city of rome but gordianuss investigations also take him to spain sicily the bay of naples and across the breadth of italy the stories are presented in chronological order at the back of the book readers will find a detailed chronology which incorporates all the short stories and novels along with some notes on historical sources why roma sub rosa for the collective series title of the gordianus novels and stories in ancient egypt the rose was the emblem of the god horus later regarded by the greeks and romans as the god of silence customarily a rose hanging over a council table indicated that all present were sworn to secrecy sub rosa literally under the rose has come to mean that which is carried out in secret thus roma sub rosa a history of romes secrets or a secret history of rome as seen through the eyes of gordianus the consuls wife honestly muttered lucius claudius his nose buried in a scroll if you go by these accounts in the daily acts youd think sertorius was a naughty schoolboy and his rebellion in spain a harmless prank when will the consuls realize the gravity of the situation when will they take action i cleared my throat lucius claudius lowered the little scroll and raised his bushy red eyebrows gordianus by hercules you got here in a hurry take a seat i looked about for a chair then remembered where i was in the garden of lucius claudius visitors did not fetch furniture visitors sat and a chair would be slipped beneath them i stepped into the spot of sunlight where lucius sat basking and folded my knees sure enough a chair caught my weight i never even saw the attendant slave something to drink gordianus i myself am enjoying a cup of hot broth too early in the day for wine even watered noon is hardly early lucius not for those of us whove been up since dawn since dawn lucius grimaced at such a distasteful notion a cup of wine for you then and some nibbles i raised my hand to wave away the offer and found it filled with a silver cup into which a pretty slavegirl poured a stream of falernian wine a little tripod table appeared at my left hand bearing a silver platter embossed with images of dancing nymphs and strewn with olives dates and almonds care for a bit of the daily im finished with the sporting news lucius nodded toward a clutter of little scrolls on the table beside him they say the whites have finally got their act together this season new chariots new horses should give the reds a run for the prizes in tomorrows races i laughed out loud what a life you lead lucius claudius up at noon then lolling about your garden reading your own private copy of the daily acts lucius raised an eyebrow merely sensible if you ask me who wants to elbow through a crowd in the forum squinting and peering past strangers to read the daily on the posting boards or worse listen to some clown read the items out loud inserting his own witty comments but thats the whole point of the daily i argued its a social activity people take a break from the hustle and bustle of the forum gather round the posting boards and discuss whatever items interest them mostwar news marriages and births chariot races curious omens its the highlight of many a mans day perusing the daily and arguing politics or horses with fellow citizens one of the cosmopolitan pleasures of city life lucius shuddered no thank you my way is better i send a couple of slaves down to the forum an hour before posting time as soon as the daily goes up one of them reads it aloud from beginning to end and the other takes dictation with a stylus on wax tablets then they hurry home transcribe the words to parchment and by the time im up and about my private copy of the daily is here waiting for me in the garden the ink still drying in the sun a comfy chair a sunny spot a hearty cup of broth and my own copy of the daily actsi tell you gordianus theres no more civilized way to start the day i popped an almond into my mouth it all seems rather antisocial to me not to mention extravagant the cost of parchment alone squinting at wax tablets gives me eyestrain lucius sipped his broth anyway i didnt ask you here to critique my personal pleasures gordianus theres something in the daily that i want you to see what the news about that rebellious roman general terrorizing spain quintus sertorius lucius shifted his considerable bulk hell soon have the whole iberian peninsula under his control the natives there hate rome but they adore sertorius what can our two consuls be thinking failing to bring military assistance to the provincial government decimus brutus much as i love the old bookworm is no fighter ill grant you hard to imagine him leading an expedition but his fellow consul lepidus is a military veteran fought for sulla in the civil war how can those two sit idly on their behinds while sertorius creates a private kingdom for himself in spain all thats in the daily acts i asked of course not lucius snorted nothing but the official government line situation under control no cause for alarm youll find more details about the obscene earnings of charioteers than youll find about spain what else can you expect the daily is a state organ put out by the government deci probably dictates every word of the war news himself deci decimus brutus of course the consul with his ancient patrician connections lucius tended to be on a firstname basis sometimes on a petname basis with just about everybody in power but you distract me gordianus i didnt ask you here to talk about sertorius decimus brutus yes sertorius no here have a look at this his bejeweled hand flitted over the pile and plucked a scroll for me to read society gossip i scanned the items as son engaged to bs daughter c plays host to d at his country villa e shares her famous family recipe for egg custard dating back to the days when romulus suckled the shewolf i grunted all very interesting but i dont see lucius leaned forward and tapped at the scroll read that part aloud the bookworm pokes his head outside tomorrow easy prey for the sparrow but partridges go hungry brighteyed sappho says be suspicious a dagger strikes faster than lightning better yet an arrow let venus conquer all lucius sat back and crossed his fleshy arms what do you make of it i believe its called a blind item a bit of gossip conveyed in code no proper names only clues that are meaningless to the uninitiated given the mention of venus i imagine this particular item is about some illicit love affair i doubt id know the names involved even if they were clearly spelled out youd be more likely than i to know what all this means lucius indeed im afraid i do know at least in part thats why i called you here today gordianus i have a dear friend who needs your help i raised an eyebrow luciuss rich and powerful connections had yielded me lucrative work before they had also put me in great danger what friend would that be lucius he raised a finger the slaves around us silently withdrew into the house discretion gordianus discretion read the item again the bookworm and whom did i call a bookworm only a moment ago i blinked decimus brutus the consul lucius nodded read on the bookworm pokes his head outside tomorrow deci will venture to the circus maximus tomorrow to watch the races from the consular box easy prey for the sparrow draw your own conclusion from thatespecially with the mention of daggers and arrows later on i raised an eyebrow you think theres a plot against the consuls life based on a blind item in the daily acts it seems farfetched lucius its not what i think its what deci himself thinks the poor fellows in a state came to my house and roused me out of bed an hour ago desperate for advice he needs someone to get to the bottom of this quietly and quickly i told him i knew just the man gordianus the finder me i scowled at an olive pit between my forefinger and thumb since the daily is a state organ surely decimus brutus himself as consul is in the best position to determine where this item came from and what it really means to start who wrote it thats precisely the problem i dont understand do you see the part about sappho and her advice yes gordianus who do you think writes and edits the daily acts i shrugged i never thought about it then i shall tell you the consuls themselves dictate the items about politics and foreign policy giving their own official viewpoint the drier partstrade figures livestock counts and suchare compiled by clerks in the censors office sporting news comes from the magistrates in charge of the circus maximus augurs edit the stories that come in about weird lightning flashes comets curiously shaped vegetables and other omens but who do you think oversees the society newsweddings and birth announcements social engagements blind items as you call them a woman named sappho a reference to the poet of ancient lesbos the consuls wife is something of a poet herself the wife of decimus brutus she wrote that item lucius leaned forward and lowered his voice deci thinks she means to kill him gordianus my wife the consul cleared his throat noisily he brushed a hand nervously through his silvery hair and paced back and forth across the large study from one pigeonhole bookcase to another his fingers idly brushing the little title tags that hung from the scrolls outside the library at alexandria i had never seen so many books in one place not even in ciceros house the consuls house was near the forum only a short walk from that of lucius claudius i had been admitted at once thanks to lucius my visit was expected decimus brutus dismissed a cadre of secretaries and ushered me into his private study he dispensed with formalities his agitation was obvious my wife he cleared his throat again decimus brutus highest magistrate in the land used to giving campaign speeches in the forum and orations in the courts seemed unable to begin shes certainly beautiful i said gazing at the portrait that graced one of the few spaces on the wall not covered by bookcases it was a small picture done in encaustic wax on wood yet it dominated the room a young woman of remarkable beauty gazed out from the picture strings of pearls adorned the masses of auburn hair done up with pearlcapped pins atop her head more pearls hung from her ears and around her throat the chaste simplicity of her jewelry contrasted with a glint in her green eyes that was challenging aloof almost predatory decimus brutus stepped closer to the painting he lifted his chin and squinted drawing so close that his nose practically brushed the wax beautiful yes he murmured the artist didnt capture even a fraction of her beauty i married her for it for that and to have a son sempronia gave me both her beauty and a baby boy and do you know why she married me the consul stepped disconcertingly close and peered at me with another man i would have taken such proximate scrutiny as an intimidation but the myopic consul was merely straining to read my expression he sighed sempronia married me for my books i know it sounds absurda woman who readsbut there it is she didnt assent to the marriage until she saw this room and that made up her mind shes read every volume heremore than i have she even writes a bit herselfpoetry and such her verses are too passionate for my taste he cleared his throat again sempronia you see is not like other women sometimes i think the gods gave her the soul of a man she reads like a man she converses like a man she has her own motley circle of friendspoets playwrights dubious women when sempronia has them over the witticisms roll off her tongue she even appears to think she has opinions anyway opinions on everythingart racing architecture even politics and she has no shame in the company of her little circle she plays the lutebetter than our besttrained slave i have to admit and she dances for them he grimaced i told her such behavior was indecent completely unsuitable for a consuls wife she says that when she dances the gods and goddesses speak through her body and her friends understand what they see even if i dont weve had so many rows ive almost given up rowing about it he sighed ill give her this shes not a bad mother sempronia has done a good job raising little decimus and despite her youth her performance of official duties as consuls wife has been impeccable nor has she shamed me publicly shes kept her eccentricities confined to this house but he seemed to run dry his chin dropped to his chest one of her duties i prompted him is to oversee society news in the daily acts is it not he nodded he squinted for a moment at sempronias portrait then turned his back to it lucius explained to you the cause for my concern only in the most discreet fashion then i shall be explicit understand finder the subject is acutely embarrassing lucius tells me you can keep your mouth shut if im wrong if my suspicions are unfounded i cant have news of my foolishness spread all over the forum and if im rightif what i suspect is truei can afford the scandal even less i understand consul he stepped very close peered at my face and seemed satisfied well then where to begin with that damned charioteer i suppose a charioteer diocles youve heard of him i nodded he races for the reds i wouldnt know i dont follow the sport but im told that diocles is quite famous and rich richer even than roscius the actor scandalous that racers and actors should be wealthier than senators nowadays our ancestors would be appalled i doubted that my own ancestors would be quite as upset as those of decimus brutus but i nodded and tried to bring him back to the subject this diocles one of my wifes circle of friends only closer than a friend a suspicion consul or do you have sure knowledge i have eyes in my head he seemed to realize the irony of claiming his feeble eyesight as reliable witness and sighed i never caught them in the act if thats what you mean i have no proof but every time she had her circle in this house lolling about on couches and reciting to each other the two of them seemed always to end up in a corner by themselves whispering laughing he ground his jaw i wont be made a fool of allowing my wife to sport with her lover under my own roof i grew so furious the last time he was here i i made a scene i chased them all out and i told sempronia that diocles was never again to enter this house when she protested i commanded her never to speak with him again im her husband its my right to say with whom she can and cannot consort sempronia knows that why could she not simply defer to my will instead she had to argue she badgered me like a harpyi never heard such language from a woman all the more evidence if i needed any that her relationship with that man was beyond decency in the end i banned her entire circle of friends and i ordered sempronia not to leave the house even for official obligations when her duties call she simply has to say the consuls wife regrets that illness prevents her its been like that for almost a month now the tension in this house but she does has one official duty left yes her dictation of society items for the daily acts she neednt leave the house for that senators wives come callingrespectable visitors are still welcomeand they give her all the tidbits she needs if you ask me the society section is terribly tedious even more so than the sporting news i give it no more than a quick glance to see if family are mentioned and their names spelled correctly sempronia knows that thats why she thought she could send her little message to diocles through the daily acts undetected he glanced at the portrait and worked his jaw back and forth it was the word bookworm that caught my eye when we were first married that was the pet name she gave me my old bookworm i suppose she calls me that behind my back now laughing and joking with the likes of that charioteer and sappho her friends call her that sometimes why do you assume the blind item is addressed to diocles despite my lack of interest in racing i do know a thing or two about that particular charioteermore than i care to the name of his lead horse is sparrow how does the message start the bookworm pokes his head outside tomorrow easy prey for the sparrow tomorrow ill be at the circus maximus to make a public appearance at the races and your wife sempronia will remain confined to this house i have no intention of allowing her to publicly ogle diocles in his chariot wont you be surrounded by bodyguards in the midst of such a throng who knows what opportunities might arise for some accident to befall me in the forum or the senate house i feel safe but the circus maximus is diocless territory he must know every blind corner every hiding place and theres the matter of my eyesight im more vulnerable than other men and i know it so does sempronia so must diocles let me be sure i understand consul you take this item to be a communication between your wife and diocles and the subject is a plot on your life but you have no other evidence and you want me to determine the truth of the matter ill make it worth your while why turn to me consul surely a man like yourself has agents of his own a finder he trusts to ferret out the truth about his allies and enemies decimus brutus nodded haltingly then why not give this mission to your own finder i had such a fellow yes called scorpus not long after i banned diocles from the house i set scorpus to find the truth about the charioteer and my wife what did he discover i dont know some days ago scorpus went missing missing until yesterday his body was fished out of the tiber downriver from rome not a mark on him they say he must have fallen in and drowned very strange how so scorpus was an excellent swimmer i left the consuls house with a list of everyone decimus brutus could name from his wifes inner circle and a pouch full of silver the pouch contained half my fee the remainder to be paid upon the consuls satisfaction if his suspicions were correct and if i failed him i would never collect dead men pay no debts for the rest of the day and long into the night i learned all i could about the consuls wife and the charioteer my friend lucius claudius might move among the rich and powerful but i had contacts of my own the best informants on sempronias circle of intimates i decided would be found at the senian baths such a closeknit group would visit the baths socially in couples or groups the men going to their facility and the women to theirs massage and a hot soak loosen the tongue the absence of the opposite gender engenders even greater candor what masseurs masseuses water bearers and towel boys fail to overhear is hardly worth knowing were diocles and sempronia lovers maybe maybe not according to my informants at the baths reporting secondhand the gossip of sempronias circle diocles was notorious for his sharp tongue and sempronia had an ear for cutting remarks there might be nothing more to their relationship than whispering and laughing in corners sempronia chose her friends male and female alike because they amused her or pleased her eye or stimulated her intellect no one considered her a slave to passion the abandon with which she danced or declaimed her verses was only part of her persona one small facet of the steelwilled girl who had made herself a consuls wife and had read every volume in the consuls study regarding a plot against the consul i heard not a whisper sempronias circle resented her confinement and their banishment from the consuls house but the impression passed on by the bathing attendants was more of amusement than of outrage sempronias friends considered decimus brutus a doddering harmless fool they playfully wagered among themselves how long it would take sempronia to bend the old bookworm to her will and resume her social life one discovery surprised me if i were to believe the bathing attendants sertorius the renegade general in spain was a far hotter topic of conversation among sempronias circle than was the consul his wife and the charioteer like my friend lucius claudius they believed that sertorius intended to wrest the spanish provinces from rome and make himself a king unlike lucius sempronias friends within the whispered hush of their own circle applauded sertorius and his rebellion decimus brutus had dismissed his wifes friends as frivolous people careless of appearances naive about politics i tried to imagine the appeal a rebel like sertorius might hold for such dilettantes were they merely infatuated by the bittersweet glamour that emanates from a desperate cause from the baths i moved on to the circus maximus or more precisely to the several taverns brothels and gambling dens in the vicinity of the racetrack i paid bribes when i had to but often i had only to drop the name of diocles to get an earful the consensus among the circus crowd was that the charioteers tastes ran to young athletes and always had his current fascination was a nubian acrobat who performed publicly during the intervals between races and was thought to perform privately after the races in diocless bedchamber of course the nubian might have been only a cover for another more illicit affair or diocles when it came to his lovers might have been something of a juggler himself if sempronias circle was abuzz about sertorius the circus crowd disdainful of politics was abuzz about the next days races i had a nagging sense that some of my informants were hiding something amid the horse talk and the rattle of dice the raucous laughter and the cries of venus for luck i sensed an edge of uneasiness even foreboding perhaps it was only a general outbreak of nerves on the night before a racing day or perhaps by then i had shared too much wine with too many wagging tongues to see things clearly still it seemed to me that something untoward was afoot at the circus maximus cocks were crowing when i left the neighborhood of the circus trudged across rome and dragged myself up the esquiline hill bethesda was waiting up for me her eyes lit up at the sight of the pouch of silver somewhat depleted by expenditures which she eagerly snatched from my hands and deposited in the empty household coffer a few hours later my head aching from too much wine and too little sleep i found myself back in the consuls study i had agreed to arrive at his house an hour before the first race to deliver my report such as it was i told him all i had learned the secondhand gossip of bathing attendants and tavern drunks seemed trivial as i recounted it but decimus brutus listened in silence and nodded gravely when i was done he squinted at the portrait of his wife nothing then scorpus is drowned and the finder finds nothing have you outsmarted me after all sempronia the portrait made no reply im not done yet consul i told him i shall attend the races today ill keep my eyes and ears open i may yet yes yes as you wish decimus brutus vaguely waved his hand to dismiss me never taking his furiously squinting eyes from the image of sempronia a slave escorted me from the consuls study in the atrium a small retinue crossed our path we paused as the train of women flitted past escorting their mistress from one part of the house to another i peered into their midst and glimpsed a wealth of auburn hair set with pearls green eyes met mine and stared back hands clapped and the retinue came to a halt sempronia stepped forward decimus brutus had been correct the picture did not do her beauty justice she was taller than i expected even through the bulky drapery of her stola her figure suggested a lithesome elegance that carried through to the delicacy of her long hands and graceful neck she flashed the aloof challenging smile which her portraitist had captured so well youre new one of my husbands men she said i had business with the consul i said she looked me up and down there are circles under your eyes you look as if you were out all night sometimes men get into trouble staying up late poking their noses where they shouldnt there was a glint in her eye was she baiting me i should have kept my mouth shut but i didnt like scorpus i hear he got into trouble she pretended to look puzzled scorpus oh yes my husbands allpurpose sneak scorpus drowned i know odd he could swim like a dolphin so i heard it could happen to anyone she sighed her smile faded i saw a glimmer of sympathy in her eyes and a look that chilled my blood such a pleasant fellow her look seemed to say what a pity it would be if one had to kill you sempronia rejoined her retinue and i was shown to the door by the time i reached the circus maximus all rome seemed to have poured into the long narrow valley between the palatine and aventine hills i pushed through the crowds lined up at the food and beverage shops tucked under the stands stepping on toes and dodging elbows until i came to the entrance i was looking for inside the stadium the seats were already thronged with spectators many wore red or white or waved little red or white banners to show their affiliation i swept my eyes over the elongated inner oval of the stadium dazzled by the crazy patchwork of red and white like blood spattered on snow restless and eager for the races to begin spectators clapped stamped their feet and took up chants and ditties cries of diocles in red quicker done than said competed with white white fast as spite a highpitched voice pierced the dingordianus over hereand i located lucius claudius he sat by the aisle patting an empty cushion beside him here gordianus i received your message this morning and dutifully saved you a seat better than last time dont you think not too high not too low with a splendid view of the finish line more important the consular box was nearby a little below us and to our right as i took my seat i saw a silvery head emerge from the boxs private entrance decimus brutus and his fellow consul lepidus were arriving along with their entourages he had made it safely to the circus at least partisan chants were drowned out by cheers the two consuls turned and waved to the crowd poor deci said lucius he thinks theyre cheering him the fact is theyre cheering his arrival because now the races can begin there was a blare of trumpets and then more cheering as the grand procession commenced statues of the gods and goddesses were paraded around the racetrack on carts led by victory with wings outspread as venus passedfavorite of gamblers as well as loverscoins showered down from the crowd and were scooped up by her priests the procession of gods ended with an enormous gilded statue of jupiter on his throne borne upon a cart so large it took twenty men to pull it next came the charioteers who would be racing that day slowly circling the track in chariots festooned with the color of their team red or white to many in the stands they were heroes larger than life there was a chant for every racer and chants for the lead horses as well the noise of all the competing chants ringing out at once was deafening never having been a gambler or a racing aficionado i recognized few of the charioteers but even i knew diocles the most renowned of the reds he was easy to spot by the extraordinary width of his shoulders his bristling beard and his flowing mane of jetblack hair as he passed before us grinning and waving to the crowd i tried to see the reaction of decimus brutus but i was able to see only the back of the consuls head did diocless smile turn sarcastic as he passed the consular box or did i only imagine it the procession ended the track was cleared the first four chariots took their places in the starting traps at the north end of the circus two white chariots a principal along with a secondstringer to regulate the pace and run interference would race against two red chariots did you get a racing card lucius held up a wooden tablet many in the stands were using them to fan themselves all around the redandwhite checkered stadium i saw the flutter of racing cards no said lucius never mind you can refer to mine lets see first race of the day the cards listed each charioteer his color and the name of the lead horse in his team of four principal red musclosus racing ajaxa hero of a horse to be sure secondstring red epaphroditus racing a fiveyearold called spotsa new horse to me for the whites thallus racing suspicion and his colleague teres racing snowy now theres a silly name for a horse dont you think even if it is pure white more suitable for a puppy i should thinkby hercules is that the starting trumpet the four chariots leaped out of their traps and onto the track once past the white line they furiously vied for the inner position alongside the spine that ran down the middle clouds of dust billowed behind them whips slithered and cracked as they made the first tight turn around the post at the end of the spine and headed back the reds were in the lead with epaphroditus the secondstringer successfully blocking the principal white to give his colleague a clear field while the secondstring white trailed badly unable to assist but in seven laps a great deal could happen lucius jumped up and down on his pillow all around us spectators began to place wagers with one another on the outcome im for snowy shouted the man across the aisle from lucius a man several rows down turned and shouted back the secondstring white are you mad ill wager you ten to one against snowy winning how much such is the roman way of gambling at the races inspired by a flash of intuition and done on the spur of the moment usually with a stranger sitting nearby i smiled at lucius whose susceptibility to such spontaneous wagering was a running joke between us care to join that wager lucius uh no he answered peering down at the track under his breath i heard him mutter come on ajax come on but ajax did not win nor did the longshot snowy by the final lap it was suspicion the principal white who had pulled into the lead with no help from the secondstring white who remained far in the rear it was a stunning upset even the red partisans in the crowd cheered such a marvelous display of fortunes favor a good thing you didnt bet on ajax i said to lucius he only grunted in reply and peered at his racing card as race followed race it seemed to me that i had never seen lucius so horsemad jumping up in excitement at each starting trumpet cheering jubilantly when his favored horse won but more often sulking when his horse lost and yet never once placing a bet with anyone around us he repeatedly turned his racing card over and scribbled figures on the back with a piece of chalk muttering and shaking his head i was distracted by my friends fidgeting and even more by the statuelike demeanor of decimus brutus who sat stiffly beside his colleague in the consular box he was so still that i wondered if he had gone to sleep with such poor eyesight it was no wonder he had no interest in watching the races surely i thought no assassin would be so bold as to make an attempt on the life of a consul in broad daylight with dozens of bodyguards and thousands of witnesses all around still i was uneasy and kept scanning the crowd for any signs of something untoward with so much on my mind along with a persistent headache from the previous nights wine i paid only passing attention to the races as each winner was announced the names of the horses barely registered in my ears lightning straight arrow bright eyes at last it was time for the final race in which diocles would compete a cheer went up as he drove his chariot toward the starting traps his horses were arrayed in splendid red trappings a goldplumed crest atop her head marked his lead horse sparrow a tawny beauty with magnificent flanks diocles himself was outfitted entirely in red except for a necklace of white i squinted lucius why should diocles be wearing a scrap of anything white is he look around his neck your eyes are as sharp as mine pearls declared lucius looks like a string of pearls rather precious for a charioteer i nodded diocles had not been wearing them in the opening procession it was the sort of thing a charioteer might put on for luck just before his racea token from his lover down in his box decimus brutus sat as stiffly as ever displaying no reaction with his eyesight there was little chance that he had noticed the necklace the trumpet blared the chariots sprang forward diocles took the lead at once the crowd roared diocles was their favorite even the whites loved him i could see why he was magnificent to watch he never once used his whip which stayed tucked into his belt the whole time alongside his emergency dagger there was magic in diocles that day man and horses seemed to share a single will his chariot was not a contraption but a creature a synthesis of human control and equine speed as he held and lengthened his lead lap after lap the crowds excitement grew to an almost intolerable pitch when he thundered across the finish line there was not a spectator sitting women wept men screamed without sound hoarse from so much shouting extraordinary declared lucius yes i said and felt a sudden flash of intuition a moment of godsent insight such as gamblers crave diocles is a magnificent racer what a pity he should have fallen into such a scheme what whats that you say lucius cupped his ear against the roar of the crowd diocles has everything skill riches the love of the crowd he has no need to cheat i shook my head only love could have drawn him into such a plot a plot what are you saying gordianus what is it you see i see the pearls around his necklook he reaches up to touch them while he makes his victory lap how he must love her what man can blame him for that but to be used by her in such a way the plot deci is deci in danger lucius peered down at the consular box even decimus brutus ever the ingratiating politician had risen to his feet to applaud diocles along with the rest of the crowd i think your friend decimus brutus need not fear for his life unless the humiliation might kill him gordianus what are you talking about tell me lucius why have you not wagered even once today and what are those numbers you keep figuring on the back of your racing card his florid face blushed even redder well if you must know gordianus i im afraid i ive lost rather a lot of money today how something something new a betting circle set up by perfectly respectable people you wagered ahead of time i put a little something on each race well it makes sense doesnt it if you know the horses and you place your bet on the best team ahead of time with a cool head rather than during the heat of the race yet youve lost over and over today far more often than youve won fortune is fickle i shook my head how many others are in this betting circle he shrugged everyone i know well everyone who is anyone only the best peopleyou know what i mean only the richest people how much money did the organizers of this betting scheme take in today i wonder and how much will they actually have to pay out gordianus what are you getting at lucius consult your racing card youve noted all the winners with a chalk mark read them off to menot the color or the driver just the horses names suspicionthat was the first race then lightning straight arrow bright eyes golden dagger partridge oh by hercules gordianus you dont thinkthat item in the daily i quoted from memory the bookworm pokes his head outside tomorrow easy prey for the sparrow but partridges go hungry brighteyed sappho says be suspicious a dagger strikes faster than lightning better yet an arrow let venus conquer all from sappho to sparrow a list of horsesand every one a winner but how could that be i know this much fortune had nothing to do with it i left the crowded stadium and hurried through the empty streets decimus brutus would be detained by the closing ceremonies i had perhaps an hour before he would arrive home the slave at the door recognized me he frowned the master is still at the circus maximus ill wait for him in the meantime please tell your mistress she has a visitor the slave raised an eyebrow but showed me into a reception room off the central garden lowering sunlight on the fountain splashing in the courtyard outside sent reflected lozenges of light dancing across the ceiling i did not have long to wait sempronia stepped into the room alone without even a handmaiden she was not smiling the door slave announced you as gordianus the finder yes we met briefly this morning i remember youre the fellow who went snooping for deci last night poking about at the senian baths and those awful places around the circus oh yes word got back to me i have my own informants what are you doing here im trying to decide what i should tell your husband she gave me an appraising look what is it exactly that you think you know decimus brutus thinks that you and the charioteer diocles are lovers and what do you think finder i think hes right but i have no proof she nodded is that all you husband thinks you and diocles were plotting to kill him today sempronia laughed out loud dear old bookworm she sighed marrying deci was the best thing that ever happened to me im the consuls wife why in hades would i want to kill him i shrugged he misunderstood that blind item you put into the daily acts which blind item theres been more than one of course that makes sense what better way to communicate with diocles since youve been confined here and hes been banned from your house what i dont understand is how you ever convinced diocles to fix todays races she crossed her arms and gave me a long calculating look diocles loves me more than i love him im afraid but when was venus ever fair he did it for love i suppose and for money diocles stands to make a tremendous amount of money today as do all the racers who took part in the fix you cant imagine how much money millions we worked on the scheme for months setting up the betting circle bribing the racers we do you mean your whole circle was in on it some of them but mostly it was diocles and myself she frowned and then deci had to throw his jealous fit it couldnt have happened at a worse time with the races less than a month away i had to have some way to communicate with diocles the daily was the answer you must have extraordinary powers of persuasion organization i was going to say like a man she laughed one thing puzzles me still what will you do with millions of sesterces sempronia you cant possibly hide that much money from your husband hed want to know where such a windfall came from she peered at me keenly what do you think i intend to do with the money i think you intend to get rid of it how i think you mean to send it abroad where to spain to quintus sertorius the rebel general her face became as pale as the pearls in her hair how much do you want gordianus i shook my head i didnt come here to blackmail you no thats what scorpus wanted your husbands man did he discover the truth only about the racing scheme he seemed to think that entitled him to a portion of the takings there must be plenty to go around she shook her head scorpus would never have stopped wanting more so he was drowned diocles arranged it there are men around the circus wholl do that sort of job for next to nothing especially for a fellow like diocles blackmailers deserve nothing better is that a threat sempronia that depends what do you want finder i shrugged the truth its the only thing that ever seems to satisfy me why sertorius why risk so mucheverythingto help his rebellion in spain do you have a family tie a loved one whos thrown his lot with the rebels or is it that you and sertorius are lovers she laughed without mirth is that all you can think that being a woman i must be driven by passion can you not imagine that a woman might have her own politics her own convictions her own agenda quite separate from a husband or a lover i dont have to justify myself to you gordianus i nodded feeling her eyes on me i paced the room the sun was sinking flashes of warm sunlight reflected from the fountain outside caressed my face decimus brutus would return home at any moment what would i tell him i made up my mind you asked me what i want from you sempronia actually there is the matter of a refund which i think you must admit is only proper given the circumstances at noon the next day i sat beside lucius claudius in his garden sharing the sunlight and a cup of wine his interest in that mornings daily acts had been eclipsed by the bags of coins i brought with me scooping the little scrolls off the table he emptied the bags and collected the sesterces into heaping piles gleefully counting and recounting them all here he announced clapping his hands every single sesterce i lost yesterday on the races but gordianus how did you get my money back that lucius must forever remain a secret if you insist but this has something to do with sempronia and that charioteer doesnt it a secret is a secret lucius he sighed your discretion is exasperating gordianus but ive learned my lesson i shall never again be drawn into a betting scheme like that i only wish i could have arranged for every person who was cheated yesterday to get his money back i said alas their lessons shall be more costly than yours i dont think this particular set of plotters will attempt to pull off such a scheme a second time hopefully roman racing can return to its pristine innocence lucius nodded the important thing is deci is safe and out of danger he was always safe never in danger rude of him though not to pay you the balance of your fee i shrugged when i saw him at his house yesterday evening after the races i had nothing more to report to him he hired me to uncover a plot against his life i failed to do so and what i thought if i had reported everything to the consulsempronias adultery the racing fix the betting scheme scorpuss attempted blackmail and his murder sempronias seditious support of sertorius terrified of scandal decimus brutus would merely have hushed it all up sempronia would have been no more faithful to him than before and no ones wagers would have been returned no i had been hired to save the consuls life discreetly and as far as i was concerned my duty to decimus brutus ended when i discovered there was no plot against his life after all my discretion would continue still gordianus it was niggardly of deci not to pay you discretion forbade me from telling lucius that the other half of my fee had indeed been paidby sempronia it was the only way i could see to save my own neck i had convinced her that by paying the fee for my investigation she purchased my discretion thus i avoided the same fate as scorpus at the same time i had requested a refund of luciuss wagers which seemed only fair lucius cupped his hands around a pile of coins as if they emitted a warming glow he smiled ruefully i tell you what gordianusas commission for recouping my gambling losses what if i give you five percent of the total i sucked in a breath and eyed the coins on the table bethesda would be greatly pleased to see the household coffer filled to overflowing i smiled at lucius and raised an eyebrow gordianus dont give me that look what look oh very well i shall give you ten percent but not a sesterce more if a cyclops could vanish in the blink of an eye eco was incensed that was all i could tell at firstthat he was angry and frustrated almost to the point of tears at such a time i felt acutely aware of his muteness he was usually quite skilled at expressing himself with gestures and signals but not when he was flustered calm down i said quietly placing my hands on his shoulders he was at that age when boys shoot up like beanstalks it seemed to me that not long ago placing my hands at the same height i would have been patting his head now i said what is the problem my adopted son took a deep breath and composed himself then seized my hand and led me across the overgrown garden at the center of the house under the portico through a curtained doorway and into his room by the bright morning light from the small window i surveyed the few furnishingsa narrow sleeping cot a wooden folding chair and a small trunk it was not to these that eco directed my attention but to a long niche about kneehigh in the plastered wall across from his bed the last time i had ventured into the room a hodgepodge of toys had been shoved into the nichelittle boats made of wood a leather ball for playing trigon pebbles of colored glass for egyptian board games now the space had been neatly clearedthe castoff toys put away in the trunk along with his spare tunic i presumedand occupying the shelf were a number of tiny figurines made of fired clay each representing some monster of legend with a horrible visage there was a medusa with snakes for hair a cyclops with one eye a nemean lion and numerous others they were crudely made but tinted with bright colors and i knew that eco treasured them a potter with a shop down by the tiber made them in his spare time out of bits of leftover clay eco had been doing occasional odd jobs for the man and accepting the figurines as payment he insisted on showing them off to me and to bethesda whenever he brought a new one home i always made a point of admiring them but my beloved concubine made no secret of her disdain for them her upbringing in egypt had given her attitudes differentdare i say more superstitiousthan those of a roman and where i found the figurines to be harmless and charming she saw in them something distasteful even sinister i had not realized how large ecos collection had grown i counted fifteen figurines all lined up in a row why do you show me these i asked he pointed to three gaps in the evenly spaced row are you telling me that three of your monsters are missing eco nodded vigorously but where have they gone he shrugged and his lower lip began to tremble he looked so desolate which ones are missing when were they taken eco pointed to the first gap then performed a very complicated mime snarling and gnashing his teeth until i grasped that the missing figurine was of threeheaded cerberus the watchdog of pluto he passed an open palm behind a horizontal forearmhis gesture for sundownand held up two fingers the day before yesterday your cerberus went missing he nodded but why didnt you tell me then eco shrugged and made a long face i gathered that he presumed he might have mislaid the figurine himself our exchange continuedme asking questions eco answering with gesturesuntil i learned that yesterday his minotaur had disappeared and that very morning his manyheaded hydra had vanished the first disappearance had merely puzzled him the second had alarmed him the third had thrown him into utter confusion i gazed at the gaps in the row of monsters and stroked my chin well well this is serious tell me has anything else gone missing eco shook his head are you sure he rolled his eyes at me and gestured to his cot his chair and his trunk as if to say with so little to call my own dont you think id notice if anything else was gone ecos figurines were of little intrinsic value any serious burglar would surely have been more likely to snatch one of bethesdas bracelets or a scroll from my bookcase but as far as i knew nothing else in the house had gone missing in the last few days at that time i was without a slaveother than bethesda whom i could hardly justify calling my slave anymore considering that she tended to prevail in any contest of wills between usso the only occupants of the house were bethesda eco and myself in the last three days no tradesmen had come calling nor sadly for my purse had any client come to seek the services of gordianus the finder i raised an eyebrow fortunately for you eco i happen to be between cases at the moment so i can bend all my efforts toward solving this mystery but the truth can never be hurried let me ponder this for a whilesleep on it perhapsand ill see if i can come up with a solution bethesda was out most of the day shopping at the food markets and taking a pair of my shoes to be resoled by a cobbler i had business to attend to in the forum as well as a special errand to take care of on the street of the plastermakers not until that night after eco had retired to his room and the two of us reclined on our dining couches after the evening meala simple repast of lentil soup and stuffed datesdid i find time to have a quiet word with bethesda about ecos problem disappearing one at a time she said by the warm glow of the nearby brazier i thought i saw a subtle smile on her lips the same light captured winecolored highlights in her dark hennatreated hair bethesda was beautiful at all hours of the day but perhaps most beautiful by firelight the black female cat she called bast lay beside her submitting to her gentle stroking watching bethesda caress the beast i felt a stab of envy cats were still a novelty in rome at that time and keeping one as a house pet as others might keep a dog was one of the peculiar habits bethesda had imported with her from egypt her last cat also called bast had expired some time ago this one she had recently acquired from a sailing merchant in ostia the beast and i got along passably well as long as i didnt attempt to interpose myself between bast and her mistress when it was the cats turn to receive bethesdas caresses yes the little monsters seem to be vanishing one by one i said clearing my throat i dont suppose you know anything about it i what makes you think i might have anything to do with it bethesda raised an eyebrow for an uncanny moment her expression and the cats expression were identicalmysterious aloof utterly selfcontained i shifted uneasily on my couch perhaps i shrugged perhaps you were cleaning his room perhaps one of the figurines fell and broke do you think im blind as well as clumsy i think i should know if i had broken one of ecos figurines she said coolly especially if i did such a thing three days in a row of course still considering the way you feel about those figurines and do you know how i feel about them master bethesda fixed me with her catlike stare i cleared my throat well i know you dont like them i respect them for what they are you think theyre just lumps of lifeless clay a childs toys made by a clumsy potter you romans youve put so much of your faith in the handful of gods who made you great that you can no longer see the tiny gods who populate your own households theres a spark of life in every one of the figurines that eco has brought into the house its unwise to bring so many into the house at once when theres so little we know about any of them do you know what i think i think the three whove gone missing may have left of their own volition what you think they jumped from the shelf and scampered off you scoff master but it may be that the three who left were unhappy with the company in which they found themselves or perhaps the others ganged up on them and drove them off as her voice rose so did bethesda sitting upright on the couch bast disliking the change in her mistresss disposition jumped from her lap and ran off bethesda this is preposterous theyre only bits of painted clay she recovered her composure and leaned back so you say master so you say the point is those figurines are of great value to eco hes very proud of them theyre his possessions he earned them by his own labor if you say so master being a mere slave i wouldnt know much about earning and owning her tone expressed no empathy for eco at all and certainly no remorse i became more determined than ever to make good on my pledge to eco to solve the mystery of his disappearing monsters that night after bethesda was asleep i slipped out of bed and stole to the garden at the center of the house which was lit by a full moon in an inconspicuous spot beside one of the columns of the portico i located the purchase i had made earlier that day on the street of the plastermakers it was a tightly woven linen bag containing a handful or so of plaster dust carrying the bag i slipped through the curtained doorway into ecos room the moonlight that poured in through the small window showed eco soundly asleep on his cot reaching into the bag i scattered a very fine layer of plaster dust onto the floor in front of the niche that contained his figurines the dust was so fine that a tiny cloud rose from my hand and seemed to sparkle in the moonlight my eyes watered and my nose twitched i slipped out of ecos room put away the bag of plaster dust and stole back to my bed i slipped under the covers beside bethesda only then did i release a sneeze that broke the silence like thunder bethesda murmured and rolled onto her side but did not wake the next morning i woke to the sound of birds in the gardennot pleasant singing but the shrill cawing of two magpies squabbling in the trees i covered my ears with my pillow but it was no good i was up for the day stepping out of bed i inadvertently kicked a shoeone of the pair that bethesda had brought home from the cobbler the previous dayand sent it skittering under the bed dropping to my hands and knees to retrieve it i was stopped short by the sight of four objects on the floor beneath the bed directly underneath the space where bethesda slept against the wall they were clustered in a little group lying on their sides joining the missing figurines of cerberus the minotaur and the hydra was a fourth ecos oneeyed cyclops well well i thought getting to my feet sprinkling the plaster dust had been superfluous after all or had it if bethesda wouldnt own up to pilfering ecos figurines the evidence of her footsteps in the dust and of the dust adhering to soles of her shoes would compel her to do so i couldnt help but smile anticipating her chagrin or would she maintain her fiction that the figurines had walked off by themselves with the curious goal as it turned out of congregating beneath our bed whistling an old etruscan nursery tune and looking forward to a hearty breakfast i strolled across the garden toward the dining room at the back of the house above my head the magpies squawked in dissonant counterpoint to my whistling bast sat in a patch of sunlight apparently oblivious of the birds cleaning a forepaw with her tongue no sooner had i settled myself on the dining couch than eco came running out of his room a look of confusion and alarm on his face he ran up to me and waved his arms making inchoate gestures i know i know i said raising one hand to calm him and gently restraining him with the other dont tell meyour cyclops has gone missing eco was briefly taken aback then frowned and peered at me inquiringly how do i know well at that moment bethesda appeared from the kitchen bearing a bowl of steaming porridge i cleared my throat bethesda i said it seems that another of ecos figurines has vanished what do you say to that she put the bowl on a small tripod table and began to ladle porridge into three smaller bowls what would you have me say master she kept her eyes on her work her face was utterly expressionless betraying not the least trace of guilt or guile i sighed almost regretting that she had forced me to expose her little charade perhaps you could begin by apologizing to eco i was about to saywhen i was abruptly interrupted by a sneeze it was not bethesda who sneezed nor was it eco it was the cat bethesda looked up yes master i could begin by saying what my face turned hot i cleared my throat i pursed my lips i stood up eco the first thing you must remember if you ever wish to become a finder like your father is always to keep a cool head and never to jump to conclusions last night i laid a trap for our culprit if we now examine the scene of the crime i suspect we shall discover that she has left a clue behind or several clues as it turned out if one wished to call each tiny padded paw print in the fine plaster dust an individual clue the paw prints led up to the niche the paw prints led away following a barely discernible trail of dusted prints eco and i tracked the thiefs progress out of his room around the colonnaded portico and into the room i shared with bethesda the trail disappeared under the bed i left it to eco to discover the pilfered figurines for himself he let out a grunt scampered under the bed and reemerged clutching the clay treasures in both hands a look of mingled relief and triumph on his face greatly excited he put down the figurines so that he could communicate he pinched his forefingers and thumbs beneath his nose and drew them outward making his sign for bast by miming the cats long whiskers yes i said it was bast who took your figurines eco made an exaggerated shrug with his palms held upright why that i cant tell you we romans dont yet know that much about cats not like the egyptians whove been living with themand worshipping themsince the dawn of time i suppose like dogs and ferretsand like magpies for that mattersome cats display a tendency to pilfer small objects and hide them one of those figurines would fit quite neatly between basts jaws im sure she meant no harm as none of them seems to have been damaged she obviously treated them with great respect i glanced at the cat she stood in the doorway beside bethesda and peered back at me with a bland expression that admitted no guilt she rubbed herself against bethesdas ankles whipped her tail in the air and sauntered back toward the garden bethesda raised an eyebrow and looked at me steadily but said nothing that night after a very busy day i slipped into bed beside bethesda her mood seemed a bit cool but she said nothing the silence stretched i suppose i owe you an apology i finally said for what the best course i decided was to make light of my mistake it was foolish of me really do you know i almost suspected you of taking ecos figurines really by the pale moonlight i couldnt quite decipher the expression on her face was she angry amused unconcerned yes i actually suspected you bethesda but of course it wasnt it was the cat all along the creature abruptly jumped onto the bed and crawled over both of us to settle between bethesda and the wall purring loudly yes it was bast who took the figurines said bethesda she rolled away from me and laid her hand upon the cat who responded with a purring that was almost a roar but how do you know that it wasnt i who put her up to it for that i had no answer the white fawn the old senator was a distant cousin of my friend lucius claudius and the two had once been close that was the only reason i agreed to see the man as a favor to lucius when lucius let it slip on the way to the senators house that the affair had something to do with sertorius i clucked my tongue and almost turned back i had a feeling even then that it would lead to no good call it a premonition if you will if you believe that such things as premonitions exist senator gaius claudiuss house was on the aventine hill not the most fashionable district in rome still there are plenty of old patrician households tucked amid the cramped little shops and ugly new tenements that sprawl over the hill the facade of the senators house was humble but that meant nothing the houses of the roman nobility are often unassuming at least on the outside the doddering doorkeeper recognized lucius could there be two men in rome with his beaming round face untidy red hair and dancing green eyes and escorted us at once to the atrium where a fountain gurgled and splashed but did little to relieve the heat of a cloudless midsummer day while we waited for our host to appear lucius and i strolled from corner to corner of the little square garden on such a warm day the various rooms facing the atrium all had their shutters thrown open i take it that your cousin has fallen on hard times i said to lucius he pursed his lips why do you assume that gordianus i dont recall mentioning it observe the state of his house its a fine house gaius had it built when he was a young man and has lived here ever since it seems rather sparsely decorated you saw the busts of his noble ancestors lined up in their niches in the foyer said lucius his nose tilting up what more ornamentation does the house of a patrician require despite his genial temperament lucius sometimes could not help being a bit of a snob but i think your cousin is a great lover of art or used to be now why do you say that observe the mosaic floor beneath our feet with its intricate acanthusleaf pattern the workmanship is very fine and note the wall paintings in some of the rooms around us the various scenes are from the iliad i believe even from here i can see that theyre works of very high quality lucius raised an eyebrow cousin gaius does have good taste ill grant you that but why do you assume hes fallen on hard times because of the things that i dont see now gordianus really how can you walk into a house youve never entered before and declare that things are missing i can see into the surrounding rooms as well as you and they all look adequately furnished precisely the furnishings are adequate i should expect something more than that from the man who built this house and commissioned those wall paintings and mosaics where is the finely wrought furniture everything i see looks like the common stuff that anyone can buy readymade down in the street of the woodworkers where are the paintings the portable ones in frames the portraits and bucolic scenes that are so fashionable nowadays what makes you think that cousin gaius ever collected such works because i can see the discolored rectangles on the wall where they used to hang and surely a rather substantial statue once filled that empty spot atop the pedestal in the middle of the fountain let me guess diana with her bow or perhaps a discusthrower a rather good drunken hercules actually such valuables dont vanish from a patrician household without good reason this house is like a bare cupboard or a fine roman matron without her jewelry where are the urns the vases the precious little things one expects to see in the house of a wealthy old senator auctioned off to pay the billcollector i presume when did your cousin sell them over the last few years admitted lucius with a sigh bit by bit i suppose the mosaics and wall paintings would be gone by now as well except that theyre part of the house and cant be disposed of piecemeal the civil war was very hard on cousin gaius he backed the wrong side quite the opposite gaius was a staunch supporter of sulla but his only son who was my age had married into a family that sided with marius and was contaminated by his wifes connections he was beheaded when sulla became dictator he did leave an heir howevergaiuss grandson a boy named mamercus who is now not quite twenty gaius took custody of his grandson but also had to assume his dead sons debts which were crushing poor cousin gaius the civil war tore his family apart took his only son and left him virtually bankrupt i looked around the house itself looks valuable enough im sure it is but its all that gaius has left the wealth has all fled and so has young mamercus i fear the grandson gone to spain its broken his grandfathers heart spain ah so thats why you mentioned sertorius on the walk here the civil war had been over for six years marius had lost sulla had won and had made himself dictator he disposed of his enemies reordered the state and then retired leaving his chosen successors in firm control of the senate and the magistracies the mariansthose who had survived the proscriptions and still had their headswere lying low but in spain the last embers of resistance still smoldered in the person of quintus sertorius the renegade general not only refused to surrender but had declared himself to be the head of the legitimate roman state disgruntled marian military men and desperate antisullan senators had fled from rome to join sertoriuss governmentinexile in addition to his own legions sertorius had succeeded in rallying the native population to his side altogether sertorius and his forces in spain constituted a considerable power that the roman senate could not ignore and had not yet been able to stamp out are you saying that young mamercus has run off to join sertorius so it appears said lucius shaking his head he leaned over to sniff a rose this smells very sweet so young mamercus rejected his grandfathers sullan politics and remained loyal to his mothers side of the family so it appears gaius is quite distraught the folly of youth theres no future for anyone who sides with sertorius but what future would the young man have if hed stayed here in rome with his grandfather you say that gaius is bankrupt its a question of loyalty gordianus and family dignity lucius spoke carefully i could see he was doing his patrician best not to sound condescending i shrugged perhaps the boy feels hes being loyal to his dead father by joining the last resistance to sullas faction but i take your point lucius its a family tragedy of a sort all too common these days but what can your cousin want of me i should think that was obvious he wants someone toah but here is gaius himself cousin lucius embrace me a fraillooking old man in a senatorial toga stepped into the atrium with wideopen arms let me feel another of my own flesh and blood pressed against me the two men could hardly have been more different gaius was older of course but also tall and narrow where lucius was short and round and where lucius was florid and flushed there was a grayness about the old senator not only in his hair and wrinkled hands but also in his expression and manner a kind of drawn sere austerity like his house the man seemed to have been stripped bare of all vain adornments and winnowed to his essence after a moment the two drew apart i knew you wouldnt disappoint me lucius is this the fellow yes this is gordianus called the finder let us hope he lives up to his name gaius claudius regarded me not with the patronizing gaze i was used to receiving from patricians but steadily and deeply as if to judge whether i should be a cause of hope to him or not he looks reliable enough he finally pronounced ah but what judge of character am i who let my only son marry into a marian family and then could not foresee my grandsons intentions to follow the same course to disaster yes i was just informing gordianus of your situation said lucius and is he willing actually we were just coming to that there must indeed have been a last thin veil of vanity over the old senators demeanor for now i saw it fall away he looked at me imploringly the boy is all i have left i must at least know for certain whats become of him and why hes done this mad thing and if he cant be persuaded to see reason will you do this for me gordianus do what gaius claudius i said though i was beginning to see all too clearly find him go to spain for me take my message bring him back to me i cleared my throat let me understand you gaius claudius you wish for me to venture into sertoriuss territory you must realize that the whole of the spanish peninsula is wracked with warfare the danger you will demand a large fee i suppose gaius averted his eyes and wrung his hands the fee is not an issue said lucius im afraid that it most certainly is i said not following his meaning then i saw the look that passed between lucius and his cousin and understood gaius claudius had no money it was lucius who would be paying my fee and lucius as i well knew could afford to be generous the commission would be coming just as much from my dear friend as from his cousin then that made me feel all the more obliged to accept it thus i came to find myself some days later on the eastern coast of spain near the village of sucro which is situated not far from the mouth of the river of the same name i was not alone after a great deal of internal debate and hesitation i had decided to bring eco with me on the one hand i was likely to encounter danger quite possibly a great deal of danger who knows what may happen in a foreign land torn by warfare on the other hand a nimble quickwitted fourteenyearold boy who had survived the harsh streets of rome from his earliest years despite the handicap of his muteness is not a bad companion to have around in unpredictable surroundings and for his own benefit i thought it a good thing that eco should learn the lessons of travel while he was still young especially since lucius claudius was paying the expenses first had come the sea voyage on a trading ship out of puteoli bound for mauretania for a reasonable sum the captain agreed to put us ashore at new carthage in spain that had gone well enough pirates had pursued us only once and our experienced captain had managed to outrun them easily and eco had suffered from seasickness only for the first day or two once ashore we sought for news of sertoriuss whereabouts and made our way north until we caught up with him at sucro where we arrived only two days after a tremendous battle on the banks of the river according to the locals sertorius had suffered heavy casualties perhaps as many as ten thousand men but so had the opposing roman general the sullan boywonder pompey not quite such a boy any longer at thirty who had been wounded himself though not gravely the two sides appeared to be regrouping their forces and a fresh rumor had it that pompeys colleague metellus was soon to arrive with reinforcements from the north the townspeople of sucro were bracing themselves for another great battle getting into sertoriuss camp proved to be easier than i anticipated the traditional rigid discipline of a roman army camp was missing perhaps given sertoriuss mix of spanish tribesmen and ragtag romans such discipline was impossible in its place there seemed to be a great sense of camaraderie and of welcome to the local camp followers who came to offer food and wares and in not a few cases themselves for sale to the soldiers the air of the camp was open and almost festive despite the great slaughter of two days before morale clearly was very high i inquired after the whereabouts of mamercus claudius using the description his grandfather had given mea young patrician of nineteen tall slender with a pleasant face and a shock of jetblack hair a newcomer to the ranks among the grizzled roman veterans and their spanish allies such a fellow was likely to stand out i thought and sure enough it took only a little asking and a pittance of bribes before eco and i were pointed to his tent the location surprised me for it was very near the heart of the camp and thus not far i presumed from sertoriuss own quarters despite his youth and inexperience mamercus claudius was probably quite a catch for sertorius evidence to his fellow romans that the renegade general could still attract a youth from one of romes best families that his cause looked toward the future not just the past this presumption turned out to be more astute than i realized when i asked the centurion outside the tent to inform mamercus that he had a visitor i was told that mamercus was elsewhere when i asked where he might be the centurion suggested that i try the commanders tent so eco and i made our way to the tent of quintus sertorius himself which was quite conspicuous thanks to the phalanx of guards around it there was also a great crowd of petitioners of the usual sort lined up to seek audiencelocals who hoped to sell provisions to the army or had suffered property damage and wanted restitution or had other pressing business with the commander and his staff eco tapped the edge of one hand against the flattened palm of the other to suggest that we had run into a solid wall we shall never get inside that tent he seemed to say ah but we dont need to get inside i said to him we want someone whos already in there to come out and thats a different matter i walked to the head of the long line some in the queue glared at us but i ignored them i came to the man who was next to be admitted and cleared my throat to get his attention he turned and gave me a nasty look and said something in his native tongue when he saw that i didnt understand he repeated himself in passable latin what do you think youre doing im next get away youre here to see quintus sertorius i said like everyone else wait your turn ah but i dont want to see the general himself i only want someone to give a message to a young fellow whos probably in there with him could you do me the favor i patted my hand against the coin purse inside my tunic which clinked suggestively ask after a young roman named mamercus claudius tell him that someone has come a very long way to talk to him i suppose the man seemed dubious but then his face abruptly brightened as if reflecting the glitter of sunlight on the coins i dropped into his hand just then a guard approached searched the fellow for weapons and told him to step into the tent we did not have long to wait soon a lanky young man stepped out of the tent his armored leather fittings seemed to have been tailored for a shorter stockier man i had noticed that many of sertoriuss junior officers were outfitted in similarly haphazard fashion the young man pulled uncomfortably at the armholes of his leather shirt and peered into the crowd looking rather put out i caught his eye and beckoned for him to meet me at one side of the tent mamercus claudius i said i come with a message from what do you think youre doing you idiot summoning me from the commanders tent like that he was angry but kept his voice low i suppose i could have lined up with the rest for an audience with the general who are you my name is gordianus called the finder this is my son eco weve come all the way from rome your grandfather sent me mamercus seemed taken aback at first then smiled ruefully i see poor grandfather poor indeed i said and poorer still for lack of your company is he well in body yes but his spirit is eaten away by fear for you ive brought a message from him i produced the little folded tablet that i had faithfully brought all the way from rome the two thin plates of wood were bound together with a ribbon and sealed with a daub of red wax upon which gaius claudius had pressed his signet ring mamercus broke the seal pulled the tablets apart and gazed at the wax surfaces inside upon which his grandfather had scratched his plea by his own hand no longer having even a secretary to write his letters for him had mamercuss reaction been callous and uncaring i would not have been surprised many an impatient bitter dispossessed young man in his situation might have scorned a doting grandparents concern especially if that grandparent had always supported the very establishment against which he was rebelling but mamercuss reaction was quite different i watched the swift movement of his eyes as they perused the words and saw them glisten with tears he clamped his jaw tightly to stop his lips from quivering his evident distress made him look almost as boyish as eco gaius claudius had not kept the contents of his letter secret from me on the contrary he had insisted that i read it my dearest grandson blood of my blood what has induced you to take thisfoolish course do you think to please the shade of your father by joining a hopeless struggle against those who destroyed him if this were the only course open to youif your own name and future had been ruined along with your fathers and mothersthen honor might demand such a desperate course but in rome you still have my protection despite your fathers downfall andyou can still make a career foryourself we are woefully impoverished to be sure but together we willfind a way out of our misfortune surely the best revenge for your father would be for you to restore our familys fortunes and to make a placefor yourself in the state so that when you are my age you can look back upon a long career and a world you have had a hand in shaping to your liking do not throw your life away please i begyou calm your passions and let reason guide you come back to me the man who bears this message has funds sufficientfor your passage home mamercus son of my son i pray to the gods that shall see you soon after a while mamercus pressed the tablets together and retied the ribbon he averted his eyes in a way that reminded me of his grandfather thank you for bringing the letter is that all is it all i said i know whats in the letter will you honor his request no leave me now are you sure mamercus will you think on it shall i come back later no my commission from gaius claudius was specific i was to locate mamercus to deliver the message and to help mamercus if he chose to escape unscathed from sertoriuss service it was not incumbent on me to persuade him to leave but i had come a long way and now i had seen both the old senators distress and his grandsons response to it if mamercus had reacted with derision if he had betrayed no love for his grandfather that would have been the end of it but his reaction had been quite the opposite even now from the way he gently held the tablets almost caressing them and reached up to wipe his eyes i could see that he was feeling a great flood of affection for the old man and consequently perhaps considerable confusion over the choice he had made i thought it wise to change the subject for a moment you seem to have done well for yourself here in sertoriuss army i said better than i expected in so short a time admitted mamercus he tucked the tablets under his arm and smiled crookedly the commander was very glad to take me in he gave me a position on his staff at once despite my lack of experience look he said to everyone a young claudius come all the way from rome to join us but dont worry son well be back in rome before you know it and its the blasted sullans wholl be searching for their heads and do you believe that is that why you choose to stay mamercus bristled the question is whats keeping you here gordianus ive given you my answer now go at that moment the crowd before the commanders tent broke into a cheer i heard the name of sertorius shouted aloud in acclamation and saw that the great man himself had emerged from the tent he was a tall robustlooking man with a strong jaw and a smile that radiated confidence years ago he had lost an eye in battle other men might have been embarrassed by the defect but sertorius was said to consider his leather eyepatch to be a badge of honor the many battle scars scattered over his arms and legs he considered to be his medals some mortals possess a charismatic allure that is almost divine that anyone can see at a glance and quintus sertorius was such a mortal this was a man whom other men would trust implicitly and follow without question to glory or death the cheers that greeted his appearance from both his own soldiers and from the local petitioners were absolutely genuine and spontaneous then the cries died away to a whispered hush eco and i looked at one another puzzled the cheering was understandable but what was this it was the hush of religious awe such as one hears in rome at certain ancient rites performed in the temples in the forum a barely audible welter of whispers and murmurs and muttered prayers then i saw the remarkable creature that had followed sertorius out of the tent it was a young fawn her soft pelt was utterly white without a single spot of color she gamboled after sertorius like a loyal hound and when he paused she nuzzled against his thigh and lifted her snout for him to stroke i had never seen anything like it the hush grew louder and amid the strange dialects i heard snatches of latin the white fawn the white fawn they both look happythat must mean good news diana bless us goddess bless quintus sertorius sertorius smiled and laughed and bent down to take the fawns head in his hands he kissed her right on the snout this evoked an even louder murmur from the crowdand from one onlooker a loud barking laugh my dear mute son has a very strange laugh alas rather like the braying of a mule the fawns ears shot straight up and she cowered behind sertorius tripping awkwardly over her spindly legs heads turned toward us casting suspicious looks eco clamped his hands over his mouth sertorius peered in our direction frowning he saw mamercus then appraised me with a curious eye mamercus claudius he called i wondered where youd got to come sertorius pressed on through the worshipful crowd with the white fawn and a cordon of guards following behind included in the retinue i was surprised to see was a girl who could hardly have been older than eco she was a beautiful child with dark eyes and cheeks like white rose petals dressed all in white with her black hair bound up in a scarf she looked and carried herself like a priestess keeping her eyes straight ahead and striding between the soldiers with a grace and selfassurance beyond her years a white fawn i said and that girl who is she mamercus but mamercus only glowered at me and went to join sertorius i ran after him and clutched his arm mamercus i shall try to find lodgings in sucro tonight if you should change your mind he yanked his arm from my grasp and strode off without looking back lodgings were not hard to find in sucro there was only one tavern with accommodations and the place was deserted the battle between pompey and sertorius had driven travelers far away and the likelihood of another battle was keeping them away the tavern keeper was a stronglooking celt with a shaggy black beard named lacro he seemed to be in high spirits despite the hardships of war and was glad to have two paying guests to share wine and conversation in the common room that night lacros family had lived on the banks of the sucro for generations he boasted proudly of the bounty of the river and the beauty of the coast his favorite recreation was to go trapping and hunting in the marshes near the rivers mouth where birds flocked in great numbers and crustacean delicacies could be plucked from the mud lacro had apparently been spending a lot of time in the marshes lately if only to stay clear of the fighting but he did not complain about the war except to excoriate pompey and metellus lacro was very much a partisan of sertorius and praised him for unifying the various celtic and iberian tribes of spain he had no quarrel with romans he said so long as they were like sertorius if it took a roman to give his people leadership then so be it when i told him that eco and i had come that very day from the great commanders camp and indeed had caught a glimpse of sertorius himself lacro was quite impressed and did you see the white fawn he asked yes we did a strange creature to keep as a pet the white fawn is not a pet lacro was appalled at the idea the white fawn was sent to sertorius as a gift by diana the goddess speaks to him through the fawn the fawn tells sertorius the future really how else do you think hes gone undefeated for so long no matter how many armies rome sends against him did you think that sertorius was merely lucky no he has divine protection the white fawn is a holy creature i see i said but apparently without sufficient conviction bah you romans youve conquered the world but youve lost sight of the gods you saw the white fawn with your own eyes and thought it was a mere pet but not sertorius thats what makes him different how did sertorius acquire this amazing creature they say some hunters came upon the fawn in a wood she walked right up to them and told them to take her to the great leader the hunters brought her to sertorius when he bent down to nuzzle the fawns face she spoke to him in his own tongue and he recognized the voice of diana the two have never parted since the fawn follows sertorius everywhere or strictly speaking he follows the fawn since its she who tells him where his enemies are and what routes to take ah so you saw her with your own eyes i envy you ive never seen her only heard of her this white fawn is quite famous then everyone knows of her i keep a tavern dont i i know what people talk about and every man from the pyrenees to the pillars of hercules loves the white fawn since there was only one tavern in sucro mamercus claudius had no trouble finding us the next morning he stepped into the common room just as eco and i were finishing our breakfast of bread and dates so i thought the young man has decided to return to his grandfather after all i smiled at him he did not smile back i realized that he was still in his military garb and that he was not alone a small band of soldiers entered the room behind him all wearing the same grim look his visit was official then my breakfast turned heavy in my stomach my mouth went dry i remembered the evil premonition i had felt about this mission from the very first even before i met gaius claudius mamercus marched up to us his manner was soldierly and impersonal gordianus quintus sertorius has sent me to fetch you then it was the worst i thought mamercus had betrayed me to sertorius and now sertorius was having me arrested for trying to engineer the defection of an officer i had known the mission would be dangerous i should have been more cautious mamercus had made it clear the previous day that he had no intention of returning to rome with me why i had lingered in sucro i had tarried too long a victim of my own sentimental sympathy for the old senator and i had made eco a victim as well he was only a boysurely sertorius would not lop his head off along with mine but what would become of him after i was gone sertorius would probably conscript him as a foot soldier i thought was that to be ecos fate to end his days on a battlefield fighting for a lost cause in a foreign land if only i had left him behind in rome i stood as bravely as i could and gestured for eco to do the same mamercus and his men escorted us out of the tavern and marched us up the river road back to the camp the mens faces looked even grimmer under the bright morning sun not one of them said a word the same grimness presided in the camp every face we saw was glum and silent where were the high spirits of the day before we came to sertoriuss tent mamercus pulled back the flap and announced my name he gestured for eco and me to enter he himself remained outside as did the other soldiers the commander was alone more alone in fact than i realized at first he rose from his chair eagerly as if he had been waiting impatiently and strode toward us this was not the reception i had expected gordianus the finder he said grasping my hand what good fortune that you should happen to be here on such a day do you know why ive summoned you im beginning to think that i dont the look on sertoriuss face was grim but not hostile my head started to feel noticeably more secure on my shoulders then you havent heard the news yet what news excellent that means that word hasnt yet spread to the town one tries to keep down the gossip and rumors when something like this happens but its like putting out fires in a hayfield i looked about the crowded tent at the generals sleeping cot the portable cabinets with maps and scrolls stacked on top the little lamps on tripods something was missing where is the white fawn i said the color drained from his face then you have heard the news no but if there is some crisis at hand shouldnt your divine counselor be with you sertorius swallowed hard someone has stolen her in the night someone has kidnapped the white fawn i see but why have you sent for me quintus sertorius dont be coy finder i know your reputation youve heard of me sertorius managed a wry smile i do have some idea of what goes on in rome even if i havent been there in years i have my spies and informants therejust as pompey and the senate no doubt have their spies in my camp i try to keep abreast of whos taking whom to court whos up and whos down you might be surprised how often your name comes up yes i know who you are and do you know what brought me here i wanted to be absolutely certain that we understood each other yes yes i asked mamercus about you yesterday he showed me the letter what a silly hen his grandfather is the sullans can have the old fellowi have the grandson and hes turned out to be worth any three of pompeys officers ill wager bright curious clever and wholly committed to the cause if the powersthatbe in rome had any sense theyd have restored his familys estates and tried to win mamercus over to their side once his father was out of the way but the sullans always were a greedy lot of shortsighted bastards theyve driven all the best young men to spain all the better for me for just a moment he flashed the dazzling smile which had no doubt won the hearts of those bright young men then the smile faded but back to the business at hand they call you the finder dont they well i am a man who has lost something and i must find it again at night sertorius explained the fawn was kept in a little tent of her own near the generals quarters for religious reasons the opening of the fawns tent was situated to face the rising moon it had so happened in this particular camp that the front of the fawns tent faced away from most of the others and so was not visible to sertoriuss own night watch the tent had its own guards however a pair of celts who had vied for the religious honor of protecting dianas emissary these two had apparently been given a powerful drug and had slept the night through sertorius was convinced of their tearful remorse at having failed the white fawn but otherwise had not been able to get any useful information from them i asked to see the tent sertorius led me there himself before we entered he glanced at eco the boy has seen death before he said yes why do you ask its not a gory sightbelieve me ive seen gore still its not pretty to look at he gave no further explanation but led us into the tent a little pen had been erected inside with straw scattered on the ground along with pails of water and fresh grass there was also outside the pen a little sleeping cot upon which lay the girl we had seen in the generals entourage the previous day she was dressed in the same white gown but the white scarf was no longer around her head so that her hair lay in a shimmering black pool around her white face her legs were straight and her hands were folded on her chest she might almost have been sleeping except for the unnatural waxy paleness of her flesh and the circle of bruised chafed skin around her throat is this how you found her i asked no said sertorius she was there in front of the pen lying crumpled on the ground who was she just a girl from one of the celtic tribes their priests said that only a virgin should be allowed to feed and groom the white fawn this girl volunteered it brought great honor to her family her name was liria where is her white scarf the one she wore around her hair you are observant finder the scarf is missing do you think i reached toward the marks on her throat a scarf would be one way of strangling someone sertorius nodded gravely she must have tried to stop them the guards were drugged which means that liria should have been drugged as well she always ate the same food but last night she may have fasted she did that sometimes she claimed that the white fawn would order her to fast to keep herself pure when they came to take the fawn she must have woken up and they strangled her to keep her from crying out but why didnt they simply kill the fawn instead of kidnapping her sertorius sighed this land is crawling with superstition gordianus omens and portents are in every breath and a man cant take a piss without some god or other looking over his shoulder i suspect that whoever did this had no intention of murdering anyone what they wanted what they intended was that the fawn should simply disappear dont you see as if she had fled on her own as if diana had abruptly deserted me to my fate what would my spanish soldiers make of that can you understand what a disaster that would be for me gordianus he stared at the dead girl then tore his gaze away and paced back and forth in the small space before the pen the kidnappers added murder to their crime that was sacrilege enough though liria wasnt really a priestess just a girl from a humble family who happened still to be a virgin but they would never had killed the fawn that would have defeated their purpose to kill the emissary of diana would be an unforgivable atrocity that would only strengthen the resolve of the tribes to fend off such an impious enemy thats why im certain the fawn is still alive and unharmed ive tried to keep this quiet gordianus but i think the rumor has already begun to spread among the men that the fawn is missing the roman soldiers will suspect the truth i imagine that she was kidnapped for political reasons but the nativesthe natives will think that the gods have turned against me is their faith in the white fawn really so great oh yes thats why ive used it as a powerful tool to bind them to me powerful but dangerous superstition can be turned against the man who uses it you see i should have guarded her better do you believe in the white fawn yourself sertorius does she speak to you he looked at me shrewdly im surprised that you even ask such a question gordianus im a roman general not a credulous spaniard the white fawn is nothing more than a device of statecraft must i explain one day my spies inform me of pompeys movements the next day i announce that the white fawn whispered in my ear that pompey will be seen in a certain place at a certain time and sure enough he is whenever i learn a secret or see into the future the knowledge comes to me from the white fawnofficially whenever i have to give an order that the natives find hard to stomachsuch as burning one of their own villages or putting a popular man to death i tell them it must be done because the white fawn says so it makes things much much easier and whenever things look uncertain and the natives are on the verge of losing heart i tell them that the white fawn has promised me a victory they find their courage then they rally and they make the victory happen do you think me blasphemous for resorting to such a device the best generals have always done such things to shore up their mens morale look at sulla before a battle he always made sure his troops would catch him mumbling to a little image he stole from the oracle at delphi the deity invariably promised him victory and marius toohe kept a syrian wisewoman in his entourage who could always be counted on to foresee disaster for his enemies too bad she failed him in the end even alexander pulled such tricks do you know the story once when things looked bleak before a battle his priests called for a blood sacrifice while the sheep was being prepared at the altar alexander painted the letters n i backwards on the palms of one hand and k e on the other the priest cut open the sheep pulled out the steaming liver and placed it in alexanders hands alexander turned it over to show his men and sure enough there it was written on the liver in letters no one could mistakethe greek word for victory and your device was the white fawn sertorius stopped his pacing and looked me in the eye here in spain the local tribes especially the celts have a special belief in the mystical power of white animals a good general makes note of such beliefs when the hunters brought dianara to me that day dianara did he look slightly embarrassed i call the white fawn dianara after the goddess why not when they brought her to me i saw at once what could be done with her i made her my divine counselor and the strategy has paid off handsomely but now sertorius began to pace again my scouts tell me that metellus has joined pompey on the other side of the sucro if my spaniards find out that the fawn is missing and im forced into another battle the result could be an utter disaster what man will fight for a general whom the gods have deserted my only chance now is to withdraw west into the highlands as quickly as i can but in the meantime the fawn must be found he gave me a look that was at once desperate and demanding im a finder quintus sertorius not a hunter this is a kidnapping gordianus not a chase ill pay you well bring dianara back to me and i shall reward you handsomely i considered my commission from gaius claudius was completed i had verified young mamercuss whereabouts delivered the letter and given him every chance to accompany me back to rome i was a free agent again in a foreign land and a powerful man was seeking my help on the other hand to aid a renegade general in the field would surely in the view of the roman senate constitute an act of treason i liked sertorius because he was honest and brave and in the long run the underdog i liked him even better when he named an actual figure as a reward i agreed if i could not return an errant young man to his grandfather perhaps i could return a missing fawn to her master sertorius allowed me to question the two guards who had been drugged i could only agree with his own assessment that the men were truly remorseful for what had happened and that they had nothing useful to tell neither did any of the other watchmen no one had seen or heard a thing it was as if the moon herself had reached down to fetch the white fawn home by the time eco and i arrived back in sucro that afternoon the tavern was full of locals all thirsty for wine and hungry for any news they could get of the missing white fawn the secret was out and rumors were flying wild i listened attentively one never knows when a bit of gossip may be helpful some said that the fawn had actually deserted sertorius long ago this was patently false since i had seen the creature myself others claimed that the fawn had died and that sertorius had buried it and was only pretending that it had disappeared a few said that the fawn had been stolen but no one reported the death of the virgin perhaps the wildest rumor and the most ominous asserted that the fawn had showed up in pompeys camp and was now his confidant none of this was very helpful after the local crowd dispersed to their homes for the night i asked our host what he made of it all not a one of them knows a blasted thing all a bunch of windbags lacro said this cheerily enough and why not he must have turned a nice profit on the sale of wine that day and quite a few of the crowd had stayed on for dinner the only story that rang true to my ears was the one about the fawn being seen in the marshes whats this i missed that one thats because the fellow who told it wasnt shouting his head off like the fools who had nothing to say he was here behind the counter talking to me an old friend of mine we sometimes go trapping in the marshes together he was there early this morning says he caught a glimpse of something white off in the distance in a stand of swamp trees perhaps he saw a bird too big for a bird he said and it moved like a beast from here to there along the ground did he get a closer look he tried but by the time he reached the trees there was nothing to be seennothing except fresh hoof prints in the mud the prints of a young deer of that he was certain and footprints as well footprints two men he said one on each side of the fawn eco gripped my arm and shook it i agreed this was very interesting did your friend follow these tracks no he turned back and went about his business checking his traps lacro raised an eyebrow he didnt say as much but from the look on his face i think he felt afraid when he saw those tracks this is a fellow who knows the marshes like his own mothers face knows what belongs there and what doesnt and if somethings not right he saw those tracks and felt a bit of awe standing where dianas gift had passed mark my words that white fawn is in the marshes eco nudged me and put his hands to his throat miming strangulation lacro looked puzzled i translated if your friend was afraid to follow those tracks then his instincts probably are good at least one person had already been murdered by the fawns abductors i dont quite follow you i looked at him steadily yesterday you spoke well of sertorius i did and you spoke with reverence about the white fawn dianas gift lacro i want to tell you a secret something very important so what are you waiting for who can keep secrets better than an innkeeper he hooked his thumb and gestured to the sleeping quarters upstairs as if alluding to all the trysts which had taken place under his roof that would never be revealed by his telling and do you think this friend of yours could keep a secret as well i said and more importantly do you think he might agree to guide a couple of strangers into the marshes theres likely to be some dangerbut therell be a fee in it too a fee for you both before daybreak the next morning we set out for the marshes lacro and his friend who was called stilensis led the way eco and i followed behind we came to the stand of trees where stilensis had seen the tracks they were still visible in the mud picked out sharply by the first slanting rays of sunlight we followed them in places where the ground was too hard or too soft the trail seemed to vanish at least to my eyes but our experienced guides were able to discern even the faintest traces occasionally even they lost the trail and when that happened they would patiently circle about until they found it again sometimes i could see how they did it by spotting a broken twig or a crumpled leaf at other times it seemed to me that they were guided by some hidden instinct or simple luck perhaps lacro would say that diana showed them the way they also seemed to sense by some unknown faculty the moment when we came within earshot of our prey at the same moment lacro and stilensis both turned and gestured for us to be utterly silent as for the enemy there were only two of them as the tracks had indicated but the tracks had also indicated by their size and depth that the men making them were large fellows with large shoes and heavy bodies fortunately for us they were still asleep when we came upon them they had no tent and had made no fire they slept on a bed of leaves with light blankets to cover them lacro and stilensis had brought their hunting bows while they notched arrows and took aim eco and i yanked away the mens blankets they woke at once scrambled to their feet then froze when they saw the arrows aimed at them they cursed in some native tongue lacro asked them what they had done with the white fawn the men grumbled and pointed toward a thick patch of bushes in a little clearing eco and i came upon the creature she was tied to a small tree asleep with her legs folded beneath het at our approach she stirred and lifted her head i expected her to scramble up and try to bolt away instead she stared at us sleepily and blinked several times then threw back her head and seemed to yawn she slowly and methodically unfolded her limbs and got to her feet then sauntered toward us and lifted her face to be nuzzled eco let out a gasp of delight as he stroked the back of his hand against the shimmering white fur beneath her eyes we marched our prisoners through the marsh and then along the river road with eco leading the fawn by her leash or as often as not being led by her we stopped short of sertoriuss camp and while the others waited in a secluded spot by the river i went to give the general the news i arrived just in time only a single tentthe generalswas still standing the troops had already begun the westward march toward the highlands sertorius and his staff were busily packing wagons and seeing to the final details of disbanding the camp sertorius was the first to see me he froze for an instant then strode toward me his face seemed to glow in the morning light its good news isnt it i nodded is she well yes and the scoundrels who took herdid you capture them as well two men both native spaniards i knew it i woke up this morning with a feeling that something wonderful would happen where is she take me to her at once no wait he turned and called to his staff come along all of you wonderful news come and see among the officers i saw mamercus carrying a cabinet out of the generals tent put that down mamercus and come see what the finder has caught for us shouted sertorius something white and two blackhearted spaniards with her mamercus looked confused for a moment then put down the cabinet he nodded and stepped back into the tent come gordianus take me to her at once said sertorius pulling at my arm on the banks of the sucro the general and his fawn were reunited i dont think i had ever seen a roman general weep before i certainly know that i had never seen one pick up a fawn and carry it about in his arms like a baby for all his protestations that the white fawn was only a tool of statecraft a cynical means of exploiting superstitions he did not share i think that the creature meant much more than that to sertorius while she might not have whispered to him in the voice of diana or foretold the future the white fawn was the visible sign of the gods favor without which every man is naked before his enemies what i saw on the banks of the sucro was the exultation of a man whose luck had deserted him and then had returned in the blink of an eye but sertorius was a roman general and not given to undue sentimentality even about his own destiny after a while he put down the fawn and turned to the two spaniards we had captured he spoke to them in their own dialect lacro whispered a translation in my ear they had treated the fawn well sertorius said and had not harmed her that was wise and showed a modicum of respect for the goddess but they had flouted the dignity of a roman general and had interfered with the will of the goddess and a young virgin had been murdered for that they would be punished the two men comported themselves with great dignity considering that they were likely to be slain on the spot they conferred with each other for a moment then one of them spoke they were only hirelings they explained they knew nothing of a murdered girl they had merely agreed to meet a man at the edge of the camp two nights ago he had brought the fawn to them wrapped in a blanket they were to hide with the fawn in the marsh until sertorius and his army were gone they would never have harmed the creature nor would they have harmed the girl who kept her sertorius told them that he had suspected as much that one of his own menindeed someone on his own staff with adequate knowledge of the generals routine and the workings of the camp must have been behind the kidnapping if the two spaniards were willing to point out this man the severity of their own punishment might be considerably mitigated the two men conferred again they agreed sertorius stepped back and gestured to the members of his assembled staff the two spaniards looked from face to face then shook their heads the man was not among them sertorius frowned and surveyed his staff he stiffened i saw a flash of pain in his eye he sighed and turned to me one of my men isnt here finder yes i see he must have stayed behind sertorius ordered some of his men to stay and guard the fawn the rest of us hurried back with him to the camp look there his horse is still here said sertorius then he hasnt fled i said perhaps he had no reason to flee perhaps he had nothing to do with the kidnapping but i knew this could not be the case even as eco and i followed sertorius into his tent amid the clutter of folded cots and chairs mamercus lay quivering on the ground transfixed on his own sword his right hand still gripped the pommel in his left hand he clutched the virgins white scarf he was still alive we knelt beside him he began to whisper we bent our heads close i never meant to kill the girl he said she was asleep and should have stayed that way from the drug but she woke i couldnt let her scream i meant to pull the scarf across her mouth but then it was around her throat and she wouldnt stop struggling she was stronger than you might think sertorius shook his head but why mamercus why kidnap the fawn you were my man no never said mamercus i was pompeys man one of his agents in rome hired me to be pompeys spy they said you would trust me take me into your confidence because of my father they wanted someone to steal the white fawn from you not to kill it just to steal it you see gordianus i never betrayed my grandfather tell him that but why did you take up with pompey i said he grimaced for money of course we were ruined how could i ever have a career in rome without money pompey offered me more than enough i shook my head you should have come back to rome with me mamercus managed a rueful smile at first i thought you were a messenger from pompey i couldnt believe he could be so stupid to send a messenger for me into the camp in broad daylight then you said you came from my grandfather dear beloved grandfather i suppose the gods were trying to tell me something but it was too late my plan was set for that very night i couldnt turn back he coughed a trickle of blood ran from the corner of his mouth but turned your visit to my advantage i showed sertorius the letter vowed that i had no intention of leaving him not even to please my grandfather how could he not trust me after that sertorius forgive me but gordianus he released his sword and blindly gripped my arm with his other hand he still clutched the scarf dont tell grandfather about the girl tell him i was a spy if you want tell him i died doing my duty tell him i had the courage to fall on my own sword but not about the girl his grip loosened the light went out of his eyes the scarf slipped from his fingers i looked at sertorius on his face i saw anger disappointment grief confusion i realized that mamercus claudius like the white fawn had meant more to him than he would say mamercus had been a sort of talisman for him in the way that a son is a talisman a sign of the gods love a pointer to a brighter future but mamercus had been none of those things and the truth was hard for sertorius to bear how had he described mamercus to me bright curious clever wholly committed to the cause how painfully ironic those words seemed now i think that in that moment sertorius saw that the white fawn counted for nothing after all that his days were numbered that the might of rome would never cease hounding him until he was destroyed and all traces of his rival state were obliterated from the earth he picked up the scarf and pressed it to his face covering his eye and for that i was thankful the voyage back to rome seemed long and tedious yet not nearly long enough i was not looking forward to meeting with gaius claudius and giving him the news i had done exactly as he asked i had found his grandson delivered the letter invited mamercus to flee i had accepted the task and completed it when sertorius asked me to find the white fawn how could i have known the end none of us could have known the outcome of my trip to spain least of all gaius claudius and yet if gaius had not sent me to find his grandson mamercus might still have been alive would the old man be able to bear the bitterness of it that seeking only to bring the boy safely home he himself had instigated the events that led to the boys destruction and yet surely mamercus alone was responsible for his downfall he had deceived his grandfather no matter that he loved him had been a spy for a man and a cause he did not care about had murdered an innocent girl and for what all for money nothing but that i should not waste a single tear on the boy i told myself leaning over the rail of the ship that carried me back to rome it was night the sky was black and the moon was full her face spread upon the dark waters like a great pool of white light perhaps i did shed a tear for mamercus claudius but the cold breeze plucked it at once from my cheek and dropped it into the vastness of the salty sea there it was lost in an instant and surely never counted for anything in the scales of justice either as reckoned by mortals or by the gods something fishy in pompeii taste it said lucius claudius go ontaste it i wrinkled my nose strange as it may sound i was not particularly fond of garum never mind that ninetynine out of a hundred romans adore it and add it to ninetynine out of a hundred dishes spooning it over everything from sausages to egg custard from asparagus to honey cakes garum goes with everything goes the popular saying we sat in the garden of luciuss opulent house on the palatine hill a slave stood before mea rather beautiful young slave for in all things lucius was used to having the bestholding a small silver dish in each hand in each dish was a dark glistening dollop of garum taste it insisted lucius i dabbed a finger into the thick oily sauce in the dish to my left i smelled it first breathing in the sharp odor of pickled fish reluctantly i popped my finger into my mouth the taste was powerful salty and slightly tangy the spices playing with remarkable complexity upon my tongue i smiled actually thats not bad not bad at all of course its not bad said lucius his fair chubby cheeks blushing as red as the curls on his head thats the finest garum on the market made exclusively at my manufactory outside pompeii the only reason you claim not to be fond of garum gordianus is because youre used to the awful stuff thats passed off as garum smelly pots of fermented fish entrails with a few crushed olives and a sprig of rosemary thrown in for seasoning foul stuff this is the real thing made from farmfattened sardines macerated in salt and seasoned with my own secret recipe of spices and herbs aged for a full month before its scooped into amphorae for shipmentnot the mere twenty days that some of my competitors try to get away with i dabbed my finger into the garum and took another taste its really quite delicious this would be very good on meats or vegetables or you could simply eat it on a piece of flatbread or straight out of the jar yes i could get used to eating this i suppose its expensive very but help me with my problem gordianus and you shall have a lifetime supply free of charge and what would that problem be taste the other sample i took a sip of wine to cleanse my palate then dipped my finger into the dollop of garum to my right i smelled it popped my finger between my lips closed my eyes to savor the heady aftertaste that suffused my entire mouth then dipped my finger to try a second helping lucius leaned toward me and obviously im no expert on garum but yes yes i would say that these two samples are identical the same robust yet subtle taste the same sublimely slippery texture no difference whatsoever lucius nodded gravely and thats the problem the first sample you tasted is my own brand of garum the second is from my competitor that blasted marcus fabricius fabricius his little garum manufactory is just a stones throw from my own down in pompeii i ship all over the world while fabricius sells most of his product out of a little shop here in rome every so often i purchase some his garum just to remind myself what an inferior recipe tastes like i bought this batch today imagine my shock when i tasted it it does seems unlikely that garum from different makers could be so completely identical unlikely impossible fabricius must have stolen my secret recipe so it happened for the promise of a lifetimes supply of the worlds best garumand because lucius claudius is my good friend and steadfast patronthat i found myself in the vicinity of pompeii a few days later taking a tour of luciuss garum manufactory with the foreman a tall wizened slave named acastus i carried a letter of introduction from lucius and posed as a wouldbe investor the impressive compound was situated beside a stream that emptied into the bay at the foot of mount vesuvius patios surrounded large sunken tanks in which the sardines were fattened the murky water glistened with masses of darting silver fish a warehouse held great stores of salt herbs and spices nearby there was a shed where artisans crafted clay vessels storage pots for spices as well as special pots for making the garum and amphorae for transporting it were made onsite there was a large stable full of horses and wagons for transporting the finished product overland to various italian cities as well as a waterfront facility for loading ships that would take the garum to markets as far away as alexandria among those who could afford it the garum of lucius claudius was a much soughtafter highly valuable commodity the integrity of which he wished devoutly to safeguard at the center of the compound was the large charmingly rustic house where lucius stayed when he was in residence attached to the house were the guest quarters where i would be staying the upper story contained acastuss office where pigeonhole shelves were stuffed with correspondence and tables were stacked high with ledgers from his balcony beyond the warehouse i could see the glittering bay dotted with sails closer at hand beyond the wooded cleft by the stream i could see the roofs and terraces of a neighboring compound whats that place i asked acastus squinted oh thats the manufactory of marcus fabricius they make garum too or something they call garum of no interest to a serious investor i assure you their product is quite inferior i see can you show me exactly how the garum is prepared whats that you say i repeated my request more loudly certainly wheezed acastus he seemed so old and frail that any master but lucius would likely have replaced him long ago but lucius had a kindly streak despite his patrician snobbery acastus he had assured me was the most trustworthy of all the foremen on all his farms and manufactories for garum was only one of luciuss moneymaking enterprises acastus oversaw production scheduled shipments billed customers and kept the books at all these tasks lucius told me acastus excelled but a foreman must be watchdog as well as overseer if something odd was going on at the garum manufactory were acastuss eyes and ears sharp enough to notice with a doddering gait he led me toward a terrace shaded by olive trees where various slaves toiled over large clay pots garum was invented by the greeks you know he said in the old days it was a luxury that only the wealthiest romans could afford nowadays everyone eats it every day on everythingor at least they eat something they call garum whether its worthy of the name or not the best garum is still quite costly here well watch this fellow make up a batch patro is your name isnt it yes foreman a brighteyed young slave stood before a very large widemouthed flatbottomed clay pot that came up to his knees the bottom of the pot was already covered with a mixture of aromatic dried herbs i leaned over the pot and breathed in the smells of dill coriander celery fennel oregano and mint no doubt there were other spices my nose was too untrained to discern who mixes the spices i said whats that i said who mixes the master comes down from rome and does it himself every other month or so said acastus this confirmed what lucius had already told me but others must know exactly which spices are stocked in the warehouse the recipe cant be a secret acastus laughed the ingredients arent the secret its the proportions that make the difference the master does the measuring and the mixing himself with no one else present hes got a most refined palate does the master there are over thirty spices in all youd be hardpressed to reproduce that exact mixture by tasting the finished product or haphazardly trying this or that amount patro meanwhile had fetched another pot this one filled with sardines these he spread over the layer of spices the fatter the fish the better commented acastus over the sardines patro spread a thick layer of salt two fingers high said acastus more is too salty less not salty enough patro repeated these three layersspices fish saltuntil the container was full he then placed a lid on the pot sealed the rim with pitch and with the help of another slavefor the pot must have been quite heavycarried it to a sunny spot nearby now we let the mixture sit in the sun for seven days no more no less after that well stir it every day for twenty days and then acastus kissed his fingertips the finest garum on earth i taste each batch myself before its shipped out he flashed a gaptoothed smile you were wondering werent you why the master has kept me on long past my prime not for my squinting eyes or my halfdeaf ears for this he tapped his nose and this he stuck out his tongue i heard laughter behind me and turned to see patro and the other slave cover their mouths and look away acastus squinted in their direction did you hear squirrels chattering he said terrible pests known to open the garum pots during fermentation and scatter it all about we have to throw the whole batch away when that happens would it spoil if you simply resealed it probably not but we cant take the chance the master has a standard to maintain how often does this happen perhaps once a month i suppose you note the loss in your ledgers of course i keep strict accounting of all expenditures and losses including spoilage its not a major problem still i feed the workers fresh squirrel as often as i can so as to thin the ranks of those nasty pests that night acastus and i dined not on squirrel but on herb bread and liver pate with generous helpings of garum acastus went to bed early i stayed up for a while examining the ledgers with his permission eventually i went to bed myself with instructions to be awakened at the beginning of the workday a slave woke me at dawn i roused myself went down to the stream to splash my face and ate a crust of bread on the terrace acastus was not yet up but the rest of the compound was stirring i strolled over to the fermentation area from a distance i saw young patro with his hands on his hips shaking his head can you believe it theyve done it again those damned squirrels it appeared that the phenomenon acastus had described had occurred during the night the lid of the container which patro had sealed the previous day lay on the grass salt was scattered about and a whole layer of sardines was missing mischievous little pests arent they i said patro smiled more hungry than mischievous dont you imagine either way theyre only as the gods made them well i suppose i should get rid of this batch then let acastus know here motho come help me carry it down to the stream together they lifted the open container walking slowly and awkwardly they headed toward the wooded cleft beside the stream i headed for the cleft myself walking fast and taking a different route i was waiting on the opposite bank when they arrived instead of emptying the contents of the pot in the rushing water they crossed the shallow stream and began to climb the opposite bank huffing and puffing and where might you fellows be going i said they froze in their tracks and gazed up at me blankly we that is to say patro frantically tried to think of some explanation i think youre headed for fabriciuss place to sell him that pot of garum hell only need to add some sardines and salt to the top seal it up and let it ferment a month from now he can sell it at his little shop in rome and claim that its every bit as delicious as the famous garum of lucius claudiussince it is the garum of lucius claudius please this is the first time weve ever no patro youve been doing this about once a month for almost half a year thats how often such a loss is noted in acastuss ledgers butwe didnt spoil this batch i was in my bed all night and so was motho i know you didnt nor did a squirrel i did it myself to see what would happen i imagine that the very first time it happened it was the act of a squirrel or some other nocturnal pest and you thought what a pity to waste all that lovely valuable garum why not sell it to the neighbor what do you two do with the money fabricius pays you enjoy a night of wine and women down in pompeii their faces turned red i thought so but what was it you said about the squirrels theyre only as the gods made them hard to blame you for taking advantage of the occasional accidentexcept that what began as an accident has become a regular occurrence if it happens that you two have been damaging batches of garum on purpose you cant prove that said patro his voice rising to a desperate pitch no but i intend to stop it from happening again what do you say ill turn a blind eye to this mornings mischief in exchange for your promise that youll never sell garum to fabricius again the two of them looked very relieved and very repentant very well now lets see you empty that spoiled batch of garum in the stream on the way back to rome i pondered the dilemma i had gotten myself into how could i assure lucius claudius that the problem had been taken care of without getting those two young slaves into trouble and further how could i let lucius know without getting acastus into trouble that the foreman needed an assistant with a sharper pair of eyes and ears and a more suspicious temperament i would think of something after all a lifetimes supply of the worlds best garum was at stake archimedess tomb when i learned that you and your son were here in syracuse gordianus i sent tiro to find you at once you have no idea what a comfort it is seeing a familiar face out here in the provinces cicero smiled and raised his cup i returned the gesture eco did likewise and the three of us sipped in unison the local vintage wasnt bad i appreciate the welcome i said which was true indeed tiros unexpected appearance at the dingy inn down at the harbor where eco and i were staying had taken me by complete surprise and the invitation to dine with cicero and to spend the night at his rented house surprised me even more in the five years since cicero had first employed me to assist him in the defense of sextus roscius accused of parricide our relationship had been strictly professional cicero generally treated me with a cool diffidence i was merely the finder useful for digging up dirt i regarded him with wary respect as an advocate and rising politician cicero seemed genuinely interested in justice and truth but in the end he was after all an advocate and a politician in other words we were on friendly terms but not exactly friends so i found it curious that he should have invited eco and me to dine with him purely for pleasure his twelve months as a government administrator here in sicily must have been lonely for him indeed if the sight of my face could bring him much enjoyment youre not exactly at the end of the world here i felt obliged to point out sicily isnt all that far from rome true true but far enough to make a man appreciate what rome has to offer and far enough so that all the gossip gets a bit distorted on the way here you must tell me everything thats been happening in the forum gordianus surely your friends and family keep you informed they write of course and some of them have visited but none of them have your he searched for the word your particular perspective looking up at the world he meant instead of down ah but now that my year of service is up i shall soon be back in rome myself what a relief it shall be to leave this wretched place behind me whats that the boy is saying on the dining couch beside me my mute son had put down his cup and was shaping thoughts in the air with his hands his pictures were clear enough to me if not to cicero high mountains broad beaches stony cliffs eco likes sicily or at least the little weve seen of it on this trip he says that the scenery here is beautiful true enough cicero agreed though not so true of the people the greekspeaking population i thought you adored all things greek cicero all things greek perhaps but not all greeks he sighed greek culture is one thing gordianus the art the temples the plays the philosophy the mathematics the poetry butwell since my other guests havent yet arrived i shall speak freely roman to roman the greeks who gave us all that marvelous culture are dust now and have been for centuries as for their farflung progeny especially in these partswell its sad to see how little they resemble their colonizing ancestors consider this city syracuse once a beacon of light and learning to the whole of the mediterranean this side of italythe athens of the west the rival of alexandria at its peak two hundred years ago hiero ruled here and men like archimedes walked the beach now one finds only the remnants of a proud race a degraded people rude and uneducated without manners or morals the farflung colonies of the greeks have forgotten their forebears the mantle of civilization has been taken up by us gordianus by rome we are the true heir to greek culture not the greeks only romans nowadays have the refinement to truly appreciate say a statue by polyclitus or is it that only romans have the money to afford such things i suggested or the armies to bring them home by force cicero wrinkled his nose to show that he found my questions inappropriate and called for more wine beside me eco fidgeted on his couch the early education of my adopted son had been sorely neglected and despite my best efforts his progress was still hampered by his inability to speak at fifteen he was almost a man but talk of culture especially from a snob like cicero quickly bored him your year of foreign service has made you even more of a roman patriot i remarked but if your term is up and if you find the company of the greek sicilians so lacking i wonder that you dont leave the place at once right now im playing tourist actually i was posted to the other half of the island you see over in lilybaeum on the west coast syracuse is a stopover on my way home a last chance to see the sights before i quit sicily for good dont misunderstand me gordianus this is a beautiful island as your son says resplendent with natural wonders there are many fine buildings and works of art and many sites of great historical importance so much has happened in sicily in the centuries since the greeks colonized it the golden reign of hiero the great mathematical discoveries of his friend archimedes the carthaginian invasions the roman takeover theres plenty for a visitor to see and do here in syracuse he sipped his wine but i dont suppose its pleasure thats brought you here gordianus eco and i are here strictly on business a fellow back in rome hired me to follow the trail of a business partner who absconded with the profits i tracked the missing man here to syracuse but today i learned that hes sailed on probably east to alexandria my instructions were to go only as far as sicily so as soon as i can book passage i plan to head back to rome with the bad news and collect my fee ah but now that weve found one another here in a strange city you must stay with me for a while gordianus cicero sounded sincere but then all politicians do i suspected the invitation for an extended stay was merely a polite gesture what a remarkable livelihood you have he went on hunting down murderers and scoundrels of course one hardly meets a better class of people being in government service especially in the provinces ah but heres tiro ciceros young secretary gave me a smile and mussed ecos hair as he passed behind our couches eco pretended to take offense and put up his fists like a boxer tiro indulged him and did likewise tiro had an affable unassuming nature i had always found him easier to deal with and to like than his master what is it tiro said cicero your other three guests have arrived master shall i show them in yes tell the kitchen slaves that they can bring out the first course as soon as were all settled cicero turned back to me i hardly know these fellows myself i was told by friends in lilybaeum that i should meet them while i was here in syracuse dorotheus and agathinus are important businessmen partners in a shipping firm margero is said to be a poet or what passes for a poet in syracuse nowadays despite his disdainful tone cicero made a great show of welcoming his guests as they entered the room springing up from his couch and extending his arms to give them a politicians embrace he could hardly have been more unctuous had they been a trio of undecided voters back in rome the meal much of it harvested from the sea was excellent and the company more genial than cicero had led me to expect dorotheus was a heavyset roundfaced man with a great black beard and a booming voice he joked continually during the meal and his good humor was contagious eco particularly succumbed to it often joining his own odd but charming bray to dorotheuss pealing laughter from certain bits of conversation that passed between dorotheus and his business partner i gathered that both men had cause to be in high spirits having recently struck some very lucrative deals agathinus however was more restrained than his partner he smiled and laughed quietly at dorotheuss jokes but said little physically he was quite the opposite of dorotheus as well a tall slender man with a narrow face a slit of a mouth and a long nose they seemed a perfect example of how a successful partnership can sometimes result from the union of two markedly different natures the third syracusan margero certainly looked and played the part of a pensive greek poet he was younger than his wealthy companions and quite handsome with ringlike curls across his forehead heavy lips and a darkbrowed moody countenance i gathered that his verses were quite fashionable at the moment in syracusan intellectual circles and i sensed that he was more an ornament than a friend to the two businessmen he seldom laughed and showed no inclination to recite from his poems which was probably for the best considering ciceros snobbishness for his part cicero only occasionally struck a patronizing tone there was talk of business regarding the port of syracuse and the sicilian grain harvest talk of the seasons dramatic festivals at the old greek theater in the city talk of the current fashions among the syracusan women who always lagged a few years behind the women of rome as cicero felt obliged to point out much of the conversation was in greek and eco whose greek was limited inevitably grew restless eventually i dismissed him knowing he would find the conversation much more fascinating if he could eavesdrop from the kitchen with tiro eventually over fresh cups of wine after the final course of savory onions stewed in honey with mustard seeds cicero steered the conversation to the past he had spent his year in sicily making himself an expert on the islands long and tumultuous history and seemed quite pleased at the chance to demonstrate his knowledge to a native audience little by little his voice fell into a speechifying rhythm that invited no interruption what he had to say was fascinatingi had never heard so many gruesome details of the great slave revolts that wracked sicily in the previous generationbut after a while i could see that his syracusan guests were growing as restless as eco cicero grew especially impassioned when he turned to hiero the ruler of syracuse during its golden age now there was a ruler an example to all the other hellenic tyrants who reigned over the greek cities in his day but then you must know all about the glory of hieros reign margero must i said margero blinking and clearing his throat like a man awakening from a nap being a poet i mean theocritushis sixteenth idyll cicero prompted margero merely blinked again the sixteenth idyll of theocritus said cicero the poem in which he extols the virtues of hieros reign and looks forward to his ultimate victory over carthage surely you know the poem margero blinked his heavy lashes and shrugged cicero frowned disapprovingly then forced a smile i mean those verses of course which begin this is ever the business of muses of poets to sing praise to gods to sing hymns to heroes surely margero the young poet stirred himself it is vaguely familiar dorotheus laughed softly agathinuss thin lips compressed into a smile i realized that margero was having cicero on cicero oblivious prompted him with more lines bravely the men of syracuse grip their spears and lift up their wickerwork shields among them hiero girds himself like a hero of old with a lions head atop his helmet horsehair margero grunted whats that with a plume of horsehair atop his helmet said margero indolently raising an eyebrow lions head indeed cicero reddened yes youre rightwith a plume of horsehair then you do know the poem slightly allowed margero of course theocritus was just blowing hot air to try to get hieros favor he was a poet without a patron at that particular moment thought he might enjoy the climate here in syracuse so he dashed off an idyll to get hieros attention figured the tyrant might be shopping for an epic poet to record his victories over carthage so he sent some sycophantic scribbles by way of applying for the post a pity hiero didnt take him up on the offertoo busy killing carthaginians i suppose so theocritus dashed off another encomium to king ptolemy in alexandria and landed a job scribbling on the nile instead a pity how we poets are always at the whim of the rich and powerful this was more than margero had said all evening cicero eyed him uncertainly ah yes be that as it may hiero did drive back the carthaginians whether any poets were there to record it or not and we remember him as a great ruler in rome anyway and of course among educated men his friend archimedes is even more famous cicero looked for a nod from his guests but the three of them only stared back at him dumbly archimedes the mathematician he prompted not a philosopher to be sure but still among the great minds of his time he was hieros righthand man a thinker in the abstract mostly consumed with the properties of spheres and cylinders and cubic equations but quite a hand at engineering catapults and war machines when he set himself to it they say that hiero couldnt have driven the carthaginians from sicily without him ah said agathinus dryly that archimedes i thought you meant archimedes the fishmonger that bald fellow with a stall on the wharves oh is the name really that common cicero seemed on the verge of apprehending that he was being mocked but pressed on determined to lecture his syracusan guests about the most famous syracusan who ever lived i refer of course to the archimedes who said give me a place to stand on and i will move the earth and demonstrated as much to hiero in miniature by inventing pulleys and levers by which the king was able to move a drydocked ship by a mere flick of his wrist the archimedes who constructed an extraordinary clockwork mechanism of the sun moon and five planets in which the miniature spheres all moved together in exact accordance with their celestial models the archimedes who is perhaps most famous for the solution he devised to the problem of the golden crown of hiero ah now you are bound to lose me said dorotheus ive never had a head for logic and mathematics remember agathinus how our old tutor used to have weeping fits trying to get me to understand pythagoras and all that ah but the principle of the golden crown is quite simple to explain said cicero brightly do you know the story in a vague general roundabout way said dorotheus with laughing eyes ill make the tale brief promised cicero it seems that hiero gave a certain weight of gold to an artisan with a commission to make him a crown soon enough the man returned with a splendid gold crown but hiero heard a rumor that the artisan had pilfered some of the gold and had substituted silver for the core of the crown it weighed the correct amount but was the crown made of solid gold or not the piece was exquisitely crafted and hiero hated to damage it but he could think of no way to determine its composition short of melting it down or cutting into it so he called on archimedes who had helped him with so many problems in the past and asked if he could find a solution archimedes thought and thought but to no avail gold was heavier than silver that much he knew and a blind man could tell the two apart by weighing them in his hands but how could one tell if a given object was made of silver covered with gold they say that archimedes was sitting in a tub at the baths noticing how the level of the water rose and fell as the bathers got in and out when the solution suddenly came to him he was so excited that he jumped from the tub and ran naked through the streets shouting eureka eurekai have found it i have found it dorotheus laughed all the world knows that part of the tale cicero and for better or worse thats how the world pictures archimedesas an absentminded old genius a naked absentminded old genius agathinus amended tartly not a pretty picture said margero a man of a certain age should know better than to subject others to his bony nakedness even in private it seemed to me that he shot a caustic look at agathinus who stared straight ahead i realized that the two of them had hardly said a word to each other or exchanged a glance all night gentlemen we digress said cicero the point of the story is the solution that archimedes devised ah now this is the part that ive never been quite able to follow said dorotheus laughing but its really quite simple cicero assured him this is what archimedes did he took an amount of gold of a certain weighta single roman uncia lets say he placed the uncia of gold in a vessel of water and marked how high the waterline rose then he took an uncia of silver placed it in the same vessel and marked the waterline being a lighter substance the uncia of silver was larger than the uncia of gold and so displaced more water and thus caused a higher waterline then archimedes took the crown and knowing the exact number of uncias of gold that hiero had given the artisan calculated how high it should cause the waterline to rise if the waterline rose higher than expected then the crown could not be made of solid gold and must contain some material of greater volume per uncia such as silver sure enough the crown displaced more water than it should have the artisan his deception discovered confessed to having covered a silver crown with gold i see said dorotheus slowly and without irony a light seemed genuinely to dawn in his eyes do you know cicero i have never before been able to grasp archimedess principle ah but you should it can be of great practical use to a man dealing in payments and commodities as you do yes i can see that said dorotheus nodding thoughtfully cicero smiled you see its really simple as most basic principles are but it takes a man like archimedes to discover such principles in the first place he gazed at his wine by the lamplight but absentminded he certainly was always drifting into his world of pure geometry at the baths they say he would even use himself as a tablet drawing geometrical shapes in the massage oil on his belly this image pleased dorotheus who slapped his own belly and laughed heartily even agathinus grinned margero merely raised an eyebrow thus archimedes met his death as absentmindedly absorbed in mathematics as ever said cicero but im sure you all know the story of his end already vaguely allowed agathinus oh but you must enlighten us said dorotheus very well if you insist after hiero died the romans occupied sicily to keep it as a bulwark against carthage on the day that syracuse was taken by the general marcellus archimedes was on the beach working out a theorem by drawing figures with a stick in the sand when a troop of roman soldiers came marching up archimedes who didnt even know that the city had been taken took no notice until the soldiers began to tramp across his drawings he made a rude remark he suggested that they all go copulate with their mothers as i recall said margero smiling languidly cicero cleared his throat at any rate one of the soldiers flew into a rage and killed archimedes on the spot had no idea that a preoccupation with mathematics could be so dangerous quipped agathinus straightfaced at least archimedes knew how to mind his own business said margero quietly again i thought i saw him glare at agathinus who showed no reaction cicero ignored the interruption when the roman general learned of the tragedy he was mortified of course he ordered a grand funeral procession and the construction of an elaborately ornamented tomb inscribed with the greatest of archimedess theorems and decorated with sculptures of the forms whose properties he discoveredthe sphere the cone the cylinder and so on i say where is the tomb of archimedes i should like to see it while im here agathinus and dorotheus looked at each other and shrugged margeros face was as unreadable as a cats do you mean to say that none of you knows the location of archimedess tomb is it not general knowledge somewhere in the old necropolis outside the city walls i suppose said agathinus vaguely not everyone is as preoccupied with their dead ancestors as you romans said margero but surely the tomb of a man as great as archimedes should be regarded as a shrine cicero suddenly stiffened his eyes flashed his jaw quivered eureka i have found it he was suddenly so animated that we all gave a start even the heavylidded margero gordianus the finder it was the fates who brought us two romans together here in syracuse i have a purpose here and so have you what are you talking about cicero what do you say to a bit of employment you shall locate the lost tomb of archimedes for meif it still existsand i shall restore it to its former glory it shall be the crowning achievement of my year in sicily brilliant who can doubt it was the fates who engineered this evening and its outcome who brought us all together we two romans and our new syracusan friends eureka i feel like archimedes in the bathing tub just dont go running naked though the streets quipped dorotheus his round body shaking with mirth the evening had come to a natural conclusion and the three syracusans made ready to leave cicero retired leaving it to tiro to show them out and to conduct eco and me to our beds at the door agathinus lingered behind his departing companions and drew me aside i take it that cicero is serious about hiring you to go looking for archimedess tomb tomorrow so it appears they call me finder after all agathinus pursed his thin lips and studied me with cool appraising eyes that betrayed a hint of amusement you seem to be a decent enough fellow gordianusfor a roman ah yes dont deny iti saw you laughing in silence tonight along with us while your countryman lectured us about hiero and archimedes as if we were schoolboys indeed as if he were the native syracusan not us but as i say you seem decent enough shall i do you a favor and tell you where to find the tomb you know its not exactly common knowledge but yes i know where it is yet you didnt tell cicero never i think you know why the knowitall from what ive heard hes more honest than most of the bureaucrats rome sends us but stillthe gall of the man but i like you gordianus and i like your son i liked the way he laughed at dorotheuss awful jokes shall i show you where to find the tomb of archimedes then you can show it to cicero or not as you pleaseand charge him a stiff fee for your services i hope i smiled i appreciate the favor agathinus where exactly is the tomb in the old necropolis outside the achradina gate about a hundred paces north of the road there are a lot of old monuments there its a bit of a maze my father showed me the tomb when i was a boy the inscriptions of the theorems had largely worn away but i remember the geometrical sculptures quite vividly the necropolis has fallen into neglect im afraid the monuments are all overgrown he thought for a moment its hard to give exact directions it would be easier simply to show you can you meet me outside the gate tomorrow morning youre a busy man agathinus i dont want to impose on you its no imposition so long as we do it first thing in the morning meet me an hour after dawn i nodded and agathinus departed how did the dinner go asked tiro as he showed us to our room i know that eco didnt think much of the evening he mimicked eco yawning meanwhile eco yawning for real tumbled backward onto a sleeping couch that looked infinitely more comfortable than the verminridden mats at the inn where we had been staying an evening is never too dull if it ends with a full stomach a roof over my head and the prospect of gainful employment i said as for the company dorotheus is likable enough if a bit loud and agathinus appears to be an alright fellow rather dourlooking i think he just has a very dry sense of humor and the poet margero was clearly in no mood to recite poetry he seemed to be rather preoccupied there was something going on between him and agathinus i think i can explain that offered tiro you werent in the room no but i was in the kitchen soaking up local gossip from the slaves agathinus and dorotheus are margeros patrons you see every poet needs patrons if hes to eat but lately theres been a chill between agathinus and margero a chill jealousy it seems theyre both paying court to the same pretty boy down at the gymnasium i see the two were rivals in love then margero was younger and more handsome than agathinus and could compose love poems but agathinus had the attractions of money and power clearly the two of them had not yet fallen out completelymargero still depended on agathinus for patronage agathinus still used the poet as an ornamentbut there was friction between them any other interesting gossip from the kitchen slaves only that agathinus and dorotheus just received payment for their largest shipment ever of imported goods from the east some people say that theyre now the richest men in syracuse no wonder cicero was advised to make friends with them do you need anything else before you retire asked tiro lowering his voice eco not even undressed was already softly snoring on his couch something to read perhaps there are some scrolls in the room that cicero uses for an office i ended the night curled under a coverlet on my couch puzzling by lamplight over a musty old scroll of the works of archimedes amazed at his genius here were such wonders as a method for determining the surface area of a sphere explained so lucidly that even i could almost understand it at length i came upon the proposition which had resulted from the problem of the gold crown proposed a solid heavier than a fluid will if placed in it descend to the bottom of the fluid and the solid will when weighed in the fluid be lighter than its true weight by the weight of the fluid yes well that much was obvious of course i read on let a be a solid heavier than the same volume of fluid and let g h represent its weight while g represents the weight of the same volume of the fluid this was not quite so clear and i was getting drowsy ciceros explanation had been easier to follow i pressed on take a solid b lighter than the same volume of the fluid and such that the weight of b is g while the weight of the same volume of the fluid is g h let a and b be now combined into one solid and immersed then since a b will be of the same weight as the same volume of fluid both weights being equal to g h g it follows that i gave a great yawn put aside the scroll and extinguished the lamp alas it was all greek to me the next morning at daybreak i roused eco grabbed a handful of bread from the pantry and the two of us set out for the achradina gate the stretch of road outside the walls was just as agathinus had described it with a great maze of tombs on either side all overgrown with brambles and vines it was an unsettling place even in the pale morning light with an air of decay and desolation some of the stone monuments were as large as small temples others were simple stelae set in the earth and many of these were no longer upright but had been knocked this way and that crumbling sculptural reliefs depicted funeral garlands and horses heads the traditional symbols of lifes brief flowering and the speedy passage toward death some of the monuments were decorated with the faces of the dead worn so smooth by time that they were as bland and featureless as the statues of the cyclades agathinus was nowhere to be seen perhaps were early i said eco full of energy began nosing about the monuments peering at the worn reliefs looking for pathways into the thicket dont go getting lost i told him but he might as well have been deaf as well as mute he was soon out of sight i waited but agathinus did not appear it was possible that he had arrived before us and lacked the patience to wait or that his business had kept him from coming there was also the chance that he had changed his mind about helping me decent enough fellow for a roman though i might be i tried to remember his description of the tombs location on the north side he had said about a hundred paces from the road and decorated with sculptures of geometrical shapes surely it couldnt be that hard to find i began nosing about as eco had done looking for ways into the thicket i found his tracks and followed them into a sort of tunnel through the thorns and woody vines that choked the pathways between the monuments i moved deeper and deeper into a strange world of shadowy foliage and cold dank stone covered with lichen and moss dead leaves rustled underfoot whenever the pathway branched i tried to follow ecos footsteps and called out his name to let him know that i was behind him i soon realized that finding archimedess tomb would not be such a simple task after all i considered turning and retracing my steps back to the road agathinus might have arrived and be waiting for me then i heard a strange twisted cry that was not quite a scream but rather the noise a mute boy might make if he tried to scream eco i rushed toward the noise but was confounded by the branching maze and the echo of his cry among the stone tombs cry out again eco cry out until i find you the noise echoed from a different direction i wheeled about banged my head against the projecting corner of a monument and cursed i reached up to wipe the sweat from my eyes and realized i was bleeding eco cried out again i followed stumbling over creeping vines and dodging crooked stelae suddenly above a tangle of thorns i glimpsed the upper part of what could only be the tomb of archimedes surmounting a tall square column chiseled with faded inscriptions in greek was a sphere and surmounting the sphere balanced on its round edge was a solid cylinder these two forms were the concrete representation of one of the principles i had encountered in my reading the night beforebut all such thoughts fled from my mind as i found a way through the thicket and stepped into a small clearing before the tomb in front of the column there were several other geometrical sculptures upon one of them a cube almost as tall as he was stood eco his eyes wide with alarm next to the cube and equally as tall was a slender cone that came to a very sharp point the point was dark with blood impaled on the cone faceup long spindly limbs splayed in agony was the lifeless body of agathinus his upsidedown features were frozen in a rictus of pain and shock you found him like this eco nodded how had such a thing happened agathinus must have been standing on the cube where eco now stood and somehow fallen backward onto the point i flinched picturing it the force of his fall had pushed his body halfway down the cone but why should he have been standing on the cube at all the faded inscriptions on the column could as easily be read from the ground and how could he have been so careless as to fall in such a dangerous spot unless someone had pushed him i thought of a triangle not of the sort which archimedes studied but with properties just as predictablea triangle made not of abstract lines but of the powerful forces that link mortal to mortal i told eco to stop gawking and get down from the cube given the circumstances of our discovery and the fact that we were strangers in syracuse eco and i might very well fall under suspicion ourselves if it was decided that agathinus had been murdered i thought it best to report what i had seen to cicero to let him handle reporting the death to the appropriate provincial magistrate and then to book passage for rome and have as little to do with the matter as possible but gordianus cicero protested this sort of thing is your specialty and if i understand you correctly agathinus was there to meet you and to do you a favorthough it seems he could as easily have shown the tomb to me instead do you feel no obligation to discover the truth cicero is a master at playing on a mans honor i resisted are you hiring me to investigate his death gordianusalways money paying you for such a service would hardly be my responsibility but im sure i can persuade the local roman magistrate to do so i might point out that your participation would also remove you from suspicion well he raised an eyebrow there was no debating logic with cicero ill do it good first someone will have to inform his friends and family dealing with a widow takes a certain finesseill handle that i leave it to you to deliver the sad news to his partner dorotheus and margero ah yes i suppose the poet will want to compose some funeral verses in praise of his dead patron unless i thought margero had been the author of agathinuss death margeros place was a small but respectable house in the heart of the city i rapped upon the door politely with my foot and was shown by a slave through a modest atrium into a modest garden after a long wait margero appeared wearing a rumpled robe the ringlets across his forehead were in disarray and his eyes were puffy with sleep its close to midday i said do all poets sleep this late they do if theyve drunk as much as i did last night i didnt notice you drinking any more than the rest of us what makes you think i stopped drinking after i left you had a late night then what business is that of yours roman one of your patrons is dead in the span of a heartbeat several emotions crossed his handsome features beginning with what might have been surprise and a flicker of hope and ending with a grimace that might have been no more than a symptom of his hangover dorotheus no a definite smile of satisfaction flickered across his lips agathinusdead but how eco and i found him this morning outside the achradina gate i described the circumstances impaled how gruesome margeros disgust slowly turned to amusement yet how appropriate an ironical turnabout from his usual preference he laughed out loud agathinus impaled delicious poor nikias will be distraught no doubt i shall make a poem to console him nikiasthe boy at the gymnasium margero darkened how do you know about him i know more than i care to about your affairs and those of agathinusand yet still not enough what do you think i said to eco as we made our way toward the large building near the docks where agathinus and dorotheus kept their offices and warehouse was margero really surprised by our bad news eco looked pensive he rotated his palm up and down inconclusively lets suppose that margero overheard agathinus last night when he arranged to meet us outside the achradina gate eco shook his head yes youre right margero and dorotheus had already moved on and were out of earshot but suppose agathinus caught up with them and told them of his plan thats certainly possible eco nodded sagely and suppose that margero volunteered to meet agathinus this morning and the two of them got there ahead of us and began to search for the tomb without usor perhaps margero showed up on his own staying hidden and secretly followed agathinus into the maze one way or the other the two of them ended up there inside the thicket safely out of sight and margero took the opportunity to get rid of his rival for nikias once and for all eco shook his head and mimed a poet in the throes of recitation yes i know margero is a man of words not actions and hed have to be an awfully good actor too if he was faking all his reactions when we gave him the news this morning eco put his cheek against folded hands and feigned sleep and yes he was obviously asleep when we called on himbut that proves nothing perhaps he stayed up all night so as to ambush agathinus then went to bed after the crime eco clutched an imaginary spike erupting from his chest then feigned sleep then shook his head dismissively how he asked could any man sleep after doing such a thing you have a point there i admitted eco winced catching the pun before i did and another thing margero is younger than agathinus but was he that much strongerstrong enough to force agathinus up onto the cube then push him onto the cone dorotheus kept us waiting for some time in the atrium of his business establishment at last he appeared smiling glumly and stroking his bushy beard gordianus and eco he boomed come to say a last farewell before you head back for rome i only wish that we were here on such happy business its about agathinus ah yes i learned of the tragedy earlier this morninghis wife sent a messenger the moment she was given the news by cicero i understand that you found his body horrible shocking did you know of his plan to meet me outside the achradina gate this morning what of course not i thought he might have mentioned it to you and margero after you left ciceros house last night agathinus caught up with us yes and the three of us walked for a while together but he said nothing of any plans to meet you i left the two of them outside my door so margero saw him last now that you mention it yes of late there had been some trouble between them perhaps you noticed margeros rudeness last night and agathinuss aloofness some silly business over a boy absurd isnt it how people can go mad over such things still its hard to believe that margero could a slave entered the room and spoke to dorotheus in hushed tones he shrugged apologetically business agathinuss death leaves everything in terrible confusion you must excuse me have a safe journey home gordianus dorotheus departed with his secretary leaving us alone in the atrium or leaving me alone rather for when i looked around eco had vanished i called his name softly but this appeared to be another occasion when he had gone conveniently deaf there were several doorways leading out of the atrium into various parts of the building but my attention was drawn to a passageway covered by a curtain that had been straight when we arrived but now hung slightly askew i pushed it back and stepped into a dark hallway on either side the hall opened onto a series of small offices cluttered with scrolls bits of papyrus and wax writing tablets the offices were deserted the clerks presumably sent home on account of agathinuss death the records stacked all about appeared to be the normal stuff of businessinvoices bills ledgers i peeked into each room softly calling ecos name the hallway ended in a door which stood ajar i pushed it open and stepped into a high open warehouse filled with crates the place appeared to be as deserted as the offices and the mazelike aisles between the stacked boxes reminded me uneasily of the mazelike necropolis outside the achradina gate eco i called softly weve no right to be snooping here eco where are you i wandered up and down the aisles until i discovered another door at the far corner of the room it opened into yet another office from small windows set high in the wall came the sounds of ships knocking together in the harbor and the cry of seagulls there was no sign of eco inside i backed out of the room and closed the door behind me i took several steps before i suddenly realized what i had seen and hurried back on a table against one wall i saw a simple scale neatly stacked beside it were some sample weights of silver and gold there was also a small wooden tub on the table i stepped closer sure enough the tub was half filled with water and there were several waterline markings made with a piece of chalk along the inner surface behind me i heard the door close i thought i bade you farewell gordianus there was not the slightest hint of good humor in dorotheuss voice without the beaming smile his round bearded face had a stern almost menacing look the constant smile had kept me from seeing the cold predatory gleam in his eyes so common in successful traders and merchants i also realized what a large man he was fat yes but the fellow had arms like a blacksmithsstrong enough i had no doubt to drag the smaller weaker agathinus onto the stone cube and then to push him backward onto the cruel spike im looking for my son i said as innocently as i could eco has a terrible habit of wandering off on his own i really should be less indulgent but dorotheus wasnt listening how much finder for what how much to shut you up and send you on your way back to rome he might be a murderer but he was a businessman first if accepting his bribe meant getting safely through the door behind him why not but i thought of agathinus on the night beforethe final night of his lifesaying i like you gordianus and i like your son the way he laughed at dorotheuss awful jokes and offering to do me the favor of showing me archimedess tomb i remembered the gaping grimace of horror on his face when we found him and i shuddered thinking of the appalling agony he must have suffered at the end transfixed like an insect on a pin agathinus did tell you last night about meeting me outside the achradina gate i said dorotheus deciding to submit to a bit of conversation let his face relax the hint of a smile returned to his lips yes he was quite looking forward to tramping through the thicket with you i insisted on coming along for the fun and margero im afraid i lied to you about that finder margero excused himself as soon as agathinus caught up with us last night he could hardly stand dining in the same room with him in case you didnt notice and he was in no mood to stroll along beside him afterward probably margero was in a great hurry to get home so he could get drunk in solitude and make up new poems for that silly boy at the gymnasium and you i saw agathinus home then i came here to your offices in the middle of the night dont be coy finder you saw the scale and the tub of water a demonstration of archimedess principle would you believe i never quite grasped it until cicero explained it last night what could be so important that you had to rush here at once to try it out he sighed ive suspected for years that agathinus must be cheating me why not he was always smarter than me ever since we were boys and the smarter partner always cheats the stupider onethats the law of business so i always watched every transaction always counted every piece of silver and gold we divided between us still i could never catch him cheating me for the last shipment of goods he talked me into taking my payment in gold vesselspitchers and bowls and suchwhile he took his in coin he needed the ready money to spend on certain investments of his own he said and what did it matter anyway so long as we both received the same weight secretly i thought i must be getting the better deal because worked gold is more valuable than its weight in coinage agathinus was counting on my own greed you see and he used it against me he cheated me the devious bastard cheated me last night with archimedess help i proved it proved that your gold vessels werent made of solid gold exactly perhaps agathinus didnt know oh no he knew after we went into the thicket and found the tomb this morning i confronted him he denied the deception at firstuntil i dragged him onto the cube and threatened to throw him on the cone then he confessed and kept on confessing with the sight of that spike to goad him it didnt begin with this transaction hed been pilfering and corrupting my shares of gold for years in all sorts of devious ways i always knew that agathinus was too clever to be honest and after he confessed i shuddered picturing it dorotheus swallowed hard i could say that it was an accident that he slipped but why im not proud of it i was angryfurious anger like that comes from the gods doesnt it so the gods will understand and theyll understand why i had to get rid of you as well he reached into the folds of his tunic and pulled out a long dagger i coughed my throat was bonedry i thought you intended to buy my silence ive changed my mind but you said you never agreed so there was never a bargain and now i withdraw that offer i looked around the room for something that might equalize the situation but saw nothing remotely resembling a weapon the best i could do was to pick up the tub i threw the water on him then threw the tub which he knocked aside all i managed was to make him furious and dripping wet all trace of the laughing genial dinner companion of the previous night had vanished seeing his face now i would not have known him it was at that moment that the door behind him gave a rattle and burst open cicero entered first followed by a troop of wellarmed roman peacekeepers who surrounded dorotheus at once and took his dagger eco trailed behind leaping in the air in great excitement the anxious look on his face turning to jubilation when he saw that i was unharmed eco fetched you i said yes said cicero you heard dorotheus confess i heard enough eco opened his mouth wide and moved his lips but managed only to produce a stifled grunt whats the boy trying to say asked cicero i think it must be eureka eureka greed i said to eco the next morning as we made ready to vacate our room at ciceros house last night i read that idyll of theocritus the poem that cicero quoted from at dinner the other night the poet certainly got it right men no longer aspire to win praise for noble deeds but think only of profit profit profit clutching their coinbags always looking for more too stingy to give away the tarnish that comes off their coins thanks to greed agathinus is dead dorotheus awaits trial for his murder and margero the poet has lost both of his patrons in one stroke which means hell probably have to leave syracuse a disaster for them all its very sad enough to make a man want to leave behind the grubby human cares of this world and lose himself in pure geometry like archimedes we gathered up our few belongings and went to take our leave of cicero there was also the matter of collecting my fees not only for finding archimedess tomb but for exposing agathinuss killer from the atrium i could hear cicero in his office he was dictating a letter to tiro no doubt intending for me to deliver it when i got back to rome eco and i waited outside the door it was impossible not to overhear dear brother quintus cicero began the fellows i was so strongly advised to cultivate here in syracuse turned out to be of no accountthe unsavory details can wait until we meet again nonetheless my holiday here has not been entirely unproductive you will be interested to learn that i have rediscovered the lost tomb of one of our boyhood heroes archimedes the locals were entirely ignorant of its location indeed denied its very existence yesterday afternoon however i set out with tiro for the old necropolis outside the achradina gate and there sure enough peeking out above a tangle of brambles and vines i spied the telltale ornaments of a sphere and cylinder atop a column you must recall that bit of doggerel we learned from our old math tutor a cylinder and ball atop a column tall mark the final stage of the syracusan sage having spotted the tomb i gave a cry of eureka and ordered a group of workers with scythes to clear the thicket all around now the tomb of archimedes can be seen and approached freely and has been restored to its rightful status as a shrine to all educated men cicero did not mention the cube and cone i noticed they had been removed along with the thicket lest someone else meet agathinuss fate cicero cleared his throat and resumed dictating ironic brother quintus is it not and sadly indicative of the degraded cultural standards of these modern syracusans that it took a roman from arpinum to rediscover for them the tomb of the keenest intellect who ever lived among them ironic indeed i thought death by eros the neapolitans are different from us romans i remarked to eco as we strolled across the central forum of neapolis a man can almost feel that hes left italy altogether and been magically transported to a seaport in greece greek colonists founded the city hundreds of years ago taking advantage of the extraordinary bay which they called the krater or cup the locals still have greek names eat greek food follow greek customs many of them dont even speak latin eco pointed to his lips and made a selfdeprecating gesture to say neither do i at fifteen he tended to make a joke of everything including his muteness ah but you can hear latin i said flicking a finger against one of his ears just hard enough to sting and sometimes even understand it we had arrived in neapolis on our way back to rome after doing a bit of business for cicero down in sicily rather than stay at an inn i was hoping to find accommodations with a wealthy greek trader named sosistrides the fellow owes me a favor cicero had told me look him up and mention my name and im sure hell put you up for the night with a few directions from the locals who were polite enough not to laugh at my greek we found the traders house the columns and lintels and decorative details of the facade were stained in various shades of pale red blue and yellow that seemed to glow under the warm sunlight incongruous amid the play of colors was a black wreath on the door what do you think eco can we ask a friend of a friend a total stranger really to put us up when the household is in mourning it seems presumptuous eco nodded thoughtfully then gestured to the wreath and expressed curiosity with a flourish of his wrist i nodded i see your point if its sosistrides whos died or a member of the family cicero would want us to deliver his condolences wouldnt he and we must learn the details so that we can inform him in a letter i think we must at least rouse the doorkeeper to see whats happened i walked to the door and politely knocked with the side of my foot there was no answer i knocked again and waited i was about to rap on the door with my knuckles rudely or not when it swung open the man who stared back at us was dressed in mourning black he was not a slave i glanced at his hand and saw a citizens iron ring his graying hair was disheveled and his face distressed his eyes were red from weeping what do you want he said in a voice more wary than unkind forgive me citizen my name is gordianus this is my son eco eco hears but is mute so i shall speak for him were travelers on our way home to rome im a friend of marcus tullius cicero it was he who cicero ah yes the roman administrator down in sicily the one who can actually read and write for a change the man wrinkled his brow has he sent a message or nothing urgent cicero asked me only to remind you of his friendship you are i take it the master of the house sosistrides yes and you im sorry did you already introduce yourself my mind wanders he looked over his shoulder beyond him in the vestibule i glimpsed a funeral bier strewn with freshly cut flowers and laurel leaves my name is gordianus and this is my son gordianus did you say yes cicero mentioned you once something about a murder trial up in rome you helped him they call you the finder yes he looked at me intently for a long moment come in finder i want you to see him the bier in the vestibule was propped up and tilted at an angle so that its occupant could be clearly seen the corpse was that of a youth probably not much older than eco his arms were crossed over his chest and he was clothed in a long white gown so that only his face and hands were exposed his hair was boyishly long and as yellow as a field of millet in summer crowned with a laurel wreath of the sort awarded to athletic champions the flesh of his delicately molded features was waxy and pale but even in death his beauty was remarkable his eyes were blue said sosistrides in a low voice theyre closed now you cant see them but they were blue like his dear dead mothers he got his looks from her the purest blue you ever saw like the color of the cup on a clear day when we pulled him from the pool they were all bloodshot this is your son sosistrides he stifled a sob my only son cleon a terrible loss he nodded unable to speak eco shifted nervously from foot to foot studying the dead boy with furtive glances almost shyly they call you finder sosistrides finally said in a hoarse voice help me find the monster who killed my son i looked at the dead youth and felt a deep empathy for sosistridess suffering and not merely because i myself had a son of similar age eco may be adopted but i love him as my own flesh i was stirred also by the loss of such beauty why does the death of a beautiful stranger affect us more deeply than the loss of someone plain why should it be so that if a vase of exquisite workmanship but little practical value should break we feel the loss more sharply than if we break an ugly vessel we use every day the gods made men to love beauty above all else perhaps because they themselves are beautiful and wish for us to love them even when they do us harm how did he die sosistrides it was at the gymnasium yesterday there was a citywide contest among the boysdiscusthrowing wrestling racing i couldnt attend i was away in pompeii on business all day sosistrides again fought back tears he reached out and touched the wreath on his sons brow cleon took the laurel crown he was a splendid athlete he always won at everything but they say he outdid himself yesterday if only i had been there to see it afterwards while the other boys retired to the baths inside cleon took a swim in the long pool alone there was no one else in the courtyard no one saw it happen the boy drowned sosistrides it seemed unlikely if the boy had been as good at swimming as he was at everything else sosistrides shook his head and shut his eyes tight squeezing tears from them the gymnasiarchus is an old wrestler named caputorus it was he who found cleon he heard a splash he said but thought nothing of it later he went into the courtyard and discovered cleon the water was red with blood cleon was at the bottom of the pool beside him was a broken statue it must have struck the back of his head it left a terrible gash a statue of erosthe god you romans call cupid a cherub with bow and arrows a decoration at the edge of the pool not a large statue but heavy made of solid marble it somehow fell from its pedestal as cleon was passing below he gazed at the boys bloodless face lost in misery i sensed the presence of another in the room and turned to see a young woman in a black gown with a black mantle over her head she walked to sosistridess side who are these visitors father friends of the provincial administrator down in sicily gordianus of rome and his son eco this is my daughter cleio daughter cover yourself sosistridess sudden embarrassment was caused by the fact that cleio had pushed the mantle from her head revealing that her dark hair was crudely shorn cut so short that it didnt reach her shoulders no longer shadowed by the mantle her face too showed signs of unbridled mourning long scratches ran down her cheeks and there were bruises where she appeared to have struck herself marring a beauty that rivaled her brothers i mourn for the loss of the one i loved best in all the world she said in a hollow voice i feel no shame in showing it she cast an icy stare at me and at eco then swept from the room extreme displays of grief are disdained in rome where excessive public mourning is banned by law but we were in neapolis sosistrides seemed to read my thoughts cleio has always been more greek than roman she lets her emotions run wild just the opposite of her brother cleon was always so cool so detached he shook his head shes taken her brothers death very hard when i came home from pompeii yesterday i found his body here in the vestibule his slaves had carried him home from the gymnasium cleio was in her room crying uncontrollably shed already cut her hair she wept and wailed all night long he gazed at his dead sons face and reached out to touch it his hand looking warm and ruddy against the unnatural pallor of the boys cold cheek someone murdered my son you must help me find out who did it gordianusto put the shade of my son to rest and for my grieving daughters sake thats right i heard the splash i was here behind my counter in the changing room and the door to the courtyard was standing wide open just like it is now caputorus the gymnasiarchus was a grizzled old wrestler with enormous shoulders a perfectly bald head and a protruding belly his eyes kept darting past me to follow the comings and goings of the naked youths and every so often he interrupted me in midsentence to yell out a greeting which usually included some jocular insult or obscenity the fourth time he reached out to tousle ecos hair eco deftly moved out of range and stayed there and when you heard the splash did you immediately go and have a look i asked not right away to tell you the truth i didnt think much of it i figured cleon was out there jumping in and out of the pool which is against the rules mind you its a long shallow pool meant for swimming only and no jumping allowed but he was always breaking the rules thought he could get away with anything so why didnt you go out and tell him to stop you are the gymnasiarchus arent you do you think that counted for anything with that spoiled brat master of the gym i may be but nobody was his master you know what hed have done quoted some fancy lines from some famous play most likely about old wrestlers with big bellies flashed his naked behind at me and then jumped back in the pool i dont need the grief thank you very much hey manius caputorus shouted at a youth behind me i saw you and your sweetheart out there wrestling this morning you been studying your old mans dirty vases to learn those positions ha over my shoulder i saw a redheaded youth flash a lascivious grin and make an obscene gesture using both hands back to yesterday i said you heard the splash and didnt think much of it but eventually you went out to the courtyard just to get some fresh air i noticed right away that cleon wasnt swimming anymore i figured hed headed inside to the baths but wouldnt he have passed you on the way not necessarily there are two passageways into the courtyard the one most people take goes past my counter here the other is through a little hallway that connects to the outer vestibule its a more roundabout route to get inside to the baths but he could have gone in that way and could someone have gotten into the courtyard the same way yes then you cant say for certain that cleon was alone out there you are a sharp one arent you caputorus said sarcastically but youre right cleon was out there by himself to start with of that im sure and after that nobody walked by me coming or going but somebody could have come and gone by the other passageway anyway when i stepped out there i could tell right away that something was wrong seriously wrong though i couldnt quite say what only later i realized what it was the statue was missing that little statue of eros thats been there since before i took over running this place you know how you can see a thing every day and take it for granted and when all of a sudden its not there you cant even say whats missing but you sense that somethings off thats how it was then i saw the color of the water all pinkish in one spot and darker toward the bottom i stepped closer and then i saw him lying on the bottom not moving and no air bubbles coming up and the statue around him in pieces it was obvious right away what must have happened here ill show you the spot as we were passing out the doorway a muscular wrestler wearing only a leather headband and wristwraps squeezed by on his way in caputorus twisted a towel between his fists and snapped it against the youths bare backside your mother yelled the stung athlete no your shiny red bottom caputorus threw back his head and laughed the pool had been drained and scrubbed leaving no trace of cleons blood amid the puddles the pieces of the statue of eros had been gathered up and deposited next to the empty pedestal one of the cherubs tiny feet had broken off as had the top of eross bow the point of his notched arrow and the feathery tip of one wing the statue had been here for years you say thats right sitting here on this pedestal yes never budged even when wed get a bit of a rumble from vesuvius strange then that it should have fallen yesterday when no one felt any tremors even stranger that it should fall directly onto a swimmer its a mystery all right i think the word is murder caputorus looked at me shrewdly not necessarily what do you mean ask some of the boys see what they tell you i intend to ask everyone who was here what they saw or heard then you might start with this little fellow he indicated the broken eros speak plainly caputorus others know more than i do all i can tell you is what ive picked up from the boys and whats that cleon was a heartbreaker youve only seen him laid out for his funeral you have no idea how goodlooking he was both above the neck and below a body like a statue by phidias a regular apollo he took your breath away smart too and the best athlete on the cup strutting around here naked every day challenging all the boys to wrestle him celebrating his wins by quoting homer he had half the boys in this place trailing after him all wanting to be his special friend they were awestruck by him and yet yesterday after he won the laurel crown he swam alone maybe because theyd all finally had enough of him maybe they got tired of his bragging maybe they realized he wasnt the sort to ever return a shred of love or affection to anybody you sound bitter caputorus do i are you sure youre talking just about the boys his face reddened he worked his jaw back and forth and flexed his massive shoulders i tried not to flinch im no fool finder he finally said lowering his voice ive been around long enough to learn a few things lesson one a boy like cleon is nothing but trouble look but dont touch his jaw relaxed into a faint smile ive got a tough hide i tease and joke with the best but none of these boys get under my skin not even cleon his face hardened then broke into a grin as he looked beyond me calpurnius he yelled at a boy across the courtyard if you handle the javelin between your legs the way you handle that one im surprised you havent pulled it off by now merciful zeus let me show you how caputorus pushed past me tousling ecos hair on his way leaving us to ponder the broken eros and the empty pool where cleon had died i managed that day to speak to every boy in the gymnasium most of them had been there the previous day either to take part in the athletic games or to watch most of them were cooperative but only to a point i had the feeling that they had already talked among themselves and decided as a group to say as little as possible concerning cleons death to outsiders like myself no matter that i came as the representative of cleons father nevertheless from uncomfortable looks wistful sighs and unfinished sentences i gathered that what caputorus had told me was true cleon had broken hearts all over the gymnasium and in the process had made more than a few enemies he was by universal consensus the brightest and most beautiful boy in the group and yesterdays games had proven conclusively that he was the best athlete as well he was also vain arrogant selfish and aloof easy to fall in love with and incapable of loving in return the boys who had not fallen under his spell at one time or another disliked him out of pure envy i managed to learn all this as much from what was left unsaid as from what each boy said but when it came to obtaining more concrete details i struck a wall of silence had anyone ever been heard uttering a serious threat to cleon had anyone ever said anything even in jest about the potentially hazardous placement of the statue of eros beside the pool were any of the boys especially upset about cleons victories that day had any of them slipped away from the baths at the time cleon was killed and what of the gymnasiarchus had caputoruss behavior toward cleon always been above reproach as he claimed to these questions no matter how directly or indirectly i posed them i received no clear answers only a series of equivocations and evasions i was beginning to despair of uncovering anything significant when finally i interviewed hippolytus the wrestler whose backside caputorus had playfully snapped with his towel he was preparing for a plunge in the hot pool when i came to him he untied his leather headband letting a shock of jetblack hair fall into his eyes and began to unwrap his wrists eco seemed a bit awed by the fellows brawniness to me with his babyish face and applered cheeks hippolytus seemed a hugely overgrown child i had gathered from the others that hippolytus was close or as close as anyone to cleon i began the conversation by saying as much hoping to catch him off his guard he looked at me unfazed and nodded i suppose thats right i liked him he wasnt as bad as some made out what do you mean wasnt cleons fault if everybody swooned over him wasnt his fault if he didnt swoon back i dont think he had it in him to feel that way about another boy he frowned and wrinkled his brow some say thats not natural but there you are the gods make us all different im told he was arrogant and vain wasnt his fault he was better than everybody else at wrestling and running and throwing wasnt his fault he was smarter than his tutors but he shouldnt have crowed so much i suppose hubris you know what that is vanity that offends the gods i said right like in the plays acquiring a swollen head becoming too cocksure until a fellows just begging to be struck down by a lightning bolt or swallowed by an earthquake what the gods give they can take away they gave cleon everything then they took it all away the gods hippolytus sighed cleon deserved to be brought down a notch but he didnt deserve that punishment punishment from whom for what i watched his eyes and saw the to and fro of some internal debate if i prodded too hard he might shut up tight if i prodded not at all he might keep answering in pious generalities i started to speak then saw something settle inside him and held my tongue youve seen the statue that fell on him hippolytus said yes eros with his bow and arrows do you think that was just a coincidence i dont understand youve talked to everyone in the gymnasium and nobodys told you theyre all thinking it theyre just too superstitious to say it aloud it was eros that killed cleon for spurning him you think the god himself did it using his own statue love flowed to cleon from all directions like rivers to the sea but he turned back the rivers and lived in his own rocky desert eros chose cleon to be his favorite but cleon refused him he laughed in the gods face once too often how what had cleon done to finally push the god too far again i saw the internal debate behind his eyes clearly he wanted to tell me everything i had only to be patient at last he sighed and spoke lately some of us thought that cleon might finally be softening he had a new tutor a young philosopher named mulciber who came from alexandria about six months ago cleon and his sister cleio went to mulcibers little house off the forum every morning to talk about plato and read poetry cleio as well sosistrides believed in educating both his children no matter that cleios a girl anyway pretty soon word got around that mulciber was courting cleon why not he was smitten like everybody else the surprise was that cleon seemed to respond to his advances mulciber would send him chaste little love poems and cleon would send poems back to him cleon actually showed me some of mulcibers poems and asked me to read the ones he was sending back they were beautiful he was good at that too of course hippolytus shook his head ruefully but it was all a cruel hoax cleon was just leading mulciber on making a fool of him only the day before yesterday right in front of some of mulcibers other students cleon made a public show of returning all the poems mulciber had sent him and asking for his own poems back he said hed written them merely as exercises to teach his own tutor the proper way to write a love poem mulciber was dumbstruck everyone in the gymnasium heard about it people said cleon had finally gone too far to have spurned his tutors advances was one thing but to do so in such a cruel deliberately humiliating mannerthat was hubris people said and the gods would take vengeance and now they have nodded but quite often the gods use human vessels to achieve their ends do you really think the statue tumbled into the pool of its own accord without a hand to push it hippolytus frowned and seemed to debate revealing yet another secret yesterday not long before cleon drowned some of us saw a stranger in the gymnasium at last i thought a concrete bit of evidence something solid to grapple with i took a deep breath no one else mentioned seeing a stranger i told you theyre all too superstitious if the boy we saw was some emissary of the god they dont want to speak of it a boy perhaps it was eros himself in human formthough youd think a god would be better groomed and wear clothes that fit you saw this stranger clearly not that clearly neither did anybody else as far as i can tell i only caught a glimpse of him loitering in the outer vestibule but i could tell he wasnt one of the regular boys how so by the fact that he was dressed at all this was just after the games and everyone was still naked and most of the gymnasium crowd are pretty well off this fellow had a wretched haircut and his tunic looked like a patched handmedown from a big brother i figured he was some stranger who wandered in off the street or maybe a messenger slave too shy to come into the changing room and his face hippolytus shook his head i didnt see his face he had dark hair though did you speak to him or hear him speak no i headed for the hot plunge and forgot all about him then caputorus found cleons body and everything was crazy after that i didnt make any connection to the stranger until this morning when i found out that some of the others had seen him too did anybody see this young stranger pass through the baths and the changing room i dont think so but theres another way to get from the outer vestibule to the inner courtyard through a little passageway at the far end of the building so caputorus told me it seems possible then that this stranger could have entered the outer vestibule sneaked through the empty passage come upon cleon alone in the pool pushed the statue onto him then fled the way he had come all without being clearly seen by anyone hippolytus took a deep breath thats how i figure it so you see it must have been the god or some agent of the god who else could have had such perfect timing to carry out such an awful deed i shook my head i can see you know a bit about poetry and more than a bit about wrestling holds young man but has no one tutored you in logic we may have answered the question of how but that hasnt answered the question of who i respect your religious conviction that the god eros may have had the motive and the will to kill cleon in such a coldblooded fashionbut it seems there were plenty of mortals with abundant motive as well in my line of work i prefer to suspect the most likely mortal first and presume divine causation only as a last resort chief among such suspects must be this tutor mulciber could he have been the stranger you saw lurking in the vestibule philosophers are notorious for having bad haircuts and shabby clothes no the stranger was shorter and had darker hair still i should like to have a talk with this lovesick tutor you cant said hippolytus mulciber hanged himself yesterday no wonder such a superstitious dread surrounds cleons death i remarked to eco as we made our way to the house of mulciber the golden boy of the cup killed by a statue of eros his spurned tutor hanging himself the same day this is the dark side of eros it casts a shadow that frightens everyone into silence except me eco gestured and let out the stifled inchoate grunt he sometimes emits simply to declare his existence i smiled at his selfdeprecating humor but it seemed to me that the things we had learned that morning had disturbed and unsettled eco he was at an age to be acutely aware of his place in the scheme of things and to begin wondering who might ever love him especially in spite of his handicap it seemed unfair that a boy like cleon who had only scorn for his suitors should have inspired so much unrequited infatuation and desire when others faced lives of loneliness did the gods engineer the paradox of loves unfairness to amuse themselves or was it one of the evils that escaped from pandoras box to plague mankind the door of the philosophers house like that of sosistrides was adorned with a black wreath following my knock an elderly slave opened it to admit us to a little foyer where a body was laid out upon a bier much less elaborate than that of cleon i saw at once why hippolytus had been certain that the short darkhaired stranger at the gymnasium had not been the alexandrian tutor for mulciber was quite tall and had fair hair he had been a reasonably handsome man of thirtyfive or so about my own age eco gestured to the scarf that had been clumsily gathered about the dead mans throat and then clutched his own neck with a stranglers grip to hide the rope marks he seemed to say did you know my master asked the slave who had shown us in only by reputation i said were visitors to neapolis but ive heard of your masters devotion to poetry and philosophy i was shocked to learn of his sudden death i spoke only the truth after all the slave nodded he was a man of learning and talent still few have come to pay their respects he had no family here and of course there are many who wont set foot inside the house of a suicide for fear of bad luck its certain that he killed himself then it was i who found him hanging from a rope he tied it to that beam just above the boys head eco rolled his eyes up then he stood on a chair put the noose around his neck and kicked the chair out of the way his neck snapped i like to think he died quickly the slave regarded his masters face affectionately such a waste and all for the love of that worthless boy youre certain thats why he killed himself why else he was making a good living here in neapolis enough to send a bit back to his brother in alexandria every now and again and even to think of purchasing a second slave im not sure how id have taken to that ive been with him since he was a boy i used to carry his wax tablets and scrolls for him when he was little and had his own tutor no his life was going well in every way except for that horrible boy you know that cleon died yesterday oh yes thats why the master killed himself he hung himself after hearing of cleons death of course only the old man looked puzzled as if he had not previously considered any other possibility now let me think yesterday was strange all around you see the master sent me out early in the morning before daybreak with specific instructions not to return until evening that was very odd because usually i spend all day here admitting his pupils and seeing to his meals but yesterday he sent me out and i stayed away until dusk i heard about cleons death on my way home when i came in there was the master hanging from that rope then you dont know for certain when he diedonly that it must have been between daybreak and nightfall i suppose youre right who might have seen him during the day usually pupils come and go all day but not so yesterday on account of the games at the gymnasium all his regular students took part you see or else went to watch the master had planned to be a spectator himself so he had canceled all his regular classes you see except for his very first of the dayand that hed never cancel of course because it was with that wretched boy cleon you mean yes cleon and his sister cleio they always came for the first hour of the day this month they were reading plato on the death of socrates suicide was on mulcibers mind then and yesterday did cleon and his sister arrive for their class i cant say i suppose they did i was out of the house by then i shall have to ask cleio but for now well assume they did perhaps mulciber was hoping to patch things up with cleon the slave gave me a curious look i know about the humiliating episode of the returned poems the day before i explained the slave regarded me warily you seem to know a great deal for a man whos not from neapolis what are you doing here only trying to discover the truth now then well assume that cleon and cleio came for their class early in the morning perhaps mulciber was braced for another humiliation and even then planning suicideor was he wildly hoping with a lovers blind faith for some impossible reconciliation perhaps thats why he dismissed you for the day because he didnt care to have his old slave witness either outcome but it must have gone badly or at least not as mulciber hoped for he never showed up to watch the games at the gymnasium that day everyone seems to assume that it was news of cleons death that drove him to suicide but it seems to me just as likely that mulciber hung himself right after cleon and cleio left unable to bear yet another rejection eco greatly agitated mimed an athlete throwing a discus then a man fitting a noose around his neck then an archer notching an arrow in a bow i nodded yes bitter irony even as cleon was enjoying his greatest triumph at the gymnasium poor mulciber may have been snuffing out his own existence and then cleons death in the pool no wonder everyone thinks that eros himself brought cleon down i studied the face of the dead man your master was a poet wasnt he yes said the slave he wrote at least a few lines every day of his life did he leave a farewell poem the slave shook his head youd think he might have if only to say goodbye to me after all these years but there was nothing not even a note not a line and thats another strange thing because the night before he was up long after midnight writing and writing i thought perhaps hed put the boy behind him and thrown himself into composing some epic poem seized by the muse but i cant find any trace of it whatever he was writing so frantically it seems to have vanished perhaps when he made up his mind to hang himself he thought better of what hed written and burned it he seems to have gotten rid of some other papers as well what papers the love poems hed written to cleon the ones cleon returned to himtheyve vanished i suppose the master was embarrassed at the thought of anyone reading them after he was gone and so he got rid of them so perhaps its not so strange after all that he left no farewell note i nodded vaguely but it still seemed odd to me from what i knew of poets suicides and unrequited lovers mulciber would almost certainly have left some words behindto chastise cleon to elicit pity to vindicate himself but the silent corpse of the tutor offered no explanation as the day was waning i at last returned to the house of sosistrides footsore and soulweary a slave admitted us i paused to gaze for a long moment at the lifeless face of cleon nothing had changed and yet he did not look as beautiful to my eyes as he had before sosistrides called us into his study how did it go finder ive had a productive day if not a pleasant one i talked to everyone i could find at the gymnasium i also went to the house of your childrens tutor you do know that mulciber hanged himself yesterday yes i found out only today after i spoke to you i knew he was a bit infatuated with cleon wrote poems to him and such but i had no idea he was so passionately in love with him another tragedy like ripples in a pond sosistrides too seemed to assume without question that the tutors suicide followed upon news of cleons death and what did you find did you discover anything significant i nodded i think i know who killed your son his face assumed an expression of strangely mingled relief and dismay tell me then would you send for your daughter first before i can be certain there are a few questions i need to ask her and when i think of the depth of her grief it seems to me that she too should hear what i have to say he called for a slave to fetch the girl from her room youre right of course cleio should be here in spite of her unseemly appearance her grieving shows her to be a woman after all but ive raised her almost as a son you know i made sure she learned to read and write i sent her to the same tutors as cleon of late shes been reading plato with him both of them studying with mulciber yes i know cleio entered the room her mantle pushed defiantly back from her shorn head her cheeks were lined with fresh livid scratches signs that her mourning had continued unabated through the day the finder thinks he knows who killed cleon sosistrides explained yes but i need to ask you a few questions first i said are you well enough to talk she nodded is it true that you and your brother went to your regular morning class with mulciber yesterday yes she averted her tearreddened eyes and spoke in a hoarse whisper when you arrived at his house was mulciber there she paused yes was it he who let you in the door again a pause no but his slave was out of the house gone for the day who let you in the door was unlocked ajar so you and cleon simply stepped inside yes were harsh words exchanged between your brother and mulciber her breath became ragged no are you sure only the day before your brother had publicly rejected and humiliated mulciber he returned his love poems and ridiculed them in front of others that must have been a tremendous blow to mulciber isnt it true that when the two of you showed up at his house yesterday morning mulciber lost his temper with cleon she shook her head what if i suggest that mulciber became hysterical that he ranted against your brother that he threatened to kill him no that never happened mulciber was toohe would never have done such a thing but i suggest that he did i suggest that yesterday after suffering your brothers deceit and abuse mulciber reached the end of his tether he snapped like a rein thats worn clean through and his passions ran away with him like maddened horses by the time you and your brother left his house mulciber must have been raving like a madman no he wasnt he was and after you left he brooded he took out the love poems into which he had poured his heart and soul the very poems that cleon returned to him so scornfully the day before they had once been beautiful to him but now they were vile so he burned them never he had planned to attend the games at the gymnasium to cheer cleon on but instead he waited until the contests were over then sneaked into the vestibule skulking like a thief he came upon cleon alone in the pool he saw the statue of erosa bitter reminder of his own rejected love no one else was about and there was cleon swimming facedown not even aware that anyone else was in the courtyard unsuspecting and helpless mulciber couldnt resisthe waited until the very moment that cleon passed beneath the statue then pushed it from its pedestal the statue struck cleons head cleon sank to the bottom and drowned cleio wept and shook her head no no it wasnt mulciber oh yes and then wracked with despair at having killed the boy he loved mulciber rushed home and hanged himself he didnt even bother to write a note to justify himself or beg forgiveness for the murder hed fancied himself a poet but what greater failure is there for a poet than to have his love poems rejected and so he hung himself without writing another line and hell go to his funeral pyre in silence a common murderer no no no cleio clutched her cheeks tore at her hair and wailed eco whom i had told to be prepared for such an outburst started back nonetheless sosistrides looked at me aghast i averted my eyes how could i have simply told him the truth and made him believe it he had to be shown cleio had to show him he did leave a farewell cleio cried it was the most beautiful poem he ever wrote but his slave found nothing mulcibers poems to cleon had vanished and there was nothing new because i took them where are they then she reached into the bosom of her black gown and pulled out two handfuls of crumpled papyrus these were his poems to cleon you never saw such beautiful poems such pure sweet love put down in words cleon made fun of them but they broke my heart and here is his farewell poem the one he left lying on his threshold so that cleon would be sure to see it when we went to his house yesterday and found him hanging in the foyer his neck broken his body soiled dead gone from me forever she pressed a scrap of papyrus into my hands it was in greek the letters rendered in a florid desperate hand a phrase near the middle caught my eye one day even your beauty will fade one day even you may love unrequited take pity then and favor my corpse with a first final farewell kiss she snatched back the papyrus and clutched it to her bosom my voice was hollow in my ears when you went to mulcibers house yesterday you and cleon found him already dead yes and you wept because i loved him even though he didnt love you mulciber loved cleon he couldnt help himself did cleon weep her face became so contorted with hatred that i heard sosistrides gasp in horror oh no she said he didnt weep cleon laughed he laughed he shook his head and said what a fool and walked out the door i screamed at him to come back to help me cut mulciber down and he only said ill be late for the games cleio collapsed to the floor weeping the poems scattering around her late for the games she repeated as if it were her brothers epitaph on the long ride back to rome through the campanian countryside ecos hands grew weary and i grew hoarse debating whether i had done the right thing eco argued that i should have kept my suspicions of cleio to myself i argued that sosistrides deserved to know what his daughter had done and how and why his son had died and needed to be shown as well how deeply and callously his beautiful beloved cleon had inflicted misery on others besides i said when we returned to sosistridess house i wasnt certain myself that cleio had murdered cleon accusing the dead tutor was a way of flushing her out her possession of mulcibers missing poems were the only tangible evidence that events had unfolded as i suspected i tried in vain to think of some way short of housebreaking to search her room without either cleio or her father knowingbut as it turned out such a search would have found nothing i should have known that she would keep the poems on her person next to her heart she was as madly hopelessly in love with mulciber as he was in love with cleon eros can be terribly careless when he scatters his arrows we also debated the degree and nature of cleons perfidy when he saw mulcibers dead body was cleon so stunned by the enormity of what he had donedriven a lovesick man to suicidethat he went about his business in a sort of stupor attending the games and performing his athletic feats like an automaton or was he so cold that he felt nothing or as eco argued in an extremely convoluted series of gestures did mulcibers fatal demonstration of lovesick devotion actually stimulate cleon in some perverse way inflating his ego and inspiring him to excel as never before at the games whatever his private thoughts instead of grieving cleon blithely went off and won his laurel crown leaving mulciber to spin in midair and cleio to plot her vengeance in a fit of grief she cut off her hair the sight of her reflection in mulcibers atrium pool gave her the idea to pass as a boy an illfitting tunic from the tutors wardrobe completed her disguise she carried a knife with her to the gymnasium the same one she had used to cut her hair and was prepared to stab her brother in front of his friends but it turned out that she didnt need the knife by chanceor guided by erosshe found her way into the courtyard where the statue presented itself as the perfect murder weapon as far as cleio was concerned the statues role in the crime constituted proof that she acted not only with the gods approval but as an instrument of his will this pious argument had so far at least as of our leaving neapolis stayed sosistrides from punishing her i did not envy the poor merchant with his wife and son dead could he bear to snuff out the life of only remaining offspring even for so great a crime and yet how could he bear to let her live knowing she had murdered his beloved son such a conundrum would test the wisdom of athena eco and i debated too the merits of mulcibers poetry i had begged of sosistrides a copy of the tutors farewell so that i could ponder it at my leisure savage sullen boy whelp of a lioness stonehearted and scornful of love i give you a lovers ringmy noose no longer be sickened by the sight of me i go to the only place that offers solace to the brokenhearted oblivion but will you not stop and weep for me if only for one moment the poem continued for many more lines veering between recrimination selfpity and surrender to the annihilating power of love hopelessly sentimental more cloying than honey the very worst sort of dreck pronounced eco with a series of gestures so sweeping that he nearly fell from his horse i merely nodded and wondered if my son would feel the same in another year or so after eros had wounded him with a stray arrow or two and given him a clearer notion from personal experience of just how deeply the god of love can pierce the hearts of helpless mortals a gladiator dies only once a beautiful day for it i said begrudgingly cicero nodded and squinted up at the filtered red sunlight that penetrated the awning above our seats below in the arena the first pair of gladiators strode across the sand to meet each other in combat the month was junius at the beginning of what promised to be a long hot summer the blue sky and undulating green hills were especially beautiful here in the etrurian countryside outside the town of saturnia where cicero and i traveling separately from rome had arrived the day before to attend the funeral of a local magistrate sextus thorius had been struck down in the prime of life thrown from his horse while riding down the clodian way to check on the progress of a slave gang doing repair work on the road the next day word of his demise reached rome where quite a few important persons had felt obligated to attend the funeral earlier that morning not a few of the senators and bankers who gathered to watch the funeral procession had raised an eyebrow at the sight of gordianus the finder among them feeling the beady gaze of a prunefaced matron on me i distinctly overheard her whisper to her husband whats he doing here does someone suspect foul play at work in the death of sextus thorius but cicero when he caught sight of me smiled grimly and moved to join me and asked no questions he knew why i had come a few years ago facing the prospect of a ruinous business scandal thorius had consulted cicero for legal advice and cicero had sent thorius to me to get to the bottom of the affair in the end both scandal and litigation were averted thorius had rewarded me generously and had subsequently sent quite a bit of business my way the least i could do on the occasion of his death was to pack my best toga spend the night at a seedy inn in saturnia and show up at his funeral we had followed the procession of musicians hired mourners and family members to the little necropolis outside saturnia where after a few speeches of remembrance thoriuss remains had been set alight atop a funeral pyre at the soonest opportunity to do so without seeming impolite i had turned to leave eager to start back to rome when cicero caught my arm surely youre not leaving yet gordianus we must stay for the funeral games games i meant to load the word with irony but cicero took the question in my voice literally theres to be a gladiator show of course its not as if thorius was a nobody his family wasnt rich but theyll have spent whatever they can afford im sure i hate watching gladiators i said bluntly so do i but theyre a part of the funeral no less than the procession and the eulogies one has to stay im not in the mood to see blood spilled but if you leave now people will notice he said lowering his voice you cant afford to have them think youre squeamish gordianus not in your line of work i glanced at the faces around us lit by the funeral pyre the prunefaced matron was among them along with her husband and numerous others from the same social set back in rome much as i might hate to admit it i was dependent on the trust and good will of such people the sort who had occasion to call on my services and means to pay for them i ferreted out the truth and in return they put bread on my table but i have to get back to rome i protested i cant afford another night at that seedy inn then youll stay with me said cicero i have accommodations with a local banker good food comfortable beds he raised an eyebrow why did cicero want so badly for me to stay it occurred to me that he was the squeamish one to watch the gladiators he wanted the company of someone who wouldnt needle him about his squeamishness as so many of his social equals were likely to do begrudgingly i acquiesced and so found myself that fine afternoon in junius seated in a wooden amphitheater constructed especially for the funeral games to honor the passing of sextus thorius of saturnia since i was with cicero i had been admitted into the more exclusive section of seats beneath the shade of the bloodred awning along with the bereaved family various local dignitaries and important visitors from rome the local villagers and farmers sat in the sundrenched seats across from ours they wore brimmed hats for shade and waved brightly colored fans for a brief moment bemused by the fluttering fans i had the illusion that the crowd had been covered by a swarm of huge butterflies flapping their wings there were to be three matches all fought to the death any less than three would have seemed parsimonious on the part of the family any more would have begun to look ostentatious and added to the cost as cicero had said the family of sextus thorius while eminently respectable was not rich the three pairs of gladiators were paraded before us helmets hid their faces but they were easy to tell apart by their different armor and their contrasting physiques one stood out from all the rest because of his coloration a nubian whose muscular arms and legs shone beneath the hot sun like burnished ebony as the fighters strode before us each raised his weapon the crowd responded with polite cheering but i overheard two men behind us complaining pretty obscure outfit owned by some freedman from ravenna im told fellow called ahala never heard of him me neither how did the family settle on this crew probably came cheap still i suppose the nubians something of a novelty there followed the ritual inspection of weapons for sharpness and armor for soundness performed by the local magistrate in charge of the games then the gladiators departed from the arena the magistrate invoked the gods and delivered yet another eulogy to sextus thorius a few moments later to a blare of trumpets a pair of gladiators reemerged and the first bout commenced the shorter stockier fighter was outfitted in the thracian manner with a small round shield and a short sword his tall lumbering opponent wore heavier samnite armor and carried an oblong shield samnite versus thraciana typical match noted cicero who often fell to lecturing when he was uneasy or nervous did you know that the very first gladiatorial matches took place right here in etruria oh yes we romans inherited the custom from the etruscans they began by sacrificing captive warriors before the funeral pyres of their leaders cicero gave a start as the sword of the samnite struck one of the iron bosses on the shield of the thracian with a resounding clang then he cleared his throat and continued eventually instead of simply strangling the captives the etruscans decided to have them fight each other allowing the victors to live we romans took up the custom and so developed the tradition of death matches at the funerals of great men of course nowadays anyone who was anyone must be honored with games at his funeral ive even heard of gladiator matches at the funerals of prominent women the result is a tremendous demand for fresh gladiators you still see captive warriors among them but more and more often theyre simply slaves whove been trained to fight or sometimes convicted criminalsmurderers whod otherwise be executed or thieves whod rather take a chance in the arena than have a hand chopped off below us the thracian thrust past the samnites shield and scored a glancing cut across the mans swordarm blood sprinkled the sand cicero shuddered ultimately one should remember that its a religious occasion he noted primly and the people must have their religion and quite candidly i dont mind watching a death match if both the combatants are convicted criminals then at least theres something instructive about the bloodletting or even if the fighters are captured warriors that can be instructive as well to take a good look at our enemies and to see how they fight and to celebrate the favor of the gods whove put us in the stands and them down there in the arena but more and more the trend is to have trained slaves do the fighting the tall samnite after a staggering retreat under the thracians relentless assault suddenly rallied and managed to score a solid thrust at the others flank blood spattered the sand from behind his helmet the thracian let out a cry and staggered back behind us the two men who had earlier complained now both roared with excitement thats how to turn the tables youve got him now samnite make the little fellow squeal again cicero fidgeted in his seat and cast a disapproving glance behind us then looked sidelong at the young woman seated next to him she was watching the bout with narrowed eyes one hand touching her parted lips and the other patting her heaving bosom cicero looked at me and raised an eyebrow and then theres the unwholesome glamour which these gladiators exert on certain womenand on more than a few men as well im sad to say the whole culture has gone gladiatormad roman boys play at being gladiators instead of generals roman ladies swoon whenever they see one and do you know ive even heard of roman citizens whove volunteered to fight as gladiators themselves and not just for the moneyalthough i understand even some slaves are paid handsomely if they can survive and make a name for themselvesbut for some sort of perverse thrill i cant begin to imagine his objection was abruptly drowned out by the roar of the crowd the stocky thracian had rallied and was once again relentlessly pushing the taller samnite back sword clanged against sword until the samnite tripping fell backwards the thracian stepped onto the shield the samnite had drawn over his chest pinning the man down he pressed the tip of his sword against the samnites windpipe the samnite released his sword and instinctively grasped the blade then drew back his hand flinging blood from the cuts across his fingers the samnite had been worsted from behind the visor of his helmet the triumphant thracian scanned the stands looking to the crowd for judgment following the ancient custom those who thought the samnite should be spared would produce handkerchiefs and wave them while those who wanted to see him put to death would raise their fists in the air here and there i saw a few fluttering handkerchiefs all but submerged in a sea of clenched fists i dont agree said one of the men behind us i rather liked the samnite he put up a good fight bah said his friend shaking his fist in the air theyre both amateurs the whole match was barely acceptable i wouldnt give a fig to watch either of them fight again send the loser straight to hades i say anything less would dishonor the memory of sextus thorius i suppose youre right said the other and from the corner of my eye i saw him put away his handkerchief and raise his fist the thracian looked to the magistrate in charge of the games for the final judgment the man raised his fist and nodded curtly and the thracian drove the sword into the samnites throat a great fountain of blood spurted from the wound gushing across the samnites helmet and chest and onto the sand all around the man thrashed and convulsed very nearly throwing the thracian offbalance but the thracian steadied himself shifting more weight onto the shield that confined the samnite and bearing down on his sword until it penetrated the back of the samnites neck and was driven firmly into the packed sand beneath with a roar of triumph the thracian stepped backed and thrust his fists in the air the samnite bucked his hips and thrashed his limbs pinned to the earth by the sword through his neck the thracian performed a victory strut in a circle around him disgusting muttered cicero pressing a clenched fist to his lips and looking queasy delightful uttered one of the men behind us now thats more like it what a finish then as a single bodymyself includedthe crowd drew a gasp with one of his thrashing hands the samnite had managed to grab hold of the thracians ankle and with his other hand he had somehow managed to regain his sword he pounded the pommel against the sand as if to still that arm from thrashing so that the blade pointed rigidly upright the thracian lost his balance and making circles in the air with his arms began to tumble backward for a long breathless moment it looked as if no power in the heavens or on the earth could stop the thracian from falling backward directly onto the upright blade of the samnites sword impaling himself even cicero bolted forward rigid with suspense the woman next to him swooned the men behind us bleated with excitement the thracian swayed backregained his balanceand swayed back again the upright sword glinted in the sunlight making a tremendous circle with his arms the thracian at last managed to propel himself forward wrenching his ankle from the samnites grasp he took a few staggering steps forward then wheeled about the samnite had stopped thrashing but the sword in his fist still pointed skyward approaching cautiously as one might a snake that seemed to have writhed its last but might yet strike the thracian squatted down and snatched the sword from the samnites gripthen jerked back in alarm as a bizarre noise emerged from the samnites throat a gurgling deathrattle that froze my blood gripping the pommel in both hands the thracian pointed the sword downward as one might strike a last blow to make sure that a snake was finished he drove the blade deep into the samnites groin again the crowd gasped in unison like cicero beside me i put my hand to my groin and flinched but the samnite was now truly dead fresh blood stained the loincloth around the wound but he did not move his chest heaving the thracian stood and recommenced his victory strut after a moment of stunned silence the exhilarated crowd rewarded him with thunderous cheering the magistrate strode into the arena and rewarded him with a palm frond to mark his victory waving it over his head the gladiator departed to raucous applause well declared cicero clearly impressed despite his avowed distaste for the games that will be hard to top the body of the samnite was dragged away the pools of blood were raked over with fresh sand and the next match commenced it was a novelty bout between two dimacheri socalled because each wielded not one but two daggers to compensate for their lack of shields they wore more pieces of armor than other types of fighters greaves to protect their forearms and shins plated pectorals to guard their throats and chests and various bands about their limbs and bits of metal over their naked flesh that suggested adornment as much as armor instead of the nervewracking banging of swords against shields the sound of their match was a constant grating slither of blade against blade as they engaged in a dizzying dance of parries and thrusts one was swarthy and the other pale but otherwise their physiques were much alike not as muscular as either of the previous fighters they had the lithesome bodies of dancers speed and agility counted for more than brute strength in such a match and they were so evenly matched and their maneuvers so elegant that their contest seemed almost choreographed instead of grunts and cheers they elicited ahs and ohs of appreciation from the crowd watching them whirl about i felt the pleasure one feels from watching dancers rather than warriors so that i almost forgot that for one of them death waited at the end of the match then with a scraping noise that set my teeth on edge a dagger slid over armor and successfully connected with unprotected flesh and the first blood was spilled the crowd exhaled an ah at a higher pitch than before and i sensed the stirring of their collective bloodlust both fighters seemed to be wearying losing the unerring focus that had kept them from harming each other more blood was spilled though the wounds were minor mere scratches that dabbed the blades with just enough blood to send red droplets flying through the air to mingle with the fine spray of sweat cast from the gladiators glistening limbs slowly but surely the pace of the parries and thrusts accelerated even as their rhythm became more ragged and unpredictable my heartbeat quickened i glanced at cicero and realized that he had not said a word throughout the match he leaned forward his eyes glittering with fascination the swarthy fighter suddenly seized the advantage his arms became a blur of movement like the wings of a bee and like a bee he stung managing to prick first the right hand of his opponent then the left hand so that the pale gladiator released both of his daggers and stood defenseless pressing his daggers to the others wrists the swarthy fighter forced the disarmed man to spread his arms wide open like a crucified slave it was a brazen gesture on the part of the swarthy gladiator to humiliate his foe but it contained a miscalculation at such close quarters almost chesttochest the pale gladiator was able to thrust one knee into his opponents groin and simultaneously to butt his helmet against the others the swarthy gladiator was sent staggering back the hushed crowd erupted in shrieks of laughter the pale gladiators advantage was shortlived he made a dash to recover one of his daggers but the distance was too great the swarthy gladiator was upon him like a pouncing lion hemming him in with his daggers jabbing and pricking him forcing him to perform a spastic backward dance controlling him at every step to pay him back the swarthy gladiator kneed him not once but twice in the groin the pale gladiator folded forward in agony then abruptly performed the motion in reverse straining upright onto his toes for not one but two daggers were pressed against the soft unarmored flesh beneath his chin the movement was so neatly performed that it seemed like the climax to a dance which the two had been performing from the moment their bout commenced they stood like statues one with daggers poised the other on tiptoes quivering empty hands at his sides helpless the crowd roared its approval the victor looked toward the magistrate who raised an eyebrow and turned his head from side to side to assess the will of the crowd spontaneously the crowd produced a multitude of fluttering handkerchiefs voices cried spare him spare him even the men behind me took up the chant spare him spare him in my experience the judgment of the mob is like quicksilver hard to pin down and impossible to predict if i had turned at that moment and asked the men behind me why spare the pale gladiator no doubt they would have given the rote answer because he fought well and deserves to fight another day but the samnite had fought just as bravely if not as beautifully and they had been eager to see him die i think it was the fact that the two dimacheri had fought so well together that swayed the crowd to spare the loser they were like a matched set that no one wished to see broken the pale gladiator owed his life as much to his opponent as to himself had they not been so precisely matched those two daggers would have been thrust into his gullet in the blink of an eye instead one by one the daggers withdrew the pale gladiator dropped to his knees his head bowed to show deference both to the spectators who had spared him and to the man who had bested him as the victor received his palm frond from the presiding magistrate well said cicero breaking his silence so far its been a better show than any of us expected i daresay i wonder what the final match will bring sometimes if the games are boring spectators begin to vacate the stands after the first or second match deciding theyve adequately paid their respects to the dead and need stay no longer on this day for the final match not a single spectator stirred from his seat instead there was a new arrival i was not the only one who noticed her one of the men behind me released a wolf whistle feast your eyes on that beauty he murmured where said his friend right across from us looking for a place to sit oh yes i see a beauty you say too dark for my taste you need to broaden your palate then ha ill bet youve never had a nubian as if you had of course i have you forget that i spent a few years traveling around libya and egypt i grew deaf to their prattling fascinated by the newcomer she was strikingly beautiful with high cheekbones full lips and flashing eyes her dense black hair was piled on her head in the latest style and tied with ribbons and she wore a tunica of pale blue that contrasted with the ebony sheen of her naked arms and throat her burnishedcopper necklace and bracelets glinted in the bright sunlight her bosom heaved slightly as if she were excited or slightly out of breath one seldom saw in italy a nubian who was not a slave but from her dress and the fact that she appeared to be out and about on her own i took her to be a free woman while i watched a row of male spectators clearly as struck by her beauty as i was nudged one another and obligingly made room for her giving her an aisle seat the two gladiators who strode into the arena for the final bout could not have been more different the first was stoutly built his chest and legs covered by curly red hair he was outfitted in the manner of the gauls with a short sword and a tall rectangular shield a loose loincloth and bands of metalplated leather wrapped around his midsection leaving his legs and chest bare his helmet covered not only his head but tapering and flaring out again like an hourglass extended down to cover his neck and breastbone as well following him into the arena was a retiarius to my mind the most fearsomely attired class of gladiators retiarii carry not a sword and shield but a long trident and a net this one was all the more striking because of his contrast to the redhaired gaul for he was the tall smoothly muscled nubian we had seen in the opening parade of gladiators as ebonhued as the woman who had just found a seat in the stands i wondered briefly if there might be some connection between themthen drew in a breath as the gaul made a rush at the retiarius and the combat commenced sword clanged against trident already heated to fever pitch by the previous matches the crowd became raucously vocal at once jumping from their seats and crying out for blood the gladiators responded with a bout that exceeded anything we had previously seen that day for two men so heavily muscled they moved with surprising speed although the retiarius with his long legs was considerably more graceful than his opponent they seemed almost to read one anothers thoughts as blows were deflected or dodged at the last possible instant and each attack was followed at once by a counterattack of equal cunning and ferocity beside me cicero repeatedly flinched and gasped but did not look away neither did i swept up by the primal fascination of watching two men in a struggle for life and death as the match continued the attributes of each fighter became clear the gaul was stronger the nubian quicker he would need to be if he were to succeed in casting the net over his prey several times when the gaul closed the distance between them in order to slash and thrust the net almost captured him but the gaul eluded it by dropping to the sand rolling out of harms way and springing back to his feet at this rate the gauls going to exhaust himself said one of the men behind me then watch the nubian catch him in that net like a fish out of water and start poking holes in him irritated cicero turned to shush the man but i was thinking exactly the same thought and indeed almost more quickly than my eyes could apprehend it the very thing happened the gaul rushed in slashing his sword wielding the trident with one hand the nubian parried the gauls thrust and with his other hand he spun the net in the air and brought it down directly over the gaul the lead weights sown at various points around the edge of the net caused it to collapse around the gaul and swallow him sword shield and all if the gaul had tripped which seemed almost inevitable that would have been the end of him but somehow he managed to stay upright and when the nubian wielding his trident with both hands now rushed toward him he managed to spin about so that the three sharp prongs landed squarely against his shield the prongs failing to penetrate flesh instead became enmeshed in the fabric of the net the nubian yanked at his trident to free it but the net held it fast and the gaul though pulled forward managed to stand his ground sensing more than seeing his advantagefor the net must have greatly blocked the view from his narrow visorthe gaul rushed forward holding fast to the trident the nubian was unable to stand his ground and was pushed back tripping he fell onto his rump and released the shaft of the trident with one hand still gripping it with the other the gaul using his bulllike strength twisted to one side the nubian his wrist unnaturally bent gave a cry and released the trident altogether the gaul slashing at the net with his sword and thrusting upwards with his shield managed to push the net up and over his head taking the trident with it stepping free he kicked the net behind him and with it the now hopelessly entangled trident the nubian meanwhile managed to scramble to his feet but he was now without a weapon the gaul might have made short work of his opponent but eschewing his sword he used his shield as a weapon instead rushing headlong at the nubian he struck him with his shield so hard that the nubian was knocked backwards against the wooden wall of the arena the spectators directly above him unable to see rushed forward from their seats and craned their necks peering over the railing among themnot hard to pick out in that crowdi saw the nubian woman even greater than the contrast of her dark flesh next to the paleness of those around her was the marked contrast of her expression submerged in a sea of faces that leered gaped and howled with bloodlust she was silent and stricken wearing a look of shock and dismay the gaul played catandmouse with his prey he stepped back allowing the nubian to stagger forward gasping for breath then struck him fullforce again with his shield knocking him against the wall over and over the gaul struck the nubian knocking the breath out of him each time until the man was barely able to stand the gaul delivered one last bodyblow with his shield and the nubian recoiling from the wall fell forward onto his face casting aside his shield the gaul grabbed hold of the nubians ankle and dragged him toward the center of the arena the nubian thrashed ineffectively seemingly unable to catch a breath to judge from the intermittent red trail he left in the sand he was bleeding from some part of his body perhaps from his mouth ha said one of the men behind me whos the fish out of water now the gaul reached the center of the ring releasing the nubians ankle he held up his fists and performed a victory strut in a circle around him the crowd gasped at the mans audacity the thracian had behaved with the same careless bravado and had very nearly paid for it with his life but the nubian was in no condition to take advantage of any miscalculation by his opponent at one point he stirred and tried to raise himself on his arms and the crowd let out a cry but his arms failed him and he fell back again flat on his chest the gaul stood over him and looked to the spectators for judgment the reaction from the stands was mixed people rose to their feet spare him cried some send him to hades cried others the magistrate in charge turned his head this way and that looking distinctly uncomfortable at the lack of consensus whichever course he chose some in the crowd would be disappointed at last he gave a sign to the waiting gladiator and i was not surprised that he did the predictable thing mercy to a defeated fighter had already been granted once that day mercy was the exception not the rule the crowd had come expecting to see bloodshed and death and those who wanted to see the nubian killed had more reason to see their expectation gratified than did those who preferred the novelty of allowing him to live the magistrate raised his fist in the air there were cries of triumph in the stands and groans of disappointment some cheered the magistrate others booed but to all this commotion i was largely deaf for my eyes were on the nubian woman directly across from me her body stiffened and her face froze in a grimace as the gaul raised his sword for the death blow i had the impression that she was struggling to contain herself to exhibit dignity despite the despair that was overwhelming her but as the sword descended she lost all composure she clutched her hair she opened her mouth the sound of her scream was drowned in the roar of the crowd as the nubian convulsed on the sand blood spurting like a fountain around the sword thrust between his shoulder blades for an instant the nubian womans gaze met mine i was drawn into the depths of her grief as surely as if i tumbled into a well cicero gripped my arm steady gordianus he said i turned toward him his face was pale but his tone was smug at last it seemed to say he had found someone more squeamish at the sight of death than himself when i looked back the woman had vanished with their palm fronds held aloft the victors paraded once more around the arena the magistrate invoked the memory of sextus thorius and uttered a closing prayer to the gods the spectators filed out of the amphitheater did you notice her i asked cicero who that hyperventilating young woman next to me no the nubian across from us a nubian female i dont think she showed up until the final bout i think she was alone that seems unlikely perhaps shes related somehow to the nubian gladiator he shrugged i didnt notice her how observant you are gordianus you and your endless curiosity but what did you think of the games i started to answer but cicero gave me no chance do you know he said i actually rather enjoyed myself far more than i expected to a most instructive afternoon and the audience seemed quite uplifted by the whole experience but it seems to me a mistake on the part of the organizers simply as a matter of presentation not to show us the faces of the gladiators at some point either at the beginning or the end their individual helmets project a certain personality to be sure like masks in the theater or do you think thats the point to keep them anonymous and abstract if we could see into their eyes we might make a more emotional connection theyd become humans beings first and gladiators second and that would interfere with the pure symbolism of their role in the funeral games it would thwart the religious intent safe once more from the very real bloodshed of the arena cicero nattered on falling into his role of aloof lecturer we arrived at ciceros lodgings where he continued to pontificate to his host a rich etrurian yokel who seemed quite overwhelmed to have such a famous advocate from rome sleeping under his roof after a parsimonious meal i excused myself as quickly as i could and went to bed i could not help thinking that the lice at the inn had been more congenial and the cook more generous i fell asleep thinking of the nubian woman haunted by my final image of herher fists tearing at her hair her mouth opened to scream the next day i made my way back to rome i proceeded to forget about the funeral of sextus thorius the games and the nubian woman the month of junius passed into quinctilis then one day as rome sweltered through the hottest summer i could remember eco came to me in my garden to announce a visitor a woman i said watching his hands shape curves in the air eco nodded rather young he went on to say in the elaborate system of gestures we had devised between us with skin the color of night i raised an eyebrow a nubian eco nodded show her in my memory did not do justice to her beauty as before her hair was done up with ribbons and she was attired in pale blue and burnished copper probably the outfit was the best she possessed she had worn it to attend the funeral games now she wore it for me i was flattered she studied me for a long moment a quizzical expression on her face ive seen you somewhere before she finally said yes in saturnia at the funeral games for sextus thorius she sucked in a breath i remember now you sat across from me you werent like the restlaughing joking screaming for blood when zanziba was killed you saw the suffering on my face and i could tell that you her voice trailed off she lowered her eyes how strange the paths upon which the gods lead us when i asked around the subura for a man who might be able to help me yours was the name people gave me but i never imagined that id seen you beforeand in that place of all places on that day of all accursed days you know who am then gordianus they call you the finder yes and you my name is zuleika not a roman name i had a roman name once a man who was my master gave it to me but zuleika is the name i was born with and zuleika is the name ill die with i take it you shed your slave name when you shed your former master youre a freedwoman then yes lets sit here in the garden my son will bring us wine to drink we sat in the shade and zuleika told me her story she had been born in a city with an unpronounceable name in a country unimaginably far awaybeyond nubia she said even beyond the fabled source of the nile her father had been a wealthy trader in ivory who often traveled and took his family with him in a desert land at a tender age she had seen her father and mother murdered by bandits zuleika and her younger brother zanziba were abducted and sold into slavery our fortunes varied as did our masters she said but at least we were kept together as a pair because we were exotic you see and beautiful i thought assuming that her brothers beauty matched her own eventually we found ourselves in egypt our new owner was the master of a mime troupe he trained us to be performers you have a particular talent i dance and sing and your brother zanziba excelled at acrobaticscartwheels balancing acts somersaults in midair the master said that zanziba must have a pair of wings hidden somewhere between those massive shoulders of his she smiled but only briefly our master had once been a slave himself he was a kind and generous man he allowed his slaves to earn their own money with the goal of eventually buying their freedom when we had earned enough zanziba and i we used the money to purchase zanzibas freedom with the intention of putting aside more money until we could do the same for me but then the master fell on hard times he was forced to disband the troupe and sell his performers piecemeala dancer here a juggler there i ended up with a new master a roman merchant living in alexandria he didnt want me for my dancing or my singing he wanted me for my body she lowered her eyes when zanziba came to him and said he wanted to buy my freedom the man named a very steep price zanziba vowed to earn it but he could never hope to do so as an acrobat performing for coins in the street he disappeared from alexandria time passed and more time for such a long time i heard no word from him that i began to despair thinking that my brother was dead or had forgotten about me then finally money arriveda considerable sum enough to buy my freedom and more and with it came a letternot in zanzibas hand because neither of us had ever learned to read or write but written for him by the banker who transmitted the money what did the letter say can you read yes then read it for yourself zuleika handed me a worn and tattered scrap of parchment beloved sister i am in italy among the romans i have become a gladiator a man who fights to the death to honor the roman dead it is a strange thing to be the romans profess to despise our kind yet all the men want to buy us drinks in the taverns and all the women want to sleep with us i despise this life but it is the only way afreedman can earn the sort of money we need it is a hard cruel life not fit for an animal and it comes to a terrible end do not follow or try to find me forget me find your way back to our homeland if you can live free sister i too shall live free and though i may die young shall die a free man your loving brother zanziba i handed the scrap of parchment back to her your brother told you not to come to italy how could i not come zanziba hadnt forgotten me after all i was not going to forget him as soon as i was able i booked passage on a ship to rome travel is expensive i paid for the fare from the money zanziba sent me surely he meant for you to live off that money here in rome i make my own living she raised her chin high the haughty angle flattered her she was beautiful she was exotic she was obviously eleven i could well imagine that zuleika was able to demand a high fee for the pleasure of her company you came to rome and then i looked for zanziba of course i started with the banker whod sent the money he sent me to a gladiator camp near neapolis i talked to the man who owned the campthe trainer what you romans call a lanista he told me zanziba had fought with his troupe of gladiators for a while but had long since moved on the lanista didnt know where most gladiators are captives or slaves but zanziba was a free agent he went where the money was best i followed his trail by rumor and hearsay i came to one dead end after another and each time i had to start all over again if youre as good as people say gordianus the finder i could have used the skills of a man like you to track him down she raised an eyebrow do you have any idea how many gladiator camps there are in italy scores i should imagine hundreds scattered all over the countryside over the last few months ive traveled the length and breadth of italy looking for zanziba without luck until until a man who knew zanziba told me that he was fighting for a lanista named ahala who runs a camp in ravenna but the man said i neednt bother going all the way to ravenna because ahalas gladiators would be fighting at funeral games the very next day up in saturnia at the funeral of sextus thorius i said yes i wasnt able to leave rome until the next morning i traveled all day i arrived just when zanzibas match was beginningexcited fearful out of breath just in time to see are you sure it was him of course but he wore a helmet she shook her head with or without the helmet id have known him by his limbs and legs by the way he moved zanziba must have wings hidden between those massive shoulders the master in alexandria used to say her voice trembled and her eyes glittered with tears after all my travels all my searching i arrived just in time to see my brother die i lowered my eyes remembering the scene the nubian flat on his chest the gaul with his sword poised to strike the uncertain magistrate the raucous crowd the death blow the fountain of blood im sorry you had to see such a thing zuleika did you attend to his body afterwards i wasnt even allowed to see him i went to the quarters where the gladiators were kept but the lanista wouldnt let me in did you tell him who you were if anything that made him even more hostile he told me it didnt matter whose sister i was that i had no business being there clear off he shouted and one of the gladiators shook a sword at me and i ran away crying i should have stood up to him i suppose but i was so upset stood up to him i thought that would have been impossible a freedwoman zuleika might be but that hardly gave her the privileges of a roman citizen or the prerogatives of being male no one in saturnia that day would have taken her side against the lanista i sighed wondering now that her story was told why she had come to see me your brother did an honorable thing when he sent you money to buy your freedom but perhaps he was right you shouldnt have followed him here you shouldnt have tried to find him a gladiators life is brutish and short he chose that life and he saw it through to the only possible end no she whispered shaking her head fixing me with a fiery gaze it wasnt the end what do you mean it wasnt the end of zanziba i dont understand zanziba didnt die that day i know because because ive seen him where when yesterday here in rome in the marketplace down by the river i saw zanziba was the glint in her eyes excitement or madness did you speak to him no he was on the far side of the market a cart blocked my way and before i could reach him he was gone perhaps you were mistaken i said quietly it happens to me all the time i see a face across a crowd or from the corner of my eye and im sure its someone i know but when i take a second look i realize the familiarity was merely an illusion a trick of the mind she shook her head how many men who look like zanziba have you ever seen in the roman market all the more reason why you might mistake such a fellow for your brother any tall muscular man with ebony skin glimpsed at a distance but it wasnt a glimpse i saw him clearly you said a cart blocked the way that was after i saw him when i tried to move toward him before that i saw him as clearly as im seeing you now i saw his face it was zanziba i saw i considered this for a long moment perhaps zuleika you saw his lemur you wouldnt be the first person to see the restless spirit of a loved one wandering the streets of rome in broad daylight she shook her head i saw a man not a lemur but how do you know he was buying a plum from a vendor tell me gordianus do lemures eat plums i tried to dissuade her from hiring me by naming the same fee i would have asked from cicero but she agreed to the figure at once and paid me a first installment on the spot zuleika seemed quite proud of her financial resources it was her idea that we should begin out search in rome and i agreed duly making the rounds of the usual eyes and ears i quickly discovered that a large nubian of zanzibas description had indeed been seen around the marketplace but no one could identify the man and no one knew where hed come from or where hed gone zuleika wanted to visit every hostel and tavern in the city but i counseled patience put out a reward for information i told her and the information would come to us sure enough a few days later a streetsweeper in the subura arrived at my door with word that the nubian i was seeking had spent a single night at a seedy little hostel off the street of the coppersmiths but had given no name and had moved on the next day again i counseled patience but days passed with no new information and zuleika grew impatient to commence with the next obvious step to pay a call on ahala zanzibas lanista the man who had turned her away when she tried to see her brothers corpse i remained dubious but made preparations for the journey ravenna is a long way from rome especially when the traveler suspects in his heart of hearts that at journeys end lies bitter disappointment zuleika traveled with me and paid all expensessometimes with coins but more often i suspected by exchanging favors with tavern keepers along the way or by plying her trade with other guests how she made her living was her business i minded my own during the day we rode on horseback zuleika was no stranger to horses one of her brothers acrobatic tricks had been to stand upright on the back of a cantering horse and she had learned to do so as well she offered to show me but i dissuaded her if she fell and broke her neck who would pay my way home she was a good conversationalist a skill that no doubt contributed to her ability to make a decent living men pay for pleasure but come back for good company to pass the hours we talked a great deal about alexandria where i had lived for a while when i was young i was amused to hear her impressions of the teeming city and its risible inhabitants in return i told her the tale of the alexandrian cat whose killer i had discovered and the terrible revenge exacted by the catworshipping mob of the city i was also intrigued by her newcomers impressions of rome and italy her search for zanziba had taken her to many places and her livelihood had acquainted her with men from all levels of society she knew both the city and the countryside and due to the nature of her search she had inadvertently become something of an expert on the state of gladiators do you know the strongest impression i have of this land of yours she said one day as we passed a gang of slaves working in a field along the flaminian way too many slaves i shrugged there are slaves in alexandria too there are slaves in every city and every country perhaps but its different here maybe its because the romans have conquered so many other people and become so wealthy and brought in so many slaves from so many places in egypt there are small farmers all along the nile they may own slaves but they also till the earth themselves everyone pulls together in years of a good inundation everyone eats well and in years when the nile runs low everyone eats less here it seems to me the farmers are all rich men who live in the city and slaves do every bit of the work and the free men who should be farmers are all in rome crowded into tenements and living off the dole it doesnt seem right the farms are run well enough i suppose are they then why does rome import so much grain from egypt look at how these field slaves are treatedhow shabbily theyre dressed how skinny they are how hard theyre made to work even under this blistering sun an egyptian farmer would be out in the fields alongside his slaves pushing them to work harder yes but also seeing just how hard they do work and making sure theyre healthy and well fed so theyre fit to work the next day too to an egyptian slaves are a valuable investment and you dont squander them here theres a different attitude work a slave as hard as you can invest as little as possible in his upkeep and when youve used him up dispose of him and get another because slaves are cheap and romes provinces provide an endless supply as if to illustrate her point we passed a huddled figure in the gutter alongside the road a creature so shriveled and filthy that i could tell neither its age nor its sexan abandoned slave kicked out by its master no doubt as we passed by the creature croaked a few unintelligible words and extended a clawlike hand zuleika reached into her traveling bag and threw the unfortunate a crust of bread left over from her breakfast too many slaves she repeated and far too many gladiators i can scarcely believe how many camps full of gladiators i had occasion to visit since i arrived here so many captured warriors from so many conquered lands all flowing into italy what to do with them all put on gladiator games and make them fight each other to the death put on a show with six gladiators and three will likely be dead by the end of the day but ten more will arrive the next day bought cheap at auction not all of them are good fighters of course the ones who turn out to be clumsy or cowardly or nearsighted can be sent off to a farm or a ships galley or the mines the ones who remain have to be outfitted and trained and fed reasonably well to keep them strong thats how the best camps are run but those lanistas charge a lot of money to hire out their gladiators not everyone can afford the best but every roman wants to host games at his fathers funeral even if its only a single pair of fighters spilling each others blood in a sheep pen while the family sit on the fence and cheer so theres a market for gladiators who can be hired cheaply you can imagine how those gladiators are keptfed slop and housed in pens like animals but their lives are more miserable than any animals because animals dont fall asleep at night wondering if the next day theyll die a horrible death for a strangers amusement such gladiators are poorly trained and armed with the cheapest weapons can you imagine a fight to the death where both men are armed with nothing better than wooden swords theres no way to make a clean quick kill the result is a cruel bloody farce ive seen such a death match with my own eyes i didnt know which man to pity more the one who died or the one who had to take the others life using such a crude weapon she shook her head so many gladiators scattered all over italy all trained to kill without mercy so many weapons within easy reach so much misery i think some day there may be a reckoning when we reached the outskirts of ravenna i asked a man on the road for directions to the gladiator camp of the lanista ahala the man eyed the two of us curiously for a moment then saw the iron citizens ring on my finger on the far side of town youll come to a big oak tree where the road forks take the left branch for another mile but unless youve come to hire some of his gladiators id stay clear of the place unfriendly guard dogs high fences to keep the gladiators in to keep everybody else out a while back a neighbors slave wandered onto the property one of those dogs tore his leg off fellow bled to death ahala refused to make restitution he doesnt like folks coming round leaving zuleika at a hostel near the town forum i made my way alone to the oak tree on the far side of town and took the branch to the left after a mile or so just as the man had said a rutted dirt road branched off the stonepaved highway i followed the road around a bend and came to a gateway that appeared to mark the boundary of ahalas property the structure itself was probably enough to keep out most unwanted visitors nailed to the two upright posts were various bones bleached white by the sun and adorning the beam above my head was a collection of human skulls i passed through the gate and rode on for another mile or so through a landscape of thickets and wild brush at last i arrived at a compound surrounded by a high palisade of sharpened stakes from within i heard a mans voice shouting commands and the clatter of wood striking woodgladiators drilling with practice swords i presumed i heard other more incongruous noisesthe bleating of sheep and goats a smiths hammer and the sound of men laughing not in a harsh or meanspirited way but quite boisterously i approached a door in the palisade but had no chance to knock on the other side so close and with such ferocity that i jerked back and my heart skipped a beat dogs began to bark and jump against the gate scraping their claws against the wood a shouting voice chastised the dogs who stopped barking a peephole opened in the gate so high up that i assumed the man beyond was standing on a stool two bloodshot eyes peered down at me who are you and what do you want is this the gladiator camp of ahala who wants to know are you ahala whos asking my name is gordianus ive come all the way from rome have you indeed i saw some of your gladiators perform at saturnia a while back did you now i was most impressed were you more to the point i said improvising my good friend marcus tullius cicero was impressed cicero you say youve heard of him i presume ciceros a man to be reckoned with a rising politician and a very famous advocate who handles the legal affairs of some of the most powerful families in rome the man lifted an eyebrow dont think much of politicians and lawyers no well as a rule cicero doesnt think much of funeral games but he thought your men put on quite a show so far everything i had said was true when lying i have found it best to begin with the truth and embellish only as necessary in his line of work cicero is frequently called upon to advise the bereaved on legal matters such as wills you understand but they often ask his advice about all sorts of other thingssuch as who to call upon to produce a truly memorable afternoon of funeral games i see so this cicero thought my boys put on a memorable show he did indeed and as i happened to be coming to ravenna on business of my own and as you happen to have your camp here i promised my good friend cicero that i would call on you if i had a chance to see what sort of operation you runhow many gladiators youve got how long youve been in business how much you charge that sort of thing the man nodded the peephole banged shut the barking resumed but receded into the distance as if someone were dragging the dogs elsewhere a bolt was thrown back the gate swung open ahalalanistaat your service i had assumed the speaker was standing on something to reach the peephole but i was wrong towering over me was a grizzled hulking giant of a man he looked like a gladiator himself though few gladiators live long enough to attain such a magnificent mane of gray hair was ahala the exception it was not entirely unheard of for a fighter to survive long enough to buy his freedom and become a professional trainer it was far less common for such a survivor to become the owner of a cadre of gladiators as ahala apparently was whatever his origins and history he was obviously smarter than his lumbering physique and terse manner might suggest come in he said have a look around the compound within the palisade included several barnlike buildings set close together separated by garden plots and pens for horses goats and sheep you raise livestock i said gladiators eat a lot of meat and you grow your own garlic i see gives the fellows extra strength so ive heard whole treatises had been written about the proper care and feeding of gladiators at a shouted command the clatter of wooden weapons resumed the noise seemed to come from beyond another palisade of sharpened stakes this is the outer compound ahala explained gladiators are kept in the inner compound safer that way especially for visitors like you wouldnt want you to end up with your skull decorating that gate out by the highway i smiled uncertainly not entirely sure the man was joking still id like to have a look at the gladiators in a bit show you the armory first explain how i do business he led me into a long low shed festooned with chains upon which were hung all manner of helmets greaves swords shields and tridents there were also a number of devices i didnt recognize including some tubes made of metal and wood that looked as if they might fit into a mans mouth ahala saw me looking at them but offered no explanation some of the weapons also looked a bit odd to me i reached out to touch a hanging sword but ahala seized my wrist youll cut yourself he grumbled then ushered me to the far end of the shed where a trio of smiths in leather aprons were hammering a redhot piece of metal you make your own weapons i asked sometimes a customized fit can make the difference between a good fighter and a great one mostly i keep these fellows busy with repairs and alterations i like to keep the armory in tiptop shape he led me past the smiths into another shed where carpenters were whittling wood into pegs amphitheater seeds i call those said ahala with a laugh some of the people who hire me want a temporary arena built especially for the games maybe they need to seat a hundred people maybe a thousand my carpenters can throw up a decent amphitheater practically overnight provided theres a good source of local timber client pays for the materials of course but ive found it saves time and shaves considerable expense if ive got nails and pegs ready to go all part of a complete package i nodded id never thought of thatthe added expense of erecting a place to put on the games ahala shrugged funeral games dont come cheap we passed through a small slaughterhouse where the carcass of a sheep had been hung for butchering certain parts of slaughtered animals that might normally have been discarded had been saved and hung to dry i stepped toward the back corner of the room to have a closer look but ahala gripped my elbow you wanted to see the fighters step this way he led me to a gate in the inner palisade lifted the bar and opened the narrow door that way to your right are the barracks where they eat and sleep the training area is this way visitor coming he shouted we walked through a covered passage and emerged on a sandy square open to the sky where five pairs of men abruptly pulled apart and raised their wooden practice swords in a salute to their lanista carry on barked ahala the men resumed their mock battles banging swords against shields i thought you thought wed be above them looking down like in an amphitheater said ahala yes he chuckled we dont stage exhibition bouts here only way to see the training area is to walk right in stand closer if you want smell the sweat look them in the eye i felt acutely vulnerable i was used to seeing gladiators at a distance in the arena to stand among them with nothing between them and me was like entering a cage full of wild animals even the shortest man among them was a head taller than me all ten wore helmets but were otherwise naked apparently they were training to receive blows to the head because their rhythmic exercise consisted of exchanging repeated blows to each others helmets the blows were relatively gentle but the racket was unnerving from his physique i thought i recognized a least one of the gladiators from the games at saturnia the bullnecked thracian who had triumphed in the opening bout about the others i was less sure i wonder do you have any nubians among your men ahala raised an eyebrow why do you ask there was a nubian that day in saturnia a retiarius cicero took particular note of himjust the sort of exotic touch to ensure a memorable day he said ahala nodded a retiarius ah yes i remember now that fellows dead of course but it just so happens that i do have another nubian in the troupe tall strapping fellow like the one you saw also a retiarius he can fight with net and trident certainly all my gladiators are trained to be versatile they can fight in whatever style you wish yes its all about giving the spectators what they want isnt it delivering a thrill and an eyeful i watched the practicing pairs of gladiators advance and retreat advance and retreat with the rhythmic precision of acrobats can i see this nubian i said see him train you mean yes why not ahala called to an assistant bring the nubian this man wants to see him train with net and trident he turned back to me while we wait ill explain how i calculate my prices depending on the size of funeral games you need for the next few moments i had to struggle to keep my face a blank id never imagined that funeral games could be so costly to be sure a lanista faced considerable expenses but i suspected that ahala was making a considerable profit as well was that why zanziba had come to him because ahala had the wherewithal to pay him handsomely are they all slaves i asked interrupting ahala as he was reciting a complicated formula for payment on installment plans whats that your gladiatorsare they all slaves one hears occasionally of free men who hire themselves out as gladiators they make good money im told have their choice of women too are you thinking of taking it up he looked me up and down and laughed rather unkindly i thought no im merely curious that nubian who fought in saturnia for example who cares about him snapped ahala gone to hades he scowled then brightened ah heres his replacement seen at such close quartets the retiarius who entered the training area was a magnificent specimen of a man tall and broad and elegantly proportioned he immediately engaged in a mock combat with the gladiator who had accompanied him putting on a lively demonstration for my benefit was it the same nubian i had seen in saturnia i thought soor was i doing what i had accused zuleika of doing seeing what i wanted or expected to see enough fighting i said i want to see his face his face ahala stared at me perplexed ive seen a nubian fightive seen one die at saturniabut ive never seen one this close facetoface indulge my curiosity lanista show me the fellows face very well at ahalas signal the gladiators drew apart ahala beckoned the nubian to come to us take off your helmet he said the nubian put aside his weapons removed his helmet and stood naked before me i had never seen the face of the nubian who fought in saturnia i had never seen zanzibas face but those two brown eyes which stared back at mehad i seen them before were they zuleikas soulful eyes set in a mans face was this the face of her brother zanziba the high cheekbones were much the same as were the broad nose and forehead but i could not be sure what is your name gladiator he hesitated as slaves not used to being addressed by strangers often do he glanced at ahala then looked straight ahead chiron he said like the centaur a good name for a gladiator i suppose were you born with that name again he hesitated and glanced at ahala i dont know where do you come from i dont know how odd and how long have you been at this camp with ahala as your lanista enough of this snapped ahala cant you see the fellows simpleminded but hes a damned good fighter i guarantee if you want the personal history of each and every gladiator put some sesterces on my table first and hire them now the tour is over ive other things to do if your friend cicero or some of his rich clients have need of funeral games theyll know where to find me you men get back to your training gordianus allow me to show you the way out as the gate to the compound slammed shut behind me the dogs silent throughout my visit recommenced their barking its him insisted zuleika it must be describe him again gordianus zuleika ive described the man to you a dozen times neither of us can say if it was zanziba i saw or not it was him i know it was but if he died in saturnia how can he be alive now thats a very good question but i have a suspicion you know something youre not telling me you saw something there in the compound perhaps ill have to go back and have another look to be sure when i sighed looking around the little room we had been given to share at the hostel in ravenna it was a plain room with two hard beds a small lamp and a single chamber pot but to my weary eyes as the long summer day faded to twilight it looked very inviting tonight i suppose might as well get it over with what if the lanista wont let you in i dont intend to ask him youre going to sneak in but how i do have some experience at this sort of thing zuleika i noticed a particular spot in the palisade where the posts are a bit shorter than elsewhere if i climb over at that point and manage not to impale myself i think i can drop right onto the roof of the slaughterhouse from there i can easily climb down but the dogs you heard dogs barking the man on the road said a dog tore a slaves leg off i cleared my throat yes well the dogs do pose a challenge but i think i know from the sound of their barking where their kennel is located thats why i bought those pieces of meat at the butcher shop this afternoon and why i travel with that small pouch full of various powders and potions in my line of work you never know when you might have need of a powerful soporific a few pieces of steak generously dusted with pulverized harpy root and tossed over the palisade but even if you put the dogs to sleep there are all those gladiators men whove been trained to kill i shall carry a dagger for selfdefense a dagger from the way you describe ahala the lanista himself could kill you with his bare hands she shook her head youll be taking a terrible risk gordianus thats what youre paying me for zuleika i should go with you absolutely not some distance from the compound i tethered my horse to a stunted tree and proceeded on foot hours past midnight the halfmoon was low in the sky it shed just enough light for me to cautiously pick my way while casting ample shadows to offer concealment the compound was quiet and dark gladiators need their sleep as i drew near the palisade one of the dogs began to bark i tossed bits of steak over the wall the barking immediately ceased followed by slavering sounds followed by silence the climb over the palisade was easier than i expected a running start a quick scamper up the rough bark of the poles a leap of faith over the sharp spikes and i landed solidly atop the roof of the slaughterhouse making only a faint plunking noise i paused for breath listening intently from outside the compound i heard a quiet scurrying noisesome nocturnal animal i presumedbut within the compound there was only a deep silence i climbed off the roof and proceeded quickly to the gate that opened into the inner compound where the gladiators were quartered as i suspected it was unbarred at night the men inside were free to come and go at will i returned to the slaughterhouse and stepped inside as i had thought the organs i had seen hanging to dry in the back corner were bladders harvested from slaughtered beasts i took one down and examined it in the moonlight ahala was a frugal man this bladder already had been used at least once and was ready to be used again the opening had been stitched shut but then carefully unstitched a gash in the side had been repaired with some particularly fine stitch work the inside of the bladder had been thoroughly cleaned but by the moonlight i thought i could nonetheless discern bits of dried blood within i left the slaughterhouse and made my way to the armory shed by night a hanging forest of weird shapes navigating through the darkness amid dangling helmets and swords i located one of the peculiar woodandmetal tubes i had noticed earlier i hefted the object in my hand then put it in my mouth i blew through it cautiously quietlyand even so gave myself a fright so uncanny was the gurgling deathrattle that emerged from the tube it frightened the other person in the shed as well for i was not alone a silhouette behind me gave a start whirled about and collided with a hanging helmet the helmet knocked against a shield with a loud clanging noise the silhouette staggered back and collided with more pieces of hanging armor knocking some from their hooks and sending them clattering across the floor the cacophony roused at least one of the drugged canines from the kennel i heard a bloodcurdling howl a moment later a man began to shout an alarm gordianus where are you the stumbling confused silhouette had a voice zuleika i told you not to follow me all these hanging swords like an infernal mazehades ive cut myself perhaps it was her blood that attracted the beast i saw its silhouette enter from the direction of the kennels and careen toward us like a missile shot from a sling the snarling creature took a flying leap and knocked zuleika to the ground she screamed suddenly there were others in the armorynot dogs but men was that a woman one of them muttered the dog snarled zuleika screamed again zuleika i cried did he say zuleika one of the mentall broad majestic in silhouettebroke away from the others and ran toward her seizing a hanging trident he drove it into the snarling dogthen gave a cry of exasperation and cast the trident aside numas balls i grabbed one of the fakes somebody hand me a real weapon i was closest i reached into my tunic pulled out my dagger and thrust it into his hand he swooped down the dog gave a single plaintive yelp then went limp the man scooped up the lifeless dog and thrust it aside zuleika he cried zanziba she answered her voice weak in blood fear and darkness the siblings were reunited the danger was not over but just beginning for having discovered the secret of ahalas gladiator camp how could i be allowed to live their successindeed their survivaldepended on absolute secrecy if zuleika had not followed me i would have climbed over the palisade and ridden back to ravenna satisfied that i knew the truth and reasonably certain that the nubian i had seen earlier that day was indeed zanziba still very much alive for my suspicion had been confirmed ahala and his gladiators had learned to cheat death the bouts they staged at funeral games looked real but in fact were shams not spontaneous but very carefully choreographed when they appeared to bleed the blood was animal blood that spurted from animal bladders concealed under their scanty armor or loincloths or from the hollow bloodfilled tips of weapons with retractable points cleverly devised by ahalas smiths when they appeared to expire the death rattles that issued from their throats actually came from soundmakers like the one i had blown through no doubt there were many other tricks of their trade which i had not discovered with my cursory inspection or even conceived of they were seasoned professionals after all an experienced troupe of acrobats actors and mimes making a very handsome living by pretending to be a troupe of gladiators any doubt was dispelled when i was dragged from the armory into the open and surrounded by a ring of naked rudely awakened men the torches in their hands turned night to day and lit up the face of zuleika who lay bleeding but alive on the sand attended by an unflappable graybearded physician it made sense that ahalas troupe would have a skilled doctor among them to attend to accidents and injuries among the assembled gladiators i was quite sure i saw the tall lumbering samnite who had died in saturnia along with the shorter stockier thracian who had killed himand who had put on such a convincing show of tottering offbalance and almost impaling himself on the samnites uptight sword i also saw the two dimacheri who had put on such a show with their flashing daggers that the spectators had spared them both there was the redheaded gaul who had delivered the death blow to zanzibaand there was zanziba himself hovering fretfully over his sister and the physician attending to her i cant understand it the physician finally announced the dog should have torn her limb from limb but he seems hardly to have broken the skin the beast must have been dazedor drugged he shot a suspicious glance at me at any rate shes lost very little blood the wounds are shallow and ive cleaned them thoroughly unless an infection sets in that should be the end of it your sister is a lucky woman the physician stepped back and zanziba knelt over her zuleika how did you find me the gods led me to you she whispered i cleared my throat with some help from the finder she added it was you i saw at the funeral games in saturnia that day yes and then again in rome he nodded i was there very briefly some days ago then came straight back to ravenna but zanziba why didnt you send for me he sighed when i sent you the money i was in great despair i expected every day to be my last i moved from place to place plying my trade as a gladiator expecting death but handing it out to others instead then i fell in with these fellows and everything changed he smiled and gestured to the men around him a company of free men all experienced gladiators whove realized that it simply isnt necessary to kill or be killed to put on a good show for the spectators ahala is our leader but hes only first among equals we all pull together after i joined these fellows i did send for youi sent a letter to your old master in alexandria but he had no idea where youd gone i had no way to find you i thought wed lost each other forever regaining her strength zuleika rose onto her elbows your fighting is all illusion then her brother grinned the romans have a saying a gladiator dies only once but ive died in the arena many many times and been paid quite handsomely for it i shook my head the game youre playing is incredibly dangerous not as dangerous as being a real gladiator said zanziba youve pulled it off so far i said but the more famous this troupe becomes the more widely you travel and the more people see yousome of them on mote than one occasionthe harder it will become to maintain the deception the risk of discovery will grow greater each time you perform if youre found out youll be charged with sacrilege at the very least romans save their cruelest punishments for that sort of crime youre talking to men whove stared death in the face many times growled ahala we have nothing to lose but you gordianus on the other hand hell have to die said one of the men like the others whove discovered out secret the skulls decorating the gateway i said ahala nodded grimly but we cant kill him protested zanziba he lied about his purpose in coming here said ahala but his purpose was to bring zuleika to me so began the debate over what to do with me which lasted through the night in the end as was their custom they decided by voting i was locked away while the deliberations took place what was said i never knew but at daybreak i was released and after making me pledge never to betray them ahala showed me to the gate zuleika is staying i said he nodded how did the voting go the motion to release you was decided by a bare majority of one that close how did you vote ahala do you really want to know the look on his face told me i didnt i untethered my horse and rode quickly away never looking back on my first day back in rome i saw cicero in the forum i tried to avoid him but he made a beeline for me smiling broadly well met gordianus except for this beastly weather not yet noon and already a scorcher reminds me of the last time i saw you at those funeral games in saturnia do you remember of course i said what fine games those were yes i agreed a bit reluctantly but do you know since then ive seen some even more spectacular funeral games it was down in capua amazing fighters the star of the show was a fellow with some barbaric thracian name what was it now ah yesspartacus they called him like the city of warriors sparta a good name for a gladiator eh i nodded and quickly changed the subject but for some reason the name cicero had spoken stuck in my mind as zuleika had said how strange are the coincidences dropped in our paths by the gods for in a matter of days that name would be on the lips of everyone in rome and all over italy for that was the month that the great slave revolt began led by spartacus and his rebel gladiators it would last for many months spreading conflagration and chaos all over italy it would take me to the bay of neapolis for my first fateful meeting with romes richest man marcus licinius crassus and a household of ninetynine slaves all marked for death but that is another story what became of zanziba and zuleika in the ensuing months of warfare and panic i lost track of them but thought of them often i especially remembered zuleikas comments on roman slavery were her sympathies inflamed by the revolt did she manage to persuade her brother and his comrades if indeed they needed persuading to join the revolt and take up arms against rome if they did then almost certainly things went badly for them for eventually spartacus and his followers were trapped and defeated hunted and slaughtered like animals and crucified by the thousands after the revolt was over and the countryside gradually returned to normal i eventually had occasion to travel to ravenna again i rode out to the site of ahalas compound the gate of bones was still there but worn and weathered and tilted to one side on the verge of collapsing the palisade was intact but the gate stood open no weapons hung in the armory the animals pens were empty spider webs filled the slaughterhouse the gladiator quarters were abandoned and then many months later from across the sea i received a letter on papyrus written by a hired egyptian scribe to gordianus finder and friend by the will of the gods wefind ourselves back in alexandria what a civilizedplace this seems after rome the tale of our adventures in italy would fill a book suffice to say that we escaped by the skin of our teeth many of our comrades including ahala were not so lucky we have saved enough money to buy passage back to our native land in the country of our ancestors we hope to find family and make new friends what appalling tales we shall have to tell of thestrange lands we visited and of those lands surely none was stranger or more barbaric than rome but to you it is home gordianus and we wish you all happiness there farewell fromyour friends zuleika and her brother zanziba for many years i have saved that scrap of papyrus i shall never throw it away poppy and the poisoned cake young cicero tells me that you can be discreet is that true gordianus can you keep a confidence considering that the question was being put to me by the magistrate in charge of maintaining roman morals i weighed my answer carefully if romes finest orator says a thing who am i to contradict him the censor snorted your friend cicero said you were clever too answer a question with a question will you i suppose you picked that up from listening to him defend thieves and murderers in the law courts cicero was my occasional employer but i had never counted him as a friend exactly would it be indiscreet to say as much to the censor i kept my mouth shut and nodded vaguely lucius gellius poplicolapoppy to his friends as i would later find outlooked to be a robust seventy or so in a time wracked by civil war political assassinations and slave rebellions to reach such a rare and venerable age was proof of fortunes favor but fortune must have stopped smiling on poplicolaelse why summon gordianus the finder the room in which we sat in poplicolas house on the palatine hill was sparsely appointed but the few furnishings were of the highest quality the rug was greek with a simple geometric design in blue and yellow the antique chairs and the matching tripod table were of ebony with silver hinges the heavy drapery drawn over the doorway for privacy was of plush green fabric shot through with golden threads the walls were stained a somber red the iron lamp in the middle of the room stood on three griffin feet and breathed steady flames from three gaping griffin mouths by its light while waiting for poplicola i had perused the little yellow tags that dangled from the scrolls which filled the pigeonhole bookcase in the corner the censors library consisted entirely of serious works by philosophers and historians without a lurid poet or frivolous playwright among them everything about the room bespoke a man of impeccable taste and high standardsjust the sort of fellow whom public opinion would deem worthy of wearing the purple toga a man qualified to keep the sacred rolls of citizenship and pass judgment on the moral conduct of senators it was cicero who recommended me then in the ten years since i had met him cicero had sent quite a bit of business my way poplicola nodded i told him i needed an agent to investigate a private matter a man from outside my own household and yet someone i could rely upon to be thorough truthful and absolutely discreet he seemed to think that you would do im honored that cicero would recommend me to a man of your exalted position and discretion he insisted cutting me off that matters most of all everything you discover while in my employeverythingmust be held in the strictest confidence you will reveal your discoveries to me and to no one else from beneath his wrinkled brow he peered at me with an intensity that was unsettling i nodded and said slowly so long as such discretion does not conflict with more sacred obligations to the gods then yes censor i promise you my absolute discretion upon your honor as a roman upon the shades of your ancestors i sighed why must these nobles always take themselves and their problems so seriously why must every transaction require the invocation of dead relatives poplicolas earthshattering dilemma was probably nothing more than an errant wife or a bit of blackmail over a pretty slaveboy i chafed at his demand for an oath and considered refusing but the fact was that my daughter diana had just been born the household coffers were perilously depleted and i needed work i gave him my word upon my honor and my ancestors he produced something from the folds of his purple toga and placed it on the little table between us i saw it was a small silver bowl and in the bowl there appeared to be a delicacy of some sort i caught a whiff of almonds what do you make of that he said it appears to be a sweet cake i ventured i picked up the little bowl and sniffed almonds yes and something else by hercules dont eat any of it he snatched the bowl from me i have reason to believe its been poisoned poplicola shuddered he suddenly looked much older poisoned the slave who brought me the cake this afternoon here in my studyone of my oldest slaves more than a servant a companion reallywell the fellow always had a sweet tooth like his master that way if he shaved off a bit of my delicacies every now and then thinking i wouldnt notice where was the harm in that it was a bit of a game between us i used to tease him id say the only thing that keeps me from growing fat is the fact that you serve my food poor chrestus his face became ashen i see this chrestus brought you the cake and then i dismissed chrestus and set the bowl aside while i finished reading a document i came to the end rolled up the scroll and filed it away i was just about to take a bite of the cake when another slave my doorkeeper ran into the room terribly alarmed he said that chrestus was having a seizure i went to him as quickly as i could he was lying on the floor convulsing the cake he said the cake and then he was dead as quickly as that the look on his face horrible poplicola gazed at the little cake and curled his lip as if an adder were coiled in the silver bowl my favorite he said in a hollow voice cinnamon and almonds sweetened with honey and wine with just a hint of aniseed an old mans pleasure one of the few i have left now i shall never be able to eat it again and neither shall chrestus i thought where did the cake come from theres a little alley just north of the forum with bakery shops on either side i know the street the place on the corner makes these cakes every other day i have a standing ordera little treat i give myself chrestus goes down to fetch one for me and i have it in the early afternoon and was it chrestus who fetched the cake for you today for a long moment he stared silently at the cake no who then he hunched his thin shoulders up and pursed his lips my son lucius he came by this afternoon so the doorkeeper tells me i didnt see him myself lucius told the doorkeeper not to disturb me that he couldnt stay hed only stopped by to drop off a sweet cake for me lucius knows of my habit of indulging in this particular sweet you see and some business in the forum took him by the street of the bakers and as my house was on his way to another errand he brought me a cake the doorkeeper fetched chrestus lucius gave chrestus the sweet cake wrapped up in a bit of parchment and then lucius left a little later chrestus brought the cake to me now i understood why poplicola had demanded an oath upon my ancestors the matter was delicate indeed do you suspect your son of tampering with the cake poplicola shook his head i dont know what to think is there any reason to suspect that he might wish to do you harm of course not the denial was a little too vehement a little too quick what is it you want from me censor to find the truth of the matter they call you finder dont they find out if the cake is poisoned find out who poisoned it find out how it came about that my son i understand censor tell me who in your household knows of what happened today only the doorkeeper no one else no one the rest of the household has been told that chrestus collapsed from a heart attack ive told no one else of luciuss visit or about the cake i nodded to begin i shall need to see the dead man and to question your doorkeeper of course and the cake shall i feed a bit to some stray dog to make sure i dont think that will be necessary censor i picked up the little bowl and sniffed at the cake again most definitely blended with the wholesome scent of baked almonds was the sharper odor of the substance called bitteralmond one of the strongest of all poisons only a few drops would suffice to kill a man in minutes how fiendishly clever to sprinkle it onto a sweet almondflavored confection from which a hungry man with a sweet tooth might take a bite without noticing the bitter taste until too late poplicola took me to see the body chrestus looked to have been fit for his age his hands were soft his master had not overworked him his waxy flesh had a pinkish flush further evidence that the poison had been bitteralmond poplicola summoned the doorkeeper whom i questioned in his masters presence he proved to be a tightlipped fellow as doorkeepers should be and added nothing to what poplicola had already told me visibly shaken poplicola withdrew with instructions to the doorkeeper to see me out i was in the foyer about to leave when a woman crossed the atrium she wore an elegant blue stola and her hair was fashionably arranged with combs and pins atop her head into a towering configuration that defied logic her hair was jet black except for a narrow streak of white above her left temple that spiraled upward like a ribbon into the convoluted vortex she glanced at me as she passed but registered no reaction no doubt the censor received many visitors is that the censors daughter i asked the doorkeeper no i raised an eyebrow but the tightlipped slave did not elaborate his wife then yes my mistress palla a striking woman in the wake of her passing a kind of aura seemed to linger in the empty atrium hers was a haughty beauty that gave little indication of her age i suspected she must be older than she looked but she could hardly have been past forty is palla the mother of the censors son lucius no his stepmother then yes i see i nodded and took my leave i wanted to know more about poplicola and his household so that night i paid a visit to my patrician friend lucius claudius who knows everything worth knowing about anyone who counts in the higher circles of roman society i intended to be discreet honoring my oath to the censor and so after dinner relaxing on our couches and sharing more wine in a roundabout way i got onto the topic of elections and voting and thence to the subject of census rolls i understand the recent census shows something like eight hundred thousand roman citizens i noted indeed lucius claudius popped his pudgy fingers into his mouth one by one savoring the grease from the roasted quail with his other hand he brushed a ringlet of frizzled red hair from his forehead if this keeps up one of these days citizens shall outnumber slaves the censors really should do something about restricting citizenship my friends politics tend to be conservative the claudii are patricians after all i nodded thoughtfully who are the censors nowadays anyway lentulus clodianus he said popping a final finger into his mouth and old lucius gellius poplicola poplicola i murmured innocently now why does that name sound familiar really gordianus where is your head poplicola was consul two years ago surely you recall that bit of unpleasantness with spartacus it was poplicolas job as consul to take the field against the rebel slaves who gave him a sound whippingnot once but twice the disgrace of it farm slaves led by a rogue gladiator thrashing trained legionnaires led by a roman consul people said it was because poppy was just too old to lead an army hes lucky it wasnt the end of his career but here it is two years later and poppys a censor its a big job but safeno military commands just right for a fellow like poppybeen around forever honest as a stick just what do the censors do census and censure their two main duties keep the roll of voters assign the voters to tribes make sure the patrician tribes carry the most weight in the electionsthats the way of it well we can hardly allow those seven hundred and ninety nine thousand common citizens out there to have as much say in electing magistrates as the thousand of us whose families have been running this place since the days of romulus and remus wouldnt make sense thats the census part i nodded and censure the censors dont just say whos a citizen and whos not they also say what a citizen should be the privilege of citizenship implies certain moral standards even in these dissolute days if the censors put a black mark for immoral conduct by a mans name in the rolls its serious business they can expel a fellow from the senate in fact he leaned forward and lowered his voice to emphasize the gravity of what he was about to say in fact word has it that the censors are about to publish a list of over sixty men theyre throwing out of the senate for breach of moral charactertaking bribes falsifying documents embezzling sixty a veritable purge you can imagine the mood in the senate house everyone suspicious of everyone else all of us wondering whos on the list so poplicola is not exactly the most popular man in the forum these days to put it mildly dont misunderstand theres plenty of support for the purge i support it myself wholeheartedly the senate needs a thorough housecleaning but poppys about to make some serious enemies which is ironic because hes always been such a peacemaker lucius laughed back when he was governor of greece in his younger days they say poppy called together all the bickering philosophers in athens and practically pleaded with them to come to some sort of consensus about the nature of the universe if we cannot have harmony in the heavens how can we hope for anything but discord here on earth his mimicry of the censors reedy voice was uncanny census and censure i murmured sipping my wine i dont suppose ordinary citizens have all that much to fear from the censors oh a black mark from the censor is trouble for any man ties up voting rights cancels state contracts revokes licenses to keep a shop in the city that could ruin a man drive him into poverty and if a censor really wants to make trouble for a fellow he can call him before a special senate committee to investigate charges of immorality once that sort of investigation starts it never endsjust the idea is enough to give even an honest man a heart attack oh yes the censorship is a powerful office thats why it has to be filled with men of absolutely irreproachable character completely untainted by scandallike poppy lucius claudius suddenly frowned and wrinkled his fleshy brow of course theres that terrible rumor i heard only this afternoonso outrageous i dismissed it out of hand put it out of my mind so completely that i actually forgot about it until just now rumor probably nothinga vicious bit of slander put about by one of poppys enemies slander oh some nonsense about poppys son lucius trying to poison the old manusing a sweet cake if you can believe it i raised my eyebrows and tried to look surprised but these kinds of stories always get started dont they when a fellow as old as poppy marries a woman young enough to be his daughter and beautiful as well palla is her name she and her stepson lucius get along wellwhat of it people see them out together now and again without poppy at a chariot race or a play laughing and having a good time and the next thing you know these nasty rumors get started lucius trying to poison his father so he can marry his stepmothernow that would be a scandal and im sure there are those whod like to think its true whod love nothing better than to see poppy pulled down into the muck right along with them the attempted poisoning had taken place that afternoonand yet lucius claudius had already heard about it how could the rumor have spread so swiftly who could have started it not poplicolas son surely if he were the poisoner but what if poplicolas son were innocent of any wrongdoing what if he had been somehow duped into passing the deadly cake by his fathers enemies who had then gone spreading the tale prematurely or might the speed of the rumor have a simpler explanation it could be that poplicolas doorkeeper was not nearly as tightlipped as his terse answers had led me to think if the doorkeeper told another slave in the household about the poison cake who then told a slave in a neighbors house who then told his master i tried to keep my face a blank but lucius claudius saw the wheels spinning in my head he narrowed his eyes gordianus what are you up to how did we get onto the subject of poplicola anyway do you know something about this rumor i was trying to think of some way to honor my oath to the censor without lying to my friend when i was saved by the arrival of lucius claudiuss beloved momo the tiny melitaean terrier scampered into the room as white as a snowball and almost as round lately she had grown as plump as her master she scampered and yapped at luciuss feet too earthbound to leap onto the couch lucius summoned a slave who lifted the dog up and placed it on his lap my darling my sweet my adorable little momo he cooed and seemed to forget all about poplicola to my relief bitteralmond is a difficult poison to obtain i am told that it is extracted from the pits of common fruits but the stuff is so lethala man can die simply from having it touch his skin or inhaling its fumesthat most of the shady dealers in such goods refuse to handle it the rare customer looking for bitteralmond is usually steered into purchasing something else for his purpose just as good the dealer will say though few poisons are as quick and certain as bitteralmond my peculiar line of work has acquainted me with all sorts of people from the highest of the high like poplicola to the lowest of the lowlike a certain unsavory dealer in poisons and potions named quintus fugax fugax claimed to be immune to every poison known to man and even boasted that on occasion he tested new ones on himself just to see if they would make him sick to be sure no poison had yet killed him but his fingers were stained permanently black there was a constant twitch at the corner of his mouth his skin was disfigured with strange splotches his head was coveted with scabs and bald spots and one of his eyes was clouded with a rheumy yellow film if anyone in rome was unafraid to deal in bitteralmond it was quintus fugax i found him the next day at his usual haunt a squalid little tavern on the riverfront i told him i wanted to ask some general questions about certain poisons and how they acted for my own edification so long as i kept his wine cup full he agreed to talk with me several cups later when i judged that his tongue was sufficientlyloosened by the wine i asked him if he knew anything about bitteralmond he laughed its the best i always tell people so and not just because im about the only dealer who handles it but hardly anybody wants it bitteralmond carries a curse some say people are afraid itll turn on them and theyll end up the dead one could happen stuff can practically kill you just by you looking at it not much call for bitteralmond then not much he smiled but i did sell a bit of it just yesterday i swirled my wine and pretended to study the dregs really some fishmonger wanting to do in his wife i suppose he grinned showing more gaps than teeth you know i never talk about my customers i frowned still it cant have been anyone very important id have heard if some senator or wealthy merchant died from sudden convulsions after eating a hearty meal fugax barked out a laugh ha try a piece of cake i caught my breath and kept my eyes on the swirling dregs i beg your pardon customer wanted to know if you could use bitteralmond in an almond sweet cake i said just the thing what was he a cook or a cooks slave i suppose your customers usually send a gobetween dont they they never deal with you facetoface this one did really said she couldnt trust any of her slaves to make such a sensitive purchase she he raised his eyebrows and covered his mouth like a little boy caught tattling then threw back his head and cackled gave that much away didnt i but i cant say who she was because i dont know not poor though came and went in a covered litter all blue like her stola made her bearers stop a couple of streets away so they couldnt see where she went and i wouldnt see where she came from but i sneaked after her when she left watched her climb into that fancy litterhair so tall she had to stoop to get in i summoned up a laugh and nodded these crazy new hairstyles his ravaged face suddenly took on a wistful look hers was pretty though all shiny and blackwith a white streak running through it like a stripe on a cat pretty woman but pity the poor man whos crossed her i nodded pity him indeed the enviable corner spot on the street of the bakers was occupied by a family named baebius so declared a handsomely painted sign above the serving counter that fronted the street a short young blonde a bit on the far side of pleasingly plump but with a sunshiny smile stepped up to serve me whatll you have today citizen sweet or savory sweet i think a friend tells me you make the most delicious little almond cakes oh youre thinking of papas special were famous for it been selling it from this shop for three generations but im afraid we dont have any today we only make those every other day however i can sell you a wonderful cheeseandhoney tortevery rich i pretended to hem and haw and finally nodded yes give me one of those no make it threehungry mouths at home but its too bad you dont have the almond cakes my friend raves about them he was by here just yesterday i think a fellow named lucius gellius oh yes we know him but its not him who craves the almond cakes its his father the censor old poplicola buys one from every batch papa bakes but his son lucius was here yesterday she nodded so he was i sold him the sweet cake myself and wrapped it up in parchment for him to take to his father for himself and the lady he bought a couple of little savory custards would you care to try the lady the lady who was waiting for him in the blue litter is she a regular customer too the girl shrugged i didnt actually see her only got a glimpse as lucius was handing her the custard and then they were off toward the forum there taste that and tell me its not fit for the gods i bit into the cheeseandhoney torte and feigned an enthusiastic nod at that moment it could have been ambrosia and i would have taken no pleasure in it i made my report to poplicola that afternoon he was surprised that i could have concluded my investigation so swiftly and insisted on knowing each step in my progress and every person i had talked to he stood turned his back to me and stared at the somber red wall as i explained how i came to suspect the use of bitteralmond how i questioned one of the few men who dealt in that particular poison plied him with wine and obtained a description that was almost certainly of palla how the girl at the bakery shop not only confirmed that lucius had purchased the cake the previous day but saw him leave in a blue litter with a female companion none of this amounts to absolute proof i admit but it seems reasonably evident that palla purchased the bitteralmond in the morning that lucius was either with het at that time and stayed in the litter or else joined her later and then the two of them went to the bakery shop where lucius purchased the cake then one or both of them together sprinkled the poison onto the cake poplicola hunched his gaunt shoulders and produced a stifled cry a sound of such despair that i was stunned into silence when he turned to face me he appeared to have aged ten years in an instant all this is circumstantial evidence he said not legal proof i spoke slowly and carefully legal proof is narrowly defined to satisfy a court of law all the slaves involved would be called upon to testifythe litterbearers your doorkeeper perhaps the personal attendants of palla and lucius slaves see everything and they usually know more than their masters think they would be tortured of course the testimony of slaves is inadmissible unless obtained by torture acquiring that degree of proof is beyond my means censor he shook his head never mind we both know the truth i knew it all along of course lucius and palla behind my backbut i never thought it would come to this what will you do censor it was within poplicolas legal rights as paterfamilias to put his son to death without a trial or any other formality he could strangle lucius with his own hands or have a slave do it for him and no one would question his right to do so especially under the circumstances he could do the same thing to his wife poplicola made no answer he had turned to face the wall again and stood so stiff and motionless that i feared for him censor what will i do he snapped dont be impertinent finder i hired you to find out a thing you did so and thats the end of your concern youll leave here with some gold in your purse never fear censor i meant no you vowed an oath on your ancestors to speak of this affair to no one but me i shall hold you to it if youre any sort of roman theres no need to remind me censor i said sharply i dont make oaths lightly he reached into a pouch within his purple toga counted out some coins laid them on the little table before me and left the room without saying another word i was left to show myself out on my way to the foyer addled by anger i took a wrong turn and didnt realize it until i found myself in a large garden surrounded by a peristyle i cursed and turned to retrace my steps then glimpsed the couple who stood beneath the colonnade at the far corner of the garden their heads together as if engaged in some grave conversation the woman was palla her arms were crossed and her head was held high the man from his manner toward her i would have taken to be her husband had i not known better lucius gellius looked very much like a younger replica of his father even to the chilly stare he gave me as i hastily withdrew in the days that followed i kept my ears perked for any news of developments at the house of poplicola but there was only silence was the old man plotting some horrible revenge on his son and wife were they still plotting against him or had the three of them somehow come together with confessions of guilt and forgiveness all around i hardly saw how such a reconciliation could be possible after such a total breach of trust then one morning i received a note from my friend lucius claudius dear friend dinner companion and fellow connoisseur of gossip we never quite finished our discussion about poplicola the other day did we the latest gossip horrible stuff on the very eve of the great purge in the senate one hears that certain members are planning to mount a prosecution against the censors son lucius gellius accusing him of sleeping with his stepmother and plotting to kill poppy such a trial will stir up a huge scandalwhat willpeople think ofa magistrate in charge of morals who cant stop his own son and wife fromfornicating and scheming to do him in opponents and likely targets of thepurge will say clean upyour own house poplicola before you presume to clean ours who knows how such a trial might turn out the whole family will be dragged through the mudif theres any dirt on any of them the prosecutors will dig it up and if lucius is foundguilty still cant believe it they wont allow him exilehell be put to death along with palla and to save face poplicola will have to play stern paterfamilias and watch while its done that would be the death of poppy i fear certainly it would be the end of his political career hed be utterly humiliated his moral authority a joke he couldnt possibly continue as censor no purge of the senate then and politics can go on as usual what an age we live in ah well come dine with me tonight i shall be having fresh pheasant and cook promises to do something divine with the sauce the pheasant that night was succulent the sauce had an intriguing insinuation of mint that lingered teasingly on the tongue but the food was not what i had come for eventually we got around to the subject of the censor and his woes theres to be a trial then i said actually no said lucius claudius but your note this morning invalidated by fresh gossip this afternoon and lucius leaned back on his couch stroked momo and looked at me shrewdly i dont suppose gordianus that you know more about this affair than youre letting on i looked him in the eye nothing that i could discuss even with you my friend without violating an oath he nodded i thought it must be something like that even so i dont suppose you could let me know simply yes or no whether lucius gellius and palla reallygordianus you look as if the pheasant suddenly turned on you well let no one say that i ever gave a dinner guest indigestion by pressing an improper question i shall simply have to live not knowing though in that case why i should tell you the latest news from the forum im sure i dont know he pouted and fussed over momo i sipped my wine lucius began to fidget eventually his urge to share the latest gossip got the better of him i tried not to smile very well since you must know poppy acting in his capacity as censor has convoked a special senate committee to investigate his own son on a charge of gross immoralitynamely this rumor about adultery and attempted parricide the committee will take up the investigation at once and poppy himself will preside over it but how will this affect the upcoming trial there wont be a trial the investigation supersedes it its rather clever of poppy i suppose and rather brave this way he heads off his enemies who would have made a public trial into a spectacle instead hell see to the question of his sons guilt or innocence himself behind closed doors the senate committee will make the final vote but poppy will oversee the proceedings of course the whole thing could spin out of his control if the investigating committee finds lucius gellius guilty the scandal will still be the ruin of poppy he shook his head surely that wont happen for poppy to take charge of the matter himself that must mean that his son is innocent and poppy knows itdoesnt it lucius raised an eyebrow and peered at me expectantly im not sure what it means i said and meant it the investigation into the moral conduct of lucius gellius lasted two days and took place behind the closed doors of the senate house where none but scribes and witnesses and the senators themselves were allowed fortunately for me lucius claudius was among the senators on the investigating committee and when the investigation was done he invited me once again to dine with him he greeted me at the door himself and even before he spoke i could tell from his round beaming face that he was pleased with the outcome the committee reached a conclusion i said yes and what a relief lucius gellius was cleared of the charges i tried not to sound skeptical completely the whole business was an absurd fabrication nothing to it but vicious rumors and unfounded suspicions i thought of the dead slave chrestus there was no evidence at all of lucius gelliuss guilt no such evidence was presented oh soandso once saw palla and lucius gellius sitting with their legs pressed together at the circus maximus and another soandso saw them holding hands in a marketplace one day and someone else claims to have seen them kiss beneath some trees on the palatine hill nothing but hearsay and rubbish palla and lucius gellius were called upon to defend themselves and they both swore they had done nothing improper poplicola himself vouched for them no slaves were called to testify this was an investigation gordianus not a trial we had no authority to extract testimony under torture and were there no other witnesses no depositions nothing regarding the poisoned cake that was rumored no if there had been anyone capable of producing truly damning evidence theyd have been found surely there were plenty of senators on the committee hostile to poppy and believe me since the rumors first began theyve been scouring the city looking for evidence it simply wasnt there i thought of the poison dealer and of the blond girl who had waited on me at the bakery shop i had tracked them down with little enough trouble poplicolas enemies would have started out with less to go on but surely they had dispatched their own finders to search out the truth why had the girl not been called to testify at least had no one made even the simple connection between the rumor of the poisoned cake and the bakery shop which produced poplicolas favorite treat could the forces against the censor have been so inept lucius laughed and to think of the meals i left untouched fretting over poppy well now that he and his household have been vindicated he can get on with his work as censor tomorrow poppy will post his list of senators whove earned a black mark for immoral conduct good riddance i say more elbow room for the rest of us in the senate chambers he sighed and shook his head really all that grief and the whole thing was a farce yes i thought warily so it had ended upa farce but what role had i played in it the next day i went to the street of the bakers thinking to finally taste for myself one of the famous almond sweet cakes baked by the baebius familyand also to find out if indeed no one from the senate committee had called upon the blond girl i strolled up the narrow winding little street and arrived at the corner with a shock instead of the blond girls smiling face behind the serving counter i saw a boardedup storefront the sign bearing the family name there for three generations had been obliterated with crude daubs of paint a shopkeeper down the street saw me gaping and called to me from behind his counter looking for the baebii yes gone where no idea when he shrugged a while back just up and left overnight the whole lot of them baebius his wife and daughter the slaveshere one day all gone the next poof like actors falling through a trapdoor on a stage but why he gestured that i should step closer and lowered his voice i suspect that baebius must have gotten himself into serious trouble with the authorities what authorities the senate itself why do you say that just a day or two after he vanished some pretty roughlooking strangers came snooping up and down the block asking for baebius and wanting to know where hed gone they even offered money but nobody could tell them and then a few days after that here come more strangers asking questions only these were better dressed and carried fancylooking scrolls claimed they were conducing some sort of official investigation and had senatorial authority not that it mattered people around here still didnt know what had become of baebius its a mystery isnt it yes i figure baebius must have done something pretty bad to get out of town that sudden and not leave a trace behind he shook his head sad though his family had been in that shop a long time and youd think he might have given me his recipe for those almond cakes before he disappeared people come by here day and night asking for those cakes say could i interest you in something sweet these honeyglazed buns are fresh out of the oven just smell that aroma is it better to visit a poison dealer on a full stomach or an empty one empty i decided and so i declined the bakers bun and made my way across the forum and the cattle market to the riverfront and thence to the seedy little tavern frequented by quintus fugax the interior seemed pitchdark after the bright sunshine i had to squint as i stumbled from bench to bench searching among the derelicts only the most hardened drinkers were in such a place at that time of day the place stank of spilled wine and river rot looking for someone asked the tavern keeper a fellow called fugax the scarecrow with the rheumy eye and the bad breath thats him youre out of luck then but not as out of luck as your friend what do you mean they dragged him out of the river a couple of days ago what drowned poor sod must have fallen in not my fault if a man leaves here too drunk to walk straight or maybe he gave me a significant look maybe somebody pushed him in why do you say that fugax had been strutting around here lately claiming he was about to come into a big sum of money crazy fool saying a thing like that in this neighborhood is asking for trouble where was he going to get this money thats what i wondered i asked him what are you planning to sell your garden villa on the tiber he laughed and said he had something to sell all rightinformation important information that powerful people would pay a lot for pay to get it or pay to keep others from getting it not likely i thought what could a river rat like you know that anybody would give a fig to find out he just laughed the fellow was halfcrazy you know but i figure maybe somebody heard him bragging tried to rob him got angry when they didnt find much and threw him in the river the dock workers that found him say it looked like he might have hit his head on somethinghard to tell with all those scabs and rashes did you know him well i sighed well enough not to mourn too much over his death the tavern keeper looked at me oddly you need something to drink citizen i had declined the bakers bun but i accepted the tavern keepers wine the doorkeeper at poplicolas house tersely informed me that his master was not receiving visitors i pushed past him and told him i would wait in the red study i waited for quite a while long enough to peruse a few of the scrolls in poplicolas little library aristotle on ethics plato on the examined life there was a movement at the green curtain drawn over the doorway it was not poplicola who entered but palla she was shorter than i had thought her elaborate turret of hair gave an illusion of height but she was actually more beautiful than i had realized by the reflected light of the red walls her skin took on a smooth creamy luster the bland youthfulness of her face was at odds with the worldliness in her eyes at such close range it was harder than ever to calculate her age you must be gordianus she said yes my husband is physically and emotionally exhausted by the events of the last few days he cant possibly see you i think he should has he not paid you yet i gritted my teeth im not an instrument to be used and then disposed of i helped him discover the truth i brought him certain information now i find that an innocent family has been driven into hiding and another man is dead very likely murdered to keep him quiet if youre talking about that wretch fugax surely the whole city is better off being rid of such a creature what do you know about his death she made no answer i insist that your husband see me i said she looked at me steadily anything you might wish to say to poppy you may say to me we have no secrets from each othernot anymore everything has come into the open between us and your soninlaw father and son are reconciled the three of you have worked it all out yes but thats really none of your business finder as you say you were hired to find out a thing and you did theres an end of it an end of chrestus and of fugax you mean and who knows whats become of the baker and his family she drew a deep breath and gave me a sour look the slave chrestus belonged to my husband his death was an injury to my husbands property chrestus was old and slow he pilfered from his masters food and might not have survived another winter his market value was nil its for poppy and poppy alone to seek recompense for the loss and if he chooses to overlook it then neither you nor anybody else has any business poking further into the matter she crossed her arms and paced slowly across the room as for fugax as i say his death is no loss to anyone a public service i should think when the trial began to loom and then the investigation he tried to blackmail us he was a stupid vile treacherous little man and now hes dead that too is none of your business she reached the far corner and turned around as for the baker and his family they were paid a more than adequate compensation for their trouble the mans family had been in that shop for generations i cant believe he left of his own free will she stiffened her jaw true baebius was not completely cooperative at first a certain amount of pressure was required to make him see reason pressure a black mark from a censor could have made a great deal of trouble for baebius once that was explained to him baebius saw that it would be best if he and his family left rome altogether and set up shop elsewhere im sure his almond cakes will be just as popular in spain as they were here in rome poppy shall miss them alas she spoke without a shred of irony and what about me you gordianus i knew more than anyone yes thats true to be candid i thought we should do something about you so did my stepson but poppy said that you had sworn an oath of secrecy upon your ancestors that you gave him your word roman to roman that sort of thing counts for a great deal with poppy he insisted that we leave you alone and he was right you kept silent he expects you to remain silent im sure you wont let him down she flashed a serene smile without the least hint of remorse it struck me that palla resembled a bit of poisoned cake herself so you see she said its all worked out for the best for everyone concerned legally and politically the affair of poplicola and the poisoned cake was at an end the court of public opinion however would continue to try and retry the case for years to come there were those who insisted that the senate investigation had been rigged by poplicola himself that vital witnesses had been intimidated driven off even killed that the censor was morally bankrupt unfit for his office and that his happy household was a sham others defended poplicola saying that all the talk against him originated with a few morally depraved bitter exsenators there were even those who argued that the episode was proof of poplicolas wisdom and profound sense of judgment upon hearing such shocking charges against his son and wife many a man would have rushed to avenge himself on them taking their punishment into his own hands but poplicola had exercised almost superhuman restraint called for an official inquiry and ultimately saw his loved ones vindicated for his patience and coolheaded perseverance poplicola was held up as a model of roman sagacity and his loyal wife palla was admired as a woman who held her head high even when enduring the cruelest slanders as for his son lucius gelliuss political career advanced more or less unimpeded by the scandal he became more active than ever in the courts and in the senate house and openly expressed his ambition to someday be censor following in his fathers footsteps only rarely did his unproved crimes come back to haunt him as on the occasion when he sparred with cicero in a rancorous debate and threatened to give the great orator a piece of his mindto which cicero replied better that lucius gellius than a piece of your cake the cherries of lucullus once a thing is done its done the accomplished fact takes on an air of inevitability no matter how uncertain it might have seemed beforehand do you not agree gordianus cicero flashed a quizzical smile im not sure what you mean i said we were strolling across the forum on a fine spring morning ahead of us fluffy white clouds were heaped on the horizon beyond the capitoline hill like a vast nimbus crowning the temple of jupiter but in every other direction the sky was an immaculate blue the mild warm air carried strains of birdsong from yew trees that grew along the slope of the palatine hill that rose steeply to our left we continued to stroll at a slow pace but paused when a group of vestals emerged from the round temple of their goddess and crossed our path holding their chins high and wearing haughty expressions one of them deigned to cast a glance at cicero and i saw him give her a faint nod i recognized his sisterinlaw fabia once years ago i had rescued her from the terrible fate that awaits any vestal who dares to break her vow of chastity fabia did not appear to notice me or else deliberately avoided meeting my gaze so it sometimes goes with those who call on gordianus the finder in their time of trouble when the trouble is over and they no longer need me i vanish to their eyes as the smoke from a censer can be dispersed by a puff of air leaving no trace to the senses cicero tired of walking indicated that he wished to sit for a while on the stone bench beside the steps of the temple of castor and pollux he gestured to the space beside him but i told him i preferred to remain standing for a while whats this you were saying about inevitability i asked cicero hummed thoughtfully how did the playwright ennius put it it is done now the workings of the fates i surmise how could the outcome have been otherwise ennius was talking about the murder of remus by romulus as i recall but what in hades are you talking about cicero he shrugged and narrowed his eyes as if searching his mind for an example but i suspected the point he wished to make was already fully formed in his mind and he was simply taking his time to get around to it wanting his words to seem spontaneous rather than rehearsed cicero was a lawyer and this is how lawyers speak they never go straight to the point when they can practice circumlocution there was no sense in pressing him i sighed and decided to sit down after all well gordianus consider a mere ten years agosay during the consulship of my good friend luculluswho could have foreseen with any certainty the future course of the roman republic to the west the rebel general sertorius was luring malcontents in the senate to spain with the aim of setting up a rival republic sertorius and his followers claimed that they represented the true rome and showed every intention of returning someday to claim the city as their own meanwhile to the east the war against king mithridates had taken a turn for the worse it was beginning to look as if rome had bitten off more than she could chew when she invaded mithridatess holdings in asia minor and we were likely to choke on our mistake and then to compound the situation our enemies decided to join forces against us sertorius sent his righthand man marcus varius to lead mithridatess army and so rome found herself embattled against roman generals on both sides the development was all the more unnerving because sertorius had only one eyeas did varius one had lost his right eye in battle the other his left i can never remember which had lost which notwithstanding aristotle and his disdain for coincidence any historian will tell you that fortune loves odd synchronisms and curious parallelsand what a curious turn of events if rome had been bested by two of her own generals a pair of men who between them possessed a pair of eyes such as most men take for granted i must confess gordianus in my darker moods it seemed to me that sertorius and mithridates together would triumph and split the world between them history would have taken a very different course and rome would be a different place today but thats not what happened i said no sertorius with his overbearing personality at last became so insufferable to his own followers that they murdered him sertoriuss oneeyed henchman varius proved to be not such a capable general after all in a sea battle off the island of lemnos lucullus took him captive and destroyed his army king mithridates was bested on every front and stripped of his most prized territories which now pay their tribute to rome whats done is done and the outcome seems to have been inevitable all along romes triumph was assured from the beginning by the grace of the gods and it could never have been otherwise you believe in destiny then rome believes in destiny gordianus for at every stage of her history her destiny has been manifest perhaps i said but doubtfully it was in the nature of my work to poke and prod and peer beneath the surface of things to turn back rugs so to speak and examine the detritus swept underneath and from my experience no man and by extension no nation possessed such a thing as a manifest destiny every man and nation proceeded through life in fits and starts frequently heading off in the wrong direction and then doubling back usually making a host of catastrophic mistakes and desperately trying to cover them over before moving on to make the next mistake if the gods took any part in the process it was generally to have a bit of sport at the expense of hapless mortals not to light the way to some predetermined path of greatness only historians and politicians blessed by keen selfinterest and blurry hindsight could look at the course of events and see the workings of divine intention if cicero entertained another view i was hardly surprised at that moment he was swiftly and surely approaching the apogee of his political career his work as an advocate in the courts had gained him the friendship of romes most powerful families his advancement through the magistracies had been marked by one successful election campaign after another in the coming run for the consulship he was considered a clear frontrunner when i first met him many years before he had been young untested and much more cynical about the ways of the world since then success had tamed him and given him the rosy selfsatisfied aura of those who begin to think their success was inevitable along with the success of the city and the empire they served and yet i observed if things had gone only a little differently sertorius might have become king of the west with his capital in spain and mithridates might still be undisputed king of the east and rome might have been reduced to a mere backwater over which the two of them would be squabbling cicero shuddered at the thought a good thing then that sertorius was killed and mithridates soundly defeated by lucullus i cleared my throat it was one thing for cicero to engage in philosophical speculation about destiny but another to contradict the facts of recent history i believe its been left for pompey to finally end the war with mithridates once and for all pompey is charged with ending the war yes but lucullus fought mithridates for years all over asia minor before he was recalled to rome and forced to cede his command to pompey if pompey appears to be making quick work of mithridates its only because lucullus softened the ground for him cicero snorted ever since lucullus came back to rome hes been owed a triumph for his many victories in the east but his political enemies have successfully conspired to deprive him of it well their obstructionism is about to be ended and within a year lucullus will finally celebrate his triumph perhapsand i should be only too honoredduring the year of my consulship should the gods favor my election so please gordianus dont subject me to this line of argument about pompey being the sole conqueror of the east lucullus broke the enemys back and pompey merely moved in for the kill i shrugged it was a controversy about which i had no firm opinion cicero cleared his throat anyway how would you like to join him for a leisurely meal this afternoon join whom why lucullus of course ah i nodded so that was the true purpose of ciceros desire to see me that morning and the point of his digressions the subject all along had been lucullus has lucullus invited me he has and let me assure you gordianus no man in his right mind would refuse an invitation to sup with lucullus his conquests in the east made him very very wealthy and ive never known anyone who more greatly enjoys spending his wealth his dinners are legendaryeven those he consumes by himself i nodded lucullus was a wellknown epicurean devoted to enjoying the good life and indulging every sensory pleasure even during military campaigns he had been noted for the extravagance of his table the multitudes in rome were eagerly looking forward to his triumph which along with a fabulous procession would also feature public entertainments banquets and a distribution of gifts to all who attended if lucullus desires my company why does he not contact me directly and to what do i owe the honor of this invitation in other words what sort of trouble had lucullus gotten himself into and what would he expect me to do about it i could leave the question of payment to another time lucullus was not miserly and could afford to be generous cicero looked at me askance gordianus gordianus always so suspicious first of all lucius licinius lucullus is not the sort of fellow to dispatch a slave to deliver an invitation to a fellow citizen he hasnt yet met not his style at all he obtains new friends through those who are already his friends hes very strict about that sort of thing decorum matters greatly to him which is not to say hes stuffy quite the opposite do you follow me i raised a dubious eyebrow cicero snorted very well then it was i who mentioned your name to him and suggested he might wish to make your acquaintance and not for any nefarious purpose the context was entirely innocent what do you know about luculluss circle of friends nothing really yet if i were to mention their names youd no doubt recognize them famous men well regarded in their fields the best of the best men like antiochus of ascalon the greek philosopher arcesislaus the sculptor and of course aulus archias the poet those three are luculluss constant companions ive heard of them of course is it luculluss habit to collect friends whose names all begin with the same letter cicero smiled youre not the first to notice that the three as lucullus sometimes calls them a mere coincidence signifying nothingas im sure aristotle would agree notwithstanding his own initial anyway as you can imagine the conversation at luculluss table can be rather elevated with discussions of philosophy and art and poetry and so on even i sometimes find it a bit challenging to carry my weightif you can imagine that he laughed aloud at this selfdeprecation to be polite i managed a chuckle of late he continued lucullus has been most interested in discourse on the subjects of truth and perception how we know what we know and how we distinguish truth from falsehood epistemology i think the philosophers call it exactly you see gordianus you are not entirely without refinement i dont recall claiming that i was cicero laughed but i did not join him anyway lucullus was saying that hes grown weary of hearing the same points of view expounded over and over he already knows what antiochus and arcesislaus and archias will say given their points of viewthe philosopher the artist the poet and he knows what i will saythe politician apparently some particular problem is bothering him though he wont come out and say what it is and our tired ideas are of no use to him so when i dined with him a few days ago i told him i knew a fellow who might very well have something new to offer gordianus the finder me are you not as obsessed with truth as any philosopher do you not see the true shape of things as keenly as any sculptor and cut through falsehood as cleverly as any playwright and are you not as sharp a judge of character as any politician more importantly would you not enjoy an unforgettably lavish meal as much as any other man all your host shall ask in return is your company and your conversation put that way i could see no reason to refuse still it seemed to me there must be more to the matter than cicero was willing to admit to reach the villa of lucullus one passed outside the city walls at the fontinalis gate traveled a short distance up the flaminian way and then ascended the pincian hill a stone wall surrounded the property entry could be obtained only through a guarded iron gate even after one passed through the gate the villa could not be seen for it was surrounded by extensive gardens the gardens had excited much comment for lucullus had collected hundreds of trees flowers vines and shrubberies from all over asia minor and had transported them at great expense back to rome along with a veritable army of gardeners some of the plants had taken root in the soil of italy while others had not and so the garden was still a work in progress with here and there a bare spot or a plant that appeared less than content nonetheless the consummate artistry of luculluss landscapers was evident at every turn to follow the stonepaved path that wound up the hillside toward the villa decorated here and there with a rustic bench or a statue or a splashing fountain was to encounter one delightfully framed vista after another unfamiliar flowers bloomed in profusion the leaves of exotic trees shivered in the warm breeze trellises were overgrown with vines that bore strange fruit occasionally through the lush greenery i caught a glimpse of the temples atop the capitoline hill in the distance or the glimmer of the sinuous faraway tiber and the sight compelled me to pause and take it in cicero accompanied me he had been up this winding path many times before but seemed happy to take his time and indulge my wideeyed wonderment at last we reached the villa a slave greeted us told us that his master awaited us in the apollo room and asked us to follow him i heard cicero release a gasp and then a groan the apollo room he muttered under his breath you know the place i asked my wonderment increasing as we traversed terraces porticoes and galleries everywhere i looked i saw bits and pieces of asia minor that lucullus had brought back to adorn his roman home greek statues ornamental plaques sculptural reliefs carved balustrades dazzling tiles magnificent rugs shimmering draperies colorful paintings in encaustic wax superbly crafted tables and chairs even entire marble columns had been shipped over the sea and up the tiber to confront luculluss engineers architects and decorators with the formidable task of creating from their disparate elements a harmonious whole by some miracle they had succeeded opulence and abundance greeted the eye at every turn gaudiness and ostentation were nowhere to be seen lucullus entertains guests in various rooms depending on his mood cicero explained to each room is accorded a specific budget for the meal the simplest mealsand they could be called simple only by the standards of lucullusare served in the hercules room the plates are of simple silver the food is traditional roman fare and the wines are of a vintage only slightly beyond the means of most of us mere senators lucullus finds the hercules room suitable for a simple afternoon repast when entertaining a few intimate friendsand thats where i presumed we would be eating but the apollo room the couches are sumptuous the silver plate is stunning and the food is fit for the gods the wine will be falernian you may be sure no delicacy which luculluss cook can imagine will be denied to us if only lucullus had warned me i should have avoided eating altogether for the last few days in preparation my poor stomach is already grumbling in dread for as long as i had known him cicero had suffered from irritable bowels he suffered least when he maintained a simple diet but like most successful politicians his life had become a whirlwind of meals and parties and to refuse a hosts offerings would seem churlish my stomach is no longer my own he had complained to me once groaning and clutching his belly after a particularly rich banquet at last we passed through a doorway into a magnificent hall along one wall doors opened onto a terrace overlooking the gardens with a view of the capitoline hill in the distance the opposite wall was covered with a glorious painting celebrating the god apollo and his gifts to mankindsunlight art and musicwith the graces and the muses in his retinue at one end of the room set in a niche was a towering statue of the god scantily clad and resplendent in his beauty carved from marble but painted in such lifelike colors that for the barest instant i was fooled into thinking i saw a being of flesh and blood the room might have accommodated scores of guests but the gathering that day was much smaller a group of dining couches had been pulled into a semicircle near the terrace where the guests could enjoy the warm jasminescented breeze we were apparently the last to arrive for only two of the couches remained empty those situated at either side of our host lucullus reclining at the center of the semicircle looked up at our arrival but did not stand he was dressed in a saffron tunic with elaborate red embroidery and a belt of silver chain his hair gray at the temples but still plentiful for a man of fortysix was combed back to show his prominent forehead despite his reputation for high living his complexion was clear and his waist no larger than that of most men his age cicero he exclaimed how good to see youand just in time for the mullet course i had them delivered from cumae this morning from oratas fish farm cooks trying a new recipe something about grilling them on a stick with an olive stuffing he tells me i shall wish to die after one taste resolved that lifes pleasures can achieve no higher pinnacle no matter what the pleasure theres always another to top it responded one of the guests the mans features were so like those of our host that i realized he had to be luculluss younger brother marcus licinius they were said to be very close indeed lucullus had held off running for his first office until his brother marcus was also old enough to run so that they could both be elected to the curule aedileship as partners the games they had put on for the populace that year the first to ever feature elephants in combat with bears had become legendary to judge by his comment and by his clothes a greek chiton with an elegantly stitched border of golden thread marcus was as much an epicurean as his older brother wanting to die after eating a mullet have you ever heard anything so absurd this comment followed by a laugh to soften its harshness came from the guest seated opposite marcus whom recognized at once cato one of the most powerful senators in rome cato was anything but an epicurean he was a stoic known for expounding oldfashioned virtues of frugality restraint and service to the state his hair was closely cropped and he wore a simple white tunic despite their philosophical differences he and lucullus had become staunch political allies firm friends andwith luculluss marriage the previous year to catos halfsister serviliabrothersinlaw reclining next to cato was servilia herself to judge by the ostentation of her red gown silver jewelry and elaborately coiffed hair she shared her husbands epicurean tastes rather than her brothers stoic values her tinted cheeks and painted lips were not to my taste but she projected a kind of ripe sensuality that many men would have found attractive her generous figure made it hard to be certain but it looked to me that she was just beginning to show signs of carrying a child servilia was luculluss second wife he had divorced the first one of the clodia sisters for flagrant infidelity the three other guests were the greek companions of lucullus whom cicero had previously mentioned to me the poet archias was perhaps ten years older than his patron a small man with a neatly trimmed white beard antiochus the philosopher was the most corpulent person in the room with several chins obscuring his neck the sculptor arcesislaus was the youngest of us a strikingly handsome and exceedingly muscular fellow he looked quite capable of wielding a hammer and chisel and moving heavy blocks of marble i realized that it must be his apollo in the niche at the end of the room for the face of the god was uncannily like a selfportrait it was likely that he had painted the wall as well which gave the same face to apollo clearly arcesislaus was an artist of immense talent i felt an unaccustomed quiver of discomfort after years of dealing with romes elite often seeing them at their weakest or worst i seldom felt selfconscious in any company no matter how exalted but here in the company of luculluss brilliant inner circle in a setting so overwhelmingly opulent yet so impeccably refined i felt decidedly out of my depth cicero introduced me most of the guests had some knowledge of me their notunfriendly nods at the mention of my name reassured me if only a little lucullus indicated that cicero should take the couch to his right and that i should recline to his left the meal was spectaculargrilled eel succulent venison roasted fowl and a wide variety of spring vegetables with delicate sauces all washed down with the finest falernian as more wine flowed the conversation grew more relaxed punctuated by peals of laughter the members of luculluss circle were completely at ease with one another so much so that they seemed to speak a sort of secret language full of veiled references and coded innuendoes i felt very much an outsider with little to contribute mostly i listened and observed servilia showed off a new piece of jewelry a necklace of pearls linked by a finely wrought gold chain and boasted of the bargain she had negotiated the cost was roughly the value of my house on the esquiline hill this prompted a discussion about money and investments which led to a general consensus myself abstaining that land around rome had become more expensive than it was worth but a country house in etruria or umbria complete with slaves to run it could still be obtained at a bargain marcus licinius asked cicero if the rumor he had heard was true that ciceros chief rival in the coming race for consul was likely to be the radical patrician catilina cicero replied by quoting a greek epigram the point was obscure to me but the others were moved to laughter there was more talk of politics cato complained about a fellow senator who had employed an obscure but ancient point of procedure to outmaneuver his opponents declining to name the man cato instead referred to him using a vaguely indecent nicknamepresumably a pun but it meant nothing to me i think he was talking about julius caesar it seemed that archias was in the midst of composing an epic poem about luculluss campaigns in the east hoping to complete it in time for his patrons eventual triumph at the urging of cicero archias quoted a new passage the scene was one the poet had witnessed himself the sinking of the fleet of the oneeyed roman rebel marcus varius off the island of lemnos his words were spellbinding conjuring images full of terror gore and glory at one point he quoted luculluss order to his men regarding the fate of the roman rebel take varius alive not dead put no oneeyed man to the sword disobey and ill pluck the eyes from your head and throw you overboard it seemed to me that a shadow crossed luculluss face as he listened to these words but afterwards he applauded as heartily as the rest of us and promised archias a place of honor at his triumph over pheasant with pinenut sauce the conversation took a philosophical turn antiochus was a proponent of the socalled new academy a school of thought which argues that mankind possesses an innate faculty for distinguishing truth from falsehood and reality from fantasy the existence of such a faculty may be inferred if we consider the opposite case that no such faculty exists said the corpulent philosopher dabbing a bit of sauce from his chin perception comes from sensation not from reason i see the cup before me i reach for it and i pick it up i know the cup exists because my eyes and my hand tell me so ah but how do i know i can trust my eyes and my hand in this instance sometimes after all we see a thing that turns out not to be there after all or at least not what we thought it was or we touch a thing in the dark and think we know what it is then discover it to be otherwise when we see it in the light thus sensation alone is not entirely reliable indeed it can be quite the opposite so how do i know in this instance that this is a cup i hold before me and not some other thing or an illusion of a cup because the rest of us can see it too said marcus laughing reality is a matter of consensus nonsense reality is reality said cato the cup would exist whether antiochus or the rest of us saw it or not i agree with you there cato said the philosopher but the point remains how do i know the cup exists or rather let me change the emphasis of that question how do i know the cup exists not by my eyes and hand alone for those two are not always trustworthy and not because we all agree it exists despite what marcus may say by logic and reason offered cicero and the accumulated lessons of experience true our senses sometimes deceive us but when they do we take note of it and learn to recognize that particular experience and to differentiate it from instances where we can trust our senses based also on past experience antiochus shook his head no cicero quite apart from logic and reason and the lessons of experience there exists in every man an innate faculty for which we as yet have no name and governed by we know not which organ yet that faculty determines for each man what is real and what is not if we could but explore and cultivate that faculty who knows to what greater degree of awareness we could elevate mankind what do you mean by a greater degree of awareness said marcus a realm of perception beyond that which we presently possess marcus scoffed why do you assume such a state exists if no mortal has yet attained it its a presumption with no basis in experience or logic its an idea plucked out of thin air i agree said cato antiochus is espousing mysticism not philosophy or at least not any brand of philosophy suitable for a hardheaded roman its all very well for greeks to spend their time pondering imponderables but we romans have a world to run antiochus smiled to show that he took no offense at catos words he opened his mouth to reply but was cut off by our host who abruptly turned his gaze to me what do you think gordianus said lucullus i felt the eyes of the others converge on me i think i looked to cicero who smiled amused at my hesitation i felt slightly flushed and cleared my throat i think that most men are like myself and dont give much thought to such questions if i see a cup and if i want whats in the cup i pick it up and drink it and thats the end of that now if i were to reach for the cup and pick up a hedgehog instead that would give me pause but as long as a cup is a cupand up is up and down is down and the sun comes up in the morningi dont think most people ever think about epistemology antiochus raised a condescending eyebrow it was one thing for the others to challenge his ideas with other ideas but quite another to dismiss the importance of the topic he had raised in his eyes i had shown myself to be hardly better than a barbarian my host was more indulgent your point is well taken gordianus but i think youre being just a bit disingenuous arent you said lucullus i dont know what you mean well in your line of workinsofar as cicero has explained it to mei should think you rely a great deal on reason or instinct or some faculty such as that which antiochus speaks of in order to determine the truth a murder is committed a relative comes to you asking you to discover the killer if a mans stopped breathing it doesnt take an aristotle to determine that hes dead but how do you go about the rest of itfinding out who did it and how and when and why i suppose some evidence is concrete and indisputable of the sort you can hold in the palm of your handa bloody dagger say or an earring separated from its match but there must be a vast gray area where the indicators are not so certain witnesses to a crime sometimes tell different versions of events they inevitably do asserted cicero with a laugh or a clue may point in the wrong direction continued lucullus or an innocent man may deliberately incriminate himself so as to protect another lies must be sorted from truth important facts must be placed above trivialities the warp and woof of reality must be minutely examined for meaningful patterns and inconsistencies that might elude the scrutiny of a less conscientious finder as i believe cicero calls you indeed gordianus i should think that you must have frequent occasion to apply the tenets of epistemology more rigorously than anyone else in this room i suspect its become second nature to you you swim in a sea of practical philosophy and never think about it as the dolphin never thinks of being wet perhaps i acknowledged dubious of his point but thankful that he had rescued me from looking like a cretin so how do you go about it said lucullus ascertaining the truth i mean do you apply a particular system or do you rely on intuition can you tell if a man is lying simply by looking in his eyes and if so would that not be an indication that some innate faculty such as that suggested by antiochus must indeed exist perhaps more developed in some menmen like yourselfthan in others the guests looked at me intently now seriously interested to see what i would say i took a deep breath in fact lucullus i have given some thought to such questions over the years if we accept that a thing must be either true or falseeither one thing or the other then even the most complex questions can be approached by breaking them into smaller and smaller questions and determining in each case which proposition is true and which is false smaller units of truth combine into greater units until eventually a greater truth emerges sometimes investigating the circumstances of a crime i imagine im building a wall of bricks each brick must be solid or else the whole wall will come down so its simply a matter of testing each brick before its put into place is this brick true or false true and it goes into the wall false and its discarded of course sometimes one makes a mistake and realizes it only after several courses of bricks have been laid and it can be a messy business going back and making the repair ah but how does such a mistake occur in the first place asked antiochus in a tone that showed he had warmed to me somewhat carelessness confusion a lapse of concentration and how do you recognize the mistake i shrugged sooner or later you step back and look at the wall and you can see theres something wrong somethings offkilter one of the bricks doesnt quite match the others ah but there you have yet another indication of the existence of the faculty i speak of said antiochus one knows it when one sees it goes the commonplace but how because of an innate ability to distinguish truth from falsehood an innate sense that doesnt always work apparently said marcus with a laugh that this faculty isnt infallible is hardly evidence against it asserted antiochus on the contrary its yet another sign of its existence no other human faculty is infallible so why should this one be perfection exists only in that ideal world which plato postulated here the talk drifted to other matters philosophical about which lucullus did not question me gratefully i withdrew from the conversation but it seemed to me that my brief foray into the debate had been deliberately engineered by lucullus so that he might observe and form a judgment of me for what purpose i did not know had i satisfied his expectations that too i did not know i spent the rest of the meal observing the others the corpulent antiochus was the most vocal and selfassertive and in such a company that was saying a great deal cato tended to enter the debate only in reaction to the others usually to chide or taunt them his sister servilia spoke only when the conversation involved gossip or money and was silent about politics and philosophy the poet archias every so often contributed an epigram some more appropriate to the conversation than others marcus licinius seemed a contented sort who enjoyed every course of the meal and every turn of the conversation cicero was talkative and highspirited but occasionally i saw him touch his belly and wince as he had feared the meal was too rich for his dyspeptic constitution the one who spoke leasthardly at all in factwas the sculptor arcesislaus like me he seemed content merely to enjoy the food and wine and to observe the others but he wore a vaguely scornful expression even when archias came out with an epigram that made the rest of us hoot with laughter he hardly smiled was he shy and retiring as are many artists or was he haughty as might be the case with a handsome young man of great talent or was he brooding about something i could not make him out the generally buoyant mood dimmed only once when the conversation turned to the father of lucullus and his sad end cicero had been talkingboasting in factof his first important appearance as an advocate before the rostra defending a citizen accused of parricide cicero had retained my services to investigate the matter and that was how we first met the outcome of the trial had made cicero a famous man in rome and set him on the path to his present pinnacle of success he never tired of telling the tale even to those who already knew it and would have gone on telling it had not cato interrupted it was the same with you was it not lucullus said cato your first appearance in the courts made your reputationeven though you lost the case i suppose said lucullus suddenly reticent indeed i remember it well though it seems a lifetime ago said cato your father was sent to put down the great slave revolt in sicily things went well for him at first then badly and he was recalled no sooner did he arrive back in rome than one of his enemies accused him of official misconduct and prosecuted him in the courts he was found guilty and sent into exile poor fellow but his sons didnt forget him as soon as he was old enough to argue before the rostra our lucullus dug up some dirt on his fathers accuser and brought the man to trial everyone in rome took sides there was rioting and bloodshed in the forum when it was all over lucullus lost the case and the fellow got offbut the real winner was our lucullus whose name was on everyones lips friends and foes alike acknowledged him as the very model of a loyal roman son and a fellow not to be tangled with added marcus looking at his brother with admiration i was only vaguely aware of this tale regarding luculluss father and luculluss own younger days and would have liked to have heard more but our host was clearly not in a mood to discuss it he lowered his eyes and raised a hand dismissively an abrupt silence filled the room and stretched awkwardly until archias clearing his throat delivered one of his epigrams right are the thracians when they mourn the infant on the very morning of its birth right also when they rejoice that death has snatched some aged mortal from the earth why not this cup of life is full of sadness death is the healing draught for all its madness he raised his cup the rest of us including lucullus did likewise and the wine we shared dispelled the chill that had fallen on the room the meal lasted at least three hours but had begun so early that the sun was still well above the horizon when lucullus announced that it was time for the final course something sweet i hope said antiochus sweet indeed said lucullus in fact the final course is the principal reason for asking you all here today so that you can share in my bounty he rose from his couch and gestured that we should do likewise up everyone up on your feet and follow me the first of the cherries are ripe and today we shall devour them from the others as they stirred i heard a murmur of pleasant anticipation i stepped beside cicero and spoke in his ear what are these cherries that lucullus speaks of a most exquisite fruit which he brought back from the realm of pontus on the euxine sea they grow on small trees and come in many varieties all with shiny skins in various shades of red all sweet all splendidly delicious i was privileged to taste some of luculluss cherries last year at this time what a delight that he should invite me back again to taste this years crop cicero smiled his brother marcus says that if luculluss wars against mithridates had yielded nothing else they would still have been worth the effort for bringing cherries back to rome lucullus led the way onto the terrace and then down a flagstone path that meandered through a small orchard of low leafy trees the branches were heavy with a fruit the likes of which i had never seen before the cherries as they were called hung in great clusters the type varied from tree to tree some were bloodred some were pink and others were almost black lucullus demonstrated the ease with which they could be picked by reaching out and plucking off a whole handful at once be warned the juice might stain your garments and be careful of the pit to demonstrate he popped a cherry into his mouth then spat the seed into his hand his features assumed a sublime expression he swallowed and smiled all this talk of philosophy and politicshow irrelevant it all seems when one can know the simple unadulterated joy of devouring a cherry and then another and another with much laughter the rest of us joined him in plucking cherries from the branches and popping them into our mouths some of the most sophisticated individuals in rome were reduced to a childlike euphoria by the unbridled joy of eating cherries sensational said archias with cherry juice running down his chin i must compose a poem to celebrate this crop of cherries cicero sighed more wonderful than i remembered even the dour arcesislaus smiled as he shared the joy of eating cherries i felt a hand on my shoulder and turned to see that it belonged to my host come gordianus he said in a low voice theres something i want you to see leaving the others behind lucullus led me to a tree at the farthest corner of the cherry orchard its branches were more gnarled and its leaves more lustrous than those of the other trees and its cherries were the largest and plumpest i had yet seen of a hue that was almost purple of all the cherry trees i brought back from pontus this variety is the most extraordinary the greekspeakers of pontus have preserved the ancient name which the aboriginal barbarians gave to this cherry i find the word impossible to pronounce but they tell me it translates as mostpreciousofallwhich these cherries are their flavor is sweet and very complexat first subtle then almost overwhelming and their skins are very very delicate most other cherries travel well you could pack them in a basket and carry them across italy to share with a friend but these are so tender that they can scarcely survive a fall from the tree to appreciate them you literally must eat them from the treeand even then they may burst if you pluck them too carelessly lucullus reached for one of the dark plump cherries he seemed not to tug at all rather the heavy fruit appeared to tumble into his palm of its own volition here is something evanescent he murmured a sensation too unique to be described capable only of being experienced the cherry that can be eaten only beneath the tree so fragile is it as such it has another practical advantage it cant have been poisoned raised an eyebrow is that a concern lucullus smiled without mirth a man like myself is never without enemies yet i saw no tasters at the meal that is because you were meant to see no tasters he extended his arm and offered the cherry to me for you gordianus the seasons very first mostpreciousofall you do me a great honor lucullus for which you will doubtless ask something in return i thought nevertheless i accepted the cherry and slipped it between my lips the skin was sleek and warm and so thin that it seemed to dissolve at the merest contact with my teeth the meat of the cherry pressed sensuously against my tongue the sweet juice flooded my mouth at first i was disappointed for the flavor seemed less intense than the cherries i had just tasted then as i located the pit with my tongue and worked it toward my lips the full flavor of the cherry suffused my senses with an intensity that was intoxicating lucullus saw my reaction and smiled i swallowed gradually the precedence claimed by my sense of taste receded and my other senses returned to the fore i became aware of a change in the light as the lowering sun shot rays of dark gold through the leafy orchard i heard the distant laughter of the others who had not yet followed us why did you ask me here today lucullus i said quietly what is it you want from me he sighed he picked another of the cherries but did not eat it instead he held it in the cup of his palm gazing at it how fleeting and elusive are the pleasures of life how lasting the pain and bitterness the disappointments and the losses when i became a general i was determined to be the best general possible and never to repeat my fathers failure but i was determined also never to wreak destruction when destruction was not called for so many generations of men have labored so hard to build up the few great storehouses of beauty and knowledge in this world yet by fire and sword their accomplishments can be destroyed in minutes their memory reduced to ashes the power of the roman legions is a great responsibility i swore that sulla would be my model as he had been my mentor in other matters when he had the chance to sack athens and level it to the ground instead sulla saved it and so passed on a great gift to future generations what i least wanted was to ever gain a reputation such as that of mummius of our grandfathers timethe mummius who ruthlessly destroyed the city of corinth and never passed a greek temple without plundering it and yet lucullus pondered the cherry in his hand as if it contained some mystery this tree came from an orchard near a town called amisus in pontus did you ever hear of amisus i shook my head it was not a particularly beautiful or wealthy city but it did have the distinction of having been founded long ago as a colony of athens amisus was an outpost of civilization at the farthest reaches of the world of all the horrors and atrocities that occurred during my war with mithridates the siege of amisus caused me the greatest despair the enemy commander who held the city saw that my forces must ultimately overwhelm him so he engineered an escape by setting part of the city on fire the fire distracted my men held them back for a while and concealed the movement of the enemy troops toward the sea where they boarded ships and sailed away leaving the city defenseless when i realized the situation i was determined to maintain the discipline of my troops i gave orders that the fires should be extinguished and the city occupied in orderly fashion but that was not what happened the men were restless after the long siege they were full of pentup fury frustrated that the city had been taken without bloodshed and eager for plunder my officers were unable to restrain them they surged into the defenseless city raping boys and women killing old men to slake their bloodlust toppling statues smashing furniture breaking anything that was breakable for the sheer joy of destruction they were heedless of the fire they even helped to spread it for night had fallen and they wanted light to continue their rampage so they lit torches and carelessly threw them aside or even deliberately set houses and even people aflame the destruction of amisus was a long bloody night of fire and chaos i stood by and watched unable to stop them he gazed at the cherry a moment longer then dropped it it struck a paving stone and burst open with a spray of bloodred pulp do you see gordianus i meant to be sulla instead i was mummius even with the best intentions each of us is helpless before the fates i said he nodded and something good did come of the siege of amisus i brought back to rome this tree that bears the cherry they call mostpreciousofall i heard a burst of laughter from the others eating their way from tree to tree they had drawn nearer your other guests will join us soon i said if there was something else you wished to say to me he nodded drawn back to the moment yesyes there is a matter i wish to discuss look there gordianus do you see that gardener at work across the way tending to a rose bush i peered past leaves and branches the man was bent over pruning the cane of a rose bush the last rays of daylight glittered on his sharp blade i see him i said though because of the broadbrimmed hat he wore i could see little of the mans face except his grizzled jaw do you remember earlier gordianus when archias quoted from the poem hes composing for my triumphthat bit about the rebel general varius of course put no oneeyed man to the sword exactly when archias spoke those lines a shadow crossed my face you saw it perhaps dont be coy gordianus i felt your eyes on me you notice things that others do not yes lucullus i saw your reaction and i wondered at it the poem is accurate up to a point i wanted marcus varius to be captured alive and he was my men brought him before me in chains you showed mercy to him he flashed a joyless smile not exactly my intention was to keep him alive so that eventually he could be marched through the streets of rome during my triumph you know what happens to a captured enemy in such a procession the people spit at him curse him pelt him with offal and afterwards like the traitor he was marcus varius would be thrown from the tarpeian rock to his death you speak as if none of this will happen no because varius escaped on my voyage home just in sight of sicily somehow he slipped from his shackles fought his way to the deck and jumped overboard we turned about and sailed after him but the sun was in our eyes and we lost sight of him the current was strong the coast was a long way off not impossible perhaps for a strong swimmer to reach but varius would have been weak from confinement and one of my men was sure that he had wounded him it seemed almost certain that varius was swallowed by the sea and drowned have you received information to the contrary not even the slightest rumor i know what youre thinking varius was a man of considerable importance with a bounty on his head and a distinguishing characteristichis lack of one eye if he did survive hes either fled beyond romes reach or buried himself in such obscurity that he might as well be dead it would seem that either wayalive or deadvarius is of no use to you now youll have to do without him as an ornament for your triumph lucullus raised an eyebrow cicero warned me of your penchant for sarcasm but you strike to the heart of the matter i spared the life of varius for the specific purpose of bringing him back to rome alive he eluded me and thwarted my plans i might as well have had the soldiers bring me his head on a pike after all and yet he turned his attention again to the slave who was pruning the rose bushes you there gardener the man stopped what he was doing and looked up when he saw who spoke he quickly lowered his head so that his eyes were hidden by the brim of his hat i never quite saw his face yes master he called come here the gardener shuffled toward us keeping his head bowed there thats close enough said lucullus the man was still several paces distant how long have you been here working in my gardens only since the start of spring master i was purchased in athens by one of your agents and brought here to tend to your roses its what ive done all my life mastertend to roses the man spoke passable latin with a greek accent he continued to avert his gaze as if awed by his master what is your name said lucullus yes yes i know ive asked you before but tell me again motho master the man fiddled nervously with the pruning knife in his hand let me see your face motho lifted his chin he blinked and squinted as the last ray of the sun struck his single eye the other eye was missing the injury had long ago healed over scarred flesh covered the place where the eye should have been how did you lose that eye motho said lucullus his voice was oddly flat the man sighed he had told this story before it happened a long time ago master pricked it on a rose thorn seemed a small wound at first but then it went bad had a fever for days nearly died in the end i got betterexcept for the eye lucullus nodded go back to your work now motho looking relieved to be dismissed the man shuffled back to the rose bush lucullus seized my elbow in a grip far stronger than necessary and pulled me into the deep shadows beneath the cherry tree did you see gordianus see what he has but one eye so i noticed what of it lucullus lowered his voice to a whisper his faceits no longer the same different somehowleaner more lined but a man can change his face if he has a will to and his voice is different i must admitbut anyone can pretend to speak with an accent what are you saying lucullus that slave the gardener who calls himself mothoim almost certain the man is actually marcus varius what surely not cant you tell for certain simply by looking at him eyes are unreliable eyes deceive a man there is that other faculty which antiochus postulates a sense of knowing it hardly seems likely that varius would escape from your clutches only to turn up as a rosetender in your garden lucullus i almost laughed but the look on his face stopped me he was dead serious surely there must be men who knew varius here in rome before he turned traitor and joined sertorius men who could identify him without any doubt round up a few such fellows and ask them to have a look at this motho ive already done that gordianus and the result to a man they deny that this fellow is marcus varius well then theyre lying or else by some trickery varius has deceived them i shook my head i dont understand what makes you think hes varius i dont think it i know it the knowledge came to me in a flash the moment i laid eyes on the man it must be as antiochus says we have a faculty for discerning truth from falsehood which comes from a source not limited to the five senses or to what we call reason that man is marcus varius i simply know it i looked at the gardener across the way he was stooped over still pruning the rose bush despite the failing light i felt a prickle of dread imagining the end to which luculluss wild notion might lead if he was determined to pursue it lucullus is this why you invited me here todayto ask me about this man and any uncertainty regarding his identity i know the circumstances are strange gordianus very strange but i havent yet told you the strangest thing which even i cant account for my sense of dread increased above the pounding of my heart i heard the laughter of the other guests who were now quickly moving to join us i saw them as shadows converging upon us in the twilight what is it lucullus i whispered this fellow who calls himself mothodo you remember which of his eyes is missing think carefully i dont need to think i said i just saw him its his right eye thats missing are you certain of that gordianus i narrowed my eyes i conjured the mans face in memory absolutely certain he has no right eye the expression on luculluss face was ghastly and yet always before varius was missing his left eye now here he is pretending to be this slave motho and as you yourself can testify hes missing his right eye how can that be gordianus how can such a thing be how i should love to have been there gordianus tell me again about those cherries my good friend lucius claudius smiled wanly and gestured to the slave behind him to recommence wafting a long pole surmounted by a fan of peacock feathers so as to stir the sluggish air we reclined on couches beneath the shade of a fig tree in lucius claudiuss garden at his house on the palatine hill the weather was much warmer than the previous day my dear friend always portly was heavier than i had ever seen him his complexion always ruddy had become alarmingly florid his orange curls hung limply over his forehead and his breathing even at rest was slightly labored it was now some fourteen years since i first met him time had begun to take a toll on him it struck me that a rich meal such as the one lucullus had served the previous day was the last thing lucius claudius needed youve not tasted luculluss cherries i said never ive heard about them of course and about how fabulous the house and the gardens are but ive not yet been invited imagine that gordianus the finder has trumped me on the social front im really quite envious but then ive never felt at home in the rarefied intellectual circle of the lucullus brothers all that artyfarty philosophical blather rather puts me off my wine and i seldom stray far from my own house anyway these days the litterbearers complain that ive become too heavy for them to carry up and down the seven hills they do not not out loud perhaps but i hear them wheezing and grumbling and now that the warm weather has begun its too hot to go out i shall settle here under the shade of this fig tree and stay put until autumn what about your etruscan estate you love it in the summer he sighed i should give it to you gordianus would you like a farm to retreat to dont be ridiculous what do i know about farming yet you constantly complain of the indignities of city life perhaps i should leave the farm to you in my will im touched lucius but youll probably outlive me by a good ten years i said this lightly but felt a prick of anxiety that lucius should speak of wills did he feel unwell besides youre changing the subject i was hoping you could tell me a bit more about lucullus lucius claudius was always a fountain of gossip especially about the movers and shakers of the ruling class a mischievous glint lit his eyes ah let me think well for one thing it sounds as if cato rather glossed over the matter of luculluss father and his scandalous end yes i was wondering about that twice at the banquet i had seen a shadow cross luculluss face first when archias recited his lines about the capture of oneeyed varius and then again when cato told the anecdote about luculluss father it seems rather extreme that the elder lucullus should have been exiled simply because his campaign against the slave revolt in sicily stalled oh his offense was much more serious than merely losing a battle or two when the senate recalled the elder lucullus from his command it was his subsequent behavior that was so unforgivable and quite inexplicable as well at least to those who knew him because the elder lucullus had always been a model of probity and even temper you see instead of doing the honorable thing the normal thing when he was recalledleaving his provisions and maps and dossiers of information for the use of his successorthe elder lucullus instead destroyed the whole lot smashed weapons dumped stores of food in the sea even burned maps and records of troop movements it was most strange because hed never been known as a spiteful man his personality was more like that of his sons and youve seen how pleasant and easygoing they both are thats one reason his punishment was so controversial many of his friends and allies here in rome simply refused to believe that the elder lucullus had done such a contemptible thing but the proof was irrefutable and the court unanimously condemned him of malversation and sent him into exile how old were his sons at the time mere boys our lucullus was probably no more than ten years old his fathers trial must have been a terrible ordeal for him im sure it was yet eventually he turned it to his advantage instead of retreating from the world out of shame or bitterness as soon as he was old enough lucullus dug up some dirt on the man whod prosecuted his father and brought the fellow to trial everyone knew it was a prosecution motivated by revenge but many people still felt warmly toward the exiled lucullus and they were proud to see his son so full of spirit the prosecution failedbut luculluss reputation was made so i gathered lucius claudius hummed and nodded lets see what else can i tell you about lucullus he was lost in thought for a moment then the mischievous glint returned to his eyes wellsince you dont care to discuss my willtheres the matter of luculluss i dont suppose that subject came up during the conversation luculluss will no naturally the one thing on everyones mind would be the one thing no one mentioned tell me more apparently for the longest time lucullus had no will hes one of those fellows who thinks hell live forever but just last month he drew up a will and left a copy in the keeping of the vestal virgins when a man as rich as lucullus makes a will thats news of course the copy was sealed and no one is supposed to know the details but but you happen to have a tidbit or two nonetheless i shook my head in wonder how was it that lucius claudius without ever leaving his garden could know so much about the secret life of the city well this is only secondhand you understand and there are no earthshaking surprises its rather what you might expect his beloved younger brother marcus is his principal heir and is also named as the guardian of luculluss son if indeed the child servilia is expecting turns out to be a male if its a daughter the child is left to the care of her mother and her mothers family which means her uncle cato i suppose i nodded my supposition that servilia was pregnant was correct and servilia what sort of provision is made for her ah as you may remember luculluss last marriage ended in an acrimonious divorce they say he picked the wrong clodiaas if there might be a right one lucius claudius laughed at this little jest each of the three clodia sisters had become notorious for carrying on behind her husbands back right now lucullus is still very keen on servilia especially since shes to give him a child but lucullus is wary once burned and all that they say there are all sorts of provisions in the will to keep servilia from getting so much as a sesterce if there should be the least hint of infidelity on her part has there been lucius claudius raised an eyebrow she was known to have a wild streak when she was younger motherhood takes that out of some women perhaps but youve seen the lady with your own two eyes if she did wish to go fishing she possesses all the right bait shes not to my taste but ill take your word for it its curious that servilia seems so different from her brother cato is so prim so proper lucius claudius laughed for one thing theyre only halfsiblings perhaps servilia inherited her wild streak from her father and you know what they say one stoic in the family is more than enough i nodded speaking of cato is he mentioned in the willbeyond his role as guardian to his prospective niece oh yes theres quite a generous provision for him cato has been instrumental in pushing through the proposal for luculluss triumph and for that lucullus is grateful the two have become staunch allies in the senate the new gemini some call them despite their differing philosophies opposites attract look at you and me gordianus could two romans be more different yet this very day ive decided to make you heir to my etruscan farm stop jesting lucius your farm would be useless to meexcept perhaps for the fine wine that comes from your vineyards another cup of which i would gladly accept right now lucius clapped his hands a slave came at once and refilled my cup what about cicero he nodded also named in the will and generously provided for and jupiter knows he could use the money what with bankrolling his campaign for the consulship this year really its a scandal how expensive its become to run for office ciceros already been forced to borrow hes in debt not just to lucullus but to several other of his wealthy friends i nodded and the three as luculluss little coterie of greek companions all named in the will in gratitude for their many years of loyalty and inspiration i thought for a moment let me understand what youve just told me lucius lucullus only recently made a will and everyone who supped with him yesterdayexcept mestands to profit enormously from his demise lucius frowned is lucullus in danger has he been threatened i thought he called you there to investigate one of his gardeners that oneeyed slave who lucullus imagines is actually the fugitive traitor varius yes that was his ostensible reason for consulting me lucullus is utterly convinced of the mans identity is such a thing possible no motho cant be varius for one thing his missing eye is on the wrong side youre sure of that i am only yesterday cicero reminded me that sertorius had lost an eye on one side his compatriot varius an eye on the other as cicero put it between them they possessed a full complement of eyes such as the rest of us take for granted i know that sertorius was missing his right eyei once met the man myselfand so it follows that varius was missing his left as lucullus himself asserts yet the gardener motho is missing his right eye and so cannot possibly be varius the most bizarre thing is that lucullus knows thisyet remains convinced that motho is varius nonetheless do you think that lucullus could be the victim of some elaborate hoax toward what end perhaps someone is deliberately trying to confuse him make him doubt his sanity drive him to suicide it may sound farfetched but have we not seen even subtler and more outrageous plots gordianus especially when an estate as large as that of lucullus is involved i shook my head no this delusion arose from luculluss own mind no one suggested it to him i suppose you looked into mothos background of course away from lucullus and the other guests i questioned the slave at length if hes not a native greek speaker for whom latin is a second language then hes a better actor than the celebrated roscius i also questioned luculluss agent the man who purchased motho in athens for the express purpose of bringing him to rome to tend to luculluss roses motho was born a slave and has been a slave all his life he started as a field hand for some wealthy athenian but with aptitude and hard work he eventually became a highly skilled gardener theres no reason to think hes anyone other than he appears to be poor fellow why do you call him that because unless someone can convince him of his error lucullus almost certainly intends to proceed as if motho is varius the wretched slave will be dressed up like a captured general marched through the streets of rome jeered at and humiliated mercilessly beaten by guards and finally thrown to his death from the tarpeian rock surely not wasnt it the whole point of your visit to verify the mans identity and put luculluss mind at rest quite the opposite lucullus expects me to find proof that motho is varius despite all evidence to the contrary to hades with logic or common sense he wants me to validate what he already knowswhether its true or not oh dear but if lucullus tries to pass this gardener off as varius word will surely get out about the mistake thats been made if not before the triumph then afterwards lucullus will become a laughingstock and motho will suffer a horrible death the situation is mad exclaimed lucius and yet i said lucullus is hardly a madman madmen dont conquer half of asia and build the most impressive gardens in rome and oversee vast financial empiresdo they madmen dont speak of saving cities for the greater good of posterity they dont love philosophy and art and culture its all very strange unless what are you thinking lucius he looked at me shrewdly exactly what youre thinking old friend after all these years can we not read one anothers thoughts sometimes sane men become madbecause of some horrible event or because the gods chose to make them so or simply as a side effect i nodded yes exactly what i was thinking a side effect as we have observed over the years there are many poisons given in doses that stop short of killing the victim outright that can cause a derangement of the mind if someone named in luculluss will has grown impatient and has been making an effort to hurry him along but all of luculluss food is tasted in advance he himself told you of his need for caution in that regard and yet i said if a manor womanwere clever enough and determined enough that person might find a way to administer a poison even to a man as cautious and wellguarded as lucullus clever and determinedthat would certainly describe any member of luculluss inner circle lucius gazed at me darkly then grimaced and shook his head no no gordianus surely were mistaken these arent cutthroats and vipers were talking about men like cicero and cato do not resort to murder for personal advancement marcus most certainly loves his older brother and so far as we know servilia loves her husband as for the three as each one is a genius in his own right its absurd that we should sit here and ponder which of them might be a coldblooded poisoner especially when we cant even say how a poison might be administered to lucullus his vehemence sobered me perhaps youre right lucius i dont wish to be reckless yet i cant stand by and see an innocent man subjected to such a horrible fate lucius shrugged we dont know for a fact that lucullus is actually in danger do we i didnt mean lucullus i meant the slave motho ah he nodded dubiously all in all i loved lucius claudius dearly but he was a creature of his patrician upbringing trained from birth never to feel empathy for a slave and he simply could not equate the fate of a man like motho with that of a man like lucullus he looked at me shrewdly perhaps theres a poison involved but without anyone intending there to be what do you mean i said well im wonderinghow much do we actually know about these socalled cherries are they truly safe to eat surely they must be must they we both know of plants which can affect a man strangely some of them when ingested or burned and inhaled can cause lightheadedness or flights of fancy or even hallucinations did you not discover that for yourself once gordianus when my friend cornelia retained your services because she was haunted by lemures even after so many years i shivered remembering that episode but all of us ate the cherries not just lucullus and while the fruit may be new to rome its been known for generations in its native region if eating cherries could cause hallucinations or delusions i think lucullus would know yes i suppose youre right lucius smiled wanly and i could see that he was growing tired this is good gordianusto sit and ponder with you like this it reminds me of the affair which first brought us together that too involved a will and what appeared to be a resurrection from the dead and here we are again come full circle and alpha meets omega i frowned alpha is the beginning and omega is the end what are you implying lucius claudius he sighed we are all getting older gordianus i know i am he looked at me plaintively nonsense youll live to be a hundred i invested the words with as much enthusiasm as i could muster but even to my ears they rang false a hoax a poison or something else as i mused on the problem of lucullus and his strange belief my suspicions increasingly centered on the three as it was the poet archias who had first mentioned varius at the supper causing a shadow to cross luculluss face did archias refer to varius merely by chance or did he know of his patrons belief regarding the gardener and wished deliberately to disconcert him was it possible that archias had suggested the idea to lucullus in the first place poets could induce an idea in a listener by using words that carried meanings beyond the obvious it was antiochus the philosopher who had convinced lucullus of the existence of some organ of perception which could discern truth from falsehood without resorting to accepted methods of logic and deduction such a belief reinforced luculluss tenacious insistence that motho was varius despite the evidence of his own eyes and his own memory did the philosopher have some other more direct connection to luculluss delusion and what of the artist arcesislaus while the rest of the company had engaged in spirited conversation he had kept quiet and watched wearing an enigmatic expression his smug silence and lack of sociability aroused my suspicion lucullus had given me permission to wander his estate and to talk to any of his guests or slaves the next day i took a stroll through his gardens delighting in the scent of roses i came upon motho who was on his hands and knees mulching one of the bushes he lifted his head at the sound of my footsteps because his empty scarred eye socket was toward me he had to turn his face to an awkward angle to get a glimpse of me the posture was grotesque he looked like a hunchback or some other malformed unfortunate i felt a stab of pity and yet at the same time i seemed to detect something almost sinister about the man had lucullus experienced the same reactiona natural shiver of distaste for anothers misfortuneand allowed it to become an obsession crowding out all reason or had lucullus genuinely detected some menace in the presence of motho we seldom sense danger by means of reason the realization comes to us more swiftly than that and with indisputable conviction what if lucullus was right what if motho was by whatever dark magic could make such a thing possible the same man as marcus varius to embrace such an idea was to relinquish the bonds of reason that way lay madness surely i gazed down into the one good eye of motho and came to my senses he was nothing more than he appeared a clever hardworking man who had suffered the misfortune of being born into slavery and then the further misfortune of losing an eye and who now faced the ultimate misfortune of dying a horrible death to satisfy another mans deluded whim it was to motho that i owed the truth even more than i owed it to lucullus in exchange for the fee he had agreed to pay me silently i vowed that i would not fail him i turned away and strode toward the house on another of the garden paths glimpsed through leafy foliage i saw luculluss brother marcus strolling beside archias they passed a little statue of the rampant god priapus out of scale isnt he said marcus too small to fit that space godhead is known from deeds not size or shape the poet uttered in his usual declamatory singsong did he always speak in epigrams i drew near to the house through an open window i was able to see into the main room of luculluss library which was almost as talked about in rome as the gardens or the apollo room lucullus had assembled the largest collection of scrolls this side of alexandria scholars and bibliophiles came from distant lands for the privilege of reading his books through the window i saw row upon row of upright bookcases their pigeon holes stuffed with scrolls pacing back and forth before the window was cicero who moved his lips slightly as he pored over a tattered scroll occasionally he lowered the scroll gazed into the middle distance and uttered disconnected phrasessons of romulus i beseech you and i come not to challenge a rival but to save rome from a scoundrel and so on i gathered he was studying some treatise on oratory and cribbing rhetorical flourishes to use in his campaign against catilina at the far end of the room cato and antiochus stood in a doorway talking in whispers cato uttered an exclamation and tapped a rolled scroll against antiochuss chest for emphasis antiochus threw back his head and laughed cicero stopped his pacing and shushed them loudly i followed the pathway that circled the house a short flight of steps brought me to the terrace outside the apollo room the doors were open i stepped inside the sunlight on the terrace had dazzled me so that the room appeared dark for a long moment i thought i was alone until i realized otherwise do you mind youre blocking my light it was arcesislaus the artist who spoke looking at me over his shoulder with a petulant expression he stood before the long wall that boasted the painting of apollo and his gifts to mankind i smelled the singular odor of encaustic wax and saw that arcesislaus was working with a thin blade and a palette of pigments applying a new layer of colored wax over the existing one and youre blocking my view said a feminine voice i turned about and saw servilia who reclined on a couch near the door to the terrace apparently i had wandered into her line of sight and was blocking her view of the artists handiworkor was it her view of the artist himself i stepped to one side youre reworking part of the painting arcesislaus made a face that indicated that he did not care to explain himself but finally sighed and gave me a curt nod yes lucullus wants cherries hes decided that cherries must have been created by apollogreatest of all the gods gifts he saysand so cherries must appear in this painting where is lucullus by the way i said servilia answered my husband is out in the orchard now eating more cherries hes mad for them cherrymad she laughed rather unpleasantly i thought arcesislaus stared at the painting arms crossed brooding here in this corner he told me a cherry tree if you please never mind that it completely unbalances the composition ill have to add some new element to that other corner as well more work for me but isnt that what you artists live forto work he snorted thats a misconception commonly held by those who possess no talent like any sane man i prefer leisureand pleasureto working did he steal a look at servilia or simply look beyond me i sculpt and i paint because lucullus pays me to do so and very handsomely money matters a great deal to you he gave me a withering glance im no different from any other man except for my ability to do this he scraped the blade against a daub of red wax on the palette touched the blade to the painting and as if by magic a cherry appeared so glossy and plump that it made my mouth water remarkable i said he smiled begrudgingly pleased by the compliment theres a trick to itpainting cherries i could paint cherries all day long he laughed as if at some private joke servilia laughed as well a chill ran up my spine i looked from the face of arcesislaus to the face of apollohis selfportrait there could be no doubt for man and god shared the same sardonic smile i thought of how merciless selfish and cruel the god could be in spite of his beauty i looked at the palette of pigmented wax not all paints were so thick other techniques called for paints that were quite thin hardly more than colored water with a thin liquid and a tiny horsehair brush one could paint cherriesor paint cherries i backed out of the apollo room onto the terrace then turned and ran to the cherry orchard lucullus was where i expected to find him seated on a folding chair beneath the tree that bore the cherries called mostpreciousofall as i approached i saw him reach up pluck a cherry gaze at it admiringly and then lower it toward his open mouth no i shouted dont eat it he turned his head but continued to lower the cherry toward his lipsuntil i knocked it from his hand gordianus what in hades do you think youre doing saving your life quite possibly or perhaps just your sanity what are you talking about this is outrageous what was it you said to me about these cherries so fragile they can be eaten only beneath the treewhich gives them a more practical advantage that they cant have been poisoned yes theyre the only things i ever eat without having a taster test them first and yet they could be poisoned here on the tree but how no one could soak them or cut them open or he shook his head i didnt call on your services for the purpose of finding a poisoner gordianus i require of you one single task and that regards they could be painted i said what if someone diluted a poison and with a brush applied the solution to the cherries while they yet hang on the branch you might consume only a little at a time but eventually considering how many of these cherries youve eaten but gordianus i have suffered no ill effects my digestion is fine my lungs are clear my eyes are bright but your mind is deranged i wanted to saybut how could one say such a thing to a man like lucullus i would have to find another way i would have to go roundabout perhaps approach marcus and win him over make him see that his older brother needed looking after yes i thought that was the answer considering how famously close was the bond between the two brothers a very public family tragedy had struck them early in life sometimes such an event drives a wedge between siblings but quite the opposite had occurred with the brothers lucullus their fathers selfdestructive behavior had very nearly ruined them but together they had regained the citys respect and made a name for themselves that exceeded anything their ancestors had achieved one might even say that lucullus owed his success to the failure of his fatherthat he owed everything to his father then i saw in a flash that cherries had nothing to do with luculluss dilemma the will yesbut not the cherries a slave hearing his masters voice raised appeared and stood at a respectful distance a quizzical look on his face go find your masters brother ask him to come here i said the slave looked to lucullus who peered at me for a long moment then nodded do as this man requests bring marcus only no one else while we waited neither of us spoke lucullus moved his eyes here and there never meeting my gaze marcus appeared whats this the slave told me he heard raised voices an argument and then gordianus asked for me he seems to think that my beloved cherries have been poisoned somehow muttered lucullus yes but that was a false notion i said and realizing that it was false i gave it up if only you could do the same lucullus this is about motho isnt it said marcus regarding his brother with a pained look call him by his true namevarius cried lucullus why did you recently decide to write a will i said the two brothers both looked at me sharply taken aback at the change of subject what a peculiar question to ask said lucullus for many years you had no will you were far from rome fighting battles accumulating a vast fortune and repeatedly putting your life at risk yet you saw no cause to write a will then because i thought id live forever men cling to the illusion of immortality for as long as they can said lucullus i think archias once wrote a poem on the subject shall i summon him to deliver an epigram the closer i cut to the bone the more he laughs denying all danger i said quoting ennius hows that for a suitable epigram what are you talking about snapped marcus but the tremor in his voice gave him away he was beginning to see the train of my thoughts you encouraged him to write a will didnt you marcus stared at me for a long moment then lowered his eyes yes the time had come because of a change in luculluss health because of some other threat to his life not exactly marcus sighed dear brother he knows theres no use hiding the truth from him he knows nothing there is nothing to know said lucullus i have employed gordianus for a single purpose to prove to the world and to you marcus that i am not mistaken in what i know about varius or motho or whatever we should call him i know what i know and the world must be made to know it too did your father say things like that after he was recalled from sicily and made to stand trial i said as gently as i could marcus drew a deep breath similar things yes he had strange notions he fixated upon impossible ideas that no one could talk him out of his emotions became inappropriate his logic inexplicable his behavior unpredictable it began in a small way but grew until toward the end there was almost nothing left of the man we had known there was only the slightest hint of the change before he left to take up the command in sicilyso slight no one really noticed it at the time but only in retrospect by the time he returned to rome and stood trial the change was obvious to those closest to himour mother our uncles my brother and i were mere children of course we had no way of understanding it was a very difficult time for everyone we spoke of it only within the family it became a source of shame to us greater than the shame of my fathers conviction and exile a family secret i said had such a thing happened before in earlier generations dont answer marcus said lucullus he has no right to ask such a question unheeding marcus nodded something similar befell our fathers father an early dotage a softening of the wits we think it must be a kind of a malady that passes from father to son a coiled serpent in the mind that waits to strike until a man is at the peak of his powers all supposition snapped lucullus just as likely it was the harassment of his enemies that drove our father to distraction not some affliction from within as you see gordianus my brother has always preferred to deny the truth of this matter said marcus he denied it concerning our father he denies it now when it begins to concern himself and yet i said he acceded to writing a will when you urged him tonow rather than later when his faculties may have eroded to a greater degree that indicates to me that at some level lucullus knows the truth of whats happening to him even if he continues outwardly to deny it is that not so lucullus he gazed at me angrily than his features gradually softened his eyes glistened a tear ran down one cheek i have led an honorable life i have served rome to the very best of my ability i have been generous to my friends forgiving to my enemies i love life dearly at last i am about to have a child why must this shameful fate befall me if the child is a son will it befall him as well my body is still strong i may live many years yet whats to become of me in the time i have left if i lose my senses have the gods no mercy i looked upon lucullus and shivered i saw a man surrounded by opulence beyond measure at the summit of his career adored by the multitude beloved by his friendsyet utterly alone lucullus possessed everything and nothing because he had no future the gods have much to answer for i said quietly but while you still can you must struggle against your delusions especially those which pose a danger to others renounce this idea you have about motho lucullus say it aloud so that marcus can hear his face became a tragedy mask the struggle within him was so great that he trembled marcus weeping more openly than his brother gripped his arm to steady him motho is not varius there ive said it though every fiber of my being tells me its a lie ill say it again motho is not varius say that you wont harm him i whispered lucullus shut his eyes tightly and clenched his fists i shall not harm him i turned and left the brothers alone to find what comfort they could beneath the branches of the cherry tree called mostpreciousofall so i came to taste my first cherry so i made the acquaintance of lucullus to whom i never spoke again the months that followed marked the pinnacle of a life which to any outsider must have appeared especially blessed by the gods lucullus celebrated a magnificent triumph at which the rebel general varius did not appear also a son was born to him healthy and whole lucullus named the boy marcus and was said to dote upon him shamelessly his marriage to servilia was less happy he eventually accused her of adultery and divorced her whether the charge was true or the result of a delusion i never knew those months brought other changes some very sad our conversation about lucullus was one of my last encounters with my dear friend lucius claudius who fell dead one autumn afternoon in the forum clutching his chest to my astonishment lucius did make me heir to his etruscan farmhe had not been jesting that day in his garden at about the same time cicero defeated catilina and won his campaign for the consulship making him a new man among the nobilitythe first of his family to attain romes highest office of my move to the etruscan countryside and of the great and tragic events of ciceros consulship i have written elsewhere an era of enormous tumult was beginning steadfast republicans like cicero and cato desperately looked to lucullus with his immense wealth and prestige to rise up as a bulwark against the looming ambitions of warlords like caesar and pompey lucullus failed to meet their expectations instead he withdrew more and more from public life into an existence of sensual pleasure and seclusion people said lucullus had lost his ambition conventional wisdom presumed he had been corrupted by greek philosophy and asian luxury few knew that his mind had begun rapidly to fail for lucullus and marcus did everything possible to hide that fact for as long as they could by the time of his death several years after i met him lucullus was as helpless as a baby completely under the care of his brother a curious rumor attended his demise one of his beloved cherry trees had died and lucullus denied the delicacy he most desired had lost the will to live lucullus had faded from the scene but the people of rome recalled his glory days and reacted strongly to his death great funeral games were held with gladiatorial contests and reenactments on a massive scale of some of his more famous victories during the period of public mourning his gardens were opened to the public i braved the crowds for the chance to see them again if anything the exotic flowers were more beautiful and the foliage more luxuriant than i remembered escaping from the crowd to walk down a secluded pathway i came upon a gardener on all fours tending to a rose bush the slave heard my approach and glanced up at me with his single eye i smiled recognizing motho i thought he might recognize me in return but he said nothing and with hardly a pause he went back to what he was doing i walked on surrounded by the smell of roses the

with sempronia one of the more remarkable women of her age and to explore the role of the chariot race at this period of the roman republic no one who saw the movie benhur as a child could ever forget the spectacular chariot race staged long before the advent of computergenerated images with live riders and horses and an audience of thousands benhur left indelible images in my mind for further research i turned to sport in greece and rome by h a harris thames and hudsoncornell university press a very british take on roman racing and gambling that includes an amusing list of translated latin names for actual horses the daily acts referred to in the story actually existed as we know from references to the acta diuma in cicero and petronius my use of the daily acts owes a debt to a very funny but painfully dated hardboiled mystery titled theulius caesar murder case by wallace irwin published in in which the intrepid reporter manny short for manlius snoops out trouble along the tiber as for sempronia readers may learn more about her in sallusts conspiracy of catiline which gives an intriguing description of her pedigree character and motives not only did she play a small role in that conspiracy but she was the mother of decimus brutus who with the more famous junius brutus was one of the assassins of caesar in an early draft of my novel catilinas riddle i wrote a lengthy passage describing her which i later decided to cut i was glad to be able to return to sempronia in the consuls wife that she was a daughter of gaius gracchus is unlikely writes erich gruen in the last generation of the roman republic university of california press but it is intriguing to speculate that sempronia might nonetheless have been a descendant of that radical firebrand of the late republic who was murdered by the ruling class and achieved the status of a populist martyr if a cyclops could vanish in the blink of an eye reflects on the domestic life of gordianus cats were still something of a novelty in rome at this time and not universally welcomed the cultural clash of east and west as exemplified by the different worldviews of gordianus and the egyptianborn bethesda will increasingly become a part of the fabric of cosmopolitan roman life as the emerging world capital attracts new people and new ideas from the faraway lands drawn into her orbit of all the historical incidents between roman blood and arms of nemesis the most notable is the revolt of sertorius the white fawn tells his story the fabulous tale of the white fawn is given in several sources including plutarchs biography of the rebel general the discontent of those who flocked to sertotiuss side presages the growing discord in rome where a series of escalating disruptions will eventually climax in the civil wars that put an end to the republic forever in on a book tour to portugal my publisher arranged a private tour of the excavations of a garum manufactory located directly beneath a bank building in downtown lisbon ancient olisipo that experience inspired me to take gordianus to such a manufactory and to uncover something fishy in pompeii readers craving a taste of garum can make their own consult a taste of ancient rome by llaria gozzini giacosa university of chicago press which gives the recipe of gargilius martialis who wrote in the third century ad how hiero tyrant of syracuse put a puzzle to the inventor archimedes who solved it in a bathtub with the cry eureka is a famous tale from the ancient world when i came across ciceros claim in his tusculan disputations to have rediscovered the neglected tomb of archimedes i decided there must be a mystery yarn to be made from such material and so archimedess tomb came to be written the sixteenth idyll of theocritus extolling the good government of hieros reign makes an interesting contrast to ciceros own verrine orations which exposed rampant corruption and mismanagement in the romanrun sicily of his own time reading theocritus during my research for archimedess tomb i came across the poets twentythird idyll which became the inspiration for death by eros the details of the spurned lover the coldhearted boy the suicide the pool and the statue of eros are all from theocritus in his version death is a result of divine not human vengeance i turned the poets moral fable into a murder mystery death by eros was originally written for yesterdays blood an ellis peters memorial anthology headline in which various authors paid homage to the late creator of brother cadfael in that book i noted that the storys theme would be familiar to ellis peters who frequently cast lovers secret and otherwise among her characters in her tales for the most part love is vindicated and lovers triumph would that it could have been so for the various lovers in this story having never written at any length about gladiators i decided to do so with a gladiator dies only once the financial and critical success of the movie gladiator was something of a puzzle to me inspiring me to post my own review of the film at my web site but the timeless fascination of the gladiator cannot be denied not all romans craved the sight of bloodshed in the arena cicero found the combats distasteful nonetheless the distinctly roman tradition that linked blood sports with funeral games eventually grew into a cultural mania centuries later these gruesome enterprises continue to puzzle us prick at our conscience and tickle our prurient interest poppy and the poisoned cake was written at the height of the clinton impeachment scandal hence its cynical flavor the details of the crime can be found in valerius maximus and are further explicated in gruens the last generation of the roman republic particularly on page ciceros quip regarding the piece of cake is recounted by plutarch that i have tied it to this particular case is an exercise of artistic license smallworld tidbit the palla in this story is the same palla whose property was said to have been stolen by marcus caelius that accusation was one of the counts against caelius along with the murder of an egyptian envoy in the trial at the center of my novel the venus throw the ruling class of gordianuss rome was a very tightknit community indeed the cherries of lucullus was inspired in a roundabout way by a reader in germany stefan cramme who maintains a web site about fiction set in ancient rome wwwhistromde when my editor told me a new paperback edition of roman blood would be forthcoming giving me a chance to correct any small errors in the book i contacted cramme whose knowledge of ancient rome is encyclopedic and asked him to do his worst cramme informed me of an anachronism which until then seemed to have slipped past every other reader in roman blood in a moment of erotic reverie gordianus commented that bethesdas lips were like cherries alas as cramme pointed out most historians agree that cherries did not appear in rome until they were brought back from the black sea region by the returning general lucullus around bcfourteen years after the action of roman blood since it appeared unlikely that gordianus could have used cherries as a simile i amended that reference in current paperback editions of roman blood bethesdas lips are likened not to cherries but to pomegranatesan echo perhaps not entirely fortunate of a line uttered by the wicked nefretiri anne baxter to taunt moses charlton heston in the campy film classic the ten commandments no historical novelist likes to be found in error and the problem of cherries at rome continued to nag at me i did further research into the diffusion of cherries around the mediterranean and discovered that the sources are not entirely unanimous in asserting that cherries were unknown in rome prior to luculluss return from the black sea region and so there is a slight chance that gordianuss musing was not anachronistic after all but a more significant result of my research was a growing fascination with lucullus and his amazing career plutarchs biography makes splendid reading never having touched upon him in the course of the novels i decided to do so with a short storyand at the same time to confront headon that business about cherries and exorcise it from my psyche once and for all thus the cherries of lucullus was conceived the incident of the gardener motho is fictional but the members of luculluss circle including the philosopher antiochus arcesislaus the sculptor and the poet aulus archias were actual persons and all the pertinent details of luculluss remarkable rise and sad decline are based on fact
